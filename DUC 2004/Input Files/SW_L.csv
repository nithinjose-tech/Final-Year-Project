MUNICH, Germany (AP) US. prosecutor have asked 20-day extension provide Germany paperwork necessary extradite top lieutenant Saudi terrorist suspect Osama bin Laden, official said Saturday. Mamdouh Mahmud Salim, 40, Sudan, ha been jailed his arrest Munich Sept. 16 Bavarian authority acting US. warrant. Under German law, US. official have 40 day arrest turn supporting evidence so German court can rule their extradition request. A Bavarian Justice Ministry spokesman, Gerhard Zierl, said US. authority few day ago asked court hearing case extra 20 day provide necessary material. Quoting unidentified Bavarian law enforcement source, Focus newsmagazine reported Saturday that evidence turned so far wa not very strong. The magazine said much it wa based testimony FBI informant, former bin Laden associate, who made only vague connection Salim and terrorist activity. Zierl declined comment report, said US. authority probably asked more time just precautionary measure. US. authority charge Salim helped finance, train and arm member terrorist organization, including alleged bomber US. embassy Kenya and Tanzania. A criminal complaint unsealed Sept. 25 US. District Court New York charge him murder conspiracy and use weapon mass destruction. Sometime summer 1997, operative Osama bin Laden sat his personal computer hideaway Kenya. He wa worried, he wrote angry dispatch, security East Africa network bin Laden, Saudi exile accused masterminding worldwide terrorist conspiracy Americans. The organization, author complained, had declared war United States, he had learned that only news medium. The writer, who federal authority believe wa Haroun Fazil, who wa become one central suspect bombing US. Embassy Nairobi year later, noted alarm British press report arrest aide bin Laden. Striking almost bureaucratic tone, he said he wa worried that important man close link bin Laden, seemed have fallen enemy's hand. He said Americans were breathing neck his associate Nairobi and that he had take precaution. The cell is 100 percent danger, operative warned. The letter, extraordinary bit digital evidence cloak-and-dagger case, wa retrieved computer house where Fazil had been staying, according paper filed US. District Court New York City. The paper said computer wa seized August 1997 raid Kenyan authority that wa attended FBI agent. The document not make clear whether FBI had translated and read document or bombing US. Embassies Nairobi and Dar e Salaam, Tanzania, Aug. 7 this year. The timing is potentially important because there have been mounting question bombing whether United States adequately followed warning possible terrorist attack American target Kenya. Officials FBI and US. attorney's office New York City refused say Tuesday night what point FBI agent learned computer file, nor would they make any other comment. Fazil eluded American investigator bombing he traveled Kenya his home Comoros Islands and then Middle East. He remains fugitive. The dispatch provides remarkable insight working terrorist network twilight 20th century. The author talk how he and his fellow operative follow event CNN and use Internet communicate. He refers himself medium information officer East Africa cell and complains that he is not being kept loop big decision. Along way, almost casual fashion, document seems confirm two central charge federal case bin Laden: That he had planted terrorist cell Nairobi and that his operative carried out another crime laid bin Laden's door federal authority attack American soldier Somalia 1993 and 1994. The writer document warned that follower bin Laden, whom he referred sheik, had become America's primary target. He said his comrade East Africa should know that there is American-Kenyan-Egyptian intelligence activity Nairobi aiming identify name and residence member who are associated sheik America know well that youth who lived Somalia and were member sheik's cell are one who killed Americans Somalia. They know that Kenya wa main gateway those member, there must be center Kenya, he wrote, concluding: We are really danger. The government ha asserted that one Fazil's duty wa prepare and transmit report bin Laden and his top lieutenant. Federal authority said that Khalid al Fawwaz, London-based associate bin Laden, directed Fazil report periodically bin Laden security situation cell. Fawwaz, who served informal press spokesman bin Laden London, wa arrested British authority September embassy bombing. He ha denied any connection terrorist activity. A translation report wa part package document American prosecutor have sent Britain support extradition Fawwaz trial New York. It is not clear material whether report computer wa forwarded bin Laden. The document, which were initially filed secret, include federal complaint that accuses Fawwaz conspiring bin Laden kill Americans overseas. A second count charge him soliciting do so. The report made clear that organization wa being run shoestring. Its author wrote that his mother ha fallen ill, and that he would return his homeland visit. What do you think? Keep mind we only have $500. He repeatedly expressed his fear American intelligence, which he believed wa midst worldwide search bin Laden and his associate. There is war and situation is dangerous, he said. He wrote that American force kidnapped anyone who threatened national security or American citizen. The author noted alarm recent CIA operation which man accused shooting agency employee had been lured border Pakistan and returned United States trial. According federal authority, Fazil went play pivotal role bombing Nairobi embassy. Prosecutors assert that he rented villa where bomb wa assembled and surveyed embassy's security precaution. On Aug. 7, they charge, Fazil drove pickup truck embassy, leading way vehicle carrying bomb that killed more 200 people, including 12 Americans. The author report said that he stood ready fight force atheism and dictator who wreaked havoc earth. He said that group not have inform it Nairobi-based operative all it global plan, they needed enough warning go underground while if authority intensified pressure Nairobi. We, East Africa cell member, do not want know operation plan, he wrote, we are just implementers. If Osama bin Laden ever stand trial New York bombing US. embassy Africa and other act terror, it is already clear who prosecutor will call chief witness: One his senior aide who ha been talking US. investigator two year. The government ha identified aide court paper pseudonym CS-1, saying person pleaded guilty terrorism charge secret proceeding US. district court Manhattan. According government, informant worked closely bin Laden 1989 1996, period when prosecutor assert that bin Laden wa ordering deadly attack US. soldier Somalia and elsewhere. From court paper filed investigation embassy bombing East Africa August, it is clear that informant ha provided crucial information federal investigator. They have cited source paper filed support extradition two associate bin Laden who are arrest Germany and Britain. Bin Laden, Saudi exile, is thought be living Afghanistan. The source is also basis many significant charge indictment bin Laden himself, including assertion that he directed attack US. soldier Somalia and that he attempted obtain nuclear weapon. It is not known whether source is custody somewhere, or hiding government protection. As recently 11 day ago, record show, source swore 5-page affidavit New York notary summarizing his allegation bin Laden. Government official adamantly declined say anything identity CS-1, which stand confidential source. But least one operative bin Laden's group East Africa concluded more year ago that he knew identity crucial turncoat: Sidi Tayyib, businessman who wa married one bin Laden's relative. The operative's concern were inflamed report British newspaper that Tayyib wa cooperating Saudi and US. authority. In August, 1997 article, The Daily Telegraph said Tayyib had been custody Saudi Arabia May and had given intelligence official detail bin Laden's bank account and business. The news Tayyib's possible defection, East African operative wrote report apparently intended group's commander, almost made me explode. An important man close link bin Laden seems have fallen enemy's hand, and we have take all appropriate security precaution that, operative, Haroun Fazil, wrote his summary security concern. Fazil ha been charged embassy attack and remains large. The report wa typed computer seized last year Kenyan authority, according government filing last week US. district court Manhattan. Thus far, US. prosecutor have charged least six member bin Laden's organization terrorist activity or conspiracy. In one recent filing, they said their case will part be based testimony confidential source, suggesting that informant ha agreed testify any trial bin Laden or his associate. The arrangement appears have resulted plea bargain which source is cooperating hope receiving lesser sentence. There is no indication that source ha been sentenced and it seems likely that sentencing would take place investigation and ensuing trial are complete. In affidavit prepared last week, source acknowledged pleading guilty terrorism charge United States and said they stemmed attack US. target, which were not specifically identified. The source described taking oath allegiance follow bin Laden's order, and gave detailed account bin Laden's group, including it history and inner working. The source told private statement bin Laden other al Qaeda member, encouraging them attack US. troop and other citizen stationed Middle East and Africa. I either heard these statement myself, source said, or I read them or learned them other al Qaeda member. The government ha also said other court paper that source helped identify bin Laden's signature 1996 document urging Muslims kill Americans. Tayyib's whereabouts are unknown and he could not be reached comment. The Taliban's chief justice accused United States Wednesday looking excuse launch another missile attack his war-shattered homeland. And that excuse is Osama bin Laden, man Washington call Enemy No. 1 and blame Aug. 7 bombing US. embassy East Africa, Justice Noor Mohammed Saqib said interview The Associated Press. On Aug. 20 United States retaliated firing Tomahawk missile suspected terrorist camp eastern Afghanistan, killing 26 people. According US. intelligence source, camp were being used train member bin Laden's al Qaeda terrorist group. America is looking excuse fire more rocket our dear Afghanistan and that excuse is bin Laden, Saqib said. Washington, which ha posted dlrs 5 million reward bin Laden's arrest, hasn't ruled out further attack Afghanistan. Saqib, who head judicial inquiry established Taliban investigate terrorism charge bin Laden, say United States ha become insecure. America fear it shadow . every part world it is afraid and see every danger connected bin Laden, he said interview Afghan capital Kabul. In Afghanistan, bin Laden is considered honored guest his Taliban host. They cite Afghan tradition, which demand host guarantee his guest protection. So far Saqib say he ha no evidence bin Laden's involvement terrorist activity. The Taliban have refused turn bin Laden United States, they say if there is evidence they will try him Islamic law. In 90 percent Afghanistan ruled Taliban harsh brand Islamic justice ha been imposed, including death penalty. We want good relation United States and all Muslim and non-Muslim country, they have respect our way, he said. Saqib said his inquiry will wind Nov. 20 and if there is no evidence bin Laden case will be closed least Taliban. Bin Laden is not sinful man . America ha been silent . they have given no evidence, he said. It is too shameful America who is now seen all that world have no reason go bin Laden. The man accused orchestrating US. embassy bombing Tanzania and Kenya wa declared free man Friday Afghanistan, where he ha lived year permission hard-line Islamic Taliban militia. The Taliban, who control 90 percent Afghanistan, Friday closed their three-week inquiry allegation that Osama bin Laden is waging war terror United States. It's over, and America ha not presented any evidence, Afghanistan's chief justice, Noor Mohammed Saqib, told The Associated Press interview Supreme Court building Afghan capital, Kabul. Without any evidence, bin Laden is man sin. . He is free man. The Taliban have told bin Laden, however, that political activity is banned and he ha agreed respect that, Taliban information minister said statement Friday. The minister, Amir Khan Muttaqi, also disputed US. assertion that bin Laden is rich man, saying Saudi dissident ha had his foreign asset frozen, claim not immediately corroborated. One clear unstated objective last August's raid Afghanistan wa kill Osama bin Laden and many his lieutenant possible, administration official now acknowledge. According official, White House lawyer conducted secret review month attack and concluded that such operation are legal US. and international law. The official said raid wa timed so that more 70 cruise missile would hit bin Laden's camp moment when Central Intelligence Agency believed he would be meeting there his chief operative. A 1976 executive order bar anyone working US. government plotting or carrying out assassination. But official said White House legal opinion drafted Afghan strike asserts that president ha authority target infrastructure terrorist group that are attacking Americans. A top US. counterterrorism official said this week that infrastructure bin Laden's group is mostly human. As we said time Aug. 20 strike, objective wa disrupt training, organization and infrastructure bin Laden terrorist network Khost camp, said David C. Leavy, spokesman National Security Council White House. Targeting infrastructure, official acknowledged, can also mean destroying leadership terrorist group. Command and control enemy is justifiable target, Leavy said. Senior administration official said they never discussed killing bin Laden their planning session. His death, they said interview attack, would simply have been side benefit. US. intelligence official say they now believe that bin Laden wa camp day attack, he appears have left unscathed missile hit. Officials said there were report that least one his senior lieutenant may have died attack, and that total casualty complex were 50 and 100. Administration spokesman have drawn distinction attempting kill specific person bin Laden and attacking group people who command terrorist organization. Administration official have denied August that raid wa intended kill bin Laden, Saudi exile who ha been charged federal prosecutor leading global war US. interest. He ha been linked Aug. 7 bombing two US. embassy East Africa. But le subtle explanation wa offered Oct. 13 Defense Secretary William Cohen, who said visit Saudi Arabia that United States had been going bin Laden and his colleague. We weren't quite successful, Cohen continued, we sent message. Kenneth Bacon, Pentagon spokesman, said secretary had not retracted his statement. The Los Angeles Times recently reported that administration believed that it had legal right use deadly force terrorist leader. Bin Laden's organization wa significant concern Clinton administration bombing US. embassy East Africa. Last spring, official said, US. intelligence considered daring raid Afghanistan capture Saudi exile. Officials said that roughly same time, White House drafted legal justification military attack terrorist leadership. That review, official said, provided legal basis August fire cruise missile meeting which it wa believed bin Laden and his lieutenant would be gathered. The review, National Security Council, wa basis saying this operation not violate presidential order banning assassination. That ban wa imposed President Ford 1975, congressional investigator uncovered evidence that CIA had plotted assassinate Fidel Castro, Cuban leader, and others. The order said: No person employed by, or acting behalf United States government shall engage in, or conspire engage in, assassination. While it is, it face, sweeping and unqualified ban, it ha been subject interpretation and intense debate year. In 1986, Reagan administration responded terrorist attack US. soldier Germany bombing raid Libya. The target included residence Libyan leader, Moammar Gadhafi. And Gulf War, US. force used powerful bomb attempt kill Saddam Hussein, president Iraq. The legal review conducted White House would appear provide precedent future operation similar circumstance.

6,"He wa classic small-town prodigy, creativity big-city profiteer. When there wa no shot take, he invented new one. When there wa no one pas to, he reconfigured play teammate wa open. Larry Bird, Indiana countryside or Boston Garden, wa luminous exception governing rule. That is why, six year his retirement National Basketball Association, his name is again basketball's most prominent, beginning his induction Hall Fame 7,000 Bird watcher Civic Center here Friday night. Deservedly enshrined forever exceptional, he again becomes Bird, exception, case study contentious and potentially disastrous labor war. No, not really, Bird said, when I asked whether he is troubled likelihood his legendary name soon representing symbol greed unsympathetic million. There's always player's name attached these thing. I know time I wa very happy it. That would have been 1988, when Celtics wanted compensate Bird $4.9 million bonus push his back pain, go their savior. Three year later, contract arbitration involving Knicks' Patrick Ewing, agent David Falk would contend that NBA conspired Celtics circumvent salary cap, order satisfy Bird. Alan Greenspan, I am sure, would agree that this salary cap is convoluted enough give anyone headache, so let's just say it is cap that doe not exist when team is negotiating one it own. The process unsealing cap re-sign particular player eventually became known making use Larry Bird exception. And that is where we stand, this onetime exception ha become very expensive rule owner don't want play anymore. I can understand side, said Bird, safely middle, Bird, former exception, and Bird, present Indiana Pacers' coach. Without getting exception, I think it's very important player stay same place. Important, he meant, franchise stability and fan identification. You have son who is 7 year old, he go 7 17 10 year you've played, Bird said. A lot people Boston told me that they had followed me, time they were very young when they were college. The Bird year numbered only three Celtics championship, he wa best player pro basketball's most famous team ever had. He and Magic Johnson created basketball renaissance that began college title showdown Salt Lake City and spread worldwide, infectious smile. They stood pas, team play, now their decade selflessness ha given way one selfishness. The NBA Michael Jordan reached greater height anyone imagined it could, it is league that now suffers sickness soul. If Larry and Magic hadn't done what they did, we might not survive what we're go through, said Bill Fitch, Bird's first Celtics coach, who, Bill Walton, stood him night that, he said, gave closure his playing career. The owner, always, are exaggerating their misery, this time, it is much easier not root player. The president union is Ewing, who one day command player boycott world championship because NBA's corporate fingerprint are them, then next day help himself some television commentary work David Stern's women's annex. Ewing lead fight protect $100 million contract 21-year-olds who have achieved not single playoff victory, linked big payoff agent his friend Falk. The battle is waged name salary cap that make exception unexceptional, reward everyone if they were Bird. I believe that any field there ha be allowance truly special one, Walton said. But that group is very small. When I wa growing this sport, only player who got recognition were champion, one who always made you feel good game, sport. That's how Larry and Magic played, always dreaming special team. It wasn't hype, money. That is not quite case, nor should it have been. Bird wa businessman's ball player day he arrived, his flannel shirt and blue-collar ethic. He hired late Bob Woolf, one original heavy-hitting agent, and got himself record rookie contract. Then he went out and turned 29-victory catastrophe 61-victory contender. A rare Bird, honest exception rule. Despite modest encouragement new proposal delivered player owner, National Basketball Association Tuesday canceled first two week regular season, first time league's 51-year history that it will lose game labor dispute. The NBA's deputy commissioner, Russ Granik, announced cancellation nearly three and half hour meeting concluded Manhattan hotel. The decision cancel 99 game Nov. 3 and Nov. 16 came player association proposed implementation tax system instead hard salary cap, proposal owner said they would respond Friday. We tried our best today try do what wa possible salvage season, said Alonzo Mourning, Miami Heat center. Unfortunately, it didn't work out. After 35,001 game blemish, NBA now join National Hockey League, National Football League and Major League Baseball having lost game labor dispute. Taking account that three- four-week period would be needed training camp and free-agent signing season start, league said it would decide two week whether make further cancellation. I'm very sad and disappointed, said NBA commissioner, David Stern. I consider it be collective failure, I honestly don't know what else we could have done. I do thing that I think are best interest game. And I believe this is. The decision came what side agreed were most substantive talk owner imposed lockout player July 1. Seventeen player, including union president Patrick Ewing and vice president Mitch Richmond, Herb Williams, Dikemebe Mutombo and Ty Corbin, attended meeting Stern, Granik and five member ownership committee Madison Square Garden president Dave Checketts and owner Abe Pollin Washington, Gordon Gund Cleveland, Les Alexander Houston and Jerry Colangelo Phoenix. The talk featured what player association implied were bevy concession made owner that they felt would accommodate league's desire swing revenue pendulum back owner. The dispute involves distribution approximately $2 billion league-wide income. The main sticking point ha been owners' insistence salary cap exception, implementation which they believe would bring player salaries' line revenue growth. While player not discus elimination Larry Bird exception clause that allows player secure any amount money he want re-signing his current team they address exception their taxation proposal. The main point were follows: A 50 percent tax would be imposed salary earned $18 million, clause that would affect only few player who exercised their Bird right. For example, if player made $20 million, team would be forced put $1 million fund that would most likely be distributed low-revenue team. There could be provision made some player, said Jeffrey Kessler, chief counsel union. We don't want do anything that would encourage Chicago getting Michael Jordan back. And I think league feel same way. The proposal is similar luxury tax proposed union 1995 negotiation, it would not be nearly liberal. A salary cap credit would go effect if league pay out more 63 percent revenue salary. Whatever figure that number reduces salary cap next year. If figure wa $29 million salary cap, then 29 team would work salary cap $1 million le previous season. But player would have assurance that salary cap would go least $2 million credit go effect. Also, if 63-percent threshold is met, reduction annual 20 percent raise would take effect multi-year contract. Players would either get raise 10 percent or rate growth league revenue. The union said this clearly address league's desire bring salary line revenue. Since owner re-opened current agreement because 57.1 percent revenue wa going salary, 63-percent figure would probably have come substantially owner agree such proposal. Teams would get right first refusal free agent fourth year incoming rookie, meaning player would be contractually obligated same team first four year his deal. Currently, rookie scale is three year and includes clause that enables player exercise his Bird right two season clause Kevin Garnett parlayed astronomical $126 million deal last year Minnesota. Finally, player agreed make marijuana banned substance. Details testing have not been negotiated and no specific discussion took place testing performance-enhancing drug, provision owner included their last proposal. In return concession, player want increase minimum salary currently $272,500 and creation average salary exception. This would allow every team salary cap being able sign one free agent year average salary currently $2.6 million. We're buoyed fact first time they've decided submit counterproposal, union's executive director, Billy Hunter, said. I don't know if I'm more optimistic, I can earnestly say we can look our ballplayer eye and say we made valiant effort. Asked if player would finally be tested financially cancellation game, Hunter added: It's not u blinking. We want reach agreement. We're tired rhetoric, we're tired game-playing. Our position all ha been we don't want accept bad deal. Granik said refund fan would be made end calendar month and that first refund would include monies canceled preseason game. He estimated loss hundred million dollar. I think we have serious concern whether tax system can address kind need we have economically, he added. But there's some possibility. Added Stern, We owe it fan go back and look notion whether tax rate might begin achieve result we wanted. It doesn't look promising, we're going spend next two day see if we can give favorable response. Though decision cancel game wa not surprising, it represent major shift prior labor stalemate. Both side reluctantly hammered out deal 1995 start training camp sole notion not missing game and preserving NBA's perfect record. Tuesday, they could not come such accord. I'd think these our last game we have cancel, Granik said. But unless this or something else work, or there's some dramatic breakthrough, I think that is certainly not all season that's jeopardy. In decision that will almost certainly lead first work stoppage National Basketball Association history, league Monday announced cancellation all 114 preseason game. Citing stalled negotiation Players Association new collective bargaining agreement, league official said they would decide next week whether cancel first week regular season game. While decision had been expected 10 day, it nonetheless sent strong signal that owner and player will probably be willing cancel least part regular season order settle their labor dispute. Both side agree that it would take least three week hold abbreviated training camp and sign 200 free agent new contract. Privately, official side do not believe season will start scheduled Nov. 3 or December. Unlike Major League Baseball, National Football League and National Hockey League, NBA ha never lost regular-season game labor strife. Since we're not negotiating, you have conclude it's very likely that we're going miss some part regular season, deputy commissioner Russ Granik said Monday night. We'll try and defer any decision last minute, right now it doe not look good. The two side will meet Thursday their first official bargaining session Aug. 6. Commissioner David Stern and group owner walked out meeting dismissing merit new proposal player. Neither Granik nor player association executive director Billy Hunter sounded if this week's meeting would go long way signing new agreement precursor playing again. I don't think you have any choice miss game this point, Hunter said. In fact, I think they've intended it all along. They've locked u out, they've refused negotiate and they've given u proposal that's ludicrous. Not only are side still awaiting outcome arbitration decision that is due Oct. 18 - Fordham Law School dean John Feerick will rule whether or not more 200 player $800 million guaranteed contract should be paid lockout owner and player also are making time win public opinion they test their fans' loyalty canceling game. Monday 11 city throughout country, player are holding make-shift press conference training-camp venue, NBA arena and gymnasium. Patrick Ewing, union president, and several teammate will speak SUNY-Purchase Purchase, N.Y., where Knicks train season. With training camp originally scheduled open Oct. 6, message player is clear: if owner would call end lockout, we would be ready play today. About 100 player are expected attend, speak and sign autograph fan afterward. I wish they would put their energy trying negotiate deal rather various other thing that they've been doing, Granik said. The dispute is essentially how owner and player will judiciously divvy $2 billion income. It began last year contention owner that their employee were receiving more their fair share pot. The owner were allowed terminate current agreement because clause that enabled them do so player salary reached 53.8 percent total basketball-related income. The owner say that figure is currently hovering 57.1 percent. Though many economic issue need be resolved, main point contention labor agreement expired and owner declared lockout July 1 ha been clause which allows team pay their free agent they want, regardless salary-cap rule governing NBA's 29 team. Called Larry Bird exception, it wa created allow Hall Fame Boston Celtics forward re-sign Celtics end his career. Michael Jordan exercised clause last two year Chicago Bulls, earning more $30 million season figure more $5 million more what team is allowed spend all it player. But exorbitant salary paid several unproven star last few year and $100 million deal sprouting routinely, owner are determined swing income pendulum back themselves enforcing restricted salary cap hard cap and putting ceiling how much one player could earn. Last year, player received $1 billion dollar salary and benefit and we have made proposal that are guaranteed increase that number 20 percent next four year, Granik said prepared statement. Our proposal would result average player salary more $3.1 million and minimum salary 10-year veteran $750,000. Unfortunately, union leadership ha been unwilling give any serious consideration what we have offered. Hunter labeled those claim optimistic projection, and shot number new proposal presented player Sept. 25. If they had left current deal place, we would have gotten much that anyway, he added. All we're saying is, we're not position accept hard cap. Monday's decision cancel preseason came le two week NBA indefinitely postponed training camp and canceled first week exhibition game. Through ticket sale alone, Granik estimated that losing exhibition season would cost league $35 million and $40 million. Decisions cancellation regular season game are expected be made next week, he added. A league official said game would be canceled block one or two week, depending circumstance negotiation. Thursday's bargaining session ha suddenly become last hope starting season time. Hurdles could be overcome very quickly, I have no reason believe they will Thursday, Granik said. Added Hunter: Of course they don't expect much get done. When Russ and David decide negotiation are going be real and substantive, then something will happen. What they're banking now is that player are going miss paycheck and cave November. It's if they've ingested something that ha pas. And once it pass, then they'll negotiate. The first substantive talk more two month opposing side National Basketball Association's labor dispute came and went Thursday hint settlement. Still, five-hour meeting that wa described cordial league and almost two bull letting little steam player association produced another scheduled talk next Tuesday. Barring major compromise, that will not be enough time preserve full season and prevent league losing it first regular-season game labor strife November. Russ Granik, NBA's deputy commissioner, said league would wait next week's meeting deciding cancel regular-season game. He also discussed possibility significantly shortened season. We haven't made determination that you need this exact number game order have representative season, Granik said. But we recognize that certain point we can't possibly sell our fan that we're having NBA season. Whether's that 60 game, 50 game or 49 or 53, we're not there yet. We have few month we have face that decision. Perhaps only progress involved Thursday conference room midtown Manhattan hotel wa question-and-answer session league's latest proposal player. Patrick Ewing, union president, and vice president Herb Williams and Dikembe Mutombo attended meeting union's executive director, Billy Hunter, and union lawyer. No owner were present, Granik, Commissioner David Stern and league's lawyer spent most day explaining intricacy two-week-old proposal player. At one point two party broke lunch, Stern and Hunter raised their voice and accused each other handling their constituency poorly, participant meeting said. But two were seen shaking hand and laughing meeting concluded shortly 3 pm. There wa some venting side, Hunter said. We've been placid and very respectful. Today, we took coat and we were inclined take glove little bit. Having done that, I think it kind loosened side. Hunter added: Did anybody blink today? They're sort look u any kind nuance they can find course negotiation that might, some way or another, give some indication that while we're mouthing one thing we might be open something else. We're looking their body language, too. I don't think that they're ready make deal. The last formal meeting side Aug. 6 ended when Stern and owner abruptly marched out they had received proposal player. In critical ruling North American National Basketball Association and players' union, arbitrator John Feerick decides Monday whether more 200 player guaranteed contract should be paid lockout. If player win, owner will be liable dlrs 800 million guaranteed salary, although they have vowed appeal if they lose. The league already ha sued player Feerick's jurisdiction. If we win, I think it just emboldens spirit and resolve player, union director Billy Hunter said. But I don't think there will be anybody celebrating because there's no guarantee that it will end lockout. It only mean they have pay some 200 player, and they've indicated u their intent file immediate appeal and take it far they have order avoid payment. So if he doe rule our favor, most it's hollow victory. The player aren't going get paid Nov. 15 any circumstance, Hunter said. If owner win, it will remove last wild card player had been holding. The side have not negotiated last Tuesday, when union proposed superstar tax highest contract. The league made counterproposal Friday, asking that tax be imposed much lower threshold. Hunter dismissed league's latest proposal Friday afternoon, then said side would be best served awaiting Feerick's ruling. It's unlikely any negotiation will be held this week, union is holding meeting all NBA player and agent advisory committee Las Vegas Wednesday Friday. We've got get sense where player are, what they consider be reasonable and what they're willing do order get season commence, Hunter said. The union filed grievance Feerick lockout wa imposed July 1 owners' announcement June 29 that they would not honor guaranteed deal. In six-day hearing summer, union argued that owner should have protected themselves being liable guaranteed salary work stoppage inserting lockout language standard player contract. The Sacramento Kings inserted lockout clause center Olden Polynice's contract 1994, and it wa approved league. The union used existence that clause argue that all other team should have protected themselves similarly. Most player are due receive their first paycheck Nov. 15, although dozen or so had clause entitling them be paid summer. None ha received paycheck. The NBA argued that tenet labor law allows employer withhold pay employee lockout. The league also called former union director Simon Gourdine testify. He said it wa his understanding when he negotiated old labor agreement 1995 that player would not be paid if owner chose reopen agreement and impose lockout. More 220 National Basketball Association player guaranteed contract will find out Monday whether they are be paid management lockout, long-awaited arbitrator's decision that may affect leverage league's dispute player and have major ramification American sports-labor law. But neither player nor owner are counting ruling arbitrator, John Feerick, speed negotiation, especially if Feerick find favor player, award that could approach $800 million salary. NBA attorney have indicated union that if decision go management, they will seek have it vacated appealing US. District Court Manhattan and then, if necessary, 2nd US. Circuit Court Appeals, process that could prevent player getting paid several month. The NBA ha already canceled first two week regular season because labor dispute. The league ha other litigation pending US. District Court Manhattan. If player win ruling, NBA intends renew it motion disqualify Feerick. The motion wa brought last summer ground that no collective bargaining agreement existed and, therefore, he had no jurisdiction hear matter. If he rule our favor, I think it emboldens spirit and resolve player, said Billy Hunter, union executive director. But we understand that won't end lockout. It just mean they have pay 200-some player. And there is still other litigation alive that may take while resolve. At most, it's hollow victory. Feerick will have taken full 30 day render his decision. Whatever he decides, his ruling will be watched carefully. There is no precedent locked-out athlete being paid. During NBA summer lockout 1995, player who missed paycheck not file grievance. Neither National Hockey League player who were locked out first three month 1994-95 season. The union argued that owner should have protected themselves inserting clause non-payment lockout and strike individual player contract. In support it argument, union pointed clause few individual player contract that contained language precluding payment lockout. The league is relying basic tenet labor law, which hold that employee not be paid strike or lockout. A ruling union would be significant all future negotiation player and owner. The deterrent factor lockout is that employee subject collective bargaining agreement do not get paid once agreement expires and they are unable reach new agreement. If Feerick find favor player, there will be no economic incentive those guaranteed contract reach agreement quickly. They would essentially be paid not playing basketball. If Feerick find favor owner, reality not being paid may spur player reach agreement more quickly. But Hunter disputed this notion, and conference call Friday talked openly entire season's being canceled player would back away their ultimate goal. I'm not all concerned, Hunter said. There's been no demonstration that there's going be change our resolve. After player saw these proposal league and recent posturing NBA owner, well, I had two player call me and tell me, if need be, they'd be willing hock everything they've got. Another significant development may be thedeparture many player Europe dispute is settled, according least two player agent. I think it would be case-by-case basis, yes, there's already some people talking that, said Bill Strickland, member union's agent advisory committee. Steve Kauffman, another member committee, said he would explore possibility that one client, Nets center Rony Seikaly, would sign professional team Greece. We wouldn't look void his deal team, Kauffman said. But we would want him have right him work temporarily he could come back and honor his contract.' Russ Granik, NBA deputy commissioner, said league ha approved idea players' earning living elsewhere lockout is settled. Proposals exchanged last week that included concept luxury-tax system player salary appeared reflect first sign progress negotiation lockout began July 1. But side have termed figure each other's proposal unacceptable, and it wa unclear whether either side wa willing compromise. I don't think we should get too carried away possibility just yet, Granik said. When they explored idea tax system, we were taking player their word that they wanted make some headway. But call their first proposal meaningless is charitable. They proposed something that ha no impact. As it stand, that can't be solution. The owners' goal is slow growth player salary relation leaguewide revenue next three year, while player want keep earning much possible. As labor battle go, current one National Basketball Association and it player is weird sport standard. There is real possibility that most, if not all, coming season will be canceled. In this union battle it is interest best paid, not those who make union scale, that are dominating discussion. And here it is some worker, not management, who are trying make union disappear. The current arrangement ha produced unbalanced pay scale immense proportion. Last year more player ever received union minimum, then $242,000 rookie or $272,000 veteran. The number player making $1 million $2 million year middle class, NBA term fell sharply. But Michael Jordan made $33 million. This should not be surprise. Sports is entertainment business, not movie. Big star get million, while most get union scale. Over year, NBA effort stem rise salary have failed. The most important loophole it salary cap let team sign it free agent it is willing pay. When that wa adopted, it wa assumed that no team would pay lot more rival could pay. But it ha not worked out that way. In current negotiation, league ha offered guarantee that it payroll will rise 20 percent next four year, $1 billion $1.2 billion, and say it is open proposal split that money any way player want, whether raising minimum salary or guaranteeing raise veteran. The union say it is worried that middle class, seems determined preserve free market. The league got it broadcaster, NBC and Time Warner's cable channel, agree pay this year's television fee whether or not there are any game broadcast. (They will be paid back later year, either reduced fee or extra game show.) Owners hoped player would think management wa willing wait them out, and come term only small part season canceled. But union is acting unhurried. It turned aside request negotiation this week, saying player had meet first. Then there is issue union suicide, tactic that wa rejected player 1995. The idea is that if player had no union, it would be illegal antitrust law owner collude. The sky would be limit. That tactic might fail. The court could reject union decertification vote sham, and any case some player may fear that team would feel free offer le old union minimum. But if player go that route, it could be long time real negotiation get going. Billy Hunter, union's executive director, warned owner this week that prolonged lockout could destroy league's popularity. That wa what all seer said four year ago, when baseball's World Series wa canceled labor trouble. But fan memory are relatively short, and now baseball seems more popular ever. With that mind, owner and player may choose battle month. In critical ruling North American National Basketball Association and players' union, arbitrator John Feerick decides Monday whether more 200 player guaranteed contract should be paid lockout. If player win, owner will be liable dlrs 800 million guaranteed salary, although they have vowed appeal if they lose. The league already ha sued player Feerick's jurisdiction. If we win, I think it just emboldens spirit and resolve player, union director Billy Hunter said. But I don't think there will be anybody celebrating because there's no guarantee that it will end lockout. It only mean they have pay some 200 player, and they've indicated u their intent file immediate appeal and take it far they have order avoid payment. So if he doe rule our favor, most it's hollow victory. The player aren't going get paid Nov. 15 any circumstance, Hunter said. If owner win, it will remove last wild card player had been holding.

The NBA argued that tenet labor law allows employer withhold pay employee lockout. The league also called former union director Simon Gourdine testify, Feerick upheld union objection and prohibited Gourdine saying whether it wa his understanding when he negotiated old labor agreement 1995 that player would not be paid if owner chose reopen agreement and impose lockout. Patrick Ewing not want sound striking longshoreman demanding health benefit. I'm not going try and put it dollar and cent. But Ewing, president National Basketball Association Players Association, played public-relations game Tuesday expounding theme labor unrest: strong-willed unity and short-sighted proposal. On day when training camp were scheduled begin, player country held news conference 14 NBA city proclaim themselves ready practice regular season. We want show public that we, player, want play, said Ewing, who wa flanked five teammate. Today is supposed be start training camp. We want practice and we want season start. But unfortunately, owner have locked u out and season ha been postponed. The owner and player are scheduled hold their first bargaining session Aug. 6 Thursday Manhattan. Neither side is predicting progress signing new collective bargaining agreement and beginning season scheduled Nov. 3. The league canceled entire 114-game preseason Monday. Next week, it will consider canceling first-ever regular season game league history. With wide philosophical difference how $2 billion annual income should be distributed, side have privately said they don't expect play regular season game December. Billy Hunter, union's executive director, offered glimmer hope. He spoke optimistically potential quick resolution. Standing few foot away Ewing, he said, I hope owner and commissioner have gotten message: that we're serious deal. I'm prepared make quantum leap. I don't think we're that far off. I think there's lot jockeying, lot rhetoric and lot game being played. But if and when owner decide they want deal, then they'll get one. But soon after, he began lambasting owners' latest proposal, which includes eventual phasing out Larry Bird exception clause that enables free agent earn unlimited salary their current team. That clause represents major rift negotiation. Owners would implement restrictive salary cap that would eventually put ceiling how much one player can earn. I don't know if this is going come speedy resolution, Ewing said. They're entrenched what they want, which is hard cap. And we feel hard cap, we player, cannot survive. We would have be stupid and ignorant accept that deal. Said Hunter, If you go their proposal, it's just joke. It's step backwards. I cannot understand it. If intent wa reach agreement this late stage or negotiate earnest, this wa wrong way go it. League official not respond players' comment. All we want is our fair share and we feel they're trying take that away u, Ewing said. `There's perception that we're strike. It's other way around. We've been locked out. Besides Ewing, other Knicks included former union president Buck Williams, former vice president Herb Williams, Allan Houston and John Starks. Marcus Camby also showed briefly. When medium horde closed in, however, third-year forward went look his late-arriving teammate practice facility. He wa stopped gym door, which wa locked. They locked u out, said Rockets forward Mario Elie. Everybody's got get that corrected. It's not u. They're one that closed u down. The stalemate ha elicited talk possibly bringing mediator coming week, Major League Baseball 1994 help solve it labor dispute. But player are convinced commissioner David Stern and owner are set testing their resolve any genuine headway can be made negotiation. That mean missing paycheck November, something Ewing said player are prepared do. Both side are still awaiting outcome arbitration decision that is due Oct. 18. Fordham Law School dean John Feerick will rule whether or not more 200 player $800 million guaranteed contract should be paid lockout. Feerick's decision could give new leverage one side. But if player lose arbitration, more 400 athlete many extravagant lifestyle and tremendous financial obligation will have their allegiance instantly tested. It's they want see how strong we are, Ewing said. Based proposal we've received, we're very strong. So far, it seems though NBA is dug their position, Buck Williams said. I don't think they're too concerned this point making deal. He added, We're far apart Grand Canyon right now. The National Basketball Association, embroiled labor dispute it player, Tuesday canceled first two week 1998-99 season. It is first time league's 51-year history that it will lose regular-season game. The NBA's deputy commissioner, Russ Granik, announced cancellation nearly three and half hour meeting concluded Manhattan hotel. The decision cancel 99 game Nov. 3 and Nov. 16 came player association proposed implementation tax system instead hard salary cap, proposal owner said they would respond Friday. We tried our best today try do what wa possible salvage season, said Alonzo Mourning, Miami Heat center. Unfortunately, it didn't work out. After 35,001 game blemish, NBA now join National Hockey League, National Football League and Major League Baseball having lost game labor dispute. Taking account that three- four-week period would be needed training camp and free-agent signing season start, league said it would decide two week whether make further cancellation. I'm very sad and disappointed, said NBA commissioner, David Stern. I consider it be collective failure, I honestly don't know what else we could have done. I do thing that I think are best interest game. And I believe this is. The decision came what side agreed were most substantive talk owner imposed lockout player July 1. Seventeen player, including union president Patrick Ewing and vice president Mitch Richmond, Herb Williams, Dikemebe Mutombo and Ty Corbin, attended meeting Stern, Granik and five member ownership committee Madison Square Garden president Dave Checketts and owner Abe Pollin Washington, Gordon Gund Cleveland, Les Alexander Houston and Jerry Colangelo Phoenix. The talk featured what player association implied were bevy concession made owner that they felt would accommodate league's desire swing revenue pendulum back owner. The dispute involves distribution approximately $2 billion league-wide income. The main sticking point ha been owners' insistence salary cap exception, implementation which they believe would bring player salaries' line revenue growth. While player not discus elimination Larry Bird exception clause that allows player secure any amount money he want re-signing his current team they address exception their taxation proposal. The main point were follows: A 50 percent tax would be imposed salary earned $18 million, clause that would affect only few player who exercised their Bird right. For example, if player made $20 million, team would be forced put $1 million fund that would most likely be distributed low-revenue team. There could be provision made some player, said Jeffrey Kessler, chief counsel union. We don't want do anything that would encourage Chicago getting Michael Jordan back. And I think league feel same way. The proposal is similar luxury tax proposed union 1995 negotiation, it would not be nearly liberal. A salary cap credit would go effect if league pay out more 63 percent revenue salary. Whatever figure that number reduces salary cap next year. If figure wa $29 million salary cap, then 29 team would work salary cap $1 million le previous season. But player would have assurance that salary cap would go least $2 million credit go effect. Also, if 63-percent threshold is met, reduction annual 20 percent raise would take effect multi-year contract. Players would either get raise 10 percent or rate growth league revenue. The union said this clearly address league's desire bring salary line revenue. Since owner re-opened current agreement because 57.1 percent revenue wa going salary, 63-percent figure would probably have come substantially owner agree such proposal. Teams would get right first refusal free agent fourth year incoming rookie, meaning player would be contractually obligated same team first four year his deal. Currently, rookie scale is three year and includes clause that enables player exercise his Bird right two season clause Kevin Garnett parlayed astronomical $126 million deal last year Minnesota. Finally, player agreed make marijuana banned substance. Details testing have not been negotiated and no specific discussion took place testing performance-enhancing drug, provision owner included their last proposal. In return concession, player want increase minimum salary currently $272,500 and creation average salary exception. This would allow every team salary cap being able sign one free agent year average salary currently $2.6 million. We're buoyed fact first time they've decided submit counterproposal, union's executive director, Billy Hunter, said. I don't know if I'm more optimistic, I can earnestly say we can look our ballplayer eye and say we made valiant effort. Asked if player would finally be tested financially cancellation game, Hunter added: It's not u blinking. We want reach agreement. We're tired rhetoric, we're tired game-playing. Our position all ha been we don't want accept bad deal. Granik said refund fan would be made end calendar month and that first refund would include monies canceled preseason game. He estimated loss hundred million dollar. I think we have serious concern whether tax system can address kind need we have economically, he added. But there's some possibility. Added Stern, We owe it fan go back and look notion whether tax rate might begin achieve result we wanted. It doesn't look promising, we're going spend next two day see if we can give favorable response. Though decision cancel game wa not surprising, it represent major shift prior labor stalemate. Both side reluctantly hammered out deal 1995 start training camp sole notion not missing game and preserving NBA's perfect record. Tuesday, they could not come such accord. I'd think these our last game we have cancel, Granik said. But unless this or something else work, or there's some dramatic breakthrough, I think that is certainly not all season that's jeopardy. ","The National Basketball Association joined the NHL, the NFL and baseball when it canceled first the preseason games then two weeks of regular season.In litigation that is complicated by a dispute over the distribution of nearly $2 billion in league income, the main sticking point is the owner's insistence on a salary cap without exceptions.Top players are avoiding discussion of the Larry Bird exception, which allows a player to secure any amount he wants in resigning with his current team except as it applies to their taxation proposal.Also pending is an arbiter's decision as to whether players will be paid during the lockout.","The Larry Bird exception has been used to pay some NBA players much more than the salary cap allows.Stalled labor dispute over NBA salaries cancels preseason games and threatens regular season games.NBA owners and players plan meeting, which is unsuccessful.Players submit proposal at next meeting.Owners to respond by Fri.First 2 weeks of the season, 99 games, are cancelled.An arbitrator will decide on Mon. whether or not NBA players with guaranteed salary contracts should be paid during the owners' lockout.As the NBA labor battle goes on, most, if not all, season games may be cancelled.Lesser paid players may suffer if union doesn't survive.","In a dispute over a new collective bargaining agreement the National Basketball Association owners declared a lockout on July 1, 1998.They wanted to discard a clause in the old agreement allowing teams to pay their own free agents whatever they wanted, substituting a hard salary cap.The players wanted to keep earning as much as possible.On Oct. 5 all 114 preseason games were cancelled.The players then proposed a 50% tax on salaries above $18 million that the owners rejected.On Oct. 13 the NBA cancelled the first two weeks of the regular season.By Oct. 21 the entire season seemed in jeopardy in the interests of the best paid.","In a dispute between the owners and NBA players over how to divide the $2 billion in league-wide income, all preseason and the first 99 1998-1999 regular season games were cancelled.The Larry Bird exception, a clause in the old agreement that allowed teams to pay their own free agents any amount, regardless of salary-cap rules, is the major issue.The owners want a restricted salary cap.The players have proposed a superstar tax, and the owners have presented a counter proposal, but negotiations have stalled.Meanwhile, both sides are awaiting a ruling by arbitrator Feerick on whether $800 million in guaranteed salaries will be paid during the lockout."
7,"Congolese rebel have taken their two-month campaign oust President Laurent Kabila Internet.

The 56-year-old history professor University Dar e Salaam Tanzania said supporter Congolese Rally Democracy United States have created web site rebellion. The site www.prairienet.org/panafrican/cdm ha been set donor-supported Prairenet Community Network eastern Illinois. The rebel are coalition ethnic Tutsis, disenchanted member Kabila's army and political opponent who accuse Kabila power-grabbing, mismanagement, corruption and sowing dissent Congo's 400 tribe. After initial lightning advance far west Africa's third-largest nation, rebel were stopped outskirt capital, Kinshasa, troop Angola, Zimbabwe and Namibia, who are backing Kabila. Since then, rebel have been confined chunk territory extreme eastern part country where their rebellion wa declared Aug. 2. Wamba said rebel control 40 percent Congo, area 15 million people.

A group high-powered US. investor Southeast Asia Monday applauded effort perk Thailand's staggering economy, saying they had been assured top Thai official that key economic reform package will soon be approved. After meeting Thai Cabinet member, including Prime Minister Chuan Leekpai, member U.S.-ASEAN Business Council said they were confident future Thailand's economy and promised their company would continue invest here and elsewhere region. We would be quick observer applaud aggressiveness reform package that we see being proposed front your government today, said business council chairman George David, who is also chairman and CEO United Technologies Corp. Thailand wa hit hard last year's Asian economic crisis, and proposed economic reform legislation focus resolving massive bad debt private company, which is hindering recovery.

The council's lobbying effort US. and Southeast Asian government have concentrated removing tariff and other barrier overseas trade. The delegation will travel Kuala Lumpur Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum Nov. 14-18. David said free trade should be focus discussion government leader attending. What I hope they will say APEC is very strong affirmation free-trade agenda and very strong affirmation foreign direct investment agenda, he added. In little more week, world's leader will converge this businesslike city heart Southeast Asia annual meeting Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation forum. They could hardly be meeting more provocative place. On Sept. 1, Malaysia discontinued trading it currency, ringgit, and imposed sweeping control flow capital it stock and currency market, particularly investment overseas. In doing so, Malaysian prime minister, Mahathir Mohamad, effect slammed door global economy that President Clinton and other leader are coming here champion. Mahathir's decision drew jeer international investor and policy- maker, who warned that Malaysia wa seeking quick fix that would retard it desperately needed reform and leave it odd man out when Asia finally recovered regional malaise. Now, though, Mahathir's ally are marshaling new economic data that they say indicate that capital control are breathing new life country's moribund economy. Malaysia's foreign reserve rose strongly September, and there is anecdotal evidence that consumer are starting spend again. It's nice be able say that we adopted capital control, economy ha improved, said Zainal Aznam Yusof, deputy director Institute Strategic and International Studies, research organization here that helped draft policy. But we want see whether this is strongly sustainable. Critics said it wa predictable that capital control would be short-term tonic Malaysia's economy. Because country is sheltered vagary capital flow and currency fluctuation, they said, government had been able ease interest rate and encourage consumer spending. Still, mere fact that Malaysia's experiment ha yielded some positive result guarantee that issue will come APEC meeting. With Mahathir leading campaign, cause capital control will have fiery advocate who ha penchant getting skin Westerners. Mahathir is very outspoken political leader, said Chia Yew Boon, independent analyst Singapore. There is no way like Clinton or Jiang Zemin are going be able muzzle him, he added, referring President Jiang China. Policy-makers United States have expressed fear that if Malaysia's gambit is seen successful, other economically weakened country region, Indonesia, might be tempted try it. So far, Indonesian official have said they would stick recovery plan devised International Monetary Fund, which stress economic austerity and open market. But official Japan have expressed some sympathy Mahathir's policy, while Paul Krugman, economist Massachusetts Institute Technology, ha advocated using them emergency measure. Yusof said recent event had vindicated Malaysia's contention that it needed insulate itself ravage global financial system. He said recent near-collapse prominent American hedge fund underscored how sudden flow capital can have destructive consequence. The Long-Term Capital Management hedge fund, based Greenwich, Conn., wa nearly wrecked series wrong bet Treasury security collapse economy Russia prompted flight capital out that country. The LTCM fiasco really provides case study what could go wrong global economy, Yusof said. With capital control protection, Yusof said Malaysia wa picking piece it shattered economy. In addition growing foreign reserve, he said Malaysia had improved it trade balance and revived consumer purchase durable good. Foreign investor have also not wholly abandoned Malaysia, expert had predicted they would. While foreign direct investment fell September $142 million, average monthly rate $321 million period January September it not dry completely. For every comforting statistic, though, critic produce alarming one. They said increase Malaysia's foreign reserve wa merely due new capital restriction, which stipulated that Malaysian currency held country would be worthless unless repatriated Sept. 30. The skeptic also noted that bank lending declined September, several reduction interest rate. So consumer who are buying new car and home appliance are merely dipping their saving, which mean buying spree will end when their saving are depleted. The argument wa that imposing capital control, you'd regain control monetary policy, which would increase supply money and lessen liquidity crunch, said KS. Jomo, professor political economy University Malaya here. But that's not happening. The biggest flaw Malaysia's policy, Jomo and said, is it timing. With Asian crisis more year old, much foreign capital that wa country ha already gone. The critic said Mahathir had spooked would-be investor locking one who used be here. There is case be made temporary imposition capital control, avert crisis, not respond one, Jomo said. In fact, other Asian currency, Indonesian rupiah and Thai baht, have actually rebounded Malaysia suspended trading it currency and fixed exchange rate 3.8 ringgit dollar. Analysts liken situation buying insurance policy disaster that ha come and gone. More important, capital control are slowing much-needed corporate and banking reform. The government's rescue Renong, major conglomerate close tie Mahathir, is going ahead, though some analyst predict government will eventually scrap much-criticized plan. The rescue politically connected company remains tense issue here. On Monday, trial Malaysia's former deputy prime minister, Anwar Ibrahim, charge corruption and sex-related crime, Anwar angrily denied Mahathir's claim that he had approved bailout. Anwar's sensational trial is reminder that Mahathir's economic policy cannot be disentangled politics. Malaysia's 72-year-old prime minister clashed his former protege how respond Asian crisis, and he dismissed Anwar day imposing capital control. During boom time, Mahathir won support his policy wrapping them anti-foreigner language. In speech Monday, he attacked familiar target, saying foreign currency trader are cause currency turmoil, adding: They spread it worldwide. They precipitated current recession every country. But Mahathir's treatment Anwar ha stirred anger and sparked growing social unrest Malaysia. With protester chanting reform orderly street this city, expert said Mahathir needed capital control work order soothe country's agitated population. Things will heat if economy doe not improve, said Chandra Muzaffar, professor political science University Malaya. Then whole question Mahathir and his leadership will remain issue. In that regard, least, leader who converge Kuala Lumpur two week will be able identify their embattled host. The leader Malaysia's ruling party met Tuesday discus replacement ousted deputy prime minister Anwar Ibrahim, who face trial next month case that will test country's legal system. Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad, 72, said last week he could drop dead any time. But because large number candidate deputy's job ruling United Malays National Organization, decision wa not expected quickly. The party leader, who have been conducting national campaign explain Malaysians why popular Anwar wa fired Sept. 2, will also confer what do now that High Court judge ha banned all comment Anwar's guilt or innocence. The ruling coalition had scheduled giant rally capital Saturday, aimed drawing youth whom Anwar's campaign reform ha most appeal. Mahathir, who had heart bypass surgery 1989, had groomed Anwar, 51, his successor. But he fired his protege his post deputy prime minister and finance minister ground he wa morally unfit lead. The two had differed economic policy and Anwar ha said Mahathir feared he wa threat his 17-year rule. Anwar wa also dumped ruling party, and two week nationwide rally which he called government reform and Mahathir's resignation, he wa arrested law that allows police hold him indefinitely, and prevent him seeing his family and lawyer. On Tuesday, Mahathir denounced demonstrator who had flocked thousand street downtown Kuala Lumpur recent week, calling them part plot topple government. Baton-wielding riot police had dispersed crowd tear gas and water cannon, arresting more 100 people. They decided that government should be brought demonstration, riot, Bernama news agency quoted Mahathir saying Sarawak state Borneo Island. He wa expected return Kuala Lumpur later Tuesday chair UMNO meeting. After Anwar appeared court black eye, bruised face, neck and arm, his case drew international attention, particularly president Philippines and Indonesia, who have raised possibility they might not attend 18-nation summit Malaysia next month. The United States would downgrade President Bill Clinton's visit Kuala Lumpur next month if Anwar continued be mistreated, Wall Street Journal quoted official Washington saying. Clinton is scheduled go Malaysia meeting Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum. Wearing neck brace Monday court-ordered hospital checkup, Anwar wa ordered stand trial Nov. 2 four charge abusing his power interfere police investigation. His trial is halt Nov. 14 and resume APEC meeting. He ha pleaded innocent all charge, including another corruption count and five charge sodomy. He face 14 year prison and fine each corruption count and 20 year, whipping, each sexual charge, if convicted. Anwar wa arrested Sept. 20 Internal Security Act, which allows jail trial. Under same law, police also arrested 17 people considered Anwar associate and risk national security. As Tuesday, 12 had been released. The UMNO supreme council wa expected prepare list top candidate Anwar's job Mahathir's final decision. The Star newspaper, which is close government, listed favorite Foreign Minister Abdullah Ahmad Badawi and Education Minister Najib Tun Razak. Other top contender included Mahathir's confidant Daim Zainuddin, former finance minister brought back Cabinet June special function minister charge economic recovery. Rafidah Aziz, international trade and industry minister, and Tengku Razaleigh Hamzah, former finance minister, were also running. The last time Asia-Pacific region held it annual summit promote free trade, Japan's prime minister assured everyone that his economy wouldn't be next victim Asia's financial crisis. Canada, host country, wa criticized some Canada cracking demonstration Suharto, Indonesia's iron-fisted ruler time. And President Bill Clinton, whose popularity and booming economy were envy planet, joined everyone else urging country such Thailand and South Korea bite bullet and comply tough economic reform that International Monetary Fund wa demanding. My, how challenge have grown, 21-nation Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum prepares it November summit Malaysia. Japan world's second largest economy, and Asia's financial anchor is suffering it worst recession World War II, and that bad news cost Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto his job. Suharto, who ruled Indonesia 32 year, wa driven out power violent, pro-democracy movement, and world's fourth most populous country is real trouble financially. Wall Street is now coping steep downturn. And though Clinton ha promised attend APEC meeting, some people wonder how he can do that while facing impeachment inquiry back home, thanks Monica Lewinsky sex scandal. Worse still, Asia's economic crisis is showing sign going global, and more and more economist are criticizing IMF way it is handling it bailouts. Other well-respected economist are going further, questioning whether free-market philosophy doesn't leave some country too vulnerable chaos major market speculator. In fact, Malaysia isn't only country trying self-defense mechanism such capital control. Hong Kong recently spent fortune investing it stock market ward speculator. And Washington is trying figure out what do hedge fund watching it Federal Reserve help bail out major one that wa going under, and seeing investment send US. dollar tailspin Japan's yen. Ironically, Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad, who made one his typical anti-free-market comment last year's summit, probably could have opened this year's I told you so. But he is having major domestic problem. Mahathir, 72, who is widely credited creating modern Malaysia his 17 year power, dismissed Anwar Ibrahim, his expected successor, apparent dispute how battle country's economic mess. Instead stepping aside, Anwar launched reform movement Malaysia that quickly led big rally demanding that Mahathir step down. The prime minister used riot police thwart protest, and jailed Anwar, charging him corruption and sex crime, and scheduling his trial Nov. 2. The trial will be interrupted Nov. 12-18 APEC meeting, Mahathir's treatment Anwar and his reform movement already have been criticized APEC member such Australia, Indonesia, Philippines and United States. President BJ. Habibie Indonesia and Philippine President Joseph Estrada consider Anwar friend, and Estrada won't say whether he plan attend this year's APEC summit. John S. Wolf, US. ambassador APEC, recently acknowledged that it won't be easy APEC member meet Malaysia Asian crisis ricochet world no clear sign what will happen next. But he also said leader 21 APEC member should aim productive meeting. Wolf said such gathering give member chance discus IMF bailout strategy and free-market philosophy, resolve bilateral dispute, and continue reduce tariff rate help struggling country improve their export. This ha been lousy year general. It ha affected all u. It ha set APEC back, and there is no silver bullet solve crisis right away, said Wolf. But we should welcome chance work together and develop sense what's possible. So far, APEC ha been criticized doing little financial crisis. But next month it hope complete plan that would lift trade barrier nine key industries: environmental product and service, energy, fishery, forestry, toy, jewelry, medical good, chemical product and telecommunication. Besides United States, APEC, which account half all global trade consists these members: Australia, Brunei, Canada, Chile, China, Hong Kong, Indonesia, Japan, Malaysia, Mexico, New Zealand, Papua New Guinea, Philippines, Singapore, South Korea, Taiwan and Thailand.

Relatives said he wa impressionable teen-ager, influenced Islamic militant whom he wa jailed. Sughayer came out prison more devout, and hardened mistreatment hand Israelis, relative said. His cellmates taught him doctrine holy war and glory martyrdom, said older brother, Samih Sughayer. They sowed it his heart, he said. He wanted be martyr cause God. But that reality, suddenly so clear Sunday, wa not so apparent when Sughayer wa freed seven month ago. He seemed normal, said his brother. He went work grocery store, he finished his high school class and he wanted enroll university. He wa supposed take driving test few day. If he wa planning something, we didn't see it. He would stay late night work, studying Koran and praying, he showed no outward sign rage Israel. He would joke thing and say that happens is God's will, said brother-in-law, who insisted anonymity. He wa easygoing guy. Last Thursday, Sughayer bought battered red Fiat and parked it his house. When someone home asked car he said nothing, and family member assumed it wa one stolen vehicle found here. On Friday morning he left car, meeting his brother-in-law and old jail buddy, Suleiman Tahayneh, who came his village West Bank town Jenin. Tahayneh had his score settle Israelis. His leg had been amputated he wa shot confrontation Israeli troop uprising, his relative said. The Fiat wa loaded explosive, and two men drove market. That evening, when concerned member Sughayer family gathered await news their missing relative, man arrived and told them that he had sold his car Youssef previous day. It wa red Fiat, same car they had seen house, and same type car that news report said had exploded marketplace. At midnight, Israeli security force raided house and interrogated family member. The last, grim piece puzzle fell place. Up last minute Thursday night we were talking together, said Sughayer's oldest brother, Ali, who worked him midnight produce store. He asked me someone who had moved his hardware shop another village, how he wa doing. Earlier we ate together, and we talked giving charity poor. He wasn't nervous. He had plan future, Ali continued. Maybe people his group convinced him do this, and he could not refuse. We not expect this him.

Although Hamas initially claimed responsibility anonymous phone call police, all side now have agreed that it wa Islamic Jihad that carried it out. There wa no immediate explanation inaccurate claim, two group have carried out attack together part their goal stopping peace process. Setting stage new quarrel how crack militant, Israel is demanding that military wing two radical Islamic group be outlawed, while Palestinian Authority insists it ha already banned them. Implementation Israeli-Palestinian land-for-security accord, signed Oct. 23 Washington, wa have begun this week, ha hit various snag. Most recently, Israel's Cabinet put vote ratify accord suicide bombing Friday Jerusalem that killed two assailant and injured 21 Israelis. The radical group Islamic Jihad claimed responsibility.

Hassan Asfour, senior Palestinian official, said Hamas' military wing, Izeddine al Qassam, and military wing Islamic Jihad were outlawed Palestinian Authority 1996. But Bar-Illan said Palestinian legislature had never passed such law. Why Mr. Arafat agree Wye accord outlaw them if he ha already done it? he asked. The Wye memorandum state that Palestinian Authority will inform United States fully action it ha taken outlaw all organization (or wing organization, appropriate) military, terrorist or violent character, and their support structure and prevent them freedom action area it jurisdiction. A Palestinian security official, speaking condition anonymity, said joint Israeli-Palestinian meeting wa held Saturday night discus security wake Friday's attack. Participants included head Palestinian intelligence, Amin Hindi, and head preventive security Gaza Strip, Mohammed Dahlan. The idea outlawing Hamas and Islamic Jihad wa brought meeting and also proposed Netanyahu Arafat phone call, official said. The Palestinians said they could ban activity Hamas or Islamic Jihad that endangered either Israelis or Palestinians, could not outlaw them outright political movement. Friday's bombing led finger-pointing side. Israel said it showed Arafat's crackdown terrorist had not been sweeping enough. The Palestinians, however, have also accused Israel failing take least partial security responsibility attack, because attacker came Israeli-controlled area, and had recently served time Israeli jail. Israel rule is harshly critical Palestinian Authority's security effort when attacker come Palestinian-controlled area or have been released Palestinian prison. On Sunday, Palestinian Justice Minister Freih Abu-Medein accused Netanyahu using blast pretext delaying implementation peace accord. This attack is gift Mr. Netanyahu, Abu-Medein said. All time he is praying God help him . escape agreement. Under accord, Israel is hand another 13 percent territory West Bank Palestinians exchange various security step.

If Mahathir not know alleged beating, it suggests police acted their own. At series rally his arrest, Anwar led throng chanting Mahathir's resignation and more open, le corrupt government. His arrest Sept. 20 wa followed street protest and hundred additional arrest. Before his arrest, Anwar designated his wife, Azizah Ismail, leader his new reform movement. But police have banned her speaking publicly. On Thursday she wa summoned third time police headquarters questioning interview regional television network CNBC Asia. She had expressed fear that her husband would be injected HIV virus prove allegation homosexuality, and police are investigating possible charge sedition her. She called repeated interview pressure and harassment. Three Malaysian police officer traveled Singapore Thursday ask CNBC news anchor how they had arranged get Sept. 21 interview Azizah and one Anwar Sept. 3. CNBC refused answer question it news gathering, said vice president news programming Chris Blackman. Anwar, who pleaded innocent this week five charge sodomy and five corruption, told court that police beat him night he wa arrested, blood seeped my nose, leaving him half-conscious. His allegation, accompanied pictorial evidence, brought prompt expression disapproval, US. State Department, Australian government, Amnesty International, and finance minister other country who used meet Anwar international conference. On Thursday, Indonesian government, where security force have been accused year mistreating prisoner, said it regretted report Anwar's injury and that allegation have placed doubt visit Malaysia President BJ. Habibie. The arrest former Malaysian Deputy Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim won't lead massive social unrest or frighten away investor, Malaysia's trade minister said Thursday. Anwar wa fired Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad Sept. 2 two differed economic policy. He then began speaking out Mahathir and wa arrested Sept. 20. Frankly speaking there is no reason say that just because one man wa arrested something . that it should bring any unrest, trade minister Rafidah Aziz said. Leaders come and go. . They get sacked all country world. They die, she told news conference Manila, where she attended meeting Association Southeast Asian Nations economic minister. Rafidah said there have only been few demonstration Malaysia Anwar's arrest, all them orchestrated. In recent visit Chicago, New York, Houston and Boston, she said potential investor asked her Anwar's arrest were still interested investing Malaysia. Anwar said police beat him custody. In recent appearance court, where he is facing charge corruption and illegal homosexual act, he wa seen black eye and neck brace. At least two ASEAN leader, Philippine President Joseph Estrada and Indonesian President BJ. Habibie, have spoken out Anwar's treatment. The Philippine leader said he wa skipping summit Asia-Pacific leader Malaysia November protest arrest Anwar, whom he described personal friend. He later said he would attend summit and had only made earlier remark out sympathy Anwar. The Philippines, Malaysia and Indonesia are founding member country ASEAN, which also includes Brunei, Laos, Myanmar, Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam. Among Asia's leader, Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad wa notable man bold vision: physical and social transformation that would push this nation forefront world affair. It almost came true. In 17 year prime minister, Mahathir, 72, who is medical doctor, fostered economic liberalization that led some world's fastest rate growth. He drove Malaysians be more productive, embrace high technology and begin major investment world. He created national affirmative-action program that allowed country's ethnic Chinese, Malays and Indians share improved living standard and new sense Malaysian identity and pride. This year wa have been Mahathir's year triumph, perhaps paving way his retirement, inauguration huge public work project and impressive gathering foreign leader and sportsman. But today, dizzying turnaround, Malaysia is Asia's critical list, it economy teetering edge disaster and it stability shaken what seems have been entirely avoidable political cat fight. Last month, Mahathir dismissed and arrested his deputy and heir apparent, Anwar Ibrahim, 51, accusing him corruption and illegal sex act. The move set street demonstration and aroused international condemnation, particularly Anwar's many friend foreign government. One region's most stable and prosperous nation is suddenly uproar. It appears that Indonesia, Thailand, Japan and South Korea, pressure economic collapse have spawned political crisis. In all those nation, result wa change leadership. The question now is: Is Mahathir next? The answer is far clear. Unlike Indonesia, there ha been little evidence simmering discontent Malaysia. The ouster former President Suharto Indonesia had been predicted many people. Almost no one seems have foreseen eruption here. Malaysia is not familiar political demonstration. Unlike Indonesians, Malaysians rarely riot. Many people here were puzzled and disturbed when they encountered water cannon and riot police street recent week. What we're seeing is unprecedented, said Ambassador John Malott United States. This ha never happened Malaysia, and nobody know where it's going go. You can write lot scenario we are totally uncharted water. Mahathir, confident nation-builder, seems be flailing he watch his legacy crumble. An economy that had been growing more 8 percent year last decade is now headed contraction perhaps 6 percent. Angry and frustrated, he closed Malaysia international financial market one month ago, turning his back foreign investor whom he once embraced and who had fueled country's rapid growth. The move had intended effect bringing home Malaysian currency, insulating it speculator Mahathir blame crisis, and giving adrenaline jolt now self-contained economy. It is move that seems tune recent questioning economic orthodoxy International Monetary Fund. But few foreign economist expect it work long. Mahathir is attacking fundamental belief free market, capitalism, Wall Street, foreign diplomat said. We are either watching economic theory being rewritten or reconfirmed and I don't think it's being rewritten. The day making his economic gamble, Mahathir set most severe political crisis his tenure, dismissing Anwar, man he had been grooming be his successor. Two week later, Anwar wa arrested his home and held incommunicado 10 day, which he say he wa beaten his jailer. Last week he wa charged 10 count corruption and sexual misconduct that could result prison term 34 year. The harshness those move unleashed surge largely unsuspected discontent that mobilized Anwar's motley fellow constituencies: liberal democrat, young professional and politically assertive Muslims. For first time decade, Malaysians thousand demonstrated street and mosque and were met tear gas and water cannon. Many people were beaten and hundred were detained, although most were later released. With emergence this still-tentative opposition movement, fear expressed one Western diplomat is downward spiral which suppression breed more discontent breed more suppression breed more discontent. People here whisper that Mahathir's day may now be numbered. But few venture guess what number might be. Given his control lever power and lack focus or leadership opposition, Mahathir could ride out storm Anwar's trial proceeds. But he ha struck harsh blow morale his nation, sense confidence he had worked so hard build slogan Malaysia Can! In this generally decorous nation, depth anger expressed two men who once called each other father and son is disturbing hear. Anwar, say prime minister, is despicable and sodomist. Mahathir, say his former deputy, is senile and insane. Malaysians, who have stolidly accepted Mahathir's authoritarian rule mixture gratitude and emerging pride, seem stunned. Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad said Friday he is not too choosy who will be his successor. The man need not necessarily be very religious and only preoccupied doing virtuous deed all time, national news agency, Bernama, quoted Mahathir saying Friday prayer Al-Falah Mosque northern town Jitra Kedah state. It is sufficient that person doe thing acceptable people, Mahathir said. So far Mahathir, 72, ha designated three heirs-apparent his 17-year rule. One resigned. Another challenged Mahathir leadership ruling party, and lost. On Sept. 2, he fired last one, Anwar Ibrahim, calling him morally unfit office. Anwar mounted nationwide campaign prime minister being detained national security risk and charged illegal homosexual act and corruption connection those allegation. Mahathir told reporter later that Anwar had been working toppling him prime minister and president governing coalition's dominant party, United Malays National Organization. He appeared very good me he wa actually planning way bringing me down. At first, I not believe when people told me this, I now know this be true, said Mahathir. Mahathir said Anwar had arranged his supporter contest and gain control UMNO division so that he could win party's top post next year's party election. Indonesian President BJ. Habibie find attending summit Asia-Pacific leader difficult because his concern arrest Malaysia's former deputy prime minister, Thai newspaper reported Sunday. Asia-Pacific leader are scheduled meet next month Malaysia annual economics meeting. Last week, Philippine President Joseph Estrada said he wa not going Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum because Anwar Ibrahim's arrest. I'm very concerned how my friend Anwar Ibrahim ha been treated, Habibie wa quoted saying English-language newspaper The Nation. I'm concerned because people should not forget that Anwar Ibrahim had contributed lot benefit his country. Anwar is charismatic politician who wa once picked be successor Malaysia's long-serving Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad. But he wa suddenly fired Mahathir Sept. 2 two differed economic policy. He then began speaking out Mahathir and wa arrested Sept. 20. Anwar ha been accused engaging homosexual act illegal Malaysia law, charge are generally seen pretext his political persecution. In court appearance last week, Anwar's face wa bruised and he said he had been beaten police, heightening international attention his case. Because human right involved and I think it is universal people should be given chance defend themselves, Habibie wa quoted saying interview conducted Saturday. People should not be tortured. Habibie said Anwar's dismissal should not have been based thing which had not been proven. On attending APEC meeting, he said, It's difficult me. But he said he would consult parliament, adding, I'm not coming personally president 211 million people Indonesia. Like Estrada, Habibie served his country's vice president when Anwar wa deputy prime minister, making them counterpart international affair circuit.

Sidek Baba, deputy rector International Islamic University, wa released Wednesday 16 day jail.

He ruled out early election prove his popularity. A general election is not scheduled 2000. Support is solid, said Mahathir. There is no exodus party.

The situation therefore remains fully serious today it wa week or two ago, he told reporter flying Belgrade. He plan meet Kosovan Albanian leader Tuesday. We hope make clear president Milosevic and people Yugoslavia extreme gravity situation, he said. Under NATO threat end his punishing offensive ethnic Albanian separatist Kosovo, President Slobodan Milosevic Yugoslavia ha ordered most unit his army back their barrack and may well avoid attack alliance, military observer and diplomat say. Milosevic, who one hand is excoriated Washington scourge Kosovo other hand is treated key peace Bosnia, acted European Union, NATO and United Nations prepared review Monday possible military intervention. Russia stepped it warning such action and dispatched it foreign and defense minister unusually high-level mission see Yugoslav president Sunday Belgrade. As he ha so often, Milosevic appears have bowed foreign demand nick time and still accomplished what he wanted. This weekend, foreign diplomatic observer Kosovo reported that military stand-down had taken place province, where Milosevic's force have waged fierce offensive Albanian rebel. The observer said that segment three brigade, most unit Yugoslav army were home. The daily report observer mission, made U.S., European Union and Russian military expert, are one key element helping Washington and European capital decide whether Milosevic ha met their demand cease-fire. By putting army back it barrack, sending some police unit out Kosovo and ordering end burning and looting village, Milosevic may well avoid NATO attack, diplomat here and Washington said. But same time, they acknowledge that while NATO looked other way, he enjoyed three-month license overwhelm Kosovo Liberation Army rebel army fighting independence Kosovo and it ethnic Albanian majority and terrorize rural civilian population that support it. His military operation created more 250,000 refugee, whom Clinton administration is gearing take care this winter variety relief organization. US. official said they expected Richard Holbrooke, US. envoy who dealt Milosevic negotiating end war Bosnia, meet him Monday discus political plan Kosovo. The heart disagreement Kosovo is Serbia, Yugoslavia's principal republic, which insists keeping Kosovo province, and ethnic Albanians there who have chafed Milosevic's repression he stripped province virtual autonomy 1989, and who now seek independence. The West, fearing precedent that independence Kosovo would set other conflict world, ha been trying mediate middle course. In essence, diplomat said they believed that plan Holbrooke will present Milosevic call three-year interim period leading status fairly close pre-1989 autonomy arrangement. Since Kosovo conflict flared March, critic Washington's policy Milosevic argue that he ha been able choreograph every move suit his goal: pushing Albanian population submission impunity. The United States and it ally have waited four month while he cleaned clock Kosovo Liberation Army, said Morton Abramowitz, head International Crisis Group, policy analysis organization, and taken three week discus military action, result that 500 Albanian village were destroyed. Administration official now acknowledge that when NATO failed live it earlier threat June strike Serbia, Milosevic took advantage indecision and plunged ahead artillery and tank offensive lightly armed guerrilla force, whose bedrock popular support had helped win them effective control large swath Kosovo territory, including key road. While he wa doing that, Milosevic skillfully managed key requirement Washington: he made sure that war not spill neighboring Albania and Macedonia, fragile country traditionally volatile area. All along, biggest fear Washington ha been that Kosovo conflict would engulf neighboring country and encourage Albania and ethnic Albanian population Macedonia join cause. Such possibility raised specter new Balkans conflict just three year peace wa secured Bosnia. Milosevic catered Washington's concern that conflict be contained. The Yugoslav army mined Kosovo's border Macedonia and Albania, ensuring that few refugee could escape and limiting route arm supply rebel. The Yugoslav leader also understood that Washington wa unsure how deal disorganized Albanian political leadership Kosovo and unbending Kosovo Liberation Army, whose main chief were hardened emigre returned Switzerland and Germany. For example, Holbrooke persuaded Milosevic meet May Ibrahim Rugova, top Albanian political leader Kosovo, encounter that turned out be little more photo opportunity. For that procedural breakthrough, Holbrooke recommended lifting ban foreign investment Serbia that had been put place month before. After meeting Rugova, Milosevic stepped his military operation Kosovo, forcing Washington reverse itself again and carry out investment ban. In late June, Holbrooke met two self-styled Kosovo guerrilla commander province's western town Junik then broke all contact. Clinton administration official said time that they were concerned that NATO intervention would bolster separatist force. To try put best face situation, Washington worked Moscow get Milosevic accept presence international monitor who would patrol Kosovo and report military action. The monitor were slow getting organized. By August, when Yugoslav army, backed Serbian special police, were full swing rebel and burning and looting village process, monitor found it difficult gain access fighting. They drove roadblock, knew something wa going sound and smoke, could not be precise. In recent day tank and artillery have withdrawn, access ha improved, monitor say. But there are some area central Kosovo Likovac and Gornje Obrinje that monitor have ruled limit because land mine road. The mine are believed have been planted guerrilla. Gornje Obrinje wa site massacre 18 ethnic Albanian woman, child and elderly people Sept. 26. A British reporter who walked field village Sunday said 10 mortar shell, apparently Serbian police or Yugoslav army, were fired village early Sunday afternoon. The Yugoslav army and police force have been responsible vast majority atrocity Kosovo conflict, said report New York-based group Human Rights Watch, released here Sunday. The report said rebel had also violated law war taking civilian hostage and carrying out summary execution. But violation guerrilla were lesser scale government abuse, author report, Fred Abrahams, concluded. The report focused what it called watershed conflict attack police force three ethnic Albanian village late February and early March Drenica region central Kosovo. At least 83 people, including 24 woman and child, were killed attack, which involved helicopter, artillery and armored personnel carrier. In Yugoslav capital, Belgrade, which is four-hour drive north rolling countryside Kosovo's capital Pristina, Milosevic remains politically secure. That is part, his domestic critic say, because diplomat Holbrooke and head U.N.refugee agency, Sadako Ogata, insist going see him, thus enhancing his stature. The American envoy Richard Holbrooke met President Slobodan Milosevic Yugoslavia Monday night and according American diplomat told him that he had take further step pull back his military Kosovo Province or face NATO attack. Milosevic wa also told, diplomat said, that he had insure that roughly 250,000 ethnic Albanian refugee who have been forced flee their home fighting last six month be allowed return home. Most these refugee are reluctant return because many Serb police officer who destroyed their home and village remain neighborhood. After delivering his sternest message so far Milosevic Kosovo conflict, Holbrooke said news conference that NATO's military plan attacking Serbia were moving ahead serious, intense and sustained basis. Holbrooke's mission Milosevic wa described American diplomat not do or die trip, they added, We're very serious juncture. Shortly Holbrooke's meeting Milosevic, Yugoslav leader issued defiant statement Serbian television which he said threat aggression outlined Holbrooke represented criminal act. Milosevic, who rarely comment his meeting foreign diplomat and whose tough word cast unusually ominous tone, also said that Holbrooke's position constituted support Albanian terrorist and not Albanian people. Milosevic wa apparently accusing Holbrooke supporting ethnic Albanian guerrilla Kosovo Liberation Army, who have been fighting make Serbian province Kosovo independent nation. The Yugoslav leader added that more seven day there have been no skirmish or military action. An American diplomat familiar theme Holbrooke planned stress Milosevic said there had been no expectation that American envoy would walk out Monday night agreement. Rather, point wa underscore Yugoslav leader and make explicit what wa expected him. It wa not quite ultimatum, diplomat said, more matter what step have be taken show compliance. The essence Holbrooke's demand centered issue outlined United Nations Security Council resolution two week ago. The resolution ordered Milosevic withdraw extra army and police force that were sent Kosovo deal guerrilla and send back their base military force normally stationed province. So far, American diplomat said, Milosevic ha withdrawn troop field not all them are their barrack. Such move is essential, American diplomat said, create conducive atmosphere any possible negotiation future status province. The UN. resolution also call political solution. Holbrooke and US. ambassador Macedonia, Christopher Hill, discussed Milosevic political document drawn State Department that call broad autonomy Kosovo. Milosevic withdrew autonomy 1989 he began his campaign Serb nationalism. The countryside central Kosovo ha been eerily silent last Thursday. The sound artillery thud and mortar round have been noticeably absent and coil white smoke that signified burning village have vanished green hill and valley. Police checkpoint are more relaxed and area that were sealed this time last week Yugoslav army are now open patrol diplomatic monitor United States, European Union and Russia. These monitor, many whom are former military officer, have reported that Yugoslav army ha stood and that they have seen virtually no military action late last week. There ha been sporadic shooting, monitor have reported. But this superficial calm is not good enough because Serb military ha capacity resume fighting very quickly, NATO military officer said Monday. The officer added that cease-fire Kosovo is pretty much enacted. He also said that trend compliance is positive. The interior ministry police must also reduce their presence village so that refugee who have fled have confidence return, military officer said. Some interior ministry police officer had left province, not enough, he added. On question how badly damaged KLA had been Yugoslav army's three-month offensive, NATO officer said, It's fair assessment that KLA is dismantled not destroyed. Holbrooke's first stop Monday wa Brussels, where he met secretary-general NATO, Javier Solana. On Tuesday he plan travel Pristina, capital Kosovo, where he is scheduled meet ethnic Albanian leader Ibrahim Rugova present political proposal future status Kosovo. He is expected back Belgrade Tuesday afternoon another session Milosevic. The United States and Russia are ratcheting pressure President Slobodan Milosevic, warning that NATO airstrikes are inevitable unless he take decisive action soon end humanitarian crisis southern Serbian province. Fearing airstrikes, Yugoslav general put nation's air defense high alert, tried belated compromise moving some tank and other heavy equipment out Kosovo. A Western diplomat said 120 Yugoslav army armored vehicle, including tank, have been pulled out. In Brussels, Belgium, however, US. special envoy Richard Holbrooke told reporter Monday that situation Kosovo is bad now two week ago. Holbrooke is en route Belgrade meeting Milosevic. While level fighting (in Kosovo) may have abated temporarily, capacity it resumption is there, Holbrooke said meeting NATO Secretary General Javier Solana and Supreme Allied Commander Europe Wesley K.

On Sunday, Human Rights Watch said Milosevic's government and ethnic Albanian rebel have committed atrocity conflict began, government abuse were much greater scale. The report New York-based human right organization say Milosevic ha primary responsibility gross government abuse. With threat NATO attack mounting, Yugoslavia's prime minister warned Monday nation face immiment danger war and claimed government wa taking step comply international demand peace Kosovo. In New York, UN. Secretary-General Kofi Annan said systematic terror had been inflicted Kosovo civilian recent day and that Yugoslav force were mostly responsible. But Annan said he not have mean necessary provide independent assessment compliance required Security Council and suggested 15 member may want make their judgement this respect. But US. special envoy Richard Holbrooke said situation southern Serbian province wa bad now two week ago. Holbrooke spoke Brussels, Belgium en route Belgrade, where he planned drive home Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic extreme gravity situation. Meanwhile, Yugoslavia's prime minister told emergency session parliament Monday that country is faced imminent danger war. Kosovo is province Serbia, main republic Yugoslavia. The threat are serious, Prime Minister Momir Bulatovic said. And I call this parliament conclude that Yugoslavia is faced imminent danger war. Yugoslavia ha defend itself if it wa attacked. One option could be parliament declare state emergency step which could lead general mobilization all military-aged men. In attempt head NATO action, Bulatovic said government had accepted Russian proposal Organization Security and Cooperation Europe investigate crisis. Yugoslavia had repeatedly rejected such mission Kosovo Yugoslav membership 54-nation organization is restored. Bulatovic also claimed there wa no longer any fighting rebellious, majority Albanian province. He said five 10 special police unit had been removed Kosovo and had been returned barrack province. In Brussels, however, Holbrooke made clear that half-measures would not be enough satisfy Washington and prevent NATO attack. While level fighting may have abated temporarily, capacity it resumption is there, Holbrooke said meeting NATO Secretary General Javier Solana and Supreme Allied Commander Europe Wesley K. Clark. The situation, therefore, remains fully serious today it wa week or two ago, he said. We hope make clear president Milosevic and people Yugoslavia extreme gravity situation. Meanwhile, head Yugoslavia's other republic, Montenegro, called Milosevic accept all international demand and avert NATO attack. We have avert clash whole world, confrontation which we are bound lose, Montenegro's pro-Western president, Milo Djukanovic, said statement. Djukanovic, staunch Milosevic critic, called Yugoslav president address nation unambiguous message that he ha accepted all UN. resolution and agreement he made Russian President Boris Yeltsin. Djukanovic blamed Yugoslavia's problem Milosevic's undemocratic regime. Fearing airstrikes, Yugoslav general put nation's air defense high alert and moved some tank and other heavy equipment out Kosovo. A Western diplomat said 120 Yugoslav army armored vehicle, including tank, have been pulled out. Belgrade had been counting Russia block any U.N.-sanctioned military move Western Alliance. On Sunday, Milosevic met Russian Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov and Defense Minister Igor Sergeyev, Serbian President Milan Milutinovic and Yugoslavia's top defense official. Although Russians are using NATO force Kosovo, Ivanov and Sergeyev said airstrikes could occur if decisive measure are not immediately taken radical improvement situation, Foreign Ministry spokesman Vladimir Rakhmanin told ITAR-Tass news agency.

Serbian police and Yugoslav army have routed separatist Kosovo Albanian rebel crackdown that began late February. The conflict ha killed hundred most them Albanian civilian and left more 275,000 refugee. Ethnic Albanians compromise 90 percent province's 2 million-strong population, and most favor independence or substantial self-rule. Momentum involvement ha increased week revelation massacre ethnic Albanian civilian forest Kosovo. Although United States and Europeans want end fighting, they also oppose independence Kosovo, fearing that could destabilize other Balkan country Albanian population.

Ethnic Albanian political leader have rejected new interim government, which wa drawn their participation. The council is composed seven Serbs, five ethnic Albanians and rest Turks and Muslims. With NATO attack said be only day away, top US. envoy Richard Holbrooke delivered last-minute warning Monday Yugoslavia's president halt his crackdown ethnic Albanians Kosovo or face airstrikes. But Slobodan Milosevic showed no sign backing down. Following his meeting Holbrooke, Milosevic's office issued statement denouncing NATO threat criminal act that favored separatist ethnic Albanian guerrilla. The statement, broadcast government television, said there had been no fighting Serbian province seven day and that crisis represented no threat other country southern Balkans. Holbrooke, US. ambassador-designate United Nations, met Milosevic several hour late Monday arriving Brussels, Belgium, where he conferred senior NATO official. Holbrooke issued no statement meeting. Before boarding plane Yugoslav capital, Belgrade, however, Holbrooke said condition southern Serbian province had not improved alliance started two week ago finalize plan air raid force Milosevic halt his offensive Kosovo Albanian separatist. Holbrooke said he planned drive home Milosevic extreme gravity situation. Holbrooke negotiated peace deal Milosevic and other Balkan leader that ended 3 1/2 year Bosnian war 1995. In Washington, US. President Bill Clinton expressed concern that Milosevic wa playing classic game making false promise avoid NATO military strike. Clinton, telephone call Russian President Boris Yeltsin, said Milosevic's compliance UN. demand must be verifiable, tangible and irreversible, press secretary Joe Lockhart said White House. What happens next depends President Milosevic, Lockhart quoted president telling Russian leader, who ha opposed use force Moscow's longtime ally. As Holbrooke tried resolve crisis negotiation, British Foreign Secretary Robin Cook said decision NATO military action wa imminent. We are getting ready NATO action and later this week we will expect decision be taken, Cook told reporter special session Cabinet called Prime Minister Tony Blair. In Brussels, NATO official said they were ready launch airstrikes hour receiving order attack. If that first airstrike failed deter Serb force, senior NATO official said condition anonymity, alliance could unleash fully fledged air campaign involving hundred plane. At United Nations, Secretary-General Kofi Annan said Yugoslav force had increased their attack Kosovo's ethnic Albanians UN. resolution demanded cease-fire. In widely anticipated report Security Council, Annan listed apparent violation Sept. 23 UN. resolution, decried appalling atrocity Kosovo, and said it wa clear any reasonable doubt that Yugoslav force were responsible bulk them. The UN. chief also said rebel force Kosovo Liberation Army also were responsible human right violation, charge KLA quickly denied. NATO country had been awaiting UN. chief's report determine whether use military force stop offensive ethnic Albanians, who are seeking autonomy they had 1989, if not independence, Yugoslavia. Albanians province outnumber Serbs 9-to-1. Despite Annan's unwillingness declare Serb noncompliance, US. State Department spokesman James Foley said Clinton administration believed Milosevic had not met condition laid UN. Security Council. Foley cited absence formal cease-fire, failure arrange meaningful dialogue ethnic Albanian leader and continued presence major army unit southeastern Kosovo Albania's border. The European Union nation were divided Monday whether launch air strike UN. Security Council backing. The EU foreign minister, meeting Luxembourg, agreed tighten economic sanction Milosevic, it wa unlikely that stricter travel curb Yugoslav official and freezing more Yugoslav asset abroad would be anything more symbolic. Meanwhile, Yugoslavia's prime minister told emergency session parliament Monday that country is faced imminent danger war. Yugoslavia is comprised dominant Serbia and smaller Montenegro. The threat are serious, Prime Minister Momir Bulatovic said. And I call this parliament conclude that Yugoslavia is faced imminent danger war. Yugoslavia ha defend itself if it wa attacked. One option wa parliament declare state emergency step mobilization all military-aged men. But parliament voted introduce measure when first bomb drop our territory. In attempt head NATO action, Bulatovic said government had accepted Russian proposal investigation 54-nation Organization Security and Cooperation Europe. Yugoslavia had repeatedly rejected such mission Kosovo Yugoslav membership organization is restored. The prime minister also said there wa no longer any fighting Kosovo, which ha 2 million resident. He said five 10 special police unit had been removed Kosovo and had been returned their barrack province. One diplomat Kosovo, who spoke condition anonymity, said there ha been significant redeployment Yugoslav army troop out Kosovo other part Serbia, including mechanized brigade that pulled out Sunday. Some army unit remain field, and there is enormous fear that violence will resume, particularly refugee, ten thousand whom are living hill and forest shelter. ","Yugoslavia failed to comply with a U.N. resolution demanding that the forces sent to Kosovo to suppress the ethnic Albanian separatist uprising be withdrawn and is now threatened with NATO airstrikes.Though Milosevic moved some units from the Serbian province, U.S. special envoy Holbrooke called the situation serious.Russia, previously against a NATO attack, said the strikes could occur if steps aren't taken to end the crisis.Hundreds, mostly Albanian civilians, have been killed and thousands are refugees.While the U.S. and other nations want peace, they oppose Kosovo independence, fearing it could destabilize other Albanian-populated Balkan states.","Under threat of NATO attack, Milosevic orders back most army units.US envoy says situation is as grave as it was 2 weeks ago, despite temporary abatement of fighting.US and Russia increase pressure on Milosevic to end the humanitarian crisis in Kosovo or face NATO airstrikes.US envoy tells Milosevic to pull back his military and let Albanian refugees return home.Yugoslavia claims it is taking steps to comply with peace demands.However, NATO says that UN Security Council conditions have not yet been met.US envoy gives Milosevic last minute warning to halt ethnic crackdown in Kosovo.Milosevic calls NATO threat criminal act favoring guerrillas.","Yugoslav President Slbodan Milosevic does not appear to be complying completely with UN demands to withdraw his troops and stop anti-Albanian activity in Kosovo.U.S. special envoy Richard Holbrooke said the level of fighting may have abated but the situation is such that it could resume.The U.S. and Russia have ratcheted up pressure on Milosevic warning him of inevitable NATO air strikes.Yugoslavia claimed it ""is faced with the imminent danger of war"", will defend itself if attacked and called NATO's threats a ""criminal act"".Yugoslav generals put the nation's air defense on high alert then pulled some armored equipment out of Kosovo as a compromise.","On Oct. 4, 1998 Yugoslav President Milosevic ordered his forces in Kosovo back to their barracks.While supressing the Albanian independence movement they had massacred hundreds of civilians and left 275,000+ refugees.NATO threatened airstrikes unless hostilities ceased and peace talks began.U.S. envoy Holbrooke insisted that Milosevic pull all forces out of Kosovo.Milosevic called the NATO threat ""a criminal act"" and said Holbrooke aided Albanian terrorists.Russia also urged an end to hostilities, but the Yugoslavs denied any fighting and vowed to defend their country if attacked.Neither side budged as NATO seemed to wait for a U.N. decision."
17,"A North Korean man arrived Seoul Wednesday and sought asylum escaping his hunger-stricken homeland, government official said. Kim Myong Sup, 23, had been living hiding third country fleeing North Korea last year, Ministry Foreign Affairs and Trade said. The ministry generally us term third country avoid naming China, which is required treaty North Korea return defector their homeland. The ministry described Kim former athlete, said detail his background and his method escape North Korea were not available. About 200 North Koreans have defected South Korea three year, including 60 so far this year. All complained severe food and fuel shortage their country. The Koreas were divided communist North and capitalist South 1945. They fought Korean War 1950-53 and never signed formal peace treaty. Hunger and malnutrition Cambodia are reaching crisis level comparable effect famine North Korea, UN. World Food Program representative said Tuesday. Though North Korea is suffering simple lack food, faltering economy Cambodia combined weak health care and education is causing similar level malnutrition child, said Ken Davies, WFP's country director. There is enough rice. The problem is that people are too poor access it. The problem is poverty, Davies said. The WFP is currently supporting 1.7 million hungry Cambodians 15 percent population food-for-work and direct assistance program, Davies said he fear there are still plenty more that are not getting enough eat every day. The problem is so bad that it is only little worse North Korea, Davies said. The situation is much worse most people recognize. According recent WFP survey, 49 percent Cambodian child age 5 are stunted lack food and 20 percent suffer acute malnutrition. By comparison, similar survey North Korean child 7 found that 65 percent are stunted and 16 percent suffer acute malnutrition. Cambodia ha produced rice surplus export last two year and expects another this year, WFP statistic show that 25 percent rice-growing area account 75 percent surplus. The majority Cambodian farmer are not producing enough keep their family fed and are being increasingly saddled debt incurred when they run out reserve harvest, Davies said. Money-lenders rural Cambodia typically charge 100 percent interest, which must be paid rice harvest time, giving many farmer handicapped start next crop season. Poor sanitation, lack health care and ignorance modern child rearing problem left mostly unaddressed under-funded health and education sector Cambodia have exacerbated food security problem, Davies said. Davies urged new government substantially increase annual expenditure health, education and rural development first step long-term solution Cambodia's food crisis. The poverty is getting worse right now and situation malnutrition child is crisis, Davies said. Cambodia typically earmark half it annual budget defense and security. In 1998 budget, education wa allocated 6.5 percent, health 4.4 percent and rural development 0.2 percent. Actual disbursement three ministry are only 60 70 percent budgeted amount annual revenue fall short expectation, according aid worker. A 1999 budget draft proposed reduction health ministry's allotment, which caused outcry September health official and UN. World Health Program. The draft wa later readjusted provide unprecedented 33 percent increase health spending. North Korea is entering it fourth winter chronic food shortage it people malnourished and risk dying normally curable illness, senior Red Cross official said Tuesday. The official warned international complacency and hostility North Korea food crisis stretch and isolated communist country show little willingness adopt far-reaching change revive it ruined economy. Humanitarian suffering cannot be routine any part world, said Margareta Wahlstrom, Red Cross' undersecretary disaster relief, who returned Beijing Tuesday week inspecting aid agency's operation North Korea. She and other Red Cross official saw further ravage North Korea's slow-motion famine: electricity supplied only half capital, Pyongyang, time; elderly looking swollen, sign long-term hunger; generation child stunted, 10-year-olds looking 6-year-olds and 5-year-olds 2-year-olds. Everywhere, bakery government ministry, people were being served noodle and cake made soybean mixed acorn, grass and herb, Red Cross president Astrid Heiberg said. Heiberg likened additive cattle food and noted that doctor reported rise stomach illness mixture. This is really part daily life, she said. You would not give them your child or your elderly mother knowing she would get cramp her stomach and diarrhea unless her stomach wa moaning. Three year flood and drought that started 1995 devastated North Korea's collective farming and planned economy, already teetering loss it Soviet bloc trading partner. With few good or money barter or buy foreign supply, country lack sufficient fertilizer crop, and fuel and part machinery. The Red Cross inspector saw soldier and people harvesting cabbage, winter's main vegetable. The grain harvest is finished and UN. estimate little improved last year's: 3 million ton, only enough meet two-thirds need North Korea's 22 million people. As long, harsh winter begin, doctor confirm and official statistic show widespread malnutrition, tuberculosis rise and hunger-weakened patient unable recover operation and sickness, Heiberg said. Doctors worry that respiratory illness so common winter may take toll weakened population, she said. One 10-bed hospital countryside wa keeping only three patient time because it not have food care more, said Heiberg. The Red Cross want focus it latest dlrs 9 million appeal getting essential medicine and blanket and warm clothes North Korea. Food aid is largely being turned UN. agency. Despite catastrophic hunger home, North Korea plan send 317 athlete and official next month's Asian Games Thailand, South Korean official said Thursday. It will be largest sport delegation communist country ha sent abroad recent year. North Korean Sports Minister Chang Ung said 209 athlete his country will compete 21 event Bangkok, hoping win medal women's judo, women's soccer, wrestling, table tennis, weightlifting and boxing. Chang made remark interview published recently Chosun Shinbo, newspaper run pro-North Korean resident Japan, said Seoul's Naewoe Press, which obtained report. Chang said North Korea wa sending large delegation Bangkok prepare 2000 Sydney Olympics. North Korea not enter last Asian Games, Hiroshima, Japan, 1994. It sent only 18 athlete and official Winter Olympics Nagano, Japan, February. Naewoe is run South Korea's main government intelligence agency and specializes monitoring communist news medium. Three year flood and drought that started 1995 devastated North Korea's collective farming and planned economy, forcing country rely aid feed it 23 million people. Famine-threatened North Korea's harvest will be no better this year last and could be worse, senior UN. aid official said Saturday. North Korea need minimum 4.5 million 5 million ton grain feed it 23 million people, managed last year harvest just 2.8 million ton, Namanga Ngongi, deputy head World Food Program said. Although hard figure are not available, prospect this year are that harvest will not be any better, Ngongi told reporter Beijing visiting North Korea. It may be worse last year. Poor harvest, economic collapse and three year flood and drought, have produced chronic food shortage North Korea and left it heavily reliant foreign aid. Fertilizer is lacking, is fuel power tractor and farm machinery, meaning most planting and harvesting must be done hand. Every year it get worse, Ngongi said. But need food aid, Ngongi said government month ago cut number county which WFP ha access 171 145, reducing number people who can get aid 6.7 million 5.8 million. Most those receiving WFP aid are child aged 6 month and 6 year. Ngongi said government cited security concern notably lack peace treaty it rival South Korea it decision. The government said ban would be temporary, Ngongi added. Ngongi, who spent four day inspecting WFP relief effort North Korea, said people generally looked better visit last year. But he also said he could see that large part population is very weak. Everybody ha been consuming very low level. So they may not be severely malnourished, they are not well nourished all, he said. US. official who toured some hardest-hit region North Korea this summer said 2 million people may have died because famine. Ngongi said he saw malnourished child who were said be 10 or 11 year old, appeared be only 4 or 5 year old. About 30 percent child one primary school he visited were not class. A lot child were too weak come school, he said. But Ngongi said foreign food aid ha saved life. A lot people are alive today thanks international community's support, he said. A congressman who visited remote part North Korea last week said Saturday that food and health situation there wa desperate and deteriorating, and that million North Koreans might have starved death last few year. The congressman, Tony Hall, D-Ohio, who ha had longtime interest world hunger, passed Tokyo his return United States and showed photograph he had taken North Korean child patchy hair, protruding bone, open sore and other sign severe malnutrition. Hall also brought back bag what official called substitute food being distributed government food station: dried leaf and straw, so coarse that cattle would normally turn away. They grind it powder and make it noodle, Hall said. The noodle have no nutrition and are indigestible, leaving people holding their aching stomach, he said. North Korea ha admitted that it is facing serious economic difficulty, there have been sharply diverging assessment how serious these are. Some visitor United Nations and other organization have said that food situation seems be bit better now year or two ago. Hall said that divergence might have arisen because North Korean capital, Pyongyang, life seem be slightly better his three previous trip North Korea. But rural area where foreigner are not allowed visit, he added, overall situation is worse ever. Based visit four hospital, Hall also emphasized that public health care had declined sharply. In one hospital, assistant were holding patient while surgeon conducted stomach operation electric light or anesthesia. Ordinary North Koreans are suffering, part, because their government's hard-line policy have alienated would-be donor and aid agency. The United Nations ha repeatedly appealed relief aid North Korea, latest appeal ha raised le one-third target. In September, Doctors Without Borders announced that it wa pulling it staff 13 North Korea because it feared that it aid wa going politically connected rather most needy. North Korea doe not release mortality figure or health statistic, Hall said that United Nations had gathered and would soon release data indicating that 30 percent North Korean child age 2 are acutely malnourished and that 67 percent all child are physically stunted. Hall said he thought that overall least 1 million people had died and that total wa probably closer 3 million. In indication seriousness which professional demographer view situation, US. Bureau Census recently published estimate suggesting that North Korea's population peaked 1995 21.55 million and ha fallen 21.23 million this year. That would be decline 320,000 three year, period when North Korea's population would have been expected grow 925,000 people, based population growth rate early 1990s. Nicholas Eberstadt, American specialist North Korean population figure, say that there simply is not enough hard information him estimate death toll famine. But he note one political tidbit: North Korea's constitution stipulates that there should be one delegate country's people's assembly every 30,000 citizen. This year's assembly not expand previous one did, rather had just 687 delegate, same previous assembly held 1990. While Eberstadt counsel caution, that could mean that North Korea's population, eight year which it had been expected add several million people, is now back 20.6 million people or fewer. The United States ha been supplying grain North Korea, strain are growing secret underground complex North that some expert worry may be heart new nuclear weapon program. The United States warned last week that agreed framework that is basis it relation North Korea will be jeopardy unless North let American expert visit underground complex and resolve their doubt. North Korea ha said that it will show complex only if Washington promise that if complex is not nuclear one, it will pay vilifying u and impairing our prestige. Washington refuse pay, and North Korea is warning that standoff could lead agreement fall apart. Their shameless and wicked demand is open infringement our sovereignty and wanton interference our internal affair, declared North Korea's leading newspaper, Rodong Sinmun. More five year severe food shortage and near-total breakdown public health system have led devastating malnutrition North Korea and probably left entire generation child physically and mentally impaired, new study international aid group ha found. The study, first scientific nutritional survey North Korea, confirms disturbing report international aid worker, who year have gained increasing access population this highly isolated and secretive country. Among other shocking finding, researcher World Food Program, Unicef and European Union found that, because long-term food shortage, staggering 62 percent child 7 year old suffer stunted growth. They have discovered that, huge international food aid program three year, severe malnutrition is widespread toddler crucial stage brain development, suggesting that this generation's physical and mental ability will not develop normally and that loss can never be recovered. Separately, international medical worker group Red Cross, have begun document how effect food shortage are being severely compounded breakdown public health service. Even basic water purification system stand idle lack essential ingredient chlorine, Red Cross worker say, leaving vast number people such severe diarrhea that they are unable absorb completely what little food they have. As North Korean dictatorship ha slowly, grudgingly, granted increased access international aid group last six month, increasingly clear and saddening picture hunger haas emerged result large formal study and informal survey and observation foreign aid agency. Past assessment magnitude disaster country 23 million are considered flawed because they were based interview small number North Korean refugee who had fled China. And while researcher and aid worker ground North Korea have not seen evidence cannibalism or starving child dying roadside description that have surfaced more lurid refugee report what they find wa many way equally disturbing: A population withering nearly decade chronic hunger, people so weakened malnutrition that cold and stomach flu quickly turn lethal, future generation irretrievably lost. Now last we have hard fact situation is very grave, said Judith Cheng-Hopkins, regional director Asia World Food Program, which ha taken part research. To me this is famine slow motion. People cope year year, and probably lot drop off. But totality is very hard gauge. For three week this fall, crew led foreign scientist were finally permitted fan out North Korea conduct first random sample nutritional survey child, providing far most solid data crisis. They found that 62 percent child 7 had stunted growth, symptom long-term malnutrition. Thirty percent 1-year-olds suffered moderate severe malnutrition. This mean high likelihood impaired mental and physical development, because nervous system matures dramatically this essential first year. The researcher said that available scientific data suggest that 10 year ago, malnutrition wa rare North Korea. Even if situation improves, it is unlikely improve degree that country will fully recover what we saw, said Judit Katona-Apte, senior program adviser World Food Program. People will be small and not well developed otherwise and somewhat limited their mental capacity. Likewise, when Red Cross representative this year tested water supply 840 hospital and clinic where they operate, they found that not one had water that wa suitable human consumption, said Sten Swedlund, head Red Cross delegation North Korea. But course they drink it they have no choice, he said recent trip Beijing. There is very close relationship problem caused lack food and health sector that's very bad shape. Virtually all child 7 who are malnourished also have diarrhea, he said. None aid group ha been able study issue hunger-related death, and North Koreans have not released relevant figure, although most expert agree that probably more one million and perhaps many three million have died prematurely food shortage began. But public health expert say number who have perished might be difficult tally any case, because most death were probably not quick starvation, immune system weakened year hunger, so that common cold more easily give way lethal pneumonia and ordinary bout infectious diarrhea prof fatal. Still, there are some disturbing clues: In one limited study conducted World Food Program and other group last year 4,000 child hand-picked government, 10 percent had parent who wa dead. In this fall's independent nutritional survey, 18 team expert sent eight North Korea's nine province looked 1,800 rural and urban child seven. In addition finding that 62 percent child had stunted growth, team found that 16 percent child were suffering acute malnutrition and were underweight their height, sign that they were severely underfed time study. That figure is higher any country East Asia and put North Korea world's worst 10 country term malnutrition. While that 16 percent figure is not quite bad that India and Bangladesh, worst world 18 percent malnutrition rate, expert say that North Korea's number some way understates problem. In India and Bangladesh, pocket severe poverty alternate pocket relative plenty, while North Korea whole country is some degree underfed. Even war-torn country, famine is more pocket, Dr. Katona-Apte said. It's hard think another country that's been affected this way. The survey result are especially sobering researcher studied only child 7, group that received nearly all food donated abroad. After three year food donation, many foreign aid worker country have remarked that child nursery and kindergarten are looking better that their older sibling are failing. So month ago, World Food Program began providing elementary school high nutrition biscuit child aged 7 12. We have reason believe that many people are suffering and that elderly are neglected age group that is just getting weaker and weaker, Swedlund said. There are now more 100 Westerners living Pyongyang, capital city, and many say long-term hunger is readily apparent there. If you walk street Pyongyang and ask child how old she is, you are three year, Swedlund said. She may be 7 she look just 3 or 4. Dr. Katona-Apte, nutrition expert who ha worked Bangladesh and Sudan, said she wa shocked when she first visited North Korean kindergarten last year. There were these two child sitting desk who were obviously severely malnourished they were so thin and they had patchy hair, she said. And they were just sitting there working. This is accepted normal! They are school, and they should really be hospitalized or placed nutritional rehabilitation. If you saw them refugee camp, you would recommend immediate intervention. But severely depleted public health and hospital system, that option doe not exist, she and said. Many Korean doctor do not know how diagnose or treat malnutrition; few had seen it this decade. And, any case, hospital lack food and proper nutritional supplement. Swedlund said most hospital lacked medicine, had no glass replace broken window and were colder out, having received no coal 1994. He said that hospital, sanitation and water purification system were virtually nonexistent, because country lack chlorine purification and fuel run water pump. He said that next year, Red Cross would start address those problem, spending $3.5 food hospital patient and $1 million water treatment. With few other option, vast number North Koreans have resorted eating substitute food, hard cake and noodle made mix nutritional plant, soybean and sweet potato, combined indigestible filler, cornstalk and straw. This now constitutes 40 percent food intake, Swedlund said. It's becoming regular part food basket. Doctors North Korea say many people suffer stomachache eating this partly indigestible material, he said, added, If you're very hungry, it fill your stomach. Although North Koreans date their food problem series flood and drought mid-1990's, foreign researcher who have worked North Korea say medical record and childhood growth pattern indicate that hunger began several year that and is linked collapse Soviet Union, which had long been North Korea's main supplier food, fuel and fertilizer. North Korea is mountainous country, le 20 percent arable land. It ha been food importer decade, mostly former Soviet Union, also China. The country ha come grip fact that this is part structural problem and can't just be blamed weather anymore, Ms. Cheng-Hopkins said. Still, she and praised normally rigid and secretive government slowly loosening it restriction. Swedlund said that three year country, international Red Cross, which collaborates North Korean Red Cross, had found official increasingly responsive and doctor more willing share medical record and bring problem. Travel is still restricted. There are more 100 county, home 30 percent population, which aid group have no access and where they have therefore refused provide food or medical supply. Still, number county open worker ha increased steadily, and freedom move ha improved. Ms. Cheng-Hopkins said half follow-up inspection were now unannounced, and she noted that researcher nutritional survey were allowed select village visit and enter home random. Workers Red Cross and World Food Program said they had not observed extreme scene people dying acute starvation and believe that they would have if they were occurring frequently. I have not seen acute starvation I have seen Bangladesh, Dr. Katona-Apte said. But that doesn't mean it can't exist. We're still really limited what we can see. Swedlund said it wa unlikely that county still closed foreigner were markedly different open one. And while some have surmised that closed county might harbor pocket death and devastation, he said he accepted North Korea's explanation that they had been excluded some area national security reason. One thing I've learned is how important national security issue are North Koreans, said Swedlund, retired admiral Swedish Navy. And I really think these area are important that standpoint, he added, going map closed area and describing what Western intelligence expert know military installation there. He also rejected notion that North Korean military is stealing donated food, charge leveled organization Doctors Without Borders, when it angrily pulled out North Korea last summer protest many restriction group working there. Now that aid group say they are starting get somewhat better cooperation North Koreans, they hope repeat their nutrition survey every 6 12 month. And they are still analyzing some tantalizing findings: Boys were twice likely suffer stunted growth girl, and every child whose mother wa dead wa malnourished.

In Chinese criminal code, this charge come grab-bag section called threatening state security, which make almost any political activity that question or hamper authority Communist Party illegal, violent or nonviolent activity aimed overthrowing government authority, activity designed change basic nature state.

In last six month they have become increasingly aggressive and defiant their attempt register party government, submitting repeated application local authority had declared concept opposition party illegal. They say Chinese Constitution doe not specifically forbid formation new political party, although there have been no new party founding People's Republic 1949.

With attorney locked up, harassed or plain scared, two prominent dissident will defend themselves charge subversion Thursday China's highest-profile dissident trial two year. Qin Yongmin's and Wang Youcai's family were running out option Wednesday help pair, leading organizer budding opposition political party. Qin's family pleaded postponement Wuhan's Intermediate People's Court, court official denied request. Police have detained one lawyer and threatened another, and subtler pressure have been used others, family member said. Given interference, Wang Youcai's wife assumes he will be convicted. Whether he ha lawyer or not, he say, government ha already decided, Hu Jiangxia said. Qin and Wang will be tried separately, city 500 kilometer (300 mile) apart and proceeding attended only family and few observer selected court. Qin, 44, and Wang, 31, are accused inciting subversion state power, apparently helping organize China Democracy Party. They face 10 year life imprisonment if convicted harshest aspect law.

To prevent display solidarity Wang's trial, police have detained least ten dissident eastern city Hangzhou, Hong Kong-based right group reported. The Information Center Human Rights and Democratic Movement China said many more are missing and believed be custody. To prosecute Wang, authority violated minimal right guaranteed suspect Chinese law and ignored court order, his wife said. Even judge asked me hire lawyer, while I wa doing this, some people were doing thing stop me, Hu Jiangxia said. During one meeting potential defense attorney, police official stormed and said, `Don't do anything them. Don't take this case. Whoever take case, you can't win,' Hu recounted. Four law firm refused take Qin's case, his brother Qin Xiaoguang said.

24,"This is what Newt Gingrich is supposed do well. The planning. The strategy. The big picture. The vision. His vision brought GOP majority Congress 1994 and made him first Republican House Speaker 40 year. But his admission, Gingrich's vision seems have blurred this time around, costing Republicans net five seat Tuesday's election and leaving party's narrow governing majority narrower. The disappointing election result also left Gingrich open fractious challenge his post speaker. Members and aide said Wednesday that fury speaker had bubbled overnight and that some member were trying organize slate candidate replace Gingrich and his leadership team when House Republicans convene Nov. 18 select their leader next year. As Rep. Mark Sanford, R-S.C., put it, When company's stock price go down, it's CEO who get fired. Top Republican aide, speaking anonymously, were blunter. People were very angry last night, one aide said. Today it's mixture seething and dismay. It's just ugly. And Newt know it. His career is line. Another aide said, Most people are really angry Newt, and no one know what do it. But some are dipping their toe water and seeing what temperature is. A possible slate could contain name Reps. Robert L. Livingston Louisiana replace Gingrich, Steve Largent Oklahoma replace Dick Armey Texas majority leader, and Jennifer Dunn Washington replace John A. Boehner Ohio conference chairman. Rep. David M. McIntosh Indiana is also said be run speaker, it wa not clear whether he would be part any slate. Rep. Tom DeLay Texas, majority whip, wa said be secure. Armey bluntly acknowledged scramble going wing oust leadership. Told Nightline that there were Republicans his head, Armey replied: They're welcome it if they're big enough take it. Publicly, Gingrich ha expressed confidence keeping his job speaker. But he ha been grim-faced last 24 hour and closeted himself Wednesday his top strategist making call shore his support member. He look victim accident, said Rep. Peter King, R-N.Y., who support Gingrich. He's very somber tone. The question, it always is Gingrich, is how many member are prepared rebel his leadership. In past, no more couple dozen member have openly expressed their dissatisfaction him, and coup attempt last year fizzled lack support. I'm hoping more people will understand need serious reassessment this year, said Rep. Charles T. Canady, R-Fla., who said he had hoped challenge speaker 1996 election, when Republicans also lost seat. The reality is this: Our majority keep shrinking, Canady said. If it shrink any more, it will be gone. But Gingrich ha built support moderate, and some perceived election repudiation conservative. Rep. Sherwood L. Boehlert, R-Utah, said result showed that this wa right direction party. To maintain our majority, we've got moderate some our view, Boehlert said. Thomas Mann, Congressional scholar Brookings Institution, said that moderate supported Gingrich part because no appealing alternative had emerged. They know he see broader world and is prepared moderate if it make sense, Mann said. Newt's gone out his way support moderate. He's nurtured relationship them. But Mann and said that anger ha been building Gingrich several reason, including his signing budget deal last month that seemed capitulate President Clinton, not offering clear legislative agenda Republicans and not communicating clear political message. We are most defined who we hate said Rep. Mark Souder, R-Ind. But voter are more sophisticated that, and Republicans better have something say where we're going. The anger grew last few day when speaker approved $10-million anti-Clinton advertising campaign that allowed Democrats turn election referendum Gingrich, who ha never been nearly popular public Clinton ha been. As if only slowly absorbing implication loss, speaker seemed unable news conference here Wednesday morning pinpoint why party suffered net drop five seat House. As late Tuesday afternoon, he wa predicting net pickup 10 and 30. Until we look it better, I frankly don't understand all thing that happened yesterday, he said, and I'm not sure anybody else country doe either. But he said Republicans should have maniacally focused basic message cutting tax, saving Social Security and preventing drug abuse, and campaigned aggressively those theme. He contrasted lack focus this year Contract With America that proved so successful 1994. People thought we stood something pretty big, he said. But Gingrich also seemed aware mounting concern his leadership, repeatedly casting election result victory his leadership team because Republicans had stayed majority three election row first time 70 year. He also suggested that those who would challenge him have little support. The people who normally are quoted this are people who would fact take party narrower base, Gingrich said, referring periodic eruption concern conservative his leadership. I'd see who it wa that had plan that they were confident last 60 day would have been more successful and why they didn't share it. An intense struggle control House is underway, Rep. Bob Livingston conducting telephone campaign replace Rep. Newt Gingrich speaker and Gingrich fighting counter-campaign that ha given some member pause ousting him. At same time, small band Republicans vowed Thursday that they would not vote re-elect Gingrich any circumstance, move that, because Republicans' shrunken House majority, could tie party knot month because it could throw speakership Democrat. Rep. Matt Salmon, R-Ariz., said: I personally have made decision that I cannot vote Newt Gingrich speaker January, and there are six who have told me they feel same way, seven people who just will not, and it take six deadlock vote. Fury speaker ha boiled Tuesday's election, when Republicans suffered net loss five seat House. They blamed Gingrich, party's chief strategist. But many were already angry him what they said wa his failure articulate clear message party going election and messy budget process that gave President Clinton political edge and contradicted Republican principle fiscal conservativism containing massive amount pork spending. House Republicans are meet Nov. 18 vote secret ballot their leader. Whoever win party's nomination speaker then stand election full House January. Even if Gingrich win secret ballot, he could be denied re-election speaker January if Salmon and least five refuse vote him. Because Republicans now control House only 12 seat, it would take just six vote Gingrich deny him majority and allow Democrats potentially elect one their speaker. With such chaotic and unacceptable prospect looming, Livingston told Gingrich that he should step aside good party, according Republican official. The official said that Livingston spoke Gingrich shortly disastrous election return also election, reflecting Livingston's earlier displeasure speaker budget process. Several Republicans said that Livingston, chairman Appropriations Committee and one few member stature stand speaker, and Gingrich were working phone Thursday struggle vote. Livingston ha said nothing publicly challenge Gingrich, several member and aide said Thursday that he would announce his intention, possibly soon Friday, he had determined if he could win. He won't do it 'til he ha his duck row, and right now lot people are still loyal speaker, said aide Republican who, many others, is trying straddle line fealty speaker who may retain power and encouragement challenger who offer salve embattled party. Stunned Democratic resurgence mid-term election, congressional Republicans tore each other Wednesday who wa blame their failure make traditional opposition party gain off-year election. The soul-searching and recrimination and possibility congressional leadership challenge came election result showed that Republicans had been unable increase their 55-45 hold Senate and that Democrats had picked five seat House. The Democratic surge marked first time 1934 that president's party had gained seat midterm election, and it whittled Republican House majority mere six vote. The Democratic victory were more remarkable political year marked months-long scandal President Clinton's affair Monica Lewinsky. The Republicans' new 223-211 majority (assuming Democrat leading Oregon hold win), one independent, amounted smallest congressional majority Republican-controlled Congress 1953, last time Republicans controlled House they captured it again 1994. With attention now shifting House Judiciary Committee and it impeachment inquiry, Rep. Henry Hyde told fellow Republicans panel conference call Wednesday that only witness Republicans were likely call would be independent counsel, Kenneth Starr. Hyde, chairman, told lawmaker he hoped have committee vote possible article impeachment Thanksgiving, act that would take issue out his hand and put it Gingrich's. Committee Democrats declined comment Wednesday they could discus Hyde's plan themselves. Trying put best face result, Speaker Newt Gingrich said Marietta, Ga., that Republicans still held House three election row first time election 1932. But furious rank and file Republicans burned phone line each other, discussing whether mount leadership challenge chamber next few week. We've got reach out and have more southern white male running Washington Republican Party, said Rep. Joe Scarborough, conservative Florida. He said that Republicans this year had been left any accomplishment run on. We need agenda first all, he said. We went entire calendar year agenda. Rep. Chris Shays, moderate Connecticut called election devastating loss and said simply, There are going be major change our leadership. All segment our party want see change. At White House, Clinton called election result vindication his party's policy. If you look all result, he said, they are clear and unambiguous. The American people want their business, their concern, their child, their family, their future addressed here. That's what messag e election wa. One first difficult question now facing Congress is how proceed impeachment inquiry face public resistance removing Clinton office, and Republican majority now so slim that it is almost certain that 218 vote required impeachment cannot be assembled. In public statement released Wednesday, Hyde said The Committee continues have clear constituional duty complete it work fair and expeditious manner. Our duty ha not changed becasue constitution ha not changed. But Sen. Robert Torricelli, D-N.J., said election result guaranteed that impeachment will fail. I think any serious effort remove President Clinton office is effectively over, he said. It is simply Newt Gingrich and Trent Lott decide exit strategy. From other side aisle, Rep. Rick Lazio, Long Island Republican, said, The inquiry should be wrapped expeditiously, fairly and it ought be resolved immediate future. For year, Republicans struggled keep control House 228-207 majority and find consensus their party's competing faction. With their number reduced, Republican leadership will need carry out tortuous balancing act unite hard-core conservative faction that want more aggressive social agenda bloc moderate who want their party return center. Any small Republican faction will now have enormous leverage. The new arithmetic House may lead Democrats' and moderate Republicans' forming ad hoc majority issue, taking control away Republican leader. Already seeing some possibility, Rep. Peter King Long Island, N.Y., said northeastern Republicans would be strengthened. It give u much more leverage leadership and make it easier protect New York, he said. It's going weaken position strident conservative and anti-northeast conservative. Just two week ago, Gingrich had foreseen election gain ranging 10 seat more 40. Seeming uncharacteristically uncertain Wednesday, he said he had trouble accounting result. Things were happening out there that none u fully understand--neither party my judgment, he said. Taking his share blame his party's loss, Georgia Republican said he had misjudged how public would recoil Clinton scandal amplified modern medium world and how scandal would drown out other Republican theme. I mean I totally underestimated degree which people would just get sick 24-hour-a day talk television and talk radio and then degree which this whole scandal became just sort disgusting sheer repetition, he said. And result I think we probably underestimated need really aggressively push much stronger message cutting tax and saving Social Security, winning war drug, reforming education and national defense. Majority Leader Sen. Trent Lott Mississippi also admitted mistake, saying his party had not presented clear enough message final 96 hour campaign. He also conceded that Congress' final scramble pas $500 billion budget bill hurt his party. One this lesson Republicans out this is that we need listen more carefully people and we need have clear understanding and concise message that we do apply nation, he said Washington. Both Lott and Gingrich said Republicans would put emphasis next year tax-cutting and shoring Social Security system. Even two leader spoke, their angry rank-and-file lawmaker were making phone call trying ass whether mount challenge Republican leader who have steered Congress Republican's assumed control four year ago. One senior Republican staffer said House had become tinderbox intrigue. Scarborough said, The long distance charge Washington office probably are going roof today. Everybody's calling everybody. Everybody recognizes that something's terribly wrong direction Washington Republicans when Republican governor are doing so well New York, Massachusetts, Florida and Texas. And while Gingrich ha not gone out his way identify himself Republican campaign's last-minute ad blitz attacking President Clinton, his caucus know he is responsible. Gingrich ha faced uprising before, foiling coup attempt him disgruntled conservative and some his leadership team summer 1997. Any move remove him remains long-shot. But House leadership election now set mid-November, Republicans said this time dissatisfaction their caucus had crossed ideological line moderate Shays well. We got shellacked, said Rep. Christopher Cannon, conserative Utah. We beat ourselves because we had no agenda. Republicans were discussing possible challenge Gingrich, his second-in-command, Rep. Dick Armey, and other member senior leadership team. Some were envisioning trying run entire new ticket headed Rep. Bob Livingston, Appropriations Committee chairman Louisiana and including Rep. Steve Largent, Oklahoma conservative. Asked whether Tuesday's election result could cost him speakership, Gingrich said, I'm not particularly concerned. Republicans close him said they expected anger dissipate. In Senate, where leadership race take place early December, some Republicans were talking mounting challenge mid-level leadership figure. Several senator expressed particular pique re-election chairman, Senator Mitch McConnell Kentucky, who poured party dollar and much his time trying defeat Democratic champion campaign finance overhaul, Russell Feingold Wisconsin. Feingold won close race. Some lawmaker Wednesday approached Sen. Chuck Hagel Nebraska see if he would replace McConnell. Hagel confirmed he had talked more eight senator, and wa whether challenge McConnell. Hagel lambasted Republican leadership election outcome. This is big loss u, he said. We squandered very historic opportunity last night. To just break is loss. Most incumbent coasted victory Tuesday night. But some will not be returning. Five House Republicans were defeated: Vince Snowbarger Kansas, Bill Redmond New Mexico, Jon Fox Pennsylvania, Mike Pappas New Jersey, and Rick White Washington. One Democrat also lost his re-election bid Rep. Jay Johnson Wisconsin. The new House member include 17 Republicans and least 22 Democrats. David Wu, Democrat wa leading Molly Bordonaro, Republican race one House seat Oregon, final victory announcement wa not expected Friday absentee ballot are counted. Unlike self-proclaimed revolutionary Republican class 1994, many newly elected member are career politician who rose rank local and state government. Three Democrats are son former lawmaker, Mark Udall Colorado, son Morris Udall who represented Arizona; Tom Udall New Mexico, son other Udall brother, Stewart, former Congressman and Secretary Interior, and Charlie Gonzalez, who o won Texas seat his father, Henry.

He also conceded that Congress' final scramble pas $500 billion budget bill hurt his party. One this lesson Republicans out this is that we need listen more carefully people and we need have clear understanding and concise message that we do apply nation, he said Washington. Both Lott and Gingrich said Republicans would put emphasis next year tax-cutting and shoring Social Security system. Even two leader spoke, their angry rank-and-file lawmaker were making phone call trying ass whether mount challenge Republican leader who have steered Congress Republican's assumed control four year ago. One senior Republican staffer said House had become tinderbox intrigue. Scarborough said, The long distance charge Washington office probably are going roof today. Everybody's calling everybody. Everybody recognizes that something's terribly wrong direction Washington Republicans when Republican governor are doing so well New York, Massachusetts, Florida and Texas. And while Gingrich ha not gone out his way identify himself Republican campaign's last-minute ad blitz attacking President Clinton, his caucus know he is responsible. Gingrich ha faced uprising before, foiling coup attempt him disgruntled conservative and some his leadership team summer 1997. Any move remove him remains long-shot. But House leadership election now set mid-November, Republicans said this time dissatisfaction their caucus had crossed ideological line moderate Shays well. We got shellacked, said Rep. Christopher Cannon, conservative Utah. We beat ourselves because we had no agenda. Republicans were discussing possible challenge Gingrich, his second-in-command, Rep. Dick Armey, and other member senior leadership team. Some were envisioning trying run entire new ticket headed Rep. Bob Livingston, Appropriations Committee chairman Louisiana and including Rep. Steve Largent, Oklahoma conservative. Asked whether Tuesday's election result could cost him speakership, Gingrich said, I'm not particularly concerned. Republicans close him said they expected anger dissipate. In Senate, where leadership race take place early December, some Republicans were talking mounting challenge mid-level leadership figure. Several senator expressed particular pique re-election chairman, Senator Mitch McConnell Kentucky, who poured party dollar and much his time trying defeat Democratic champion campaign finance overhaul, Russell Feingold Wisconsin. Feingold won close race. Some lawmaker Wednesday approached Sen. Chuck Hagel Nebraska see if he would replace McConnell. Hagel confirmed he had talked more eight senator, and wa whether challenge McConnell. Hagel lambasted Republican leadership election outcome. This is big loss u, he said. We squandered very historic opportunity last night. To just break is loss. Most incumbent coasted victory Tuesday night. But some will not be returning. Five House Republicans were defeated: Vince Snowbarger Kansas, Bill Redmond New Mexico, Jon Fox Pennsylvania, Mike Pappas New Jersey, and Rick White Washington. One Democrat also lost his re-election bid Rep. Jay Johnson Wisconsin. The new House member include 17 Republicans and least 22 Democrats. David Wu, Democrat wa leading Molly Bordonaro, Republican race one House seat Oregon, final victory announcement wa not expected Friday absentee ballot are counted. Unlike self-proclaimed revolutionary Republican class 1994, many newly elected member are career politician who rose rank local and state government. Three Democrats are son former lawmaker, Mark Udall Colorado, son Morris Udall who represented Arizona; Tom Udall New Mexico, son other Udall brother, Stewart, former congressman and secretary Interior, and Charlie Gonzalez, who won Texas seat his father, Henry. A week White House and congressional Democrats disavowed his war Speaker Newt Gingrich, James Carville, President Clinton's former campaign strategist and chief defender, put forth new battle cry Wednesday: He will not be muzzled. Not only that, Carville went his customary denunciation Gingrich and Republicans and, interview, trained his fire leader his party not being sufficiently aggressive four week Election Day. My sense frustration is that I believe Democrats have much better chance doing much better anyone expects, Carville said. And I don't think anyone's emerging try pull it together. Everybody ought be pushing, leadership Congress, White House, DNC. We ought hammer Gingrich every day. How can you take Congress back if you don't make case people who are running it? I have never heard strategy that. Sounding increasingly agitated, he went on: The only people left be activated this election are Democrats. The right wing, they're bouncing wall. They're going out vote. Rep. Dick Gephardt, minority leader, complained Erskine Bowles, White House chief staff, Carville appeared NBC News program Meet Press Sept. 27 and declared, Cpl. Cue Ball Carville will be rolling battle Newt Gingrich. The concern House Democrats, one expressed some White House official well, wa that Carville's vitriol would make Democrats appear overly partisan and could be especially damaging Democrats marginal district who do not want appear too easy president. But Wednesday, Carville wa anything timid. If Gephardt people think they've quieted me down, he said, I'm not quieted. Carville said he told official White House, Don't waste your breath calling me and telling me not say this. Carville insisted that he would rather do battle Republicans his fellow Democrats. If they want fight me, they can, he said. I'm going fight Republicans. Yet he could not help ridicule his party. Asked describe Democrats' strategy election, Carville said, If there is one, no one's shared it me. Just four year ago, it wa good bet that Newt Gingrich would be pivotal figure US. politics turn millennium. Seemingly overnight he had taken moribund minority party and turned it pumped-up, issue-driven House majority. With promise balance budget, end welfare and represent more conservative social value, he appeared have rearranged political map Congress just Ronald Reagan had done presidency. But Gingrich's leadership is now so shaky that if he maintains his hold speaker's office, he is danger marginalization. A change this dramatic suggests something far more profound miscalculation election tactic. What looked one major realignments US. political history might turn out have been nothing temporary shift. The Gingrich revolution wa fueled anger, revolt white working-class Americans what they perceived Democratic bias favor black and other minority, and middle-class rejection politics big government and big deficit. They were same resentment that Ronald Reagan had exploited so successfully. But old political habit and moribund Republican leadership allowed Democrats retain control Congress throughout 1980s, and turned Reagan's economic program undisciplined tax-cutting spree that created prosperity huge budget gap. Gingrich's attention-grabbing rhetoric, energy and talent political organization finally took Reagan's formula success congressional election 1994. But once power, he ran head Bill Clinton, whose political instinct were better. The president co-opted part Contract With America, particularly balanced budget and welfare reform. He adapted Republican social message call thing school uniform and television rating system, which symbolized more responsibility and parental control supporting government intrusion private life. The Republican right's genuine contempt Clinton wa based part well-known flaw president's character. But it wa mainly reaction ease which he had diverted what wa supposed be flood tide their revolution. They expected that genuine success Gingrich's first year office would lead still larger victory minimal government and tax, unfettered free enterprise and return conservative Christian value. But public wa happy be led another direction, and focus concern aging baby boomer health care and Social Security. The government that wa seen enemy when issue were budgetary once again looked potential ally. Back 1994, party were so stunned sudden change their congressional fortune that they may have overestimated what it all meant. In particular they may not have realized how quickly good economic time, drop crime and national welfare reform could blunt power race US. politics. The Democrats had become literally minority party white voter resentfully identified their policy city, black and immigrant. But last week union worker and Catholics returned Democratic fold. Without race wedge issue, solid black Democratic vote became powerful advantage key state. Blacks, woman and Latinos angry Republican anti-immigration initiative were winning coalition California, North Carolina and New York. The speaker wa right say this wa not election we expected. There may indeed be Republican majority America, it appears resemble Republicanism Dwight Eisenhower rather Newt Gingrich pro-business, wary debt and inherent distaste bringing messy social issue abortion. The Republicans who have begun talking compassionate conservatism and politics inclusion may be peddling political mush, they peddled it victory Tuesday. The congressional Republican Party's long sojourn wilderness House minority may have left it too accustomed opposition figure out what it can be for, and too attached politics anger make sense nation mood moderation. Gingrich ha suggested that his mistake wa let Republicans drift politics impeachment when they should have been almost maniacally focused thing tax cut. But looking maniacal is what got them trouble first place. Winning control Congress so many year wa very tough Gingrich 1994. But it will be ten time tougher forge politics that doe not depend rage. House Speaker Newt Gingrich, who orchestrated Republican revolution recent year and is overseeing impeachment inquiry President Clinton, wa driven office Friday party that swiftly turned him it unexpected loss Tuesday's midterm election. Catching virtually everyone Capitol Hill surprise, Gingrich announced Friday night two conference call other Republicans that he would not seek re-election Speaker Nov. 18 vote and would leave Congress altogether when his term expires January. This will give u chance purge some poison that is system, Gingrich said, according party aide who listened one call. Gingrich's resignation wa stunning reversal one most combative and personally confrontational politician America. He made his name decade ago bringing one Democratic speaker, Jim Wright, and continued his assaultive style Tuesday's election last-minute commercial reminding voter Clinton scandal. His reflexive pugilistic response wa evident Friday night. In his second conference call, according several people who listened, Gingrich blamed House conservative his downfall. Although it wa their revolutionary zeal he harnessed take control Congress 1994, they have become his most bitter critic last two year his tumultuous speakership. Friday night he called them cannibal who had blackmailed him quitting. Rep. Michael P. Forbes, R-N.Y., said: Newt said all those who had marginalized Republican Party had engaged cannibalism. He said, `Refer clips.' He's blaming others. Another Republican described conference call this way: He started very statesmanlike, then you could see anger building. When someone asked him why he wa leaving, he said, `A handful member have blackmailed conference.' He said, `They're hateful.' And he said, `They're cannibals.' Gingrich announced his move just hour Rep. Robert L. Livingston Louisiana announced he wa running speaker, putting himself forward pragmatist and manager. After Gingrich call, Rep. Bill Archer Texas announced he wa his run speaker. Livingston and Archer are chairman two most powerful committee House. In statement Gingrich said, The Republican conference need be unified, and it is time me move forward. He said he hoped his colleague would pick successor who can reconcile and discipline, who can work together and communicate effectively. Referring his wife, he told his colleague he wa resigning Congress because Marianne and I are tired. We need time get know each other again. He also acknowledged his knack bringing negative attention himself and his party. If I stay, he told his colleague Friday night, my controversial nature would overshadow any success we might have, understatement those who recalled his suggestion two year ago that he forced shutdown government because he wa miffed having sit back Air Force One trip President Clinton. According another Republican who took note, Gingrich said his resignation: There is lot bitterness amongst some member. So long I am around, I will always be target news medium, which would mean we would never be able get our message out. Clinton said: Newt Gingrich ha been worthy adversary leading Republican Party majority House and joining me great national debate how best prepare America 21st century. Despite our profound difference, I appreciate those time we were able work together national interest, especially Speaker Gingrich's strong support America's continuing leadership freedom, peace and prosperity world. Many Republicans took opportunity portray Gingrich visionary. Rep. Sherwood Boehlert New York said that first conference call, there wa shock and surprise and strong expression appreciation leading u Promised Land. His supporter said Gingrich had vote win election nominate speaker, which is be conducted secret ballot. But, they agreed, party's slim, six-vote majority meant every vote would be battle. Kenneth Duberstein, former official Reagan administration, said, I have no doubt he had vote be speaker, I'm not sure he had vote govern. He said that because deep rift party, Gingrich would not have been able implement his plan. In unusually biting reaction, Rep. Dick Gephardt Missouri, Democratic leader, said he hoped that Gingrich's resignation would clear fierce partisan air that he had fostered. I hope that whoever succeeds Newt Gingrich speaker will immediately begin process repairing damage that wa wrought this institution last four year, Gephardt said. House Republicans predicted that Gingrich's resignation would set more wide-ranging and hectic scramble replace him had been anticipated. There will be lot pretender throne who will test water, said Boehlert, who had supported Gingrich re-election speaker. There won't be any shortage candidate. The presidential campaign 2000 began Wednesday, it or not. The millennial election will be fought political playing field whose rough outline, if not it exact boundary, were drawn voter Tuesday's election, which delivered crushing disappointment giddy hope Republicans and unexpected elixir recently ailing Democrats. President Clinton called it astonishing triumph issue investigation and said Democrats had won so many major victory because they had clear message. Republicans agreed. Of course next 18 month will bring many surprise and many reversal fortune. But election result offered important guideline. Tuesday wa great day Vice President Al Gore, least three reason. He worked furiously and successfully last ten day balloting persuade Democratic loyalist not stay home and sulk, appearing behalf no fewer 224 candidate, according his office. A moderate spectrum his party, he watched moderate win crucial election, notably California gubernatorial race, where Lt. Gov. Gray Davis, cautious pragmatist Gore, won smashing victory. The return break Senate and Democratic gain five House Representatives also made impeachment President Clinton le likely. And better shape Clinton is his term end, better chance Gore, his sidekick six year now, stand presidential nomination process and, ultimately, election. But California voter also complicated nominating process and set Gore strategist work tactic uncomplicate it, because he and they consider state absolutely central his presidential aspiration. In referendum 1996, California adopted primary system which Republicans, Democrats and independent voter would all receive same ballot, candidate all party listed. That violates rule major party, and measure ballot Tuesday, Proposition 3, would have rescinded 1996 change. But it failed, raising possibility that California's March 7 primary will be mere political popularity poll, convention delegate chosen caucus or convention nightmare. Tuesday wa bad day Republican right. High-profile right-winger lost country, Attorney General Dan Lungren California governor's race Sen. Lauch Faircloth, denied re-election North Carolina, Rep. Mark Neumann Wisconsin, who failed Senate race huge spending advantage Sen. Russell Feingold, Ellen Sauerbrey Maryland, who proved unable her second try prevail unpopular Democratic governor, Parris Glendening. Both conservative and moderate party said Republicans had get back basic. Even Speaker Newt Gingrich conceded that result should sober every Republican and called new strategic thinking. If you make it referendum president 67 cent approval rating, they tried do, you shouldn't be surprised if election go you, said Gov. Tom Ridge Pennsylvania, moderate whose promoter mention him weekly possible vice-presidential nominee. Sen. John McCain Arizona, conservative who tends steer away divisive social issue, won re-election 68 cent vote. He is studying possibility presidential race, he or any other Republican nominee can hope win, he said interview Wednesday, congressional Republicans and their leader need learn some lesson. I just hope this debacle is wake-up call our people, he said. You've got be something smaller government, better education, something. We're seen party that's everything. Polls taken late this year's campaign bore McCain out. They showed that Republicans are no longer identified issue that were once their electoral bread and butter, such low tax and law and order. Tuesday wa also fresh demonstration, anyone who needed one, political utility pitching tent big enough almost everyone. Black politician North Carolina, Maryland and California reported that their fear indifferent black turnout had proved groundless. Black vote proved indispensable considerable number hard-pressed Democratic candidate, especially where they felt their interest directly threatened. The figure Hispanic voting, assembled exit poll and candidates' precinct analysis, showed dramatic difference. In California, where outgoing Republican governor, Pete Wilson, had played anti-immigration card vengeance, major Democratic candidate Davis and Sen. Barbara Boxer, who won re-election trailing early poll cleaned Hispanic voter. He took 78 percent, she 72. But Bush brother, Jeb Florida and George W. Texas, took more half Hispanic vote their highly successful gubernatorial campaign. So McCain. Jeb Bush is married Hispanic woman, he and his brother speak Spanish fluently and frequently, and Senator McCain ha long espoused Hispanic cause. Both George W. Bush and McCain will draw strength, if they decide run, their proven ability appeal Hispanic voter, well their general electoral strength. George W. Bush took 69 percent vote Texas, where Democrat sat governor's chair only four year ago, and which ha second-largest bloc electoral vote. Florida ha fourth-largest. Governor Bush Texas uttered rallying cry moderate. A leader who is compassionate and conservative, he said his victory speech, can erase gender gap and open Republican party new face and new voice. But figure right saw thing differently. James Dobson, leading religious broadcaster, said that Republicans had fared poorly because Gingrich and Sen. Trent Lott Mississippi, majority leader, had caved president budget and de-emphasized social issue such abortion and flag desecration. He called all explicitly ouster Gingrich. Likewise, millionaire publisher Steve Forbes, another probable candidate 2000, said leadership will have lot answer for. Tuesday proved potency education issue, and suggested that it will emerge major theme 2000 campaign. Clinton, his limited involvement campaign, and Gore, his extensive participation, stressed Democratic program build more school and hire more teacher. Almost quarter California voter and there are now almost twice many voter California any other state named education their most pressing concern. Elsewhere, Democrats won governorship Alabama and South Carolina odds, partly emphasizing their rivals' opposition lottery that will help pay school. In Iowa, Democrat wa elected governor first time 1969 platform that featured dilapidated condition state's school and promise remedy it. Tuesday demonstrated overriding importance money modern American politics. Feingold, one principal backer campaign-finance reform, survived fight another day, so opponent reform. And return House race, showing that all six 401 member who sought re-election had won, underlined once again how hard it is, present system, challenger raise enough money compete effectively. The difficulty raising money may doom many would-be presidential candidacy. Gore will have what he need, will Bush, Forbes and former Gov. Lamar Alexander Tennessee. But how many will? Finally, Tuesday delivered indecisive message impeachment. Close two-thirds voter nationwide told exit pollster that they intended send no message Clinton, they made it clear response other question that they disliked House inquiry president's alleged misdeed and wanted see it end. In only two state, Kansas and Nebraska, majority voter say they favored congressional censure Clinton, much milder form punishment advocated many Clinton backer. Some Republicans said privately that there should be no hearing all Clinton matter, and some Democrats began talking deal, equivalent plea bargain that would bring matter early close. Nevertheless, Republican member House Judiciary Committee said they needed press ahead Constitutional process that House ha set motion. Among those taking that view were Rep. Bob Barr Georgia, fierce foe president, and Rep. Mary Bono California, whose tone ha been more muted. But Rep. David Dreier California, incoming Rules Committee chairman, said that election ha played role ensuring that one u ha desire drag that out. Stunned Democratic resurgence mid-term election, congressional Republicans tore each other Wednesday who wa blame their failure make traditional opposition party gain off-year election. The soul-searching and recrimination and possibility congressional leadership challenge came election result showed that Republicans had been unable increase their 55-45 hold Senate and that Democrats had picked five seat House. The Democratic surge marked first time 1934 that president's party had gained seat midterm election, and it whittled Republican House majority mere six vote. The Democratic victory were more remarkable political year marked months-long scandal President Clinton's affair Monica Lewinsky. The Republicans' new 223-211 majority (assuming Democrat leading Oregon hold win), one independent, amounted smallest congressional majority Republican-controlled Congress 1953, last time Republicans controlled House they captured it again 1994. With attention now shifting House Judiciary Committee and it impeachment inquiry, Rep. Henry Hyde told fellow Republicans panel conference call Wednesday that only witness Republicans were likely call would be independent counsel, Kenneth Starr. Hyde, chairman, told lawmaker he hoped have committee vote possible article impeachment Thanksgiving, act that would take issue out his hand and put it Gingrich's. Committee Democrats declined comment Wednesday they could discus Hyde's plan themselves. Trying put best face result, Speaker Newt Gingrich said Marietta, Ga., that Republicans still held House three election row first time election 1932. But furious rank and file Republicans burned phone line each other, discussing whether mount leadership challenge chamber next few week. We've got reach out and have more southern white male running Washington Republican Party, said Rep. Joe Scarborough, conservative Florida. He said that Republicans this year had been left any accomplishment run on. We need agenda first all, he said. We went entire calendar year agenda. Rep. Chris Shays, moderate Connecticut called election devastating loss and said simply, There are going be major change our leadership. All segment our party want see change. At White House, Clinton called election result vindication his party's policy. If you look all result, he said, they are clear and unambiguous. The American people want their business, their concern, their child, their family, their future addressed here. That's what message election wa. One first difficult question now facing Congress is how proceed impeachment inquiry face public resistance removing Clinton office, and Republican majority now so slim that it is almost certain that 218 vote required impeachment cannot be assembled. In public statement released Wednesday, Hyde said The Committee continues have clear constitutional duty complete it work fair and expeditious manner. Our duty ha not changed because constitution ha not changed. But Sen. Robert Torricelli, D-N.J., said election result guaranteed that impeachment will fail. I think any serious effort remove President Clinton office is effectively over, he said. It is simply Newt Gingrich and Trent Lott decide exit strategy. From other side aisle, Rep. Rick Lazio, Long Island Republican, said, The inquiry should be wrapped expeditiously, fairly and it ought be resolved immediate future. For year, Republicans struggled keep control House 228 seat and find consensus their party's competing faction. With their number reduced, Republican leadership will need carry out tortuous balancing act unite hard-core conservative faction that want more aggressive social agenda bloc moderate who want their party return center. The Democrats held 206 seat, and one wa held indepenndent. Any small Republican faction will now have enormous leverage. The new arithmetic House may lead Democrats' and moderate Republicans' forming ad hoc majority issue, taking control away Republican leader. Already seeing some possibility, Rep. Peter King Long Island, N.Y., said northeastern Republicans would be strengthened. It give u much more leverage leadership and make it easier protect New York, he said. It's going weaken position strident conservative and anti-northeast conservative. Just two week ago, Gingrich had foreseen election gain ranging 10 seat more 40. Seeming uncharacteristically uncertain Wednesday, he said he had trouble accounting result. Things were happening out there that none u fully understand--neither party my judgment, he said. Taking his share blame his party's loss, Georgia Republican said he had misjudged how public would recoil Clinton scandal amplified modern medium world and how scandal would drown out other Republican theme. I mean I totally underestimated degree which people would just get sick 24-hour-a day talk television and talk radio and then degree which this whole scandal became just sort disgusting sheer repetition, he said. And result I think we probably underestimated need really aggressively push much stronger message cutting tax and saving Social Security, winning war drug, reforming education and national defense. Majority Leader Sen. Trent Lott Mississippi also admitted mistake, saying his party had not presented clear enough message final 96 hour campaign. He also conceded that Congress' final scramble pas $500 billion budget bill hurt his party. One this lesson Republicans out this is that we need listen more carefully people and we need have clear understanding and concise message that we do apply nation, he said Washington. Both Lott and Gingrich said Republicans would put emphasis next year tax-cutting and shoring Social Security system. Even two leader spoke, their angry rank-and-file lawmaker were making phone call trying ass whether mount challenge Republican leader who have steered Congress Republican's assumed control four year ago. One senior Republican staffer said House had become tinderbox intrigue. Scarborough said, The long distance charge Washington office probably are going roof today. Everybody's calling everybody. Everybody recognizes that something's terribly wrong direction Washington Republicans when Republican governor are doing so well New York, Massachusetts, Florida and Texas. And while Gingrich ha not gone out his way identify himself Republican campaign's last-minute ad blitz attacking President Clinton, his caucus know he is responsible. Gingrich ha faced uprising before, foiling coup attempt him disgruntled conservative and some his leadership team summer 1997. Any move remove him remains long-shot. But House leadership election now set mid-November, Republicans said this time dissatisfaction their caucus had crossed ideological line moderate Shays well. We got shellacked, said Rep. Christopher Cannon, conservative Utah. We beat ourselves because we had no agenda. Republicans were discussing possible challenge Gingrich, his second-in-command, Rep. Dick Armey, and other member senior leadership team. Some were envisioning trying run entire new ticket headed Rep. Bob Livingston, Appropriations Committee chairman Louisiana and including Rep. Steve Largent, Oklahoma conservative. Asked whether Tuesday's election result could cost him speakership, Gingrich said, I'm not particularly concerned. Republicans close him said they expected anger dissipate. In Senate, where leadership race take place early December, some Republicans were talking mounting challenge mid-level leadership figure. Several senator expressed particular pique re-election chairman, Senator Mitch McConnell Kentucky, who poured party dollar and much his time trying defeat Democratic champion campaign finance overhaul, Russell Feingold Wisconsin. Feingold won close race. Some lawmaker Wednesday approached Sen. Chuck Hagel Nebraska see if he would replace McConnell. Hagel confirmed he had talked more eight senator, and wa whether challenge McConnell. Hagel lambasted Republican leadership election outcome. This is big loss u, he said. We squandered very historic opportunity last night. To just break is loss. Most incumbent coasted victory Tuesday night. But some will not be returning. Five House Republicans were defeated: Vince Snowbarger Kansas, Bill Redmond New Mexico, Jon Fox Pennsylvania, Mike Pappas New Jersey, and Rick White Washington. One Democrat also lost his re-election bid Rep. Jay Johnson Wisconsin. The new House member include 17 Republicans and least 22 Democrats. David Wu, Democrat wa leading Molly Bordonaro, Republican race one House seat Oregon, final victory announcement wa not expected Friday absentee ballot are counted. Unlike self-proclaimed revolutionary Republican class 1994, many newly elected member are career politician who rose rank local and state government. Three Democrats are son former lawmaker, Mark Udall Colorado, son Morris Udall who represented Arizona; Tom Udall New Mexico, son other Udall brother, Stewart, former congressman and secretary Interior, and Charlie Gonzalez, who won Texas seat his father, Henry. A struggle control House is way, Rep. Robert Livingston conducting telephone campaign that could lead him running Newt Gingrich speaker. But Gingrich's counter-campaign ha given some member pause ousting him. At same time, small band Republicans vowed Thursday that they would not vote re-elect Gingrich any circumstance, move that, because Republicans' shrunken House majority, could tie party knot month. Rep. Matt Salmon, R-Ariz., said: I personally have made decision that I cannot vote Newt Gingrich speaker January, and there are six who have told me they feel same way, seven people who just will not, and it take six deadlock vote. Fury speaker ha boiled Tuesday's election, when Republicans suffered net loss five seat House. They blamed Gingrich, party's chief strategist. But many were already angry him what they said wa his failure articulate clear message party going election and messy budget process that gave President Clinton political edge and contradicted Republican principle fiscal conservativism containing massive amount spending local project. House Republicans are meet Nov. 18 vote secret ballot their leader. Whoever win Republican nomination speaker must stand election full House January. Even if Gingrich win secret ballot, he could be denied re-election speaker January if Salmon and least five refuse vote him. Because Republicans now control House only 12 seat, it would take just six vote Gingrich deny him majority. With such chaotic and unacceptable prospect looming, Livingston told Gingrich that he should step aside good party, Republican official said. The official said that Livingston spoke Gingrich shortly election return also election, reflecting Livingston's earlier displeasure speaker budget process. Several Republicans said that Livingston, chairman Appropriations Committee and one few member stature stand speaker, and Gingrich were working phone Thursday struggle vote. Livingston ha said nothing publicly challenge Gingrich, several member and aide said Thursday that he would announce his intention, possibly soon Friday, only he had determined if he could win. Rep. Peter King, R-N.Y., wa one several member who spoke Livingston Thursday. He told me he's making number phone call, that he's gotten very positive response running speaker, and he'll decide next 48 hour, King said. He won't do it till he ha his duck row, and right now lot people are still loyal speaker, said aide Republican who, many others, is trying straddle line fealty speaker who may retain power and encouragement challenger who offer salve embattled party. Many Republicans immediately blamed Gingrich party's loss Tuesday. Talk quickly emerged next day slate candidate oppose Gingrich and his lieutenant. The list possible candidate leadership position included Rep.e Steve Largent Oklahoma, who talked Livingston Thursday challenging Gingrich, Republican official said, speaking condition that their name not be reported. Those official said that Largent told Livingston that he wanted run him ticket and that he would challenge Rep. Dick Armey, majority leader. But, these official said that if Livingston not challenge Gingrich, Largent would run speaker instead. Other name were floated Wednesday leadership post. They included Reps. David McIntosh Indiana speaker and Jennifer Dunn Washington conference chairman. Added mix Thursday wa name Rep. Christopher Cox, California conservative. As sign uncertainty prevailing House member Thursday, Rep. Henry Hyde, chairman Judiciary Committee and one House's most venerable member, rebuffed chance endorse Gingrich speaker. Hyde said that Gingrich bore responsibility party's loss Tuesday. Leadership take credit when thing go right, he said. They ought take blame when thing go wrong. Asked if Gingrich should remain speaker, Hyde said: I rather think he will, that remains be seen. The energy that many vented publicly Wednesday anger Gingrich seemed devoted Thursday intense internal political calculation whether Livingston could succeed toppling Gingrich and whether he should succeed. While many support him veteran who understands House and ha shown shrewd political skill managing massive federal budget, are reviving image Louisianan hot-head who gave party bad name government shutdown two year ago and who tends arm-flailing heated moment. One conservative leader said that he and his ally had reservation Livingston because he wa obsessed trying keep social issue out budget process. The budget, he said, ha been vehicle conservative year add restriction federal money abortion and other thing you can't get Senate or presidential veto. If Livingston is challenger, I doubt that will cause rallying real conservative Congress. Some moderate said they were prepared support him. Rep. Marge Roukema, R-N.J., said, I would be amenable Livingston. Still, she cautioned, I'm not Newt. But it's wrong not sit and seriously look our option. Ken Johnson, aide Rep. WJ. (Billy) Tauzin, R-La., said that his bos wa emblematic confusion broad base House Republicans. Billy ha been loyal Speaker Gingrich and Dick Armey, and he's still loyal them, he also want hear what they have say committing them next election, Johnson said. Everyone is asking same question: Can we refocus message and re-energize our base re-aligning leadership? Salmon said his refusal support Gingrich no matter what wa based Gingrich's track record one failed strategy another, including impeachment process and pork-laden budget. With challenge way, Gingrich ha been trying show member that he is responsive their concern. After election night which he portrayed Republicans victorious they lost seat, next day he took responsibility loss. In another move, Gingrich ha indicated that he is willing cede control party's congressional campaign committee, allowing whole House select it member. Gingrich is also making strong personal appeal Republicans. Said one top House aide: He'll get support. How much? Only his vote-counters know. ","Speaker of the House Newt Gingrich has announced that he will not seek re-election to the post when the vote comes up on November 18th.He also announced that he would be leaving the House when his current term as Speaker expires in January.This announcement comes on the heels of a poor Republican showing in the mid-term elections.Although the Republicans retained a majority in the House, the Margin of Republican control shrank in the face of Democratic gains.Gingrich had been seen as the man who led the Republicans our of the doldrums into control of the House and the Senate.","Most Democrats, except for former Clinton strategist James Carville, were hesitant to attack Speaker Newt Gingrich as the 1998 elections approached.Republicans were expected to add to their majority in Congress.However, Republicans lost seats in both the House and Senate.Republicans became disenchanted with the Gingrich ""vision"" and blamed him for the losses.An active campaign began to replace Gingrich as Speaker with Louisiana Congressman Robert Livingston as the main actor.After a losing struggle to maintain his position, Gingrich resigned as Speaker.House Republicans then turned their attention to impeachment proceedings of President Clinton.","The 1998 election ended the political career of Newt Gingrich, who had become Speaker in 1994, leading a conservative, issue-driven, GOP majority.In Oct Democrats were urged to go after him.Although both houses retained a narrowed GOP majority, Newt, with his combativeness and Impeachment-fixation, was blamed for the failures by both wings of his party.The 1998 winners were Gore, Clinton, and moderates.Newt's issues seemed dead in the booming economy and old Democratic loyalists ignored Clinton's morals and returned to the fold.As fellow Republicans jockeyed for his positions, Newt resigned as Speaker on Nov 6 and also decided to leave his House seat.","James Carville complained that fellow Democrats didn't join his war against Speaker Newt Gingrich leading up to the congressional elections of 1998.Gingrich had led the impeachment inquiry against President Clinton in the House.When, contrary to all predictions, the Democrats gained five seats in the House and held their own in the Senate, Republicans enlisted in Carville's cause, blaming Gingrich for the election results.Gingrich battled fiercely as Rep. Livingston rallied forces against him, but ultimately Gingrich accepted defeat agreeing to cede the speakership and his seat in the House.He blamed his defeat on blackmail by Republican cannibals."

AOL would also enter joint marketing and development partnership Sun Microsystems strengthen Netscape's other business selling large corporation heavy-duty software needed serve Web page and other Internet technology many thousand user same time. The purchase, exchange AOL share Netscape stock, is valued roughly $4 billion. A completed deal could be announced soon Monday morning. But executive involved talk cautioned Sunday night that some detail remained be negotiated. The Netscape deal, if consummated, would realign three business forefront modern economy on-line service, Internet software and electronic commerce. It would strengthen two Microsoft's leading rival, AOL and Sun Microsystems. At same time, however, it would end independent existence Netscape, Internet software maker once regarded most serious challenger Microsoft's dominance personal computer software market. Netscape, founded 1994, ha struggled last 18 month assault Microsoft. Its Navigator wa runaway leader market browser software used navigate World Wide Web. But Microsoft, responding Internet revolution, entered market aggressively, quickly matching quality Netscape's technology and then bundling Microsoft browser, Internet Explorer, it industry-standard Windows operating system and giving it away free. Eventually, Microsoft's browser technology caught Netscape's. Earlier this year, Netscape announced layoff and started distributing Navigator free well, Microsoft steadily gained browser market. Since then, Netscape ha focused mainly two business advertising and transaction fee it Netcenter Web site and selling industrial-strength software corporation that are building their Internet site which conduct electronic commerce. AOL belief it ha expertise increase revenue Netscape's Web site and, helped Sun's programmer and vast corporate sale force, accelerate Netscape's software sale well, executive involved negotiation said. Among large corporation, Sun's version Unix, Solaris, is most popular operating system powerful computer that run Netscape's server software. The much smaller Netscape would be placed wing AOL and Sun Microsystems. The three company had combined revenue more $12.4 billion last year. Microsoft, comparison, had revenue more $14 billion. This deal would insure that fundamental element Netscape survive bigger company that can drive it technology forward, said David B. Yoffie, professor Harvard business school and co-author Michael A. Cusumano Massachusetts Institute Technology recent book, Competing Internet Time: Lessons Netscape and Its Battle Microsoft. The impact deal, if any, government's antitrust suit Microsoft is uncertain. It doe appear support key theme Microsoft's defense namely, that it operates fast-moving industry where corporate alliance shift all time. Thus, Microsoft argues, antitrust policy should tread gently. But deal, government official insist, should have no direct effect current case. No matter how much alliance shift, it doesn't affect central fact Microsoft's monopoly and how it ha used and abused it market power protect it monopoly, said David Boies, Justice Department's lead trial lawyer Microsoft case. Executives representing Netscape, AOL and Sun Microsystems are government witness Microsoft trial. And serious merger talk Netscape Chief Executive Officer James Barksdale and AOL Chairman Steve Case began month ago, or just start Microsoft trial, according people close talk. Industry analyst suggest that company may have been emboldened take stronger anti-Microsoft step based partly perception that antitrust case would weaken Microsoft. And representative Kleiner Perkins Caufield &AMP; Byers, Silicon Valley venture capital firm regarded power broker Microsoft's rival, sit board Netscape, Sun and AOL. Still, executive involved talk said that timing proposed deal wa unrelated antitrust trial. Nor should it, one person noted, be regarded single-minded attempt circle wagon Microsoft. Indeed, AOL, according one person close talk, plan keep Microsoft's Internet Explorer browser default choice it on-line service. One government's allegation antitrust suit is that Microsoft won out Netscape main browser AOL because Microsoft used it Windows monopoly bargaining chip. To win browser deal, Microsoft offered AOL prime real estate Windows desktop, main screen more 90 percent personal computer sold today. Staying Microsoft's browser can be seen proof that AOL still regard placement Windows desktop crucial, well careful step avoid undermining one allegation government's case. For AOL, Netscape purchase would accelerate it evolution Internet. At present, it flagship on-line service is hybrid it proprietary service, it ha added gateway World Wide Web. In addition, consumer who do not subscribe AOL's dial-up service, it also ha it Web site, aol.com, which attracts 24 million visitor month, according Media Metrix/Relevant Knowledge, market research firm. Its big Web site offer wide range information, entertainment, Internet chat and e-mail, leading example all-in-one site that have become known portal. Netscape's Netcenter traffic ha slipped bit recent month, 16 million visitor month, it, too, is major portal. Together, they should be huge player intensifying portal battle viewer and resulting advertising revenue. Yahoo is current leader portal site more 25 million monthly visitor, while Microsoft's site attracts more 20 million month. Though known new-media company consumer, AOL is also interested boosting it electronic commerce business Netscape purchase. AOL ha recently done work Eastman Kodak, American Greetings and other company, not only promoting their product on-line subscriber also building Internet infrastructure software conduct electronic commerce. AOL note projection recent one Forrester Research Inc., which predicted that worldwide Internet commerce could reach high $3.2 trillion 2003, or 5 percent global sale. Sun Microsystems, analyst say, could be strong partner AOL market Internet commerce software. Sun is corporate software company sale force several thousand. As it move increasingly Internet technology, AOL should prove excellent partner Sun term developing and using Sun's Java, Internet programming language. And while Netscape's browser no longer generates revenue it own, it is distribution channel Java technology. Having Netscape's browser safely hand friendly company is strategic importance Sun, Microsoft owns alternative browser market. AOL is expected pay little, if any, premium Netscape's stock price Friday, executive close deal said, Netscape share have more doubled last month. In last week alone, Netscape's stock ha jumped $12, or nearly 45 percent, report that it wa discussing possible partnership AOL. The stock closed Friday $39.1875, $2625. AOL's share gained $1.50 Friday, closing $84875. Envisioning thoroughly networked world which World Wide Web is limitless marketplace information, entertainment, product and service, America Online Inc. Tuesday laid out detail it agreement buy Netscape Communications Corporation $4.2 billion. By moving quickly what company have recently come see inevitable convergence technology and medium, America Online hope that it will secure solid lead battle already joined giant Microsoft Corp. and International Business Machines Corp. transform greater part cyberspace vast virtual mall. Part that vision rest alliance Sun Microsystems that America Online negotiated part deal. Sun not only brings cyber-savvy sale force effort but, more importantly, strong technology partner developing Netscape's industrial-strength software running Internet site. Sun is indeed technology heavyweight. It owns Java programming language specially designed Internet application, and Solaris, most popular commercial operating system powerful computer that big corporation use serve Internet service World Wide Web, e-mail and retail transaction. It also manufacture highly respected line powerful computer based it microprocessor chip. But America Online and big Internet player which it will compete real potential gold mine lie further road, perhaps five year away, when people will venture line information or shopping not only personal computer inexpensive Internet appliance costing $200 each, or maybe included free part subscription service, just some cellular phone are now. Today, being wired remains comparatively elitist activity estimated 25 percent American household had access Internet last year, and 5 percent household bought merchandise line. But executive America Online and Netscape hope that their deal will accelerate timetable day when Net is ubiquitous, when people will tap World Wide Web appliance-like device, pager, cell phone, television set-top box or computer routinely they use telephone today. A new generation Internet device be able deliver our service anywhere is key part what this deal is long run, said Stephen M. Case, 40, chairman America Online. For present, however, idea is make America Online, nation's leading online service, standard way get Internet, executive explained. Netscape, Internet pioneer, is crucial part that effort, they said. There is no assurance that this vision technological future will prove accurate or, if it doe, that America Online-Netscape combination will lead way. Still, long-range game plan help explain what brought America Online and Netscape together. And ability companies' executive sell that vision Netscape's whiz-kid programmer particular will determine whether merger succeeds. Netscape's headquarters Mountain View, Calif., is likely become prime target Silicon Valley headhunter. As is case any software company, Netscape's key asset is it talented programmer, and many these code hacker may be reluctant work America Online, which still ha reputation middle-brow service catering online newcomer, known derisively newbie. Stock option and other financial incentive will be tailored try keep Netscape employee board. But these people want change world, and we've got be clear that joining America Online, Sun component, really is bigger opportunity u, said Marc Andreessen, 26-year-old cofounder Netscape who led team young programmer supercomputing center University Illinois Silicon Valley start Internet software company 1994. This ought be preeminent Internet company next decade, Andreessen declared, speaking cell phone streetcorner Palo Alto, Calif. For his part, Andreessen, Netscape executive vice president, will become Netscape's chief technology officer next three or four month, merger is completed. His new job America Online ha not been determined, it is likely be chief technology officer combined company well, America Online executive said. Already, according one Netscape board member, Andreessen ha delivered 12-page single-spaced memorandum Case, setting out his view technological road map new company should follow future, emphasizing opportunity electronic commerce environment which most people are linked Internet. Netscape, populated computing sophisticate, and America Online, known on-ramp Internet technologically challenged, seem corporate odd couple. But two company, it executive explained, had been evolving each other more year. In telephone interview America Online's headquarters Dulles, Va., Case described Netscape enterprise that had morphed itself company dependent sale it software used browse World Wide Web and Microsoft's cross-hairs business that relied advertising and other revenue it popular Netcenter Web site and selling software corporation handle electronic commerce. The Netscape transformation wa largely reaction Microsoft's competitive assault it browser business central element government's antitrust suit Microsoft. Microsoft bundled it browser it industry-standard Windows operating system, and gave away browser free. The government alleges these step were part pattern anticompetitive practice, while Microsoft maintains move were intended mainly benefit consumer. Early this year, laying worker and suffering large loss last year, Netscape announced that it would also distribute it browser free. It seems have stabilized it business it new model. Netscape announced Tuesday that it earned $2.7 million revenue $162 million it fourth fiscal quarter, which ended September. Yet America Online ha also changed last couple year, moving well it reputation online service beginner. It now ha Internet chat service and run it all-in-one site Web, known portal, which includes e-mail, Internet searching, news, entertainment and online shopping. America Online ha really changed closed online service novice user Internet medium and technology company diverse set brand, Andreessen said. These two company have been moving same direction, and fit is good one. America Online Inc. want become next Microsoft two promising information-age field where Microsoft Corp. is just another company Internet medium business and electronic commerce. With it proposed purchase Netscape Communications Corp., AOL, nation's largest dial-up online service more 14 million subscriber, hope take significant step that ambitious goal. If $4 billion deal is completed company had not reached final agreement Monday night AOL would acquire leading Internet brand and enlarge it wired audience absorbing million who regularly visit Netscape's popular NetCenter site World Wide Web. Acquiring Netscape would really enhance America Online's role premier Internet medium company, said James F. Moore, president Geopartners Inc., consulting firm. America Online is assembling kind audience number that will convince people Internet is becoming mainstream medium. In new medium business, traditional medium television or newspaper, eyeball translate advertising revenue. But what really intrigue medium executive and consumer marketer new medium news, entertainment and service rendered computer code is that it is inherently two-way medium which people can interact tap key or click mouse button The interaction that advertiser and marketer want see, course, is buying. And it is potential exploiting instant, direct connection consumer that ha fueled all recent optimism electronic commerce. Today, company are selling everything book baby clothes Internet. Most company have not progressed experimentation stage, there are handful encouraging success story Amazon.com, on-line bookstore. By 2003, Forrester Research Inc., whose business is analyzing trend cyberspace, project that Internet commerce could reach $3.2 trillion, or 5 percent all sale worldwide. AOL is forefront this convergence medium and commerce converge, and integration reflected lineage it leader. Steve Case, chairman, wa once new-product manager Pepsico's Pizza Hut chain, while Robert Pittman, president, is former MTV executive. Microsoft is also investing heavily new medium and electronic commerce. It ha online service, MSN, which competes AOL, well information-and commerce Web site that focus travel, car and real estate. It also owns Sidewalk, network local site that list movie, restaurant and store city country including Seattle and New York. Its MSNBC Internet news service is half joint venture NBC. Microsoft is expected be formidable competitor media-and-commerce business. It ha no shortage bright people and it ha more money any rival. Besides deep pocket, Microsoft ha built-in advantage any computer-based medium because it Windows operating system run more 90 percent personal computer sold today. Its control Windows desktop give it most valuable piece commercial real estate information age. In theory, least, owning that desktop screen should help Microsoft steer consumer it online offering issue that is key government's antitrust suit Microsoft. But so far, Microsoft ha started slowly field Internet medium and electronic commerce. Microsoft may want to, it doe not dominate these new market, said Richard Shaffer, principal Technologic Partners, research firm. America Online recognizes that big opportunity is these emerging growth business electronic commerce instead trying take Microsoft head-on. Still, if Netscape deal is completed, AOL will also find itself software business way it ha never been past. Netscape is known pioneer commercial development software used navigate World Wide Web. Microsoft saw browser software direct threat it industry dominance and pursued that market aggressively, bundling it browser it Windows and giving it away free tactic that have been challenged government. But Netscape no longer generates revenue it browser, which it now also distributes free, sale heavy-duty software sold corporation. Much this software is used technological back office electronic commerce used building Web site and processing transaction. A surprising element proposed deal is that AOL intends hold Netscape's corporate software business instead selling it established software company. America Online just doesn't have credibility that market, observed Michael A. Cusumano, professor Massachusetts Institute Technology's Sloan School Management. Executives close AOL explain decision need provide full-line offering electronic commerce, corporate Web site computer screen consumer. But AOL ha decided it need help preserve and strengthen Netscape's corporate software business. To do that, it ha brought Sun Microsystems Inc. side deal, which ha complicated transaction considerably. AOL, according executive close proposed deal, will Netscape, it will have joint marketing and development partnership Sun. As part deal, AOL will agree purchase $300 million worth Sun's computer it service, while Sun will apparently agree purchase sizeable amount Netscape software, which Sun's sale force must sell. Still, AOL and Sun have longer-term objective well one that promise place them more direct conflict Microsoft. For nearly year, William J. Raduchel, Sun's chief strategist, ha been working closely AOL, according Sun executive. A former Harvard economics professor who taught Scott McNealy, Sun chairman, Raduchel ha focused Sun's Internet programming technology, called Java and Jini, which are seen potential threat Microsoft's dominance. By combining Sun's technology prowess AOL's powerful consumer brand, Sun executive say, there is potential kind end-run Microsoft's grip desktop computing. In it research laboratory, Sun ha been working stripped-down network computer simple-to-use information appliance, which could cost little $200 or be given away part subscription service. The concept is that AOL's Internet medium and electronic commerce service could be delivered many more home today because many people still shun expense and difficulty using personal computer. The appliance would be mainly receiver and screen, most computing power residing vast central computer serving information user request tapping few button. Sun's technological specialty is this kind centralized network computing. If long-term AOL-Sun vision ever materialized certainly three-to-five year bet, least it could give company boost and technological independence Microsoft. Microsoft Corp. argued federal court Monday that proposed acquisition Netscape Communications Corp. America Online seriously undermined government's antitrust suit software giant. From legal standpoint, this proposed deal pull rug out government, William Neukom, Microsoft's senior vice president legal affair, said Monday morning courthouse step. The reasoning this assertion, Microsoft say, is that proposed deal demonstrates that Netscape and larger software industry are healthy and vibrant all illegal and anti-competitive practice alleged government's suit. But David Boies, government's lead attorney, said all that wa irrelevant. Whatever deal end being if there end being deal is not going remove any obstacle that Microsoft ha placed path competition this industry, he said. Michael Lacovara, Microsoft lawyer who wa questioning government witness, economist Frederick Warren-Boulton, suggested him trial Monday that proposed acquisition undermined Warren-Boulton's argument, that Microsoft seems headed obtaining monopoly Internet browser software match one it apparently hold operating system. After all, 22 percent Americans who use Internet reach it America Online. And present AOL us Microsoft's Web browser, Internet Explorer, service's default choice. In exchange that, Microsoft place AOL advertisement and Internet link Windows 98. Lacovara asked witness whether, once AOL's service contract expires January, he would expect AOL continue distribute Microsoft software. Yes, Warren-Boulton responded. It is not all clear me that AOL's incentive do this is changed this proposed merger Netscape. He noted that America Online official had said their need be online service featured Windows forced them accept Microsoft term establishing Internet Explorer default choice. Lacovara then asked Warren-Boulton question that lay his entire cross-examination witness and Microsoft's larger assertion Monday proposed Netscape-AOL deal. Surely this combination, he asked, tell you something nature competition software industry? Warren-Boulton's answer wa probably not one Lacovara had been after. To extent that this potential merger is result Microsoft's action these exclusive contract and other action, he said, it is unfortunate see disappearance firm Netscape, brightest, newest star. Warren-Boulton's purpose stand government is establish that Microsoft doe have monopoly operating-system software; more 90 percent world's computer use Microsoft operating system. That is foundation most government's case federal antitrust law forbids certain behavior monopolist that would be legal firm that face healthy competition. Through repeated, circumlocutious questioning, Lacovara tried make case that Microsoft's overwhelming market share wa ephemeral. The software industry is so vibrant and fast moving, he suggested, that Microsoft could be toppled it position any moment point view company encourages it employee. On Friday and Monday, Lacovara repeatedly pointed out that other company are placing other operating system market, and some software company principally Microsoft's greatest rival are writing software these new system. But Warren-Boulton argued that existence these fringe competitor operating system market doe not mean any way that Microsoft doe not have monopoly power. On Monday afternoon, Lacovara made issue success Apple Computer Co. is having selling it new iMac computer. He entered evidence Apple news release issued last month showing, other thing, that 12.5 percent people buying Apple's new iMac computer had previously owned Windows machine. Apple computer use different operating system, Mac-OS. The outcome Microsoft antitrust case may be long way off, one thing is already clear: This is first major e-mail trial. The government's prosecution and Microsoft Corp.'s defense, striking degree, are legal campaign waged electronic message. The human testimony pale next e-mail evidence. On stand or videotaped testimony, people being questioned shrug, mumble and forget. The e-mail is alive idea and competitive zeal, punctuated profanity and exclamation point. The second week trial ended prosecutor being frustrated because lengthy cross-examination Microsoft's lead lawyer left no time government show several hour videotaped deposition Bill Gates, Microsoft chairman. With new witness, executive Apple Computer Inc., taking stand Monday, it is uncertain when Gates tape will be played. The Justice Department and 20 state suing Microsoft believe that tape will strengthen their case because it show Gates saying he wa not involved plan take what government alleges were illegal step stifle competition Internet software market. The Gates videotape, said David Boies, Justice Department's trial lawyer, offer opportunity judge Gates' credibility. But Gates credibility gap, if there is one, becomes issue not because videotape because his taped remark can be compared and contrasted e-mail he wrote and received. The e-mail record, government insists, show Gates waist-deep plotting anti-competitive deal and bullying tactic that he denies or professes have never heard his taped deposition. If his machination are central government's case, why not summon Gates trial? The government doe not need put Gates stand, because we have his e-mail and memoranda, Stephen Houck, lawyer state, told court. The Microsoft legal team ha month been preparing it e-mail defense. First, Microsoft argues, anything that look damaging is taken out context. I urge your honor, John Warden, Microsoft's lead lawyer, told Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson, view considerable skepticism crazy quilt e-mail fragment that seem form core government's case. But Microsoft ha also mounted e-mail counterattack, culled million message it obtained subpoena competitor pretrial discovery. Warden's cross-examination ritual is present government witness internal e-mail his company and then pose declaration question. These interrogation have two refrains: Isn't it true your company doe exactly what you are accusing Microsoft doing, and isn't it true that Microsoft prevailed not because it is predatory monopolist because it superior technology? Microsoft is accused trying prod company stay out it way. So last week, example, Warden produced e-mail Stephen Case, chairman America Online, suggesting partnership Netscape Communications Corp. which company would focus their respective strength. That division labor, Case wrote, would be best way achieve goal that Marc Andreessen, Netscape's cofounder, described earlier e-mail beating Beast From Redmond that want see u dead reference Microsoft's headquarters Redmond, Wash. Printouts e-mail are just another form written communication. By 1920s, typewriter became common, typed memoranda started be used court case. From 1950s 1980s, legal expert say, there wa explosion documentation fueled new technology electric typewriter, photocopying and fax machine, and then personal computer. And e-mail, they add, ha played important role legal inquiry year, Iran-contra case 1980s when e-mail found Oliver North's computer proved crucial. But Microsoft case is result sweeping government antitrust investigation high-technology company where e-mail ha supplanted telephone most common instrument communication. E-mail ha just revolutionized investigation this kind, one senior Justice Department official said. While investigation, Microsoft ha handed government estimated 30 million document, mostly e-mail. In trial, two side have submitted 3,000 exhibit, mainly e-mail. And their e-mail, people communicate more frankly and informally when writing letter or report tap it out, punch button and it's gone cyberspace. But e-mail communication is documentary evidence, which legal case provides rich, contemporaneous record what people were thinking and planning time. It can be sharp contrast formal oral testimony, so coached lawyer and crafted selective memory. The e-mail record certainly make I-don't-recall line response harder sustain, said Robert Litan, former senior official Justice Department's antitrust division who is now Brookings Institution. It can also be powerful ammunition pointing contradiction testimony. And that is what government will do attacking Gates' credibility his videotaped deposition, taken three day August. The government offered glimpse that strategy first day trial. It showed few brief clip point deposition when Gates wa asked meeting June 21, 1995, which, government alleges, Microsoft offered divide browser market Netscape and make investment company, which is it chief rival that market. In taped deposition, Gates say he recalled being asked one his subordinate whether he thought it made sense invest Netscape. He said that he wa asked it June 1995 meeting and replied, I didn't see that something that made sense. But e-mail May 31, 1995, Gates urged alliance Netscape. We could pay them money part deal, he wrote, buying piece them or something. The contradiction Gates' deposition and his e-mail, though, doe not itself speak issue whether Microsoft made illegal offer Netscape. To be sure, it is what Microsoft not what it said e-mail communication that count most. But once e-mail that look bad get record, you end doing what Microsoft's lawyer are going spend much this trial doing trying explain it away, said Stephen Axinn, leading antitrust litigator firm Axinn, Veltrop &AMP; Harkrider New York. America Online built itself most potent force cyberspace largely appealing family chatty teen-agers who want flirt online and adult looking easy way send electronic mail while checking weather and sport score. Now, company ha get serious if it is win heart and mind corporate executive pin-stripe suit. Nearly lost complexity America Online's deal buy Netscape Communication Corp. is America Online's announcement that it will enter entirely new market: working computer screen help company open and operate online store. Netscape already ha created software that made it player providing support what is already known electronic commerce. But America Online now say it ha ambition offer much wider array software, consulting and service online merchant. Most company that sell consumer realize that they need get e-commerce space, said America Online president Robert Pittman news conference Tuesday. We see major business offering them end-to-end solution. The market is big and growing bigger day. Forrester Research estimate that $325 million will be spent this year electronic commerce software and another $5.3 billion service that range graphic design turn-key operation entire online store. By 2002, Forrester estimate, combined market electronic commerce service and software should top $35 billion. E-commerce service are silver bullet that will enable company be able take advantage true business opportunity Web, said Traci Gere, analyst International Data Corp. The market is growing very rapidly, it is very fragmented. Analysts say leader today e-commerce service is IBM, which ha full line offering sophisticated software product hand-holding consulting. Other competitor include well-known information technology consulting company such Andersen Consulting, spin-off Arthur Andersen accounting firm; Electronic Data Systems, which run computer system big company, and PricewaterhouseCoopers, which offer accounting and consulting separately one umbrella. Software company Microsoft and Netscape sell packaged program, typically little or no consulting help customer use them. There are also plenty new company that have sprouted provide electronic commerce service. Some, Agency.Com and Organic Online, started basically advertising and design firm. Others, including U S Web and Viant, have emphasized programming and consulting. In fact, those two strain are blurring together, exemplified U S Web's pending merger CKS Group. America Online argues that it advantage this increasingly crowded bazaar is it ability combine broad subscriber base 15 million customer Netscape software, hardware Sun Microsystems, which ha joined America Online's venture electronic commerce engineering. This is first time anyone ha put true end-to-end solution that start silicon and end audience, said Barry Schuler, America Online's president interactive service. We start Sun's line server, then commerce tool build store, support service process order and then deal online real estate that can drive traffic. Despite advantage Netscape and Sun bring, analyst say that America Online face variety problem it new quest. Chief them is whether it can appear have consistency, focus and follow-through that corporate customer demand. AOL is not first company that come my mind when it come business-quality software, said Robert Chatham, senior analyst Forrester Research. Its decision keep Netscape separate unit and offer electronic commerce service partnership Sun will not enhance it credibility, Chatham said. America Online doesn't look homogenous vendor, he added. It look customer will have tangle menage trois AOL, Netscape and Sun. Nor have Internet service provider and other telecommunications-oriented company shown much evidence, Ms. Gere International Data said, that they are capable offering highly specific customized service that big corporate client demand. Telecommunications company that try do thing efficiently large number customer have not been able offer customized one-to-one relationship, she said. Pittman said that America Online had been driven e-commerce business because company that approached it wanting sell their good needed more help simply advertising online. We are finding people who are expert running bricks-and-mortar store are limited their infrastructure, he said. They have online store, their square footage is too small. Even Netscape deal, America Online wa moving provide some electronic commerce software and service. It ha been rewriting software that let company open online store be based universally accepted Internet standard rather specific computer language used only America Online. This new software, which now will be combined Netscape's online store service, will be available company use America Online and Internet. Similarly, it ha developed service that let user create file their credit card number and shipping address so they can make online purchase retyping all that information each time. America Online is working offer it fee store broader Internet. There is wide range service that are incorporated electronic commerce. These include high-end strategy consulting help company decide whether and how sell online hurting their traditional sale store. There are all sort computer system be developed, ranging online store themselves connecting those site company's existing inventory and accounting system. There are creative service that include graphic design, medium buying, customer list analysis and other marketing and promotional effort. And there are operational service that involve actually maintaining big server that user connect when they use online store that display catalog, take order and process payment. America Online, Schuler said, will emphasize service that relate marketing rather back-office function. We will consult how merchandise and sell online, he said. We understand consumer piece puzzle. Some competitor worry that America Online's electronic commerce service may simply be device sell it software and hardware. The challenge is prove that client are getting best possible solution their business, said Robert Gett, chief executive Viant. If they offer AOL and Netscape and Sun, their answer is bit tainted. Netscape doe have expanding force 700 people who provide consulting and custom programming. But they have been most competitive, Gett said, competing nuts-and-bolts project rather more lucrative assignment develop and carry out full-fledged strategy Web. They say, `Who know our software better Netscape?' Gett said. We help customer decide which platform is best them. But America Online argues that combined might it, Netscape and Sun is just what business need. We always believed that commerce, that is buying good and service, is huge revenue stream future, Schuler said. We have only seen tiniest tip iceberg.

America Online is verge agreeing purchase Netscape Communications Corp., Internet pioneer center government's antitrust suit Microsoft Corp., executive involved talk said Sunday. The proposed deal is complex, three-way transaction involving AOL, Netscape and Sun Microsystems Inc. AOL, leading on-line service more 14 million subscriber, would acquire Netscape's popular site World Wide Web and it software business. But part deal, AOL would also enter joint marketing and development partnership Sun Microsystems strengthen Netscape's other business selling large corporation heavy-duty software needed serve Web page and other Internet technology many thousand user same time. The purchase, exchange AOL share Netscape stock, is valued roughly $4 billion. A completed deal could be announced soon Monday morning. But executive involved talk cautioned Sunday night that some detail remained be negotiated. The Netscape deal, if consummated, would realign three business forefront modern economy on-line service, Internet software and electronic commerce. It would strengthen two Microsoft's leading rival, AOL and Sun Microsystems. At same time, however, it would subsume Netscape, Internet software maker once regarded most serious challenger Microsoft's dominance personal computer software market. Netscape, founded 1994, ha struggled last 18 month assault Microsoft. Its Navigator wa runaway leader market browser software used navigate World Wide Web. But Microsoft, responding Internet revolution, entered market aggressively, quickly matching quality Netscape's technology and then bundling Microsoft browser, Internet Explorer, it industry-standard Windows operating system and giving it away free. Earlier this year, Netscape announced layoff and started distributing Navigator free well, Microsoft steadily gained browser market. Since then, Netscape ha focused mainly two business advertising and transaction fee it Netcenter Web site and selling industrial-strength software corporation that are building their Internet site which conduct electronic commerce. AOL belief it ha expertise increase revenue Netscape's Web site and, helped Sun's programmer and vast corporate sale force, accelerate Netscape's software sale well, executive involved negotiation said. Sun's version Unix, Solaris, is most popular operating system large, powerful computer that run Netscape's server software. This deal would insure that fundamental element Netscape survive bigger company that can drive it technology forward, said David B. Yoffie, professor Harvard business school and co-author Michael A. Cusumano Massachusetts Institute Technology recent book, Competing Internet Time: Lessons Netscape and Its Battle Microsoft. The impact deal, if any, government's antitrust suit Microsoft is uncertain. It doe appear support key theme Microsoft's defense namely, that it operates fast-moving industry where corporate alliance shift all time. Thus, Microsoft argues, antitrust policy should tread gently. But deal, government official insist, should have no direct effect current case. No matter how much alliance shift, it doesn't affect central fact Microsoft's monopoly and how it ha used and abused it market power protect it monopoly, said David Boies, Justice Department's lead trial lawyer Microsoft case. Executives representing Netscape, AOL and Sun Microsystems are government witness Microsoft trial. And serious merger talk Netscape Chief Executive Officer James Barksdale and AOL Chairman Steve Case began month ago, or just start Microsoft trial, according people close talk. Industry analyst suggest that company may have been emboldened take stronger anti-Microsoft step based partly perception that antitrust case would weaken Microsoft. And representative Kleiner Perkins Caufield &AMP; Byers, Silicon Valley venture capital firm regarded power broker Microsoft's rival, sit board Netscape, Sun and AOL. Stock price vaulted record level Monday, furthering recovery that recently two month ago seemed nearly unthinkable. I thought we were most serious correction 1990, I never thought or wrote that bull market wa over, said Byron Wien, US. equity strategist Morgan Stanley Dean Witter &AMP; Co. Now it seems all that is u. The Dow Jones industrial average rose 214.72 point, or 2.34 percent, 9,37427. The record is first July 17, when Dow closed 9,33797. Since Aug. 31, when Dow stood 7,539.07 steep slide, blue-chip gauge ha risen more 24 percent. For year, Dow is 18.54 percent and ha chance rising more 20 percent fourth consecutive year, something never accomplished before. Broader average also climbed. The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock index set record, rising 24.66 point, or 2.12 percent, 1,18821. The Nasdaq composite index not reach new high posted biggest percentage gain Monday, rising 49.21 point, or 2.55 percent, 1,97742. And Russell 2000 index smaller-company issue gained 3.86 point, or nearly 1 percent, 39815. Monday's action wa energized daily record number merger and acquisition valued $1 billion or more. The merger announcement not only prompted investor change estimate how much company were worth also indicated coming decline outstanding share stock. This may be supply-demand story, where demand stock is rising and supply stock is reduced one company another merges, said Hugh Johnson, chief investment officer First Albany Corp. The flow money mutual fund is fairly strong, and there is pressure manager put that money work. Two deal seemed be catalyst broad swath stock. News that Bankers Trust may be close accepting $8.9 billion offer Deutsche Bank Germany heightened interest financial-services and bank stock. And word that America Online may acquire Netscape Communications $4 billion stock powered Internet and other technology stock loftier valuation. Among financial company, JP.

Netscape wa most active stock Monday, gaining 2}, 41 15/16. America Online gained 4 3/8, 89\. Other Internet stock also surged, and analyst said group, which ha seen meteoric gain recent week, wa ripe steep correction. Yahoo and Amazon.com became $200 stock Monday. Yahoo rose 30 7/16, 221 7/16. And Amazon.com gained 37 3/8, 218. The performance Internet stock is unsettling sign, Wien said. Still, more-established technology share also had very good day. IBM rose 7, 166 5/8. Microsoft jumped 5 9/16, 119 3/16. And Intel closed 113 9/16, 1{. After Monday's big price move, Wien said that according his calculation, stock were 10 percent overvalued. By contrast, middle July market wa 20 percent overvalued, he said. Nonetheless, market's recovery, which ha been buttressed three cut interest rate Federal Reserve Board, ha left many longtime Wall Street hand grasping historical parallel. At this point we are new ground, said Laszlo Birinyi, who head his market research firm. At beginning year, I said my target Dow wa 10,000 end 1998. If anyone had asked when market went what now look corrective blip, I would have said my new target would have been 9,000. I am surprised 10,000 figure came back table this year. The New York Times said editorial Wednesday, Nov. 25: America Online's effort acquire Netscape and set partnership Sun Microsystems is reminder how rapidly corporate landscape can change fast-moving technical field. But it doe not lessen need Justice Department vigorously pursue it antitrust suit Microsoft, dominant player software. The department ha presented solid evidence that Microsoft ha used it monopoly operating system muscle rival and partner so head competition other software realm. The Internet ha risen so quickly information medium that only four year ago, his book The Road Ahead, Bill Gates scarcely mention it. In addition, only couple year ago America Online, world's biggest online service, wa having so much trouble getting rid bug system it wa widely derided America On Hold. Now Microsoft ha moved so aggressively Internet that Justice Department is accusing it predatory behavior, and America Online ha rocketed forward make deal other Internet player. In it antitrust suit Microsoft, federal government charge that company ha illegally bundled it browser it Windows operating system smother Netscape's chance marketing it browser. Now corridor antitrust trial Microsoft's lawyer maintain that Netscape ha found new partner America Online and ha no need protection government. But it could be easily argued that Microsoft ha bludgeoned Netscape dissolution, forcing distress sale America Online. Nor is it clear that customer America Online will choose Netscape's browser vehicle buying and selling Internet. Even it newly musclebound form, America Online remains dependent Microsoft's good will favorable placement AOL icon main desktop screen. It may be that, year hence, America Online, Netscape and Sun will put together alternative mean Internet telephone line, cable or like. But that day, fairness requires Justice Department action insure that Microsoft not use it current position thwart consumer choice. Only when company know they can get their product consumer will they have incentive innovate and turn Internet revolutionary medium it promise be.

27,"President Leonid Kuchma called Friday correction Ukraine's program market reform, pledged that reform would continue. Kuchma not elaborate his comment group Ukrainian economist, saying only that change were necessary because country's economic problem. Kuchma urged economist come recommendation national meeting economist November, Interfax news agency reported. Ukraine ha suffered economic problem 1991 collapse Soviet Union and it ha been especially hard hit financial crisis neighboring Russia, it main trading partner. The Russian crisis ha hurt bilateral trade, caused Ukrainian currency fall and led withdrawal investor Ukraine. In recent month, Kuchma ha implemented some economic reform decree, prompting International Monetary Fund release first installment long-awaited dlrs 2.2 billion loan. Many reform, however, remain stalled. National Bank chairman Viktor Yushchenko wa Washington this week consultation IMF official. Yushchenko ha warned that bank would not spend it dwindling reserve support hryvna currency, ha avoided comment currency recent day. Kuchma met Friday Yushchenko, Prime Minister Valery Pustovoitenko and other senior official discus way stabilize hryvna. The government's press service said they focused possible way keep hryvna 3.5 US. dollar end year. The hryvna ha been trading 3.4 dollar recent day trading ha been limited. There are wide expectation Ukraine that hryvna will fall further, and Ukrainians have been stocking food, clothing and household good their fast-devaluing money. When world's finance minister and central banker gathered last year Hong Kong, they nervously congratulated each other containing least moment nasty financial brush fire Asia. In year's time, many predicted hallway chatter, trouble Thailand and Indonesia would look replay Mexico 1995 rough bump road world enjoying remarkable prosperity. Talk bad market call. Twelve month later, same financial mandarin clog Washington their limousine and glide endless reception annual meeting International Monetary Fund and World Bank, just everything that could have gone wrong world economy has: worst downturn Japan World War II, economic meltdown Russia, depression Indonesia that is plunging 100 million people poverty line, and deep fear what happens next Latin America. What make this year's IMF meeting most remarkable, though, is that harshest criticism are directed monetary fund itself, and, extension, US. Treasury, which is viewed power IMF. This year, place confident prediction, there are mutual recrimination. Arguments are breaking out whether true culprit were crony capitalist and weakened leader Russian President Boris Yeltsin, or huge investor who poured money world's emerging market reckless abandon mid-1990s and panicked twelve month. Whatever reason, one reality prevails: Hundreds billion dollar have fled economy four continent seeking safest haven possible, United States and money is not returning anytime soon. And subtext every seminar capital flow and every conclave nervous minister will be some painfully blunt questions: Can this be stopped? Or is world headed global recession? Fifty-three year ago IMF wa created Bretton Woods conference which sought stabilize world economy and secure peace World War II. Now it is attack all side, charged not only worsening bad situation misjudging economics, being politically tone-deaf some most volatile capital world, Jakarta, Indonesia, Moscow. For first time, there are disturbing question whether institution itself is still capable, financially or politically, containing kind economic contagion that caught world unaware. Once, IMF's critic were largely found Africa and South Asia, were fund wa viewed arrogant; today they include Wall Street's biggest player and top official most powerful economy Asia and Europe. Only few including former Secretary State George Schultz and member Congress who are increasingly suspicious all international institution are talking scrapping IMF altogether. But almost everyone is talking creating new financial architecture that can do what old one clearly cannot: smother financial wildfire they leap globe. President Clinton, British Prime Minister Tony Blair and other leader, month silence, have edged debate, some case wresting issue first time their finance minister and central bank. Their fear, their adviser say, is that 15 month financial turmoil are now threatening political stability. Such concern have turned this year's meeting tumbled mass worry and groping short and long-term solution. The Japanese, French, Southeast Asians are all arriving Washington different diagnosis what went wrong, and different solution how set it right. The United States ha it set plan, mix suggestion force more disclosure financial data country world and impose more American-style financial standard and regulation. Meanwhile, ideological argument is breaking out whether world should slow long march more free and open market strategy pressed Clinton administration six year. Others argue that it is unwise start rebuilding hospital while patient are still operating table. Last year standard answer that all u were given came this: `We have IMF and World Bank, and they know best,' Indonesian Foreign Minister Ali Alatas said breakfast Washington other day, reflecting how crisis turned 30 year astounding growth his country overnight depression. Then they said everything that went wrong wa our fault, he said. But now, now I think people know that much problem came outside, and we need something better. And IMF itself is beginning fight back, awkward role institution dominated PhD. economist who are unaccustomed being openly challenged. Every place you turn you read same story, that we came in, that we made thing worse, said Stanley Fischer, deputy managing director fund, who wa born Northern Rhodesia now Zambia and became chairman Massachusetts Institute Technology's economics department taking job that ha now put him center financial storm. We frequently get blame, some it well-deserved, he said. But it is politically convenient government world cry, `The IMF made u do it,' and pin their mistake u. That's fine. We'd rather be loved, more that we'd be effective. MISCALCULATIONS, POLITICS AND SAFETY NETS On steaming January day, Michel Camdessus, IMF's top official, slipped Jakarta private residence President Suharto and sat four-hour meeting tick off, line line, huge reform Indonesia would have implement return ten billion dollar emergency aid. Two previous deal had collapsed when Suharto ignored fund's condition, so Camdessus insisted that he strike deal directly Suharto, then Asia's longest-serving leader. It wa meeting men who knew different world power politics: Suharto rose general central Java, and Camdessus had detonated mine Algeria French army entering French Treasury his way becoming head France's central bank. It wa all there, senior IMF official recalled. He wa told he had dismantle national airplane project, clove monopoly, all distribution monopoly. At one point, Camdessus looked impassive Suharto and said, You see what this mean your family, reference their vast investment country's key industry. He said, `I called my child, and they all understand.' But month, that exchange Jakarta came symbolize IMF's twin troubles: Its inability understand and reckon national politics country need radical reform, and it focus economic stabilization rather social cost it action. Suharto had no intention fulfilling agreement. It wa, one his former Cabinet member said, delaying move that wa obvious everyone Camdessus. Perhaps one reason why IMF sometimes appears tone-deaf is that it senior staff is almost entirely composed PhD. economist. There are few official deep experience international politics, much le complexity Javanese culture that were work Indonesia. Historically, expert politics and security have gravitated United Nations, development expert World Bank, and economist IMF creating dangerous gap crisis this one. As result, fund had only rudimentary understanding what would happen if it demand were met and all Indonesia's state monopoly were quickly dissolved. While that system lined pocket Suhartos and their friend, it also distributed food, gasoline and other staple country that stretch 3,000 mile thousand island. To help balance budget, fund demanded quick end expensive subsidy that keep price food and gasoline artificially low. But that, combined huge currency devaluation that sparked crisis, resulted high price and shortage that fueled riot that continue this day, million Indonesians lose their job. The IMF unintentionally, it official insist also sped Suharto's resignation, insisting elimination crony capitalism, code word removing Suharto family center economy. Ultimately, that may prove be Indonesia's salvation, if new government can contain rioting ethnic Chinese minority whose money is desperately needed country's fast-shrinking economy. It is worth noting, Fischer said this week, that our program Asia Indonesia, Korea and Thailand only took hold there wa change government. Nonetheless, Indonesia experience ha revived argument that IMF is so focused stabilizing bank and currency, preventing capital flight and freeing market, that it is blind social cost it action. Among toughest critic ha been it sister institution, World Bank, whose main charge is alleviating poverty. You've seen tension almost every day, one senior World Bank official said recently. The bank ha gone extraordinary length recent month differentiate it role that fund, and announce tripling aid poorest country hit economic chaos. Even UN. Secretary General Kofi Annan ha joined argument, warning speech Harvard recently that if globalization is succeed, it must succeed poor and rich alike. It must deliver right no le rich. It must be harnessed cause not capital alone, development and prosperity poorest world. IMF official say they are changing strategy when they see they are exacting too great social cost. It's very difficult formula get exactly right, Fischer said August, Russia wa teetering and IMF wa sending $4.8 billion aid that wa rapidly wasted. You need enough discipline send right message market and keep investor fleeing. But you need enough leeway keep people suffering more they otherwise would. In recent month, he noted, IMF ha allowed more spending sustain subsidy basic good longer period Indonesia, Korea and elsewhere. There is new flexibility IMF senior Indonesian official concluded recently. It is lot better. A US. PAWN, OR A RUNAWAY AGENCY? The Clinton administration admits that IMF ha many failing, many them display this year. But it insists that world ha gone global financial crisis IMF once this century and result wa 1930s. I have no doubt situation year would have been much worse greater devaluation, more default, more contagion, and greater trade dislocation program agreed IMF and finance it ha provided, Deputy Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers told Congress last week. Many Republicans and some Democrats are unconvinced. Even though Senate ha overwhelmingly approved $18 billion contribution fund help it fight new crisis, House defeated that measure two week ago. The fund's last hope getting money, which will free nearly $100 billion contribution other nation waiting United States act, will come when House and Senate try resolve their budget difference conference committee next 10 day. A rejection, Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin insists, would send message world that United States is turning it back one institution charged restoring economic stability. Everywhere else world, though, politician and businessmen insist that one biggest problem IMF is that, contrary view Congress, it act US. Treasury's lap dog. Ask Jakarta or Moscow, and response is same: The IMF never venture far looking back approving nod it master. When United States weighs in, however, is when IMF is called rescue country deep trouble. Only then doe IMF and US. Treasury have leverage extract commitment return billion aid. In theory, US. influence is limited: It ha 18.5 percent vote fund. Germany, Japan, France and Britain have 5 percent each. But practice United States get it way, exercising it influence scene, interaction Fischer and Summers. The two met when Fischer wa MIT faculty and Summers wa graduate student taking one his class, later becoming colleague MIT. Each served chief economist World Bank. It wa Summers who wa instrumental placing Fischer fund's no. 2 job, and these day they talk constantly. It's warm relationship, Fischer said this summer. Remember, this is job where you cannot turn outsider advice you can't call chief economist Wall Street firm, or many your academic friend, because so many issue are confidential. The Treasury's relation Camdessus are more strained he play role world diplomat, traveling globe and trying coax political leader. The tension were obvious start Asia crisis. The fund made little secret it displeasure that United States wa not offering direct aid Thailand, major US. ally, sign support and confidence. Mindful backlash Congress when Mexico wa bailed out US. money, that wa last thing Treasury planned do. Summers, turn, thought fund wa not forcing Thais implement it reform commitment rigorously enough or disclose their true financial picture. Within US. government there wa other dissension: The State and Defense Departments felt United States should do more Thailand, backed when Treasury asked if they would pony some aid out their budget. There were other conflict. When Japan used last IMF meeting propose setting $100 billion Asia Fund one that would exclude United States and would probably offer aid much more relaxed condition IMF doe. Rubin called Camdessus breakfast one morning and told him that Japanese proposal would undercut IMF's authority. We've just had dispute Michel, Rubin reported his aide he returned his orange juice and croissant. One them shot back: And it's only 8 am. Camdessus backed Rubin's insistence and walked away money that Asia could have used. Japan say it will be back similar proposal this weekend, this time $30 billion fund. Camdessus ha also rankled US. official statement that amounted cheerleading reassure market sometimes face fact. In June, Russia it way collapse, Camdessus declared that contrary what market and commentator are imagining slow collapse Russia's economy, this is not crisis. This is not major development. The bailouts Russia and South Korea were prime example how Washington muscle IMF's turf soon major US. strategic interest are involved. Last Christmas, South Korea slipped day running out hard currency pay it debt December, it sent secret envoy, Kim Kihwan, work out rescue package. I didn't bother going IMF, Kim recalled recently. I called Summers' office Treasury my home Seoul, flew Washington and went directly there. I knew that wa how this would get done. Within day Treasury dispatched David Lipton, it most experienced veteran emergency bailouts, who is leaving his post undersecretary international affair this month, shadow IMF staff's negotiation government Seoul. Fischer wa displeased. To make negotiation effective, it ha be clear who ha authority do negotiating, he said. WHO LOST RUSSIA? The pattern wa repeated this summer, when United States raced put together $17 billion package Russia. The IMF's staff Moscow declared that Russia needed no money all it just needed enact policy that would restore confidence investor. The Americans and Germans came different conclusion. Soon after, US. official gathered White House situation room consider what might happen Russia if ruble wa devalued and market reform collapsed and push IMF come emergency money. So fund began assembling last-ditch program prop country that had resisted it reform plan seven year. Camdessus, though, wa still hesitant, questioning whether IMF should risk it scarce resource Russia. We had pull Michel along, senior Treasury official recalled. As it turned out, Camdessus' instinct were right while approach championed Rubin and Summers proved disastrously wrong. The first installment that payment $4.8 billion wa wasted, propping currency long enough, word one IMF official, let oligarch get their money out country. Then Yeltsin reversed his commitment, let ruble devalue anyway, began printing money abandon and fired virtually every reformer his government resulting collapse IMF agreement and indefinite suspension it aid program. Now, IMF and Capitol Hill, there are recrimination who lost Russia. Publicly, Fischer argues that there are no apology owed what we attempted Russia. But some IMF official complain privately that they let Rubin and Summers run roughshod them, striking deal that fell apart week Russian parliament rebelled and Yeltsin backed away his commitment. Summers responds that United States took calculated risk because it wa vastly better that Russia succeed not succeed. The Russian collapse touched new round economic contagion, investor fleeing Latin America, and triggering huge loss hedge fund Long Term Capital, Greenwich, Conn., investment firm that needed be rescued Wall Street powerhouse whose money it had invested. Russia wa turning point, said Robert Hormats, vice chairman Goldman, Sachs &AMP; Co. It made world realize that some country can fail, if IMF and Treasury intercede. And that changed perception risk. Now, country meet face future that IMF ha warned could be very bleak, they need reverse those perception, or watch country slowly starve lack capital. The emerging market are calling control short term investment. The French want stronger IMF. The Americans say answer is more disclosure, so that investor are better warned, and tougher regulation. These are nice, quiet meetings; everyone very polite, top US. official said earlier this week. Not this year. Ukraine's parliament Friday refused approve President Leonid Kuchma's decree establishing state fund compensate people saving lost bank. Deputies voted 240-47 prepare revised version decree and debate it later month. They must consider decree Oct. 10, or else it automatically take effect constitution. Leftist faction, which voted proposed legislation, said it would not fully guarantee return saving lost financial instability that ha recently hit Ukraine. The fund Kuchma proposed establish would have accumulated money special National Bank account and repay people case bank they kept their saving went bankrupt or became insolvent. Although decree provided compensation deposit amounting only 500 hryvna (dlrs 147 current exchange rate), it author said it would cover more 90 percent Ukrainians who keep their money bank. The measure wa meant prevent mass withdrawal deposit that most Ukrainian bank have already experienced people, scared fall national currency and turmoil neighboring Russia, started stock food, clothing and household good. Government official say that Ukrainians have recently withdrawn least 10 percent 3 billion hryvna (dlrs 882 million) they deposited bank. Russia's new prime minister picked unusual way reassure nation Thursday. After two week deliberation he announced that he still had no plan rescue country it economic crisis. I want repeat once more there is no program, Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov said. It ha be worked out. In most nation such statement might provoke alarm. But Primakov wa seeking calm anxious public that wa worried that Kremlin's cure could be worse disease. It is not if Russians do not have something be concerned about. Thursday Primakov convened meeting top aide try hammer out strategy overcoming economic woe. A main item agenda wa plan drafted Yuri Maslyukov, Communist and government's senior policy maker economic issue. It not take long Maslyukov's plan hit street. A newspaper, Kommersant Daily, published it full Thursday morning. Not surprisingly Maslyukov's plan call greater state role economy, including control hard currency. A new State Bank Reconstruction and Development would be established using nationalized asset failed commercial bank. Wages and pension would be paid two month, and minimum wage would be indexed inflation. There would be huge tax cut, combination that suggested that government wa committed printing additional money. The exchange rate ruble would be set central bank, based change inflation and balance payment. Maslyukov's plan also implies that Russians would be able buy dollar exchange country. It stipulates that hard currency could enter country only special authorization. Exporters would be required sell most their hard currency reserve. That is allusion currency control that sent shock wave Russian public. Russians have come treat dollar second currency, and many people have squirreled away dollar hedge inflation. It is obvious stupidity, Otto Latsis, commentator newspaper Noviye Izvestiya, said. People won't give their dollar away. They will go black market if they need to. Yegor Gaidar, former prime minister who favor free market, said plan wa war dollar and predicted that it would lead shortage import. As criticism grew, Primakov rushed distance himself talk currency control. The rumor state's becoming monopolist inflow hard currency country is nonsense, he said, asserting that document published Kommersant Daily wa just one six possible plan. Primakov may be opposed wildly unpopular currency control. He may be worried that plan would would set panic buying dollar, further depressing ruble. Or he may simply be trying keep his distance Maslyukov's plan while Russia try wrangle it next disbursement, $4.3 billion, International Monetary Fund. The particular could be modified, many people maneuvering say they believe that it represents basic thrust government's thinking. Primakov ha called greater state regulation and expansion money supply, two theme Maslyukov's plan. The plan also ha many similarity plan presented government Gorbachev-era adviser. We think it is close being final document, said United Financial Group, Russian investment business. It is unclear how long Primakov can carry spelling out detailed strategy. The ousted tax chief, Boris Fyodorov, ha argued that IMF should not provide further aid Primakov ha taken tough measure build free market. Primakov ha, however, sought turn that logic it head, arguing that his government's economic strategy will depend fund's willingness provide aid. His aim appears be pressure fund implying that it will be fund's fault if Russia is forced default it loan or take draconian measure home. Or Primakov put it Thursday, fund's money, Russia will have impose unpopular measure. Wall Street extended global stock selloff Thursday Dow industrials tumbling more 200 point second straight day.

In her first comprehensive review U.S.-Russian relation Primakov wa confirmed prime minister last month, Albright said Washington wa deeply concerned Russia's direction and not think crisis there would soon abate.

While praising Primakov, once her counterpart when he wa foreign minister, pragmatist able cooperate key issue Washington, she had harsh word warning him. Our initial reaction some direction he's going ha not been particularly positive, she said, adding, The question now is whether that cooperation can continue. The United States must keep it aid Russia is adjusting it promote building democracy and student exchange well arm control, Albright said. Washington doe not favor more direct aid. More big bailouts are not themselves going restore investor confidence Russia, she said. In long run, gap Russia's need and it resource must be met not foreign bailouts foreign investment. Albright sharply criticized self-defeating many voice Russia who want shift emphasis Russia's interaction America and our ally one partnership one assertiveness, opposition and defiance it stake. Russia could not stand alone world, she said, and United States' ability help Russians help themselves will go being merely very, very difficult being absolutely impossible. At same time, she said, Washington would not assume worst, there are still plenty people Russia who will fight turning back clock. And she urged world and American critic be patient working democratic process Russia and not start each day taking census reformer Kremlin, census that American official themselves promoted President Boris Yeltsin dismissed previous government. While Moscow may continue oppose any NATO use force Serbian force southern province Kosovo, Albright said, NATO must be prepared act regardless. If Communist Party ha it way and it ha been planning month million Russians will take street Wednesday some biggest demonstration year. But now that Communists or politician Communist stamp approval are running country and it economy question is what marcher will be demonstrating against. President Boris Yeltsin and his economic adviser were easy target two month ago. But Yeltsin seems shadow himself today, and his adviser are gone. The Communists, who have undergone sort resurgence playing discontent, are working hard cast themselves outsider government that they help run and keep focus protest Wednesday Yeltsin and his policy. Even that strategy may backfire, however, because discontent Yeltsin doe not necessarily translate support his predecessor. An adviser Communist Party leader, Gennadi Zyuganov, made headline not long ago when he called new government bourgeois. The characterization wa striking, because new prime minister, Yevgeny Primakov, wa one Zyuganov's top choice post. The deputy prime minister charge economy, Yuri Maslyukov, is Communist Party figure who once headed Gosplan, infamous central-planning program that helped bring Soviet Union ruin. We don't have slogan that are aimed government, first secretary Moscow Communist Party committee, Alexander Kuvayev, said recent interview. All slogan are aimed president and economic course country. Only president can fully be blamed course that ha brought country this situation. Anger Russia's fate, and their own, is drawing some Russians back Soviet-style slogan and old-style hostility capitalism. The ardently pro-Communist newspaper Sovietskaya Rossiya devoted most it front page Thursday what it said were result contest reader protest slogan. The entry ranged catchy kitschy, from, Legislator, official, banker study Constitution; exam is Oct. 7, to, Imperialist! Help Russia return exported capital, and we will pay debt once. Russia ha seen nothing approaching this sort economic chaos and despair 1993, when hyperinflation swept economy. There is no real way knowing whether latest travail will produce huge and ugly crowd or small, peaceful one. A deputy editor and political analyst newsweekly, Itogi, Masha Lipman, said situation wa not that 1993, when Yeltsin sought, and won, popular mandate referendum. He used it dissolve Communist-dominated Parliament and increase his power. That led autumn showdown, shelling Parliament tank and total defeat, time being, Yeltsin's legislative opponent. You can interpret this demonstration Communist mandate, I don't think they will act Yeltsin, Ms. Lipman said. Support Communists is it smallest level, maybe 20 percent. In survey 1,714 people that wa released last week All-Russian Public Opinion Center said that nearly half population supported idea demonstration Yeltsin, that barely one-tenth were likely participate any way. Nobody is interested any sort struggle, Yuri Levada, who head center, said interview. This is mainly general expression great wave distrust authority, mainly president. He's great scapegoat all our sin. There seems be little enthusiasm demonstration any sort. Only few thousand people turned out Sunday fifth anniversary shelling Parliament and Yeltsin's subsequent triumph Communists. The Communist Party and Federation Independent Russian Unions, leftist organization that say it is main sponsor protest, predict that 9 million Russians will participate Wednesday. The government ha vowed keep order resorting force. But it is concerned enough that it ha summoned 11,000 police officer patrol Moscow and 6,000 military troop intervene if violence erupts. Protests 1993 have generally been tepid, deep-seated feeling here. Some demonstration last week, more or le practice run, hinted similarly dampened march this year. President Boris Yeltsin would respond strongly any effort prohibit Russians buying foreign currency, believing move would be bringing another Iron Curtain country, his spokesman said Friday. The president clearly understands that such ban would be clear violation our right . that would mean return Iron Curtain everyday life, said presidential spokesman Dmitry Yakushin. The remark came medium report government economic plan work that would prohibit Russians buying US. dollar and other foreign currency, and institute other strict economic control, rolling back seven year reform. Though government official say such plan is only one six possibility, Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov warned Thursday that he might be forced take unpopular measure rescue Russian economy if it doe not receive next installment dlrs 22.6 billion loan International Monetary Fund. Central Bank Chairman Viktor Gerashchenko and Finance Minister Mikhail Zadornov flew Washington Friday negotiation IMF dlrs 4.3 billion installment. IMF official have said they want Russian government come sound economic program loan is given, and have made it clear that currency control and boosting money supply printing ruble are not acceptable. But Primakov said that country's plan would be dependent IMF loan, not other way around. No short-term economic plan will be known another three week, long IMF is set make it decision, said First Deputy Prime Minister Vadim Gustov. A draft version government's fourth-quarter budget would rely heavily IMF loan, Kommersant newspaper said. Without loan, government would have engage major deficit spending. Calls Soviet-style control part plan drafted First Deputy Prime Minister Yuri Maslyukov and leaked press have apparently created rift Cabinet. The plan drew heavy criticism Zadornov, and Gerashchenko called idea banning foreign currency sale mad idea. Meanwhile, Russia's stock market dropped 5 percent 38.8 Friday, trading wa so light downward move meant little. The stock market ha continued fall crisis hit Aug. 17. And tax collection wa September, result collapse Russia's banking system, said Alexander Pochinok, head government's finance and credit department. Revenues totaled 14.3 billion ruble (dlrs 875 million), 700 million ruble (dlrs 43 million) le expected. The government want reverse this trend raising tax oil and gas company, idea is expected meet sharp resistance lower house Russia's parliament, which want cut tax rate, Pochinok said. Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov said Saturday that economic crisis would not bring end government's program privatizing state property. Privatization will be accomplished growth production, growth investment and growth production effectiveness renewal major fund, Primakov said meeting Western businessmen. We shall conduct privatization so that it serf interest people, state, and business, he said, according ITAR-Tass news agency. Primakov reassured businessmen, member prime minister's consultive council foreign investment Russia, that government had no plan ban circulation US. dollar Russia. But, he said, government would take step staunch flow dollar Russia. Responding medium report government economic plan that would prohibit Russians buying US. dollar and other foreign currency, Primakov said report absolutely do not correspond reality, ITAR-Tass quoted him saying. He said there wa no need regulate influx dollar Russia, government should take step prevent what he called dollar drain. Russian company stashed dlrs 2.5 billion country September alone, Interfax news agency reported Friday, quoting central bank figure. Primakov said foreign investor are force that will help Russia minimize it loss current economic crisis. We are very much interested foreign investment, especially one that go real production sector, Primakov said, according Interfax. We need continuous dialogue foreign investor, whom it will be difficult u overcome current difficulty. He said Russia wanted long-term investment. Foreign capital ha been coming country short-term operation, Primakov said. This, he said, is not our liking or yours. Viktor Gerashchenko, central bank chairman, said Friday that government must act stem flow dollar Russia. Gerashchenko and Finance Minister Mikhail Zadornov were Washington Saturday annual meeting International Monetary Fund, where they plan spell out measure Russia is taking bail out it finance system. Russia want IMF release second dlrs 4.3 billion installment loan that wa approved July, month country's economy crashed and government effectively defaulted it foreign loan. IMF official have said they want Russian government come sound economic program installment is given, and have made it clear that currency control and boosting money supply printing ruble are not acceptable. In season crashing bank, plunging ruble, bouncing paycheck, failing cropsand rotating government, maybe it is not ultimate insult. But nation that bore Tolstoy and Chekhov, and still regard well-written letter labor love, is buckling little this week, because it can no longer wish good health Baba Anya Omsk. The Post Office is broke. In 60 country's 89 statelike region, more 1,000 mail car have been sidetracked, many stuffed 18 ton letter, newspaper and parcel. The state Railway Ministry refuse carry more mail Post Office make good some 210 million ruble old bill $13 million today's dollar, or $35 million dollar six week ago. Air mail, which amount one every four or five letter, wa also suspended one Moscow's major airport this week, when Post Office coughed 5 million ruble old bill. A second airport is still demanding 3 million ruble past-due debt. So much mail is backed that post office Moscow and elsewhere have simply stopped accepting out-of-town mail, area that can be easily reached truck. Delivery schedule have fallen week, and perhaps month, behind. The situation is really extraordinary, said Vladimir Sherekhov, deputy chief mail service administration government's Communications Committee. We've never had anything this before. Maybe Post Office ha been lucky. Extraordinary is rule elsewhere Russia. Until Friday, lower house Parliament wa preparing sue government failure provide soap, heat, toilet paper and copy-machine paper legislature's monumental downtown office. It turned out that politician had exhausted their fund cutting short their recess and returning address nation's economic crisis. Earlier week, official said Russia's Arctic shipping route may close next month because half nation's icebreaker are disrepair and there is no money fix them. The oldest ship is so ancient that it nickname is Granny. Such anecdotal evidence that Russia is losing it wheel, one it old, ill-maintained Volga sedan, is everywhere. But oddly, real sign public distress are not particularly common, perhaps because system rarely seems shed part big postal system. If US. Postal Service is increasingly pipeline sweepstakes notice and bill, Russian Post Office still hold special place national conversation. Russians still write letter each other, frequently and fervently, and many remote region get their news mail. Millions use mail ship canned good and other provision needy relative and friend faraway area, especially vital service winter. And last few year, Post Office ha become vehicle growing mail-order trade book, clothes and other catalog item not readily available big city. Exactly why all this ha rumbled halt is some dispute. What is clear is that Post Office and Railway Ministry suffer what ail every Russian venture, private and public alike: Nobody pay his bill. The state Railway Ministry complains that it is continually stiffed customer who believe railroad are honor-bound carry freight whether they are paid or not. The government ha specified nearly 40 category freight which railroad must carry next nothing. Among biggest deadbeat are power ministry military and interior department which not pay Soviet time and feel little need pay now. It's psychology formed socialist period, said Tatiana Pashkova, deputy spokeswoman ministry, and same situation exists Post Office. We've been dispute very long time. Always we try understand their difference. But we can't carry cargo free. No kidding, say Post Office: It, too, is owed 200 million ruble government agency, and is barred raising rate though freight cost are outstripping revenue. Moreover, Post Office is also required government carry some form mail, such pension check, reduced rate. Officials state Communications Department say they also suspect ulterior motive railroads' actions: struggle dominate thriving mail-order business. Here's competition u and railroad delivery parcel, and I think decision made railroad are mainly explained this competition, Sherekhov said. They blame u carrying some commercial cargo instead mail. The Railways Ministry's spokeswoman, Ms. Pashkova, said such commercial cargo are indeed problem, only because railroad know that Post Office ha already gotten cash transport package. The railroad are still waiting their share that money, she said. In meantime, situation ha come boil. In late September railroad cut mail service and out Moscow, effectively decapitating postal system and forcing official draft fleet truck move letter and out city. Hundreds empty and full rail car have clogged some local yard point where moving car position unloading ha become difficult. At last count, 39 loaded car were awaiting service one yard. And customer are getting angry. We've gotten all kind complaint, said Viktor Salikov, deputy Communications Department's mail shipping center. People are coming u, searching mail that wa sent week ago.

The Australian Maritime Safety Authority (AMSA) ha alerted all shipping Bass Strait high wind and huge sea smash remnant 115-boat fleet. An AMSA spokesman said they were alerted that 30-foot Sydney yacht Sword Orion had rolled heavy sea Gabo Island 450 kilometer (280 mile) east Melbourne. Several crewman were injured including one broken leg. The yacht, which ha crew 11, wa halfway Bass Strait when it overturned. The Navy sent Sea King helicopter night-vision and heat-seeking equipment search area and frigate HMAS Newcastle wa it way area. Earlier, wind gusting 80 knot and sea 35 foot caused havoc fleet, several rescue took place. A police helicopter rescued yachtsman swept overboard when Victorian yacht Kingurra wa rolled huge sea 19 nautical mile south Gabo Island. John Campbell, American, wa water 40 minute and wa suffering hypothermia when he wa winched safety senior constable Barry Barclay, who dropped large swell secure Campbell.

One missing yacht B-52 wa found mid-morning Monday and wa making it way Eden New South Wales coast, AusSAR spokesman said. The nine crew board were thought be safe and vessel wa sailing unassisted. The spokesman said no word had been received fate Winston Churchill or sailor swept deck Sword Orion Sunday night. As mid-morning Monday, he had been water 15 hour. The yacht, which ha crew 11, wa halfway Bass Strait when it overturned. The Navy sent Sea King helicopter night-vision and heat-seeking equipment search area and frigate HMAS Newcastle wa it way area. Rescuers more 30 search aircraft were similarly unsure whereabouts and condition Solo Globe and it crew. Seven board Business Post Naiad were put helicopter and flown Merimbula Hospital, center said. The center wa unable identify sailor, say how they died or give detail injury sustained surviving crewman. There were unconfirmed report that one dead sailor wa British.

United States maxi Sayonara look set continue foreign domination line honor Australia's famous Sydney Hobart yacht race, which start Saturday. Sayonara, raced American computer billionaire Larry Ellison, ha only been beaten once it wa launched 1995 and is aiming it second win 630 nautical mile bluewater classic. If 80-footer beat local boat home Hobart, it will be third time four year foreign yacht ha finished first. New Zealand Endeavour trumped local 1992, Sayonara won 1995 and German's Morning Glory set race record two day, 14 hour, seven minute and 10 second year. Sayonara's rival are expected be last year's line honor winner Brindabella Sydney and new Australian maxi Wild Thing. The contest handicap honor appears more open, there are many who believe Sayonara could become sixth yacht do line honor and handicap double. Ellison belief unforeseen damage is only major barrier victory. She is much more modern boat Brindabella, if we don't break, we should beat Brindabella, we should beat anybody, Ellison said. If we hold together we should win race, question is if this boat come and pay u favor we would just love knock record. Ellison say Sayonara can knock half day Morning Glory's record given right condition. Brindabella's captain and owner George Snow belief new record is possible. I think front boat will be very close all way down, which will be great challenge, said Snow. We are well set up, we've got best crew we've ever had and I think boat is great shape, Snow added. The race is tipped start Saturday freshening north easter prospect shower and thunder storm southerly change 25-30 knot later day. The southerly is expected ease 15-20 knot Sunday swinging back north Monday west south westerly change expected move Tasmania and Bass Strait Tuesday when first yacht is anticipated finish. Two sailor died and 15 were missing gale-force wind and high sea battered yacht Sydney-to-Hobart yacht race Monday. There are two that have been confirmed deceased which is tragedy because 54-year history race I think there's only two people who have died it before, said Australian Maritime Safety Authority spokesman David Gray. The two dead were found 40-foot vessel Business Post Naiad, 100 kilometer (60 mile) New South Wales state town Merimbula. Gray said Business Post Naiad owner-skipper Bruce Guy and first-time race participant Phil Skeggs were killed. Both men were Launceston northern Tasmania. Guy suffered heart attack one two occasion yacht rolled, Gray said, while Skeggs drowned when he wa unable free himself safety harness. Their body were left board boat attempt were being made recover them soon possible. Race official said Guy sailed two previous Sydney Hobart yacht race. Grave fear were held safety nine crew missing cutter Winston Churchill, while contact ha been lost five crew Solo Globe. British sailor Glyn Charles wa swept Sword Orion Sunday night when boat rolled wild sea. At 12:30 pm. local time (0130 GMT) Monday Charles had been missing 17 hour.

British sailor Glyn Charles wa missing and presumed drowned becoming third fatality Sydney-to-Hobart yacht race while three remained missing rough sea nightfall Monday. Robin Poke, spokesman Australian Maritime Safety Authority (AMSA), admitted it wa unlikely 33-year-old Charles could survive more 24 hour sea being washed Sword Orion Sunday night. He ha been out there 10-meter (30-feet) wave and 80-kilometer (50-mile) wind, Poke said Monday. He will be superman if he make it. Charles sailed four Admiral's Cups and represented Britain Star Class 1996 Atlanta Olympics where he finished 11th. Two sailor died gale-force wind and high sea battered entrant. Four member veteran cutter Winston Churchill were winched safety liferaft dark Monday. Two more crew Winston Churchill were plucked second liferaft late Monday night, three who had been liferaft were still missing. We are unsure what ha happened other three, it appears they were washed out liferaft, spokesman authority said. The two dead, Australians, were found 40-foot vessel Business Post Naiad, 100 kilometer (60 mile) New South Wales state town Merimbula.

Guy suffered heart attack one two occasion yacht rolled while Skeggs drowned when he wa unable free himself safety harness. Their body were left board boat attempt were being made recover them soon possible, rescue official said. Dad loved sailing, said Bruce Guy's son Mark Guy. He loved competition. He also loved beer and talk race. Dad simply loved life. Winston Churchill skipper Richard Winning wa one four rescued. The worst thing whole affair wa that we got life raft and became separated others, damned thing capsized twice these great sea night which is bloody frightening, let me tell you, Winning said. You have got four u this little canopy and next thing is you are upside down. I wouldn't want have spent another night out there.

Mission Control ordered pilot fire shuttle thruster put extra three mile Endeavour and space junk, putting Endeavour total five mile orbiting debris. The smaller gap would have been probably little too close comfort, Mission Control said. The bigger worry, far, wa Endeavour's pursuit and capture Zarya, and it coupling Unity. The shuttle's 50-foot robot arm had never handled object massive 41-foot, 44,000-pound Zarya, power and propulsion module that wa launched Kazakstan Nov. 20. It will provide all necessary electricity and steering fledgling space station permanent control module can be launched next summer. Minutes Zarya's capture, Cabana called that two antenna module were still undeployed Russian flight controller had feared. The antenna must be fully deployed order Zarya's manual docking system work; that system won't be needed next summer, official said. The only other problem wa Zarya battery; astronaut took replacement part. The 36-foot, 25,000-pound Unity, first American-made component, will serve connecting passageway, or vestibule, future module. It wa crucial that Zarya and Unity be joined; if they could not be connected robot arm, NASA would have sent out two spacewalking astronaut manually fit them together. In all, three spacewalks are planned Endeavour's 12-day flight, not only hook electrical connection two module install handrail and other tool future crew. The joined module will be released Endeavour once all work is completed. NASA estimate 43 more launch and 159 more spacewalks will be needed this mission assemble entire orbiting complex. Once completed, 16-nation space station will have mass 1 million pound, be longer football field, and house seven astronaut and cosmonaut. WASHINGTON NASA and Russian Space Agency have agreed set aside last-minute Russian request launch international space station orbit closer Mir, official announced Friday. While putting new station closer Russia's 12-year-old Mir station would make it easier transfer equipment and supply old outpost new one, request came too late be acted on, said Randy Brinkley, NASA's space station program manager. NASA wa surprised last week when Russia's prime station contractor proposed orbital position change just two-and-a-half week launch first part new station. Delaying Nov. 20 flight 10 hour match orbit would have forced similar shift subsequent assembly flight, and resulted potentially unfavorable sun angle solar-powered station, engineer said. We have mutually concluded that it would not be prudent make these change, Brinkley said news conference held Johnson Space Center Houston. It added technical complexity and risk mission that were not justified. The decision, which followed frank and candid discussion two partner, wa not imposed United States, he said. The conclusion were mutual, Brinkley said. Both side concluded that it not make sense. The Russians, struggling find money their space program their nation economic collapse, had said they wanted transfer thousand pound newer equipment and scientific instrument Mir economy move. However, some critic questioned Russians' motif, wondering if requested orbital change wa part plan delay decommissioning and destruction Mir, which Russians have agreed do next summer. The Russians have so little money that United States and other partner international station fear that money spent Mir will prevent Russia meeting it obligation new project. The Mir competes international space station very critical resource and funding, Brinkley said. NASA will consider idea salvaging Mir's research equipment use international space station, he said, only if it doe not interfere assembling new station. The United States and 15 other nation plan begin building new station orbit next week when Russians launch module that will supply power and propulsion early stage five-year construction period.

Mission Control ordered pilot fire shuttle thruster put extra three mile Endeavour and space junk, putting Endeavour total five mile orbiting debris. The smaller gap would have been probably little too close comfort, Mission Control said. The bigger worry, far, wa Endeavour's pursuit and capture Zarya, and it coupling Unity. The shuttle's 50-foot robot arm had never handled object massive 41-foot, 44,000-pound Zarya, power and propulsion module that wa launched Kazakstan Nov. 20. It will provide all necessary electricity and steering fledgling space station permanent control module can be launched next summer. Minutes Zarya's capture, Cabana called that two antenna module were still undeployed Russian flight controller had feared. The antenna must be fully deployed order Zarya's manual docking system work; that system won't be needed next summer, official said. The only other problem wa Zarya battery; astronaut took replacement part. The 36-foot, 25,000-pound Unity, first American-made component, will serve connecting passageway, or vestibule, future module. It wa crucial that Zarya and Unity be joined; if they could not be connected robot arm, NASA would have sent out two spacewalking astronaut manually fit them together. In all, three spacewalks are planned Endeavour's 12-day flight, not only hook electrical connection two module install handrail and other tool future crew. The joined module will be released Endeavour once all work is completed. NASA estimate 43 more launch and 159 more spacewalks will be needed this mission assemble entire orbiting complex. Once completed, 16-nation space station will have mass 1 million pound, be longer football field, and house seven astronaut and cosmonaut. For second day row, astronaut boarded space shuttle Endeavour Friday liftoff NASA's first space station construction flight. Let's go do this, said commander Robert Cabana. Amen, replied launch controller. Rain and cloudy sky were once again threat. But NASA wa confident master alarm Endeavour's cockpit would behave; it went just 4{ minute go countdown Thursday, forcing delay. NASA ha only five minute or le each day launch Endeavour order meet first space station part, which wa put orbit two week ago Russians. The shuttle contains second station component. The master alarm blared and red light flashed just shuttle wa lift early Thursday. By time controller traced problem momentary drop hydraulic pressure and decided press ahead, it wa too late they had missed cutoff second or two. Sure, it's frustrating, said Bill Readdy, shuttle program director and veteran shuttle commander. But we do thing right. We do thing book, and we're not going cut any corner if it mean just shaving second or two. The six astronaut crawled out shuttle, and two threw their hand. Cabana held his thumb and index finger half-inch apart: We were that close. The problem wa confined one Endeavour's three hydraulic pressure unit. The pressure dropped just long enough trigger alarm, evidently because sensitive switch, then returned normal. NASA engineer spent day examining problem, found nothing wrong any system and were confident it would not reoccur. Endeavour's flight is already year late because cash crunch Russia, one NASA's partner building international space station. The one-day delay cost NASA $600000, mostly fuel and overtime pay. Aboard Endeavour is American-made connecting passageway named Unity. The astronaut will use shuttle robot arm capture Russian space station piece and attach it Unity. Then, two spacewalker will hook all electrical connection and cable two cylinder, and attach handrail and tool future crew. Until alarm sounded, it looked though weather would be only problem. Rain and cloud moved Atlantic 1{ hour liftoff, drifted away minute spare. Secretary State Madeleine Albright and other dignitary world had gathered drizzle see Endeavour and it crew off. Here we have 16 country cooperating venture future, said Albright, who wa expected back Friday's attempt. This is good investment. The planet's most daring construction job began Friday shuttle Endeavour carried orbit six astronaut and first U.S.-built part international space station that is expected cost more $100 billion. After last-minute alarm shuttle forced postponement early Thursday, launch went flawlessly 3:36 Friday morning, right schedule. The night sky wa clear, and moon full. With roar, Endeavour made it fiery ascent and briefly turned Florida coastline night day. More five minute and 500 mile later, spaceship's main engine could still be seen distance, twinkling new star. On their 12-day flight, Endeavour's astronaut are locate Russian part already orbit, grasp it shuttle's robot arm and attach new US. module. Wielding tool hundred mile Earth, working methodically cold void, astronaut will be starting five-year assembly that is likely make construction Pyramids and great cathedral look child's play. Construction station, which will be research facility, will require estimated 160 space walk, which, safety reason, will always be done two people. When complete, international space station, dominated solar power array, will cover area equal that two football field. Modules interconnected laboratory and living quarter seven astronaut are form habitat equal that two 747 jetliner. The station's battery alone, if lined up, would extend half-mile. The project entail high risk, because technical difficulty putting all this together unforgiving environment space, danger inherent flying space shuttle construction site. The work is further complicated international politics and worry money. The Russians, whose participation partnership clinched post-Cold War deal five year ago, are now wild card. Moscow's economic and political woe have left Western official unsure it ability and willingness come it share money and technology. At same time, station's cost are rising, and it critic scientist worry that it appetite money will consume their federal financing. The project's total cost is subject debate, most credible estimate now put price assembly and operation decade, station's estimated lifetime, $110 billion. Of that, American taxpayer are spend roughly $96 billion, and project's 15 foreign partner $14 billion. The station is intended be grand laboratory where, environment weightlessness, investigator can develop new material and new drug and explore physiology's remaining mystery, part so that human may someday know how adapt long space flight other world. Friday, any case, little wa heard project praise. Great show, Endeavour, mission control Houston radioed six astronaut shuttle went orbit. At Florida spaceport, Secretary State Madeleine Albright lauded launching team and new venture. That wa truly, truly fantastic, she told team liftoff. And it wa important, she added, have so many nation working together kind issue that 21st century is going be concerned with. So my congratulation all you, secretary said. Stupendous work. The main cargo Thursday wa Unity module, first U.S.-built station part. Small compared giant come three dozen shuttle flight assembly, unit is 18 foot long, weighs 13 ton and is serve connecting hub other module. Saturday, one astronaut, Lt. Col. Nancy Currie Army, is have shuttle's robot arm hoist Unity payload bay and secure it Endeavour's docking system, moving unit horizontal vertical position. Then, Sunday, astronaut are rendezvous module known Zarya, or Sunrise, which Russia launched orbit Kazakhstan Nov. 20. Financed United States built Russia, Zarya, 41 foot long, is be kind tugboat embryonic station, furnishing power and propulsion well communication and rendezvous ability. When Endeavour's payload bay is 10 foot Zarya, Colonel Currie is reach out robot arm and pull Russian module position Unity. The mechanical arm ha never moved anything so big. Zarya, while completely weightless space, ha 21 ton mass. If mishandled, it can crush and kill. As Col. Currie hold Zarya steady, Endeavour's commander, Col. Robert Cabana Marine Corps, veteran three space flight, is nudge shuttle forward join two station piece together. When mated special attachment, Zarya and Unity will form station's first element, 63 foot long and 78 foot wide out tip solar array. Starting Monday, pair space-walking astronaut are hook electrical connection and data cable unit, attach antenna and install tool and handrail future visitor. The builder will be Col. Jerry Ross Air Force, 50, and Dr. James Newman, 42, physicist. Their series three space walk will continue Wednesday and end Saturday, Dec. 12. As construction go outside, astronaut Endeavour will be busy making preparation enter new station connecting tunnel and docking system. Next Thursday, crew will enter embryonic station first time, installing portable fan and light. Friday they will again enter, prepare arrival 1999 next major element, first one built and financed Russia. The other astronaut Endeavour are it pilot, Maj. Frederick Sturckow Marine Corps, and mission specialist, Sergei Krikalev Russian Space Agency. After separating new outpost, crew is bring Endeavour back Kennedy Space Center Dec. 15, mission length just shy 12 day. Gretchen McClain, NASA's director Washington international space station, said interview here that it overall cost were actually small individual Americans. Over it lifetime, she said, annual cost will equal that pizza and soft drink each nation's 96 million taxpayer. US. cost construction, she added, were $24 billion, and operation year 2012 were $10.4 billion, total $34.4 billion. Most expert agency consider this figure ridiculously low because it ignores many billion dollar spent early development work well cost numerous shuttle flight, which run $800 million apiece. Following series intricate maneuver and skillful use space shuttle Endeavour's robot arm, astronaut Sunday joined first two many segment that will form international space station. The shuttle and it crew six snared Russian-made Zarya control module chasing it Earth ever-closing orbit throughout day. Less hour rendezvous 240 mile Earth shortly 6 p.m., Lt. Col. Nancy Currie Army deftly used 50-foot arm grab 40,000-pound cylinder craft passed Russia and slowly pull it shuttle. Seeing Zarya close, Col. Robert Cabana Marines, shuttle commander, confirmed that two antenna had failed deploy module it launch Kazakhstan Nov. 20. There were earlier indication that antenna, which will be used later station manually assist spacecraft docking, had not extended. Currie took almost two hour painstakingly move Zarya American-made Unity docking port positioned Endeavour's cargo bay. When two piece were aligned inch one another, Cabana fired small thruster rocket that raised shuttle, allowing module clamp together. The two station piece, together measuring 77 foot end end and having combined mass 70,000 pound, are first 100 major component be united space next five year form orbiting outpost that would weigh almost million pound and span area size two football field. More 40 additional mission US. shuttle and Russian rocket will be used haul all component and other supply orbit, and astronaut nation are spend almost 1,800 hour doing spacewalks assemble entire structure. The spece station is expected cost it partnership 16 nation more $40 billion just construct. Bringing piece together is only first step mating them. A pair astronaut are make three spacewalks this week, first Monday, which they will hook electrical and communication cable, remove cover, attach handrail and perform other task get module work one unit. The most difficult part Sunday's mating $240 million Zarya $300 million Unity wa bringing them together shuttle caught Russian unit. Currie had use Canadian-built robot arm place Zarya top Unity being able see where piece joined. Unity, raised Endeavour's cargo bay Saturday, is so large that it blocked Currie's view mating fixture shuttle's window. She used view remote camera and computerized vision system built arm estimate relative position two large segment. The computerized system examined marking module, computed their relationship one another using mark and displayed result laptop computer. We've never done anything this before, Currie said flight, adding that she had practiced difficult maneuver more 100 time last two year. The flight Endeavour, which took Cape Canaveral, Fla., last Friday, had gone according plan early Sunday, when mission control ordered shuttle change it orbit slightly avoid piece space debris. Air Force space debris tracker noted that shuttle wa pas 1.6 mile spent stage American booster rocket launched last month. Although this wa considered safe distance, shuttle controller decided widen separation five mile extra precaution. Endeavour and it astronaut closed Sunday capture first piece international space station, Russian-made Zarya control module that had be connected Unity chamber shuttle. Stacking two giant cylinder 240 mile Earth wa considered most difficult part mission. The job fell Nancy Currie, shuttle crane operator who had deftly hoisted and repositioned Unity cargo bay Saturday. The two station piece are so big 77 foot tip one tip other combined mass 70,000 pound that Currie and her crewmates were going have rely computerized vision system and camera view, rather direct line sight. Such blind docking had never been attempted before. Mission Control gave astronaut plenty time task. The main thing I've tried do last two year working this flight is make sure we have time. We have margin everything, said flight director Bob Castle. Before beginning their final approach Zarya Russian Sunrise shuttle's six astronaut had steer clear chunk rocket launched last month California. Mission Control ordered pilot fire shuttle thruster put extra three mile Endeavour and space junk, putting Endeavour total five mile orbiting debris. The smaller gap would have been probably little too close comfort, Mission Control said. The bigger worry, far, wa Endeavour's pursuit and capture Zarya, and it coupling Unity. The shuttle's 50-foot robot arm had never been assigned handle object massive 44,000-pound Zarya, power and propulsion module that wa launched Kazakhstan Nov. 20. It will provide all necessary electricity and steering fledgling space station permanent control module can be launched next summer. The 36-foot, 25,000-pound Unity will serve connecting passageway, or vestibule, future module. In case Zarya and Unity could not be connected robot arm, two spacewalking astronaut would have manually fit them together. The astronaut would be going out anyway Monday attach electrical connector and cable two component. In all, three spacewalks were planned Endeavour's 12-day flight. NASA estimate 43 more launch and 159 more spacewalks will be needed this mission assemble entire orbiting complex. Once completed, 16-nation space station will have mass 1 million pound, be longer football field, and house seven astronaut and cosmonaut. Endeavour's astronaut connected first two building block international space station Sunday, creating seven-story tower shuttle cargo bay. It wa first time that Russian-built Zarya control module and made-in-America Unity chamber had ever touched. It looked be perfect and, hopefully, long-lasting fit. We have capture Zarya, commander Robert Cabana announced moment two piece came together. Congratulations crew good ship Endeavour, replied Mission Control. That's terrific. The 240-mile-high construction job began two hour earlier Nancy Currie's capture Zarya (Russian Sunrise) using shuttle robot arm. We're halfway home, Cabana said. Then came hard part: stacking two giant cylinder cargo bay. The two station piece are so big 77 foot tip one tip other combined mass 70,000 pound that Currie and her crewmates had rely computerized vision system and camera view, rather direct line sight. This wa first time such blind docking had ever been attempted. Currie positioned solar-winged Zarya, still end shuttle robot arm, several inch directly Unity. It wa slow going; she wanted and needed perfect alignment. Once she wa sure she had it, Cabana fired Endeavour's thruster, and brief burst raised shuttle and thereby Unity enough docking mechanism two station component snap together. The historical moment occurred South Pacific. It took several try, however, Zarya and Unity be pulled tightly together. The docking ring them would not retract properly; Mission Control quickly traced problem attached robot arm and asked crew release it hold docked Zarya. That trick. The union intended last station's 15-year or more lifetime set stage spacewalk two astronaut Monday attach electrical connector and cable two component. Mission Control thought Sunday's work might take hour longer planned and gave six astronaut plenty time task. But everything occurred more or le when and how it wa supposed to, aside piece space junk that strayed too close. Before beginning their final approach Zarya, six astronaut had steer clear chunk rocket launched last month California.

A last-minute alarm forced NASA halt Thursday's launching space shuttle Endeavour, mission start assembling international space station. Another attempt Endeavour and it crew six astronaut is scheduled Friday 3:36 am. This wa first time three year, and 19 flight, that shuttle countdown had been stopped spaceship wa fueled and crew craft and ready go. The uncommon delay prompted frown and furrowed brow here, although official stressed that it wa entirely warranted. We want err conservative side, Ralph Roe, launch director Kennedy Space Center, said news conference sudden halt countdown just 19 second liftoff. Everything had been going smoothly rare nighttime launching, set 3:58 Thursday morning. The weather, forecast be iffy, turned out be fine, and sky wa alight nearly full moon. But length so-called launching window wa, planned, unusually short only 10 minute. That brevity wa result Endeavour's having rendezvous space-station part that Russia put orbit last month. The show-stopper arose four minute liftoff when computer space shuttle set master alarm. Controllers studied data and discovered momentary pressure drop one hydraulic system that control movement shuttle's engine and it rudder and other flight surface. Officials eventually decided that pressure drop wa insignificant, and they resolved press ahead. But then it wa too late: time had run out one procedure needed keep shuttle's fuel supercold. So countdown wa aborted just 19 second blastoff. The six astronaut began emerge shuttle hour later and ultimately headed bed rest another attempt early Friday. ","On Friday the shuttle Endeavor carried six astronauts into orbit to start building an international space station.The launch occurred after Russia and U.S. officials agreed not to delay the flight in order to orbit closer to MIR, and after a last-minute alarm forced a postponement.On Sunday astronauts joining the Russian-made Zarya control module cylinder with the American-made module to form a 70,000 pounds mass 77 feet long.NASA estimates 43 more launches and 159 more space walks are needed to assemble the complex.When completed the 16-nation space station will be longer than a football field.It will be used to study adaptation to space flight.","Russia and NASA jointly decided against a Russian cost-cutting proposal to orbit the 2nd space station, a 16-country cooperative project, closer to Mir, citing complexity, risk, and bad sun angles.After 5 years of assembly, the research station will house 7 people.A 12-day shuttle mission will attach the US Unity module to the Russian Zarya, already in orbit.Thursday's launch was delayed by a pressure drop.A 2nd attempt Friday was perfect.Unity was attached to Zarya in a blind docking using cameras and computer images.Electrical and cable connections come next.Unity will serve as a passageway for future modules.Two Zarya antennas failed to deploy.","After discarding a suggested change of orbit, the Russian Space Agency went ahead with plans to launch its Zarya module of the international space station on Nov. 20, 1998.Although delayed for a day, U.S. plans to launch the space shuttle Endeavour carrying the U.S. module Unity and six astronauts were carried out on Dec. 4.The astronauts' job was to connect Unity with the already-orbiting Zarya as the first step in assembling 100 major components of the planned space station.Using the shuttle's 50-foot robot arm, the two modules were joined setting the stage for a spacewalk by two astronauts the next day to attach electrical connectors and cables.","The International Space Station when completed will have a million pound mass and be longer than a football field.It will house up to seven space explorers.The initial assembly of space station components involves linking the US Unity, carried into space by the shuttle Endeavour, with the Russian Zarya.The Russians had asked for a different launch profile in order to be able to transfer equipment from its MIR station, but that was not possible.Endeavour astronauts successfully completed the complicated maneuvers to join the two space objects.NASA estimates that 43 more launches will be required to completely assemble the 16-nation space station."
33,"Making their first collective decision monetary policy, 11 European nation launching common currency Jan. 1 cut interest rate Thursday surprise move that won market confidence. Ten 11 country joining European economic union dropped their key interest rate 3 percent, Portugal making most significant plunge, 3.75 percent. Austria made smallest cut, 3.2 percent. The exception wa Italy, which cut 4 3.5 percent. It is expected drop common rate time euro is launched. Unifying interest rate is critical step laying groundwork monetary union, and analyst generally expected rate settle level Germany's, 3.3 percent cut, now 3 percent. However, interest rate level had become contentious political issue center-left government Germany and France pushing rate cut help spur growth and combat unemployment, stuck 10.9 percent nation adopting euro. The head European Central Bank that will set monetary policy euro nation, Wim Duisenberg, again Thursday suggested government should reform rigid labor market create job, and not pressure him cut rate. The remark Brussels cut were made gave no hint that rate drop wa imminent, made clear his resistance political pressure wa strong ever. So strong, fact, that Dutch Finance Minister Gerrit Zalm said he had feared bank would delay decision. What had been feared wa that, order prove it independence, ECB would go it analysis and would wait longer, which would have been nonsensical, Zalm said. Hans Tietmeyer, who run German Bundesbank which ECB is modeled, hinted rate cut wa designed boost confidence new currency, dampened global economic crisis and Europe's worsening outlook. The coordinated rate cut could lead reduction current pessimism and reduction financial market turbulence, Tietmeyer said. The cut seemed have desired impact. Frankfurt's main index closed 2.1 percent, while France's wa 1.8 percent. The cut also boosted market Spain, Belgium, Italy and Britain, which is not nation launching euro. The reaction is, `Oh good, they're doing little bit prop euro economy.' But confidence ha taken quite hit Europe recently, and I think further action ECB will be needed next year, maybe 2.5 percent, James Mitchell, senior London-based strategist Nomura. An economist Banque Bruxelles Lambert, Liesbeth Van de Craen, said cut were timely. We are clearly headed slowdown, she said. Until recently, Europe's economy had held out relatively well damage Asia and Russia's economic crisis and unstable financial market. But just two day ago, Duisenberg painted bleakest picture Europe's economy, warning growth will likely slow 2.5 percent next year earlier expectation 3 percent. The rate cut may help. By making it cheaper borrow money, rate cut can lead more investment and new business, making it le worthwhile and inducing people spend. That expands economy. The 11 country launching euro are Austria, Belgium, Ireland, Italy, Finland, France, Germany, Luxembourg, Netherlands, Spain and Portugal. Wim Duisenberg, head new European Central Bank, said interview published Wednesday that he won't step completing half his term earlier agreed. I had hoped you wouldn't ask me that question. The answer is no, Duisenberg told Le Monde daily, which had asked him if he would step four year job. Duisenberg wa named this spring head new European Central Bank, which will govern policy euro, new single currency which go effect Jan. 1. France surprised it euro partner proposing it central banker, Jean-Claude Trichet, last minute job Duisenberg wa expected secure easily. Although he wa elected easily, Duisenberg agreed step four year his eight year term although he ha said no such gentleman's agreement exists. Duisenberg told Le Monde, newspaper that fervently ha backed euro, that the introduction new currency is most significant step so far European unification. However, he said that he would see further political integration, especially area foreign tax and social policy. China made trading euro official Monday, announcing authorization European common currency's use trade and financial dealing starting Jan. 1. The expected announcement central People's Bank China and State Administration Foreign Exchange, carried official Xinhua News Agency, also authorized opening euro account. Financial institution, enterprise and individual China can accept and use euro economic, trade and financial exchange 11 member European Union effective January 1, 1999, Xinhua reported. In addition, they can convert, use and open euro account, it said. Chinese official have said government may convert proportion it dlrs 145 billion worth foreign exchange reserve euro currency's Jan. 1 debut. The 11 country launching common currency are Austria, Belgium, Ireland, Italy, Finland, France, Germany, Luxembourg, Netherlands, Spain and Portugal. The annual inflation rate 11 nation that adopt euro their shared currency Jan. 1 fell 0.9 percent November, European Union's statistic agency reported Wednesday. The fall continued steady decline inflation euro-zone year. Annual inflation stood 1 percent October and 1.6 percent November 1997, according Eurostat's monthly report. In 15 nation EU whole, inflation fell 1 percent November compared 1.5 percent United States and 0.8 percent Japan. Germany, France, Italy, Spain, Netherlands, Belgium, Austria, Portugal, Finland, Ireland and Luxembourg are set adopt euro common currency midnight New Year's Eve. The latest figure may hint trouble ahead euro-zone significant increase year Portugal and Ireland. With European Central Bank setting common interest rate whole bloc, some economist fear low rate designed boost core EU economy France and Germany may bring overheating smaller nation faster growth. There wa good news Greece which wa kept out euro-zone failing meet economic condition joining, including low inflation. It's rate wa 3.9 percent November 5 percent year before. Greece hop join euro-zone 2001. Denmark, Sweden and Britain decided stay out euro political reason. Eurostat gave rate November 1998, November 1997 brackets: Sweden, 0.1 (2.7); France, 0.2 (1.4); Germany, 0.6 (1.4); Austria, 0.5 (1.1); Luxembourg, 0.5 (1.5); Belgium, 0.6 (1.3 percent); Denmark, 1.1 (1.6); Netherlands, 1.5 (2.5); Finland, 0.9 (1.8); Britain, 1.4 (1.9); Spain, 1.4 (1.9); Italy, 1.7 (1.8); Portugal, 2.6 (1.9); Ireland, 2.2 (1.1); Greece, 3.9 (5). In his most candid remark economy, European Central Bank President Wim Duisenberg said Friday that growth appears be slowing 11 country adopting EU common currency or euro Jan. 1. Despite area-wide survey that suggested moderation pace growth, Duisenberg said domestic demand will continue boost economy. He pointed also gradual improvement labor market condition supporting growth, well interest-rate cut 3.3 percent level euro-zone's lowest rate country. Duisenberg, who spoke event London, said Dec. 1 and Dec. 22 meeting Central Bank's policy-making body will gauge outlook inflation and EU economy. The bank, which will set monetary policy currency bloc, ha been pressure politician keep interest rate low help boost growth and create job. While inflation is it lowest level decade just 1 percent euro-zone unemployment 11 nation remains stubbornly high 10.9 percent. Struggling avoid being sidelined Continent-wide equity market promised Europe's soon-to-be-introduced single currency, French authority said Thursday that Paris stock exchange would join alliance London and Frankfurt that is seen precursor pan-European market. The Bourse Paris also announced that it would play host meeting Nov. 27 nine other European exchange discus step and condition needed create unifying and competitive pan-European equity market. The two announcement show how introduction currency, euro, is reshaping Europe's financial landscape, requiring Europeans think Continental rather national term finance and business. And it suggested that exchange authority Paris, ruffled announcement July strategic alliance London Stock Exchange and Deutsche Borse Frankfurt, had not only abandoned effort set rival market were also seeking gain initiative organizing Nov. 27 gathering. Some doubt remained, however, timing and technicality French entry alliance. Foreign Minister Dominique Strauss-Kahn said, Paris is joining this alliance creation January 1999 joint company. However, official London and Frankfurt who welcomed idea principle declined say whether timing and arrangement were far advanced Strauss-Kahn implied. I'm afraid I can't confirm anything that, spokeswoman London Stock Exchange said. The appearance are well ahead reality this point, said American banker, who spoke condition anonymity. Not only that, notion Europe-wide exchange raise technical question compatibility not just trading system also regulation governing stock market operation country that will use euro beginning January. That ha led some analyst forecast that pan-European exchange could not be and running 2000. There are awful lot issue be resolved, American banker said. The euro is be introduced electronic trading equity, bond and future and intergovernmental transfer. Notes and coin pocket money that shopper and traveler will carry will be introduced only 2002. Initially, currency will group 11 European nation euro zone, leaving Britain, Denmark, Sweden and Greece outside. With it concentration banking and trading, however, London is expected continue main market center. The prospect ha heightened pressure consolidation exchange. Stock market official Milan, Madrid, Amsterdam and Brussels have indicated they would be interested joining London-Frankfurt alliance, which will initially create single point liquidity trading British and German blue-chip issue. The London exchange estimate that pan-European stock exchange would group together company market capitalization $5.5 trillion, compared $8.7 trillion New York Stock Exchange. The Paris Bourse, third largest European exchange and last major holdout pan-European market, said that it had also invited official exchange Zurich and Stockholm attend Nov. 27 meeting. A spokeswoman said official London Stock Exchange would be meeting. Also Thursday, New York Mercantile Exchange and International Petroleum Exchange here acknowledged that they were merger that would bring together two biggest energy future market. Discussions began July, and exchange have formed working group study merger. They already cooperate development system intended coordinate after-hours electronic trading. Palm Pilot one hand, cellular phone other, Jean-Marc Routiers, 26, wa juggling business call halfway London and Paris. When his phone went dead high-speed Eurostar train pulled underwater tunnel that link England Continent, London-based French banker loosened his Italian silk tie and introduced himself. I definitely describe myself European, he said fluent English he perfected working Australian bank. I may get sentimental when they play Marseillaise, all practical thing, I see myself citizen Europe. I lifestyle France, I don't make my living there. The year 1999 is official start-up date euro, common European currency that will unite 11 country monetarily. But throughout Europe, different kind integration ha already taken root. Routiers, who wa spending day Paris meet his bank's French client, is vanguard new generation Europeans who do not have brace themselves shock new year. Mobile, fluent several language and aggressively non-nationalistic, they are already living kind borderless, cosmopolitan existence that single European currency is supposed advance. They do not share their parents' memory World War II or their parents' sense national identity. People worry when they hear talk common European defense policy because it suggests that end day, we have one government, said Kleon Papadopoulos, Greek banker based London. Countries are afraid lose their sovereignty, I don't see it bad thing. If government is good, stable and efficient, who care if it is based Berlin or Athens? Papadopoulos, 36, who studied business United States and Britain, could serve model new Europeans. He work Swiss bank London, speaks Greek, English and French, and year ha traveled, other place, Belgium, United States, Cuba, Switzerland and Italy. Like hundred thousand other Europeans, he chose London and it busy financial market best place work. He said he doe not feel if he life England. He life London, clubhouse financial Europe. And membership ha it privilege. Papadopoulos life fashionable Knightsbridge area, drive Porsche he bought Brussels, and work out fashionable gym Carleton Towers. I went London School Economics 1984, and only other `foreigners' I met were Middle East, he say. Now friend and co-worker are Italian, French, Greek, Spanish, German, Russian. You feel it everywhere. The street are jammed foreigner. Not tourist people who live and work here. Baby-boomers Europe describe themselves 1968 generation, weaned protest and social turmoil that convulsed European society 30 year ago. Less dramatic equally significant wa 1968 law guaranteeing freedom movement what were then six country Common Market. A Frenchman could work Holland, Italian could work Germany permit. Back then some economist dourly predicted huge migration, particularly unskilled laborer moving southern country more prosperous north. Actually, huge industry steel shrank 1970s and '80s, so job opportunity working-class Europeans. There are 15 country what is now European Union, only small percentage their citizen have moved other country, according estimate prepared Eurostat. Those who do mostly find job service industry waiter, maid or garbage collector. There are still legal barrier preventing most doctor, lawyer and academic finding work other country. So far European Union ha been most profitably put use white-collar business executive who eagerly followed career opportunity national border, time zone and language barrier. Twenty-five year ago that kind mobility wa preserve far smaller elite, top executive major company or multinational corporation. Technology, high-speed train ever-evolving apparatus business lap-top computer, cell phone, fax machine ha made European mobility accessible mid-level manager, young entrepreneur and student. Cable television, which allows Germans watch Italian game show or Swedes watch French news program, ha spread Zeitgeist mass. This year Superga, Italian brand sport clothes and shoe, opened major advertising campaign series magazine ad that show fashionable young people saucily cavorting European leader leggy young woman push her bicycle step Elysee Palace greet President Jacques Chirac, young man playfully stick his tongue out window plane former German chancellor, Helmut Kohl. This kind ad would not have been possible five or 10 year ago, said Aldo Cernuto, executive creative director Milan office Pirella Gottsche Lowe, international advertising agency. Now European unification is TV all time; it ha seeped people's unconscious. Even people who do not care politics recognize face Tony Blair or Jacques Chirac. Ten year ago, very few people did. According European Union, Britain ha twice many EU citizen France, it is not country highest concentration resident other European country. According estimate based survey prepared Eurostat, nearly third resident tiny Luxembourg, which ha low unemployment and high standard living, are other European country. Belgium, which ha European Commission and NATO headquarters, is second, 5.4 percent. Paradoxically, perhaps, Britain, one major European nation that ha held joining euro, is widely viewed nerve center new cosmopolitanism, headquarters New Europeans banker and business executive drawn London's financial district, more flexible bureaucracy and universality English language. Perhaps just surprisingly, London also serf example another le obvious aspect European cosmopolitanism breakdown certain social barrier. Studying abroad wa once privilege reserved son and daughter Europe's elite. Now European Union ha 12-year-old scholarship program, called Socrates-Erasmus, that this year allowed 200,000 European university student 5 percent EU's entire university population study other country Union year, free. In last 20 year, business school Europe have multiplied, and most offer U.S.-style MBA program that teach American approach business. This too ha allowed measure meritocracy creep European business. Juergen Schrempp, head Daimler, started car mechanic, noted Stephen Szabo, professor European Affairs Johns Hopkins University School International Studies Washington. That would have been unthinkable Germany 20 year ago. Social mobility, moreover, is fueled movement. When people transfer another country, they find it easier shed psychological or cultural trapping home. I could never have kind job I have had I stayed Paris, Routier explained. France is still very hierarchical. Bosses want know where you went school, what your father doe. In London, none that matter long you make money. Many Britons still view their country weighed heavy class distinction. For example, Tony Smith, 36, editor several Portuguese magazine Lisbon, seized opportunity study Vienna 14 year ago, and never looked back. He ha lived all Europe, and is fluent Portuguese, Spanish, German, French and Serbo-Croatian. His father, car mechanic, had not traveled out Britain 1992. Smith said he could never have succeeded well had he stayed home. I didn't go public school or Oxbridge, he explained. I'm not saying it impossible, it would have been much more difficult England. Yet Continental Europeans who flock London find themselves bypassing English society and joining cosmopolitan world where birth and breeding do not matter much. Ildiko Iliffe, 30, chose work London escape sexism she encountered Continent. Mrs. Iliffe, who is Hungarian, speaks fluent English, German, French and Italian, and met her Canadian husband, Roger Iliffe, 30, while were attending University Bocconi business school Milan 1995. Like his wife, Iliffe speaks four language and ha lived and traveled all world. She work Eastern European desk British bank; he work major international consulting firm. Originally they planned work Italy, Mrs. Iliffe said prevailing attitude working woman there made it impossible her find good job. I went job interview Italian bank and they only asked me my husband's job, she said grimace. And they made it clear that they were afraid I would get pregnant and ask maternity leave. Philippe Haspeslagh, 48, professor Insead, prestigious international business school Fontainebleau, Paris, called Mrs. Iliffe's choice cherry-picking choosing best deal herself. As he put it, If they cannot find what they want one country, they can pick and seek it elsewhere. Twenty-five year ago, Haspeslagh wa pioneer when he same thing. A Belgian who studied business Harvard, he life and teach France and doe consulting work all Europe, Sweden Czech Republic. The message his cell phone is three language French, Flemish and English. His student, generation him, see nothing exceptional his transnationalism. These Europeans form advance guard that is still relatively small number, expert say they carry disproportionate influence their society. In Germany, example, it is business people who are pushing ahead change and pulling politician them kicking and screaming, Szabo said. They are looking larger market and feel competitive pressure globalization. Politicians are responding domestic constituency. They are answering international one.

Saramago's controversial opinion and atheistic outlook have frequently clashed establishment and general public. Even day he won prize, Vatican newspaper L'Osservatore Romano attacked Swedish Academy's choice, describing Saramago old-school communist who had substantially antireligious vision. Undersecretary State Sousa Lara wa so upset one Saramago's novel 1992 that he withdrew his name Portugal's nominee European Literature Prize. At time, Lara said Saramago's 1991 novel O Evangelho Segundo Jesus Cristo (The Gospel according Jesus Christ) offended Portugal's Roman Catholic religious conviction and divided country. The book describes Christ who, subject human desire, life Mary Magdalene and try back out his crucifixion. I have not come bring peace sword, said Saramago, atheist, time. He retreated disgust his Spanish wife, Pilar del Rio, his home Lanzarote Spain's Canary Islands. He ha never courted kind fame offered literary prize, and his bluntness can sometimes offend. I am skeptical, reserved, I don't gush, I don't go smiling, hugging people and trying make friend, he once said. A gaunt man wisp white hair, Saramago wa born Azinhaga, small town Lisbon. From poor family, he never finished university continued study part-time while supporting himself metalworker. His first novel, published 1947 Terra do Pecado, or Country Sin wa tale peasant moral crisis. It sold badly won enough recognition propel him welder's shop literary magazine. But next 18 year, Saramago, communist who opposed 41-year conservative dictatorship Antonio Salazar, published only few travel and poetry book while he worked journalist. He returned fiction only Salazar's regime wa toppled military uprising 1974. Since 1980s, he ha been one Portugal's best-selling contemporary writer and his work have been translated more 20 language. He first won critical acclaim abroad his 1982 historical fantasy Memorial do Convento, published English 1988 Baltasar and Blimunda. It is set Catholic-inspired inquisition and explores war individual and organized religion, picking Saramago's recurring theme loner struggling authority. He is most frequently compared Colombian writer Gabriel Garcia Marquez because his prose is rooted recognizable setting same time tinged magical element. The Nobel citation praised his work that parable sustained imagination, compassion and irony continually enables u apprehend elusory reality. Saramago remains prominent nonconformist his regular newspaper and radio commentary, though his view are always inspired his deep concern his fellow man. Blindness, his most recent book be translated English, is unsettling allegory social meltdown inexplicable blindness sweep society. This blindness isn't real blindness, it's blindness rationality, he said. We're rational being we don't behave rationally. If we did, there'd be no starvation world. In 1989 The History Siege Lisbon, Lisbon proofreader mischievously insert word not text 12th century capture Portuguese capital Moors, thereby fictionally altering course European history stroke his pen. Such historical and literary mischief are Saramago trademark. In his 1986 book, The Stone Raft, Iberian Peninsula snap rest European continent and float North Atlantic apparently metaphorical search identity away standardizing nature European Union, which Portugal and Spain are enthusiastic member. Saramago will receive dlrs 978,000 prize Dec. 10 Stockholm. Former US. President Jimmy Carter, who seems perennial Nobel Peace Prize also-ran, could have won coveted honor 1978 had it not been strict deadline rule nomination. That prize wa shared Egyptian President Anwar Sadat and Israeli Prime Minister Menachem Begin signing Camp David peace accord. However, five-member Norwegian award committee also wanted honor Carter brokering pact, only be foiled their rule. The Nobel committee wanted give prize all three, said Geir Lundestad, current committee's nonvoting secretary, said Sunday. But Carter had not been nominated when deadline ran out. Nominations postmarked Feb. 1 are accepted that year's prize. The committee can add it nomination it first meeting year, early March. The Camp David accord were not signed Sept. 17, 1978, five week that year's peace prize wa annouCkuld not give him prize, Norwegian committee recognized 1978 award citation positive initiative taken President Jimmy Carter. Lundestad said committee, which work deep secrecy it five or six meeting year, tried find loophole rule, which are overseen Swedish Nobel Foundation. The Nobel Prizes were endowed Alfred Nobel, Swedish industrialist whose 355 invention included dynamite. In his 1895 will, Nobel endowed prize, and said peace prize should be picked Norwegian committee and rest Swedish institution. Lundestad said committee turned Swedish Nobel Foundation advice Carter because it wa question principle. Stig Ramel, Swede who wa then director Nobel Foundation, advised breaking rule, Lundestad said telephone. Normally, committee refuse discus candidate keeping strict policy secrecy which selection detail are sealed 50 year. Lundestad made exception because Ramel revealed Carter dilemma his 1994 memoir. Carter ha repeatedly been nominated Nobel prize his consistent and wide-ranging peace effort. He is also 139 candidate prize being announced Oslo Friday. However, early speculation lean more someone involved Northern Ireland peace process, Czech President Vaclav Havel mark 30th anniversary Soviet invasion his country, or human right activist mark 50th anniversary UN. Human Rights Charter. While committee wanted honor Carter and could not, hindsight some regretted prize other reason. Four year Begin won prize, Israeli prime minister ordered invasion southern Lebanon which thousand civilian died. Kare Kristiansen, who served peace prize committee 1991 1994, once said that, had committee waited, Begin probably would not have won. There's room few more name 20th century honor roll writer, and one will be added this week when Swedish Academy announces latest Nobel Literature laureate. Who is chosen and why stimulates animated conversation reader well academic, critic and author themselves. This year's winner or, possibly, winner will be announced Thursday, Academy disclosed Tuesday. The joke you hear is that it go people you never heard of, said Ian Jack, editor London-based Granta literary magazine. But Nobel, awarded most every year 1901, also shine light, deservedly, wonderful writer few people have read, he added. His favorite include Trinidad-born VS. Naipaul, though he's convinced Naipaul probably won't win because his dark . pessimistic and scathing portrayal post-colonial African culture. The academy keep it deliberation secret. Who is considered seriously, who's nominated, isn't disclosed. A writer's nationality, term prize founder Alfred Nobel's will, is supposed be irrelevant. Two can share prize, though last time that happened wa 1974. Winners are expected personally receive it: award are not given posthumously. Looking process afar, Harold Bloom, member American Academy Arts and Letters, said award committee ha unsettling record selection that are nationally 'correct' and politically 'correct.' The winner list is prestigious, he concedes, no mean uniformly lustrous. Absolutely not! Outrageously not, he said telephone interview New York. They include all kind fifth-raters. . James Joyce never got one, heaven's sake. Neither Marcel Proust. Bloom's US. favorite include Cormac McCarthy, author Blood Meridian; Philip Roth, author American Pastoral; and John Ashbery, best living poet. A review recent winner may foreshadow this year's laureate. Seven 10 were men doe that favor woman? Two three were poet doe that favor prose writer? Four 10 wrote English, and last three laureate are European. In comparison, only three Asian writer have ever won. Bei Dao is personal favorite mine, said Abe Harumasa, editor-in-chief Japanese literary magazine Bungei. The choice could be interpreted being motivated partly politics, given poet's association China's democracy movement, it's clear he's wonderful poet. Minoru Takeuchi, professor Chinese literature Japan's prestigious Kyoto University, cited novelist Pa Kin and Xie Bing Xin worthy. The latter is known her portrayal struggle Chinese woman. China, which translates and publishes work many Nobel winner, desperately want it first laureate, he added. Spain's Nobel hope are pinned Francisco Ayala, 92, winner this year's renowned Prince Asturias prize, said Jose Maria Martinez Cachero, author, university professor and secretary jury that selected Ayala. Other presumed Latin candidate are Peru-born Mario Vargas Llosa, member 200-year-old Royal Spanish Language Academy, Martinez Cachero said, and Portugal's Jose Saramago, whose work have been translated more 20 language. For his part, Saramago, 75, said recent Associated Press interview that he's weary speculation that this year, once again, he might win. Let's not get that, he said. I just write. Jose Saramago, 75-year-old Portuguese writer who took literature relatively late life and whose richly imaginative novel soon won him loyal reader Europe and vocal admirer United States, wa awarded this year's Nobel Prize Literature Thursday Swedish Academy Stockholm. A tall, balding man whose large, tinted glass give him mien severity, Saramago is first Portuguese-language writer and one first card-carrying Communists become Nobel Literature laureate. He is also fourth successive European win prize, Italy's Dario Fo 1997, Poland's Wislawa Szymborska 1996 and Ireland's Seamus Heaney 1995. In it citation Thursday, Swedish Academy praised Saramago who parable sustained imagination, compassion and irony continually enables u once again apprehend elusory reality. Although Saramago discount influence Latin American magical realism his work, his novel use supernatural, allegorical, paradoxical and irrational way addressing complex question faith and existence. Many his novel are set backdrop political or historical event, it is his unwavering concern individual fate that give his fiction it distinctive voice and independent character. His best-known book, all published United States, are Baltasar and Blimunda, The Year Death Ricardo Reis, The Stone Raft and The History Siege Lisbon. His latest book available English, Blindness, which all one his character mysteriously become blind, wa described his symphonic new novel Andrew Miller The New York Times Book Review Sunday. There is no cynicism and there are no conclusion, just clear-eyed and compassionate acknowledgment thing they are, quality can only honestly be termed wisdom, Miller, himself novelist, wrote. We should be grateful when it is handed u such generous measure. Saramago learned his award Thursday Frankfurt airport, where he wa preparing fly home Madrid Lanzarote Canary Islands attending Frankfurt Book Fair. Earlier this week, he participated round-table Portuguese writer topic, Why I am still Communist. He immediately returned fair where he wa received cheer and bouquet rose. I am personally very happy myself, he said. I am also happy my country. Later he told news conference: The Portuguese language had wait 100 year this. There have be way and mean protecting language so that it doe not become museum, is something that is alive. The writer's role is protect it and work it. The award wa also celebrated Lisbon, where President Jorge Sampaio described it recognition Portuguese culture, while local Communist leader, Carlos Carvalho, saw it credit his party. As member our party, he noted solemnly, Saramago make great contribution our ideal and struggle social change. The laureate's fiction, though, is never overtly political. Saramago, whose body work includes poetry, essay, play and journal well 10 novel, is unusual having emerged major literary figure only age 60. His novel have been translated 30 language, selling particularly well Portugal, Brazil, Spain, Italy and Germany. While he ha not been well known United States, his novel have always been critically well received there. For all his late blooming, though, Saramago long dreamed becoming writer. Born family rural laborer and raised Lisbon, he wa forced poverty leave school while teen-ager and learn trade car mechanic. Yet he managed publish small novel age 25. Later, he found work Lisbon publishing company, oppressive and censorial atmosphere Salazar dictatorship discouraged him writing. It wa only Portugal's April 1974 revolution that Saramago felt free find his voice. A member Portuguese Communist Party 1969, he served editor Lisbon newspaper, Diario de Noticias, 18-month period when left looked likely seize power Portugal. But anti-Communist backlash November 1975 forced him out newspaper and he began translating French text Portuguese make end meet. In late 1970s, he also turned novel, publishing three succession 1977, 1978 and 1980. But it wa 1982, Baltasar and Blimunda (Memorial do Convento Portuguese), that he achieved his international breakthrough. This is rich, multifaceted and polysemous text that same time ha historical, social and individual perspective, Swedish Academy noted Thursday. The insight and wealth imagination which it give expression is characteristic Saramago's work whole. Set 18th-century Portugal Inquisition, book tell baroque effort war veteran, Baltasar, and visionary, Blimunda, escape heaven flying machine powered human will captured hypersensory Blimunda. This fantastic story take place very real background tortuous construction massive Mafra Convent thousand men held grip Inquisition. When novel wa published United States 1987, Irving Howe acclaimed it brilliant The New York Times Book Review. Mr. Saramago is constantly present voice European skepticism, connoisseur irony, Howe wrote. I think I hear his prose echo Enlightenment sensibility, caustic and shrewd. In his next novel, The Year Death Ricardo Reis, which is also homage great Portuguese poet Fernando Pessoa, who appears it ghost, Saramago set his story early year Salazar dictatorship, tale romantic and sexual misadventure poet-physician. Writing The New York Times, Herbert Mitgang called it rare, old-fashioned novel once lyrical, symbolic and meditative. Saramago, whose sense literary freedom is evident his unconventional punctuation and conflicting use tense, sought different form freedom The Stone Raft, where he imago confusion unleashed when Iberian peninsula suddenly break free rest Europe and begin drifting New World and threatens collide Azores. To delight Britons, Gibraltar is left behind. Unsurprisingly, bitter satire, The Gospel According Jesus Christ, proved controversial, God shown using innocently human Jesus create religion that ha spawned violence and intolerance. When Lisbon jury picked book Portugal's entry 1992 European literary prize, country's conservative government vetoed choice blasphemous. It wa then that Saramago decided leave his small, crowded apartment Lisbon relative solitude Lanzarote. The History Siege Lisbon, published United States last year, is whimsical tale set motion decision humble proofreader publishing house insert word not key passage standard history Portugal. With this lunatic creative act, Edmund White put it The New York Times Book Review, he totally derails national saga affirming that crusader not fact help liberate 12th-century Lisbon Moorish occupation. White ended his July 1997 review prescient remark. Word ha it that Saramago is overdue Nobel Prize, he noted. No candidate ha better claim lasting recognition this novelist. With recent publication Blindness United States, only Saramago's latest novel, Todos o Nomes, or All Names still awaits translation English. In tradition Andre Gide and Julian Green, though, he ha now embarked his journal. The fourth volume these Cadernos de Lanzarote wa just published Lisbon. Saramago will receive his Nobel Prize, worth equivalent $967,500 this year, ceremony Stockholm Dec. 10. Three American pharmacologist were awarded Nobel Prize Monday their surprising discovery how natural production gas, nitric oxide, can mediate wide variety bodily action. Those include widening blood vessel, helping regulate blood pressure, initiating erection, battling infection, preventing formation blood clot and acting signal molecule nervous system. The prize, physiology or medicine, went Dr. Robert Furchgott, 82, State University New York Brooklyn; Dr. Louis Ignarro, 57, University California Los Angeles, and Dr. Ferid Murad, 62, University Texas Medical School Houston. The announcement significant phase discovery two Monday's winner meeting 1986 elicited avalanche research activity many different laboratory world, said Nobel committee Karolinska Institute Stockholm, which make award. Its citation said that research had led new treatment treating heart and lung disease, shock and impotence. Ignarro discovered principle that led use Viagra anti-impotency drug, said Dr. Sten Orrenius, professor toxicology Karolinska Institute. Nitric oxide start process which blood vessel penis widen produce erection. Nitric oxide, chemical relative anesthetic gas nitrous oxide, is better known common air pollutant formed when nitrogen burn, such automobile exhaust fume. But scientist now know it is distributed widely body. The discovery honored Monday were made largely 1980s time when scientist knew that bacteria produced nitric oxide not think it wa important animal and human. The award committee said that this wa first discovery that gas can act signal molecule organism. The discovery wa startling because nitric oxide is totally different any other known signal molecule and so unstable that it is converted nitrate and nitrite 10 second. Recipients Nobel Prize, including some who have lobbied it year, profess surprise learning their award. This year's winner were refreshingly candid. Furchgott said he had planned sleep late Monday, holiday, wa awakened 5:30 his home Hewlett, NY. He said that he knew that previous Nobel prize winner had nominated him award, that he still wa somewhat surprised receive it. I guess I had some good friend voting, Furchgott said. He said he could not get back sleep. Murad said he had pondered odds and thought that maybe I could win prize, if not now maybe couple year. He described award culmination career and said that when it happens, it's incredible. Ignarro wa traveling Italy. Dr. Gerald Levey, dean UCLA, said we actually anticipated this day four year now. The three 1998 winner never worked together, we talked lot shop talk meeting, Furchgott said. Dr. Valentin Fuster, president American Heart Association and head cardiology Mt. Sinai Hospital Manhattan, said that discovery nitric oxide and it function is one most important history cardiovascular medicine. Doctors have learned prize-winning research that heart disease, endothelium, or inner lining artery, make le nitric oxide. Drugs nitroglycerine, however, can help replenish store nitric oxide. Now, drug company are trying develop more powerful heart drug based newer knowledge nitric oxide's role signal molecule. Researchers have also learned that nitric oxide produced endothelium rapidly spread cell membrane underlying muscle cell artery. Then it can shut muscle contraction artery, thus widening them and reducing blood pressure. Inhalation nitric oxide gas ha saved life some people certain lung disease, particularly infant who have developed dangerously high pulmonary blood pressure. But regulating amount nitric oxygen inhaled is critical because too much can be lethal. Nitric oxide play harmful role collapse circulatory system, or shock, resulting overwhelming microbial infection. Bacteria can release product that cause white blood cell release enormous amount nitric oxide. As result, blood pressure drop. Scientists are trying develop drug that can block production nitric oxide such infection. White blood cell also play role attacking cancerous cell. The gas can also induce type programmed cell death known apoptosis. Scientists are studying nitric oxide's effect immune system stop growth cancer. They are also exploring nitric oxide's possible role regulating body temperature. Doctors are measuring production nitric oxide lung and intestine diagnose number ailment, including asthma and colitis, and are studying it role menstruation. Nitric oxide formed nerve cell spread rapidly all direction activate cell vicinity and influence many function, behavior and mobility intestinal tract. Nitric oxide is also being studied it role smell and memory. Nitric oxide's role is still unfolding; scientist have written thousand scientific paper it recent year and have started journal, Nitric Oxide. The Nobel committee cited Furchgott performing 1980 ingenious experiment that showed that drug, acetylcholine, widened blood vessel only if inner layer, or endothelium, wa intact. Furchgott concluded that blood vessel widen because endothelial cell produce signal molecule that he called EDRF, endothelium-derived relaxing factor, which relaxes smooth muscle cell blood vessel. Furchgott's finding led quest identify factor, citation said. (OPTIONAL TRIM CAN BEGIN HERE) The citation not refer accident Furchgott's laboratory that played major role his discovery. In 1995, Annual Review Pharmacology and Toxicology, Furchgott wrote that May 5, 1978, first series planned experiment artery rabbit, technician not follow direction correctly. The technician performed one step experiment instead he wa supposed wash out drug used earlier phase experiment. Furchgott expected that artery would contract. Instead, they relaxed. It wa first time he had seen drug study produce such reaction, and he used insight plan additional experiment. Furchgott omitted technician's name that paper and another 1996 Journal American Medical Association. On Monday, he said David Davidson wa technician. (OPTIONAL TRIM ENDS HERE) The committee cited Ignarro concluding 1986, brilliant series analysis conducted independently Furchgott, that EDRF wa identical nitric oxide. Furchgott said he and Ignarro made announcement same symposium 1986 Mayo Clinic Rochester, Minn., paper were not published 1998. Murad wa cited work conducted year while he worked University Virginia Charlottesville, Stanford University Palo Alto, Calif., and Abbott Laboratories Illinois. Murad said he felt fortunate have heard Furchgott report his early work EDRF 1980. Murad showed that gas could regulate important cellular function and studied how nitroglycerin and related heart drug led release nitric oxide. (OPTIONAL TRIM CAN BEGIN HERE) In his early training Case Western Reserve University Cleveland, Murad worked laboratory Dr. Theodore Rall, who also trained another Nobel prize winner, Dr. Alfred Gilman University Texas Southwestern Dallas. Gilman said interview that he believed Rall, now retired and living Charlottesville, Va., wa first scientist have trained two Nobel Prize winner. In addition, Rall worked Dr. Earl Sutherland, who also won Nobel Prize. In his early reseach year, Murad worked chemical known cyclic guanosine monophosphate, which later turned out be critical nitric oxide story. Murad's trainee referred early work dumping experiment because all they could do laboratory time wa crudely add various hormone and agent slice tissue, cell culture. It took year develop more refined technique that led understanding nitric oxide's many role body. But many year, most scientific community wa skeptical ability free radical nitric oxide activate enzyme, Murad said 1996 when he and Furchgott shared Albert Lasker basic medical research award. (OPTIONAL TRIM ENDS HERE) The Nobel Prizes were created will Alfred Nobel, whose invention dynamite involved use nitroglycerine. The award committee noted odd twist this year's award. When Nobel developed chest pain heart disease, it said, he refused take nitroglycerine his doctor prescribed because he knew it caused headache. Nobel dismissed nitroglycerine's benefit relief chest pain. Nobel died 1896. The prize that three scientist will share is now worth $938,000. When Alfred Nobel wrote direction establishing literature prize his name, he chose unclear word and scratched out few letter. Questions prize have engaged and piqued literary world ever since. A new chapter mystery will be written Thursday, when Swedish Academy announces this year's winner world's most prestigious prize writer. The prize focus intense medium attention Swedish capital and clamor journalist generally drowns out question: Why doe world care so much literary choice handful people quiet and remote country? Does Nobel Prize really recognize best? When asked that question, Swedish Academy permanent secretary Sture Allen smiled and said Look list prizewinners! The answer obscures much it clarifies. On one hand, Nobel Prize ha recognized world-renowned writer such Isaac Bashevis Singer and brought little-known wonder light, such Wislawa Szymborska. But prize arguably also ha honored mediocre, heaping attention those who would have been more fairly served obscurity. Among them is winner first prize 1901, Sully Prudhomme. That choice wa denounced Sweden's leading literary light, August Strindberg, and group Swedes sent letter Leo Tolstoy apologizing Academy's slight not choosing him. Arguments Academy's choice are inevitable, instruction they were given. Nobel's will say prize should recognize literature that work ideal direction. What, exactly, he meant ideal** is unclear and Academy's choice have reflected confusion. The Academy ha chosen interpret word apply work ranging good-hearted charm Szymborska's poetry crushing hopelessness Samuel Beckett's writing. When Nobel wrote word ideal Swedish idealisk** he superimposed last couple letter previous one. Allen wa so curious understand Nobel's thought that he engaged forensic expert try find out what earlier letter were. The expert succeeded point. He found that first word Nobel wrote wa idealirad, word that doesn't exist. Despite inclarity edge, Allen said he is confident that Academy's choice bolster Nobel's core idea that literature would be basis some kind progress. About this year's choice, he won't say more that: Academy is bound keep it deliberation secret. But observer love speculate who might win, who's shortlist prize, this year worth 7.6 million kronor (about dlrs 974,000). Names that freuqently come guessing include VS. Naipaul, China's Bei Dao and Pa Kin, American poet John Ashbery, and Jose Saramago Portugal. A day winning Nobel Prize literature, Portuguese novelist Jose Saramago insisted that while he wa delighted win award, it could just easily have gone many other Portuguese writer. I'm not only one who deserved it, said first Portuguese-language author obtain prestigious award. There have been other Portuguse author, Fernando Pessoa, whose work would justify 1,000 Nobels Speaking packed press coference Madrid, Saramago joked how he heard he had won prize German air hostess Frankfurt airport he waited flight home Spain's Canary Islands. The news left 75-year-old writer no choice leave airport and return city's book fair meet press and public. At that moment I wa moon and returning book fair only thing I wa worried wa that whole thing wa error, said Saramago. Dismissing Vatican paper's disapproval Thursday his achievment, Saramago, known atheist, quipped that he wa aware that Pope had been jury, I wouldn't have won prize. The Vatican is easily upset, said Saramago, I think that Vatican should keep it mind it prayer and leave people alone. Meanwhile Portugal, where Saramago is scheduled arrive Tuesday, delight Swedish Academy's award Saramago wa reflected daily paper, country's three daily sport paper ample space event. The two leading daily, Publico and Diario de Noticias, gave their entire front page Saramago. Lisbon City Hall rushed out poster saying Congratulations Jose Saramago which were hung capital night. Saramago wa born poor, illiterate family Azinhaga, small town Lisbon. He never finished university continued study part-time while supporting himself metalworker. Nothing my life would have led one think I'd win Nobel Prize, said Saramago. I wasn't born win Nobel. I didn't have my book I wa 18. His first novel, published 1947 Terra do Pecado, or Country Sin wa tale peasant moral crisis. For next 18 year, Saramago, communist who opposed 41-year conservative dictatorship Antonio Salazar, published only few travel and poetry book while he worked journalist. He returned fiction only Salazar's regime wa toppled military uprising 1974. Since 1980s, his work have been translated more 20 language. Regarding future, Saramago said book he is currently working will be called The Cavern and deal modern version myth Plato and cave. Three American researcher Monday won Nobel Medicine Prize discovering how nitric oxide act signal molecule cardiovascular system, breakthrough application ranging hardening artery impotence. The prestigious prize went Robert F. Furchgott, Louis J. Ignarro and Ferid Murad. Furchgott is pharmacologist State University New York Brooklyn, Ignarro is University California-Los Angeles and Murad is University Texas Medical School Houston. The citation Karolinska Institute said it wa senation that simple, common air pollutant (nitric oxide), which is formed when nitrogen burn . could exert important function organism. Because research, we know today that nitric oxide act signal molecule nervous system, weapon infection and regulator blood pressure. Signal transmission gas that is produced one cell, penetrates membrane and regulates function another cell represents entirely new principle, citation said. Understanding how nitric oxide transmits signal ha sparked research wide range new drug, including those that can be used treatment heart problem, artherosclerosis, shock and impotence. The prize amount 7.6 million kronor (dlrs 978,000) is divided equally three. Last year, prize went Stanley B. Prusiner University California San Francisco his discovery prion, rogue protein identified causing Mad Cow Disease. Winners generally aren't known medical community, although list laureate contains few familiar name including Ivan Pavlov, tuberculosis pioneer Robert Koch, and DNA researcher Francis Crick and James Watson. Generally, they are researcher who have made discovery that sound small paper carry large consequence. Among other well-known name receive prize is David Baltimore, although he shared prize 1975, long becoming one world's most visible AIDS researcher. Alan Cormack United States and Sir Godfrey Hounsfield may not be familiar name, what they won prize 1979 is term known most patients: computer-assisted tomography or CAT scan. The medicine prize wa second six Nobels be announced this year. Last Thursday, literature prize went Portuguese novelist Jose Saramago. The physic and chemistry prize will be announced Tuesday, economics prize Wednesday and peace prize Friday. All announcement are Stockholm, peace prize which is given Oslo, Norway. The prize are presented Dec. 10, anniversary death Alfred Nobel, industrialist and inventor dynamite whose will established prize.

Syria and previous Israeli government had reached informal agreement full withdrawal Golan Heights, which Israel captured Syria 1967. But Netanyahu's government rejected that agreement, saying it wa never formalized. Netanyahu ha sent clear message all those who are deluding themselves and betting Israel (to) change it anti-peace stand give their illusion, paper said. Lebanon's peace talk Israel also have been suspended more two year pending progress Syrian-Israeli negotiation. The independent An-Nahar newspaper quoted Lebanese Prime Minister Rafik Hariri asking, Does Israeli government really want peace it is trying delude world? In front page comment, Sahar Baasiri, said The mere announcement that he (Sharon) will lead negotiation (with Arabs) is tantamount disaster. Ariel Sharon, hawkish former general tipped be Israel's next foreign minister, said interview published Sunday that if he get job, he won't shake hand Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat. Sharon, who opposes ceding West Bank land Palestinians, is being considered government's No. 2 post. In it, he would be pivotal figure reaching final peace settlement Palestinians. Even if I will be appointed foreign minister and run negotiation, I won't shake Yasser Arafat's hand, Sharon wa quoted saying Yediot Ahronot daily. The newspaper said Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is close making decision appointment. Netanyahu himself ha been acting foreign minister post wa vacated January David Levy, moderate who opposed Netanyahu's hardline negotiating strategy Palestinians. Sharon's appointment would signal toughening Israel's position and could further strain relation Arab neighbor. Sharon is general who led Israel's 1982 invasion Lebanon, and former housing minister who strengthened Jewish settlement territory Israel captured Syria, Jordan and Egypt 1967 Mideast war. Sharon told Haaretz newspaper he would accept foreign minister's job if he were allowed act strengthen country. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu appointed Ariel Sharon, hawkish former defense minister, be Israeli foreign minister Friday effort placate far right he move closer turning more West Bank land Palestinians. With his appointment, Sharon, 70, ardent advocate Jewish settlement West Bank, is expected quell domestic opposition concession that Netanyahu is supposedly prepared make peace summit conference Washington area next week. For month, Sharon, who is currently minister national infrastructure, ha maintained that redeploying Israeli troop more additional 9 percent West Bank would be national disaster. In assuming role foreign minister, however, he would be forced abandon his public opposition Netanyahu's decision withdraw another 13 percent Palestinian territory if he vote accord. Sharon will be drawn directly issue, Netanyahu ha appointed him direct final status talk Palestinians, which would follow signing interim peace agreement. Last week Sharon told Israeli newspaper that, negotiation or not, he would never shake hand Yasser Arafat, Palestinian leader, whom he ha long disdained. Palestinian leader and Israeli leftist were divided their reaction, similar way. Some professed be aghast, and some, Nabil Sha'ath, Palestinian transportation minister, said they were willing forget history if Sharon's appointment provided Netanyahu political backbone sign deal. In Washington, White House and State Department official pledged work closely Sharon and emphasized that personnel Israeli government are internal affair. Arik Sharon is most fitting person state Israel position foreign minister, Netanyahu said, using his nickname. He brings him rich experience, creativity, proven working ability and I think that he well know wound and damage war well fruit peace. Sharon ha never hidden his belief, he continued, and his word have influenced way that redeployment will be carried out if not it extent. In nod Sharon, Netanyahu ha decided new location nature reserve that would constitute 3 percent West Bank land. It wa supposed be Judean desert Israel's eastern border, which Sharon argued would pose strategic security risk. Instead, it wa decided Thursday that nature reserve would instead be slope Hebron hill, much closer existing Jewish settlement. Many Israeli political observer believe that Netanyahu ha eviscerated his right-wing opposition this appointment, signaling that he genuinely intends bring home peace agreement. Who is right wing now if Sharon is foreign ministry and negotiating Palestinians? asked Uzi Benziman, editorial board member newspaper Haaretz and author critical biography Sharon. It will be just settler and some real hard-liners who don't comprise more 15 percent public opinion. So it's really quite intelligent move, suggesting that Netanyahu mean business trying get agreement. But Palestinians took news hard, and read it differently. I think it's clear-cut message Bibi, Saeb Erekat, lead negotiator Palestinians, said, using Netanyahu's nickname. I imagine people will try explain Netanyahu's intention trying get support right. What he is trying do is make peace right wing expense making peace u. It mean he want continue path non-negotiations, because he want continue be prime minister any cost. Sharon declined be interviewed Friday because his appointment must still be approved Cabinet Tuesday, approval that is expected. An aide, Raanan Gisin, said Sharon accepted position so that he could stem tide dangerous development and contribute fighting risk facing Israel. A retired general who fought every Israeli war, Sharon, 70, is leading figure Likud Party who ha done much battle Likud prime minister. At most recent party convention, he said that Netanyahu didn't know his right hand his left, which prime minister dismissed Friday comment made height political argument. And when Netanyahu first formed his Cabinet 1996, fact that he not give Sharon senior position caused 11th-hour crisis swearing-in ceremony. Sharon retreated his family farm Negev, and David Levy, who had been named foreign minister, said he would not serve unless Sharon wa given post. Netanyahu then created Cabinet job, minister infrastructure, especially Sharon. Levy resigned January lengthy power struggle prime minister, and then Netanyahu ha been serving his foreign minister. Sharon, member old guard, ha complicated political past, highlighted string military victory, and checkered, many, his indirect role, defense minister, Lebanese Christian Phalangist massacre unarmed civilian Sabra and Shatila refugee camp Lebanon 1982. Many Israelis, those who despise his politics, see him strong, experienced figure who know his mind and who is capable being moderate when he ha power. Friday afternoon, right-wing political establishment nearly universally applauded appointment. Uzi Landau, who is Likud hard-liner, said he wa relieved hear confirmed what ha been rumor week. I feel more safe negotiation if Minister Sharon is directly involved, said Landau, who head Parliament's security and foreign affair committee. Undoubtedly it will facilitate situation prime minister show right that Arik Sharon is identified program, so therefore they can live it. Right announcement wa made, leader National Religious Party, who had threatened bring government, changed their combative tone. They emerged mollified meeting Netanyahu late Thursday, saying they would leave government intact. Still, they would not connect their change heart nomination Sharon. Appointing Sharon is political step we very much, said Shaul Yahalom, minister transportation and leader National Religious Party. But it will have no effect how we see peace agreement. Our concern there is whether any 160 Jewish settlement are endangered. The appointment Sharon come backdrop violence that ha erupted this week. Friday, 19-year-old Israeli soldier, Michal Adato, wa stabbed death Palestinian man she got bus her hometown, settlement Tomer Jordan Valley. Netanyahu reported that he had received sympathy note Arafat, who condemned attack. Also Friday, continuing clash Palestinian youth and soldier divided city Hebron, 32 Palestinians were lightly injured rubber bullet funeral Palestinian protester shot dead Thursday. After Netanyahu made announcement Friday, Israeli reporter introduced question stating that Netanyahu had diminished political threat right wing appointing Sharon. Are you willing sign that? Netanyahu said. I do not know that. I do know one thing that when you are dependent vote one or two people you can never know what will be. He wa referring his razor-thin majority parliament which some analyst perceive be his key motivator appointing Sharon. More anything else, this reflects political weakness Netanyahu, said Yaron Ezrahi, leading intellectual and critic prime minister. He ha recognized that next redeployment is inevitable if he doesn't want be seen contributing wave political violence that would follow failure. But he doesn't have domestic political power carry out big decision his own. The New York Times said editorial Saturday, Oct. 10: Just day heading United States critical negotiation Palestinian leader, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu jolted Middle East peace effort appointment Ariel Sharon Israeli foreign minister. The most optimistic reading is that Sharon, long implacable foe Palestinians, is prepared make peace them and then sell it Israelis who are most opposed. Unfortunately, he is also capable wrecking entire peace effort. Much will depend whether Netanyahu can control his strong-willed aide, goal that ha eluded other Israeli leader. Like political typhoon, Sharon ha roared Israeli life better three decade brilliant military commander, reckless defense minister and ardent conservative, leaving destruction his wake. He still bear burden his role massacre hundred Palestinians Christian militiaman Lebanon 1982. An Israeli inquiry found he wa indirectly responsible killing Sabra and Shatila refugee camp. As leader most conservative wing Likud party, Sharon can help Netanyahu hold together his shaky Cabinet potentially decisive negotiation Yasser Arafat, Palestinian leader. That will be fine if Sharon is willing play constructive role peace talk himself. But such behavior is not likely be first impulse man who ha famously said he would never shake hand Arafat. Since Netanyahu ha designated Sharon his chief negotiator, new foreign minister will soon have opportunity act more responsibly. The first order business when two side get together next week Washington is wrap negotiation further withdrawal Israeli force West Bank coupled security guarantee Palestinians. Sharon can show statesmanship helping Netanyahu close this deal, though it is opposed Israeli settler whose cause Sharon ha long championed. Success these talk would clear way last and most difficult negotiation permanent settlement, including shape and status Palestinian state and future Jerusalem. If Sharon ever hope overcome shame Sabra and Shatila, he must become force peace Middle East.

Oct. 9, 1998: Netanyahu appoints him foreign minister, place him charge negotiation Palestinians, marking his return center Israeli politics and world political arena. Ariel Sharon's appointment Israeli foreign minister serf bullet mercy Middle East peace process, official Syrian newspaper said Saturday. In Beirut, Lebanese newspaper denounced appointment disaster peace. Many Arabs know Sharon his role Israel's 1982 invasion Lebanon. An Israeli tribunal looking invasion found him indirectly responsible massacre hundred Palestinian refugee pro-Israeli Christian Lebanese militiaman two Beirut camp. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu named Sharon foreign minister Friday, effectively putting hard-liner charge negotiating Israel's final border Palestinians. The appointment is bullet mercy (peace) process, which ha stopped all track, said Tishrin newspaper, which speaks Syrian government. It said Netanyahu ha sent clear message all those who are deluding themselves thinking that Israel will change it anti-peace stand. Syrian-Israeli peace talk broke more two year ago. Syria and previous Israeli government had reached informal agreement full withdrawal Golan Heights, which Israel captured Syria 1967. But Netanyahu's government rejected that agreement, saying it wa never completed. Lebanon's peace talk Israel also have been suspended more two year pending progress Syrian-Israeli negotiation. The independent An-Nahar newspaper quoted Lebanese Prime Minister Rafik Hariri saying: Sharon's appointment make Lebanon and most world state ask: Does Israeli government really want peace it is trying delude world? An-Nahar's columnist, Sahar Baasiri, said front-page comment: `The mere announcement that he (Sharon) will lead negotiation (with Arabs) is tantamount disaster. The man is hero Arab defeats; he is firmest believer expansion land Israel and resolving Palestinian problem expense Jordan. He is liar, Baasiri wrote. The conservative Ad-Diyar newspaper said front-page comment: The history Ariel Sharon is known. He ha called burning Beirut, annexing Golan, occupying (West) Bank and slaughtering and displacing Arabs everywhere. Ariel Sharon ha law degree, and fancy himself farmer. But more three decade his role Israeli public life ha been that unapologetic warrior, first battlefield and later bare-knuckled combat domestic partisan politics. With his blunt tongue, barrel chest and bar-scrapper's demeanor, Sharon 70 is his many critic here caricature right-wing intransigence. To his equally numerous admirer he is living symbol unrelenting dedication Israel's national survival. Still conveying physical vigor impressively expanding frame, he remains pugnacious fault. Both his friend and foe would agree that new foreign minister is not natural diplomat. A Zionist underground operative teen-ager and infantry commander wounded 1948 war independence, Sharon ha fought, and fought memorably, virtually every major military engagement his country's history. He commanded legendary armored division that crossed and seized control Sinai 1967 Arab-Israeli war. He returned active service three-month retirement lead Israel's badly outgunned armored division victory, again Sinai, war 1973. As defense minister 982, Sharon led Israel's invasion Lebanon, defying international condemnation unrelenting artillery assault Beirut neighborhood and Palestinian refugee camp believed Israeli high command be Palestine Liberation Organization redoubt. To some, Israel and abroad, Sharon's Lebanese incursion will forever be associated massacre Lebanese Christian Phalangists, ally Israelis, reported 460 unarmed Palestinians Sabra and Shatila refugee camp. In official inquiry Jerusalem and subsequent libel trial he brought New York, Sharon wa seen have effectively refuted charge that he knew and condoned Phalangists' attack beforehand. But government investigating commission held that his failure prevent killing constituted ground his dismissal Defense Ministry. Since 1982 invasion, Israel ha been mired unpopular open-ended occupation southern Lebanon, operation constant casualty young inductee which Sharon is still blamed. To many Israelis, however, Lebanese incursion wa ultimately risk worth taking, it succeeded crushing PLO militarily and driving it force far Israel's border. The PLO's defeat Sharon's hand Lebanon led eventually it renunciation armed warfare Israel and embrace peace negotiation process which Sharon Foreign Minister will now be responsible. In civilian life he proved savvy political operator he wa military strategist, helping break Labor's hold Knesset and making himself indispensable binding force successive fractious Likud coalition. His investiture foreign minister next week will mark his sixth Cabinet appointment 21 year. He previously held agriculture and defense portfolio Prime Minister Menachem Begin, trade and housing Yitzhak Shamir's government, and national infrastructure essentially, settlement support directorate administration Benjamin Netanyahu. As key member inner cabinet Begin's first government, Sharon began construction and systematic expansion new Israeli housing development throughout West Bank, Gaza Strip and Galilee area territory occupied Israel 1967, policy that he and his opponent alike would agree remains his signal domestic political achievement. At 70, Sharon remains one great polarizing fixture Israeli political life. An acerbic critic other leading soldier-politician his generation, Yitzhak Rabin, Sharon attacked Oslo peace accord terrible and dangerous and condemned Rabin's negotiating partner, Yasser Arafat, war criminal. He angrily opposed any diplomatic discussion return internationally demilitarized Golan Heights Syria. A secular Jew manner typical his generation native-born Israelis, Sharon became outspoken and effective defender new Orthodox Jewish settlement predominantly Palestinian area West Bank, cementing his position bridge traditional secular right and new militant religious faction Likud coalition. ","Ariel Sharon was named Israeli foreign minister just weeks before a scheduled peace summit in the US, aimed at negotiating an Israeli withdrawal from 13% of the West Bank.Arabs reacted strongly and said the hard-line, right-wing, warrior and former defense minister would kill any progress for a settlement in the mid-East.Many blame Sharon for a 1982 massacre of Palestinian civilians at refugee camps in Lebanon.Others believed his appointment was an effort to placate the far right and gain their support for the Netanyahu government and the concessions necessary for the peace process.Sharon vowed not to shake Yasser Arafat's hand.","Prior to his appointment as foreign minister by Israeli Prime Minister Natanyahu in 1998, seasoned warrior Ariel Sharon announced that if appointed, he would not shake hands with Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat.The remark fit Sharon's long history of unyielding bellicosity towards Palestine.When he was appointed some thought that Netanyahu was placating Israel's far right wing while striving for peace.Others saw it as a move to scuttle the peace effort.Arab commentary deemed the appointment ""tantamount to disaster"" and ""the bullet of mercy"" to the peace process.Peace talks in the U.S. were in the offing with the outcome in doubt.","Appointment of Ariel Sharon as Foreign Minister by PM Netanyahu does not bode well for the peace process.His appointment is surprising in that the two have differed on withdrawal from Palestinian territory and is seen as an effort to placate the right.Sharon, 70, is an unapologetic warrior on the battlefield and in partisan politics.He brings heavy baggage: right-wing intransigence and responsibility for failing to prevent the killings of 460 unarmed Palestinians in refugee camps during the Lebanon incursion.Sharon has said that he will not shake Arafat's hand and his appointment is seen as a ""bullet of mercy"" for the Middle East peace process.","In a move widely viewed as an effort to placate the far right as he moves to withdraw from more West Bank land, Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu named hardliner Ariel Sharon foreign minister and chief peace negotiator.Sharon, a military leader with legendary victories in the 1967 and 1973 Mideast wars, is infamous in the Arab world as the defense minister in the 1982 invasion of Lebanon during which Lebanese Christian militiamen, Israeli allies, slaughtered hundreds of unarmed Palestinians.His appointment as lead negotiator was denounced as a ""disaster"" in the Lebanese press and ""a bullet of mercy to the peace process"" in a Syrian paper."

IOC president Juan Antonio Samaranch immediately disassociated himself Hodler's allegation. The only official spokeman IOC executive board is (director general) Francois Carrard, Samaranch said. All other comment are personal comment. They are not official comment. Hodler's allegation, made group reporter, came IOC continued investigation alleged financial misconduct Salt Lake City group which won bid 2002 game.

Hodler contested argument current Salt Lake organizing committee that it wa not directly involved controversial scholarship program and that onus wa former bid chief Thomas Welch. Yesterday lawyer Salt Lake City said, `Everything had been done Tom Welch, who is not there any more. We know nothing.' My experience is that this is not true. The controversy center scholarship including tuition assistance and athlete training program paid relative IOC member Salt Lake bid committee. From 1991 1995, committee direction Welch spent nearly dlrs 400,000 scholarship 13 individual six them relative IOC member, mostly Africa.

Salt Lake organizer, 10th graf pvs LAUSANNE, Switzerland (AP) IOC president Juan Antonio Samaranch Sunday promised expel any member if they are found guilty accepting bribe. Samaranch said he wa surprised allegation corruption International Olympic Committee made senior Swiss member Marc Hodler.

After we get recommendation panel, we will take measure necessary arrange problem. Samaranch said IOC wa intent protecting integrity organization and Olympics whole. If we have clean, we will clean, he said. After, IOC will be stronger before. Samaranch said he wa taken aback Hodler's allegation, which were made reporter Saturday.

Hodler said he believed four agent including one IOC member had been involved vote-buying 10 year. He said he thought 5 7 percent IOC member currently numbering 115 were open bribery. Samaranch denied that he muzzled Hodler, Swiss official claimed earlier Sunday. He said he had told all member executive board that only himself and director general Francois Carrad could speak medium. This is not first time I do this, he said.

Samaranch compared current climate Soviet boycott 1984 Olympics Los Angeles and sprinter Ben Johnson's expulsion 1988 Olympics Seoul, South Korea. Those were difficult moment, Samaranch said. Now we are facing another difficult moment, I'm sure we will solve this problem. Samaranch expressed surprise allegation made IOC executive board member Marc Hodler Switzerland that agent were offering sell IOC. members' vote payment bidding city. Hodler, second most senior member IOC, said Saturday that he knew four agent, including one IOC member, who engaged such activity. Hodler said he believed that 5 7 percent IOC membership, which currently number 115, asked some sort compensation their vote. He ha called new electoral process, which executive board or some other select IOC group would decide which city become Olympic host instead full IOC membership. Samaranch agreed Sunday that time had come explore change. The system we have now is very complicated, very slow and very expensive, he said. Hodler, former head International Ski Federation, also claimed that Fiat tycoon Gianni Agnelli had given free van influence vote Italian resort Sestriere hold 1997 world skiing championship. Fiat denied claim Saturday, Sunday Howard Peterson, former senior American delegate ski federation, said he had been offered car two Fiat executive. The issue vote-buying came fore Lausanne because recent disclosure scholarship payment made six relative IOC member Salt Lake City official their successful bid play host 2002 Winter Games. The Salt Lake Organizing Committee ha said payment, which amounted slightly le $400000, came privately financed fund that wa started 1991.

Sunday, Frank Joklik, president Salt Lake Organizing Committee, issued public apology Olympic family and citizen Utah embarrassment caused scholarship program. Samaranch Sunday ruled out taking Games Salt Lake City. He said, If necessary we will expel member if this ad hoc commission think these member are guilty. Pound said his commission wa already satisfied Salt Lake City won 2002 Games merit bid. He also said that his commission would expand it inquiry Salt Lake City bid only if it wa presented evidence and not simply rumor corruption other bid. On Saturday, Hodler had suggested bidding team Atlanta and Nagano, Japan, that won 1996 Summer Olympics and 1998 Winter Olympics had not run clean campaign. Billy Payne, who presided Atlanta's bid, and Makoto Kobayashi, general secretary Nagano organizing committee, denied those claim. Asked whether he regretted his statement Sunday, Hodler said, Not all and later said that city have been victim and not villain. Pound said there had been concern IOC some time agent. There always have been lobbyist, he said. In recent year, especially Olympics coming every two year, there seems be professional class being created. Hodler, when pressed further comment this afternoon Olympic headquarters, initially covered his mouth hand and then said, Muzzle imposed president. Hodler, 80, is one only four IOC member life membership because he wa appointed age limit were imposed 1966. Asked if he might resign he said, I'm not going resign, I might be expelled. But 78-year-old Samaranch said he had great respect Hodler and no intention asking his resignation or pushing his expulsion. Moving quickly tackle escalating corruption scandal, IOC leader questioned Salt Lake City official Friday first ever investigation alleged vote-buying Olympic city. Acting unusual speed, International Olympic Committee set special investigative panel that immediately summoned organizer 2002 Salt Lake Games address bribery allegation. The chief investigator refused rule out possibility taking game away Salt Lake City though that scenario is considered highly unlikely. Frank Joklik, president Salt Lake Organizing Committee, and SLOC senior vice president Dave Johnson appeared IOC panel 90 minute Friday night. Both side declined comment talk, saying inquiry wa still process. Earlier, Joklik met IOC president Juan Antonio Samaranch and other top official provide information and document case. The controversy center payment nearly dlrs 400,000 scholarship relative IOC member Salt Lake bid committee which won right stage 2002 game. Senior IOC executive board member Marc Hodler said scholarship fund described humanitarian aid Salt Lake official amounted bribe sway vote 1995 election. It's most serious case alleged ethical misconduct investigated IOC former US. member Robert Helmick wa accused conflict interest 1991. Helmick eventually resigned IOC member and president US. Olympic Committee. This is first time IOC ha ever investigated possible bribery bidding city, previous rumor and allegation corruption other Olympic vote. The executive board take this matter very seriously, said Dick Pound, IOC vice president heading Salt Lake inquiry. Despite many request made or evidence support rumor that have been floating around, we have never had anything come forward. Specific allegation have now been made. The executive board acted very quickly investigate. Also investigative panel are IOC vice president Keba Mbaye, executive board member Jacques Rogge and Thomas Bach, and IOC director general Francois Carrard. Pound said panel would investigate allegation that there may or may not have been payment benefit member IOC or their family connected Salt Lake City bid. Pound, Canadian lawyer, said there wa no deadline completion investigation said it wa possible inquiry could be wrapped this weekend. Pound declined speculate what if any sanction could be taken Salt Lake not rule out moving game elsewhere. We're not going make any conclusion or any speculation what we may decide we know what fact are, he said. Moving game would be unprecedented and, just three year go, would be logistical nightmare. Most facility needed game Salt Lake already are built. John Krimsky, deputy secretary general US. Olympic Committee, discounted any possibility game being moved. There is no chance all, absolutely none my mind, he said. I can't be stronger saying I don't consider it possibility whatsoever game being withdrawn Salt Lake City. Salt Lake organizer have denied that bid committee's dlrs 500,000 project wa effort buy key IOC members' support four year vote 1998 and 2002 Winter Games. Salt Lake lost '98 race Nagano, Japan, 1991, when program wa begun. It won landslide vote Sion, Switzerland, 2002 Games 1995 balloting. From 1991 1995, bid committee direction former president Thomas Welch spent nearly dlrs 400,000 scholarship 13 individual six them relative IOC member, mostly Africa. Olympic rule prohibit bidding city giving IOC member or their relative any present or benefit exceeding value dlrs 150. I've already stated I do not regard what wa done bribe, Joklik said Friday.

Asked whether all Olympic vote are tainted, Hodler said, I know so many time. There is good chance it is always case.

I know what happened I don't want disclose it. I can't imagine that Sydney is different others, he said. Sydney pretend it is completely clean, clean, clean. The committee which won 1998 game Nagano certainly had do thing which are not legitimate, Hodler said. Hodler contested argument current Salt Lake organizing committee that it wa not directly involved controversial scholarship program and that onus wa former bid chief Thomas Welch. Yesterday lawyer Salt Lake City said, `Everything had been done Tom Welch, who is not there any more. We know nothing.' My experience is that this is not true.

45,"Whether or not talk Exxon and Mobil lead merger or some other business combination, America's economic history is already being rewritten. In energy business financial service, telecommunication and automobile, global competition and technology have made unthinkable combination practical, necessary. Oil company Exxon Corp. and Mobil Corp. have additional pressure, one unthinkable le two decade ago. Crude oil price have fallen sharply, plunging 40 percent just this year level, adjusted inflation, not seen first oil embargo 25 year ago. As such, oil company, having spent year cutting their cost, are desperate further saving order continue operating profitably such low price. Exxon and Mobil are two largest, strongest competitor emerge nation's most famous antitrust case, 1911 breakup John D. Rockefeller's Standard Oil Trust. Now they face Royal Dutch/Shell Group that is larger either them. They will also confront British Petroleum PLC made far more potent United States it agreement this summer buy Amoco Corp. $48.2 billion. Industry executive say further deal this scale are inevitable. Executives company not return call Thursday comment talk, and it wa unclear Thursday night what outcome might be. But if Exxon and Mobil agree become one, antitrust regulator are likely be cautious putting back together much what they long ago broke apart. Even so, most oil industry analyst contend that improved efficiency combining giant energy company would do more lower cost more concentrated ownership gas station and refinery would do raise them. The ultimate beneficiary all this will be consumer, said Daniel Yergin, chairman Cambridge Energy Research Associates. If Exxon and Mobil ultimately do combine, cost could prove heaviest energy industry employee. Analysts say that 80,000 global employee Exxon, based Irving, Texas, and more 40,000 Mobil, Fairfax, Va., thousand would be likely lose their job. Exxon, Lee R. Raymond, and Mobil, Lucio A. Noto, have chief executive who have been preoccupied humbling accommodation that low oil price have made necessary. Oil company were everybody's favorite target trust-busting era early this century and again Arab oil embargo 1970s. Now they seem especially vulnerable demand weakens much world, especially economically troubled Asia, weighing further already depressed price. They're pitiful, helpless giant, said Ronald Chernow, author Titan, biography John D. Rockefeller, Standard Oil's founder. As such, these giant are compelled continue cutting cost and spreading risk their huge, expensive international project that are needed develop oil reserve needed next century. Mobil, $58.4 billion sale last year, might seem large enough undertake anything. But competing right develop huge natural gas field Turkmenistan, former Soviet republic, Mobil wa unable match Shell's offer build pipeline $1 billion or more. Oil company have decided that they cannot count rebound oil price revive their fortune any time soon. Earlier this month, Energy Department predicted that collapse Asian demand would continue depress oil price nearly decade, and much $5.50 barrel year 2000. And Thursday, Organization Petroleum Exporting Countries put March any decision extending their oil production cutback prop price. Moreover, improving technology exploration and production and opening new region development have added already huge supply oil that is hand now. In response, many energy company have already begun new wave cutback their staff and operation. To further reduce cost, company Mobil are forming partnership that stop short full merger. Two year ago, Mobil agreed combine it European refining and marketing operation British Petroleum's, resulting annual saving $500 million. Shell and Texaco then formed refining partnership United States. In face these partnership, said Amy Jaffe, energy analyst James A. Baker III Institute Public Policy Houston, if you're Exxon, how do you compete? Though Mobil and Exxon might have high concentration gas station certain area United States, analyst say they have far more competition pump oil price collapsed 1980s. Thousands convenience store now also sell gasoline produced variety refining company, and foreign national oil company, Venezuela's, sell their supply acquired company Citgo. Under Noto, Mobil ha been hunting way becoming large and lean enough survive. He took lead deal British Petroleum and ha considered buying smaller company. And he ha made it clear that corporate or personal pride would never block deal. In European agreement British Petroleum, Mobil's red flying horse have come front many gas station, while green and yellow BP logo have gone up. As major oil company team up, said John Hervey, analyst Donaldson Lufkin &AMP; Jenrette, If price is right, ego will not get way. In past, Mobil reportedly had further talk British Petroleum other combination, well talk Amoco forming American refining venture. The company wa also interested Conoco Inc. when DuPont Co. began looking divest itself that oil and gas business. But no deal were reached. More recently, there wa speculation Wall Street that Mobil had been talking Chevron Corp. British Petroleum purchase Amoco put more pressure Noto seek deal, Hervey said. I don't think this whole thing would have started if British Petroleum had not pulled trigger, he said. The British Petroleum-Amoco deal, progressing quickly August announcement expected $2 billion annual saving, ha put company large Exxon spot. There, Raymond ha so far concentrated more making his operation more efficient finding ally. Though Royal Dutch/Shell's financial resource are greater Exxon's, some analyst say Exxon still ha size and soundness absorb company Mobil's size. Only largest oil company can afford take advantage today's best opportunity. Finding new field deep water coast West Africa or Gulf Mexico can require platform costing $1 billion or more. Producing oil state former Soviet Union ha taken more time and money many investor anticipated. In September, Noto wa American executive invited Saudi leader visiting Washington greatly step investment his country, too. Noto spent 1977 1985 Saudi Arabia himself, building Mobil operation including huge refinery. But any new partnership Saudis might require Mobil's connection and Exxon's capital. Back when Standard Oil organized it operation state, Exxon wa Standard Oil New Jersey, while Mobil wa Standard Oil New York. Even Standard Oil monopoly wa broken up, they remained several year same building Manhattan. Chernow, Rockefeller biographer, noted that two piece Standard Oil trust are already likely be united. British Petroleum bought Standard Oil Ohio 1970s, and Amoco wa once Standard Oil Indiana. The break-up Standard Oil and resulting competition ha been cited precedent current antitrust action Microsoft. Chernow see no reason why allowing Exxon acquisition Mobil go should suggest more leniency Microsoft. Exxon would not be obviously larger it leading competitor, way Microsoft is, he said. In energy business today, he added, there are other large dinosaur that stalk that particular jungle. The board Exxon Corp. and Mobil Corp. are expected meet Tuesday consider possible merger agreement that would form world's largest oil company, source close negotiation said Friday. The source, who spoke condition anonymity, said prospect were good completing agreement. Exxon and Mobil confirmed Friday that they were discussing way combine. They cautioned, however, that no agreement had been reached and there wa no assurance they would reach one. The statement sent stock company surging, suggesting investor believe company will combine. Shares Exxon, biggest US. oil company, rose $1.6875, or 2.3 percent, $74375. Shares Mobil, No. 2 US. oil company, rose $7.625, or 9.7 percent, $86. Some analyst said that if two giant reached agreement, it wa likely be form takeover Exxon Mobil. Exxon is far larger and financially stronger. Analysts predicted that there would be huge cut duplicate staff company, which employ 122,700 people. Adam Sieminski, oil analyst BT Alex. Brown, said that company would probably make cut $3 billion $5 billion year. Sieminski and other analyst said Exxon would have offer premium 15 20 percent it price prior Monday, when serious speculation Exxon takeover Mobil first circulated and sent Mobil share sharply. They said transaction would probably be exchange Mobil share Exxon share. Based Mobil's $75.25 share price week ago, takeover company would be worth $70 billion. The merger discussion come backdrop particularly severe pressure Lucio Noto, chairman, president and chief executive Mobil, find new reserve oil and natural gas and keep big project profitable time deep decline crude oil price. This is one most intelligent chief executive business and man considerable ability he inherited some serious structural problem his company, said J. Robin West, chairman Petroleum Finance Co., consulting group energy industry based Washington. He said that Mobil's prime asset include Arun natural gas field Indonesia, one largest world, which ha contributed one-third Mobil's profit year is beginning run down. The field, production 1977, supply liquefied natural gas Japan and Korea. Although Mobil Noto ha moved quickly cut cost and muscle it way promising new area such Kazakhstan, where it is partner joint venture develop huge Tengiz oil field, payoff such venture is many year away. Other company face similar strain. The challenge is replace their crown jewel and grow increasingly competitive environment, West said. Noto ha not been shy sitting other company such British Petroleum and Amoco this year see if combination made sense. Although Exxon chairman Lee Raymond head much stronger and bigger company Mobil, he ha not been immune strain global petroleum business. Those strain intensified this year when Russia's economic collapse raised risk Exxon's extensive exploration venture that country. Exxon ha also been more follower leader huge project deep offshore field, where major find have been made West Africa and Gulf Mexico. News that Exxon and Mobil, two giant energy patch, were merger talk last week is biggest sign that corporate marriage are back vogue. Even that combination came light, deal-making wa fast and furious. On Monday alone, $40.4 billion corporate acquisition were either announced or declared imminent. Driving resurgence merger is roaring stock market, recognition major corporation that it is getting harder increase revenue internally and growing confidence market player that economy will not plunge recession next year. There are also industry-specific issue, low crude-oil price that are driving oil giant one another's arm. But investor, mega-marriages are not where real money is be made. Rather, it is smaller company, whose still-depressed stock price are luring bigger acquirer stock that again are their peak. If Exxon buy Mobil close current price, deal this month will have total value more $140 billion April's peak $244 billion three time volume September, when stock market wa falling. Which industry are likely witness most merger? Tom Burnett, director Merger Insight, institutional investment advisory firm New York, say more deal are certainty energy, which is suffering low crude-oil price. Burnett also say health care executive are finding it tougher ever lift earnings. But smaller company may be better way play takeover game. Charles LaLoggia, editor Special Situation Investor newsletter Potomac, Md., said: Some premium high-profile merger aren't so great anymore. The value are small-cap stock. Another reason is that deal involving smaller-cap candidate are le likely incur wrath antitrust regulator. LaLoggia reckons that odds picking takeover winner increase if investor focus company already partially owned another. In energy sector, Houston Exploration qualifies, he says; oil and gas driller is 66 percent owned Keyspan Energy. He also belief more deal are imminent drug chain and supermarket. Longs Drug Stores and Drug Emporium, he say, remain acquisition candidate, though neither is controlled another concern. In supermarket, LaLoggia like Great Atlantic &AMP; Pacific Tea Co., 55 percent owned Tengelmann Group Germany. Another pick is Smart and Final, operator warehouse-style store that is 55 percent owned US. subsidiary Groupe Casino, France's largest supermarket chain. Both A&AMP;P and Smart and Final are trading just book value, LaLoggia said. Takeovers typically occur book value. Finally, he recommends National Presto Industries, maker housewares and electrical appliance, which is trading $39, close it low year. The company ha $30 share cash it balance sheet, no debt and dividend yield 5 percent. After last month's announced acquisition Rubbermaid Newell Co., LaLoggia think National Presto could find itself acquirer's cross-hairs. It wa new high again Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock and Nasdaq composite index Friday anticipation new wave merger and general rush investor join equity rebound pushed stock up. Oil stock led way investor soaked news continuing talk Exxon and Mobil merger that would create world's largest oil company. Internet and computer stock also rallied, helped part announcement Tuesday America Online's purchase Netscape Communications three-way deal involving Sun Microsystems. At same time, Germany's Deutsche Bank and Bankers Trust are scheduled formally announce their merger Monday. There is no question that merger euphoria is headline, said Hugh Johnson, chief investment officer First Albany Corp. But flow mutual fund is also strong. Exxon rose 1 11/16, 74], while Mobil jumped 7|, 86. Chevron, reflecting bounce that other oil company got merger news, climbed 5\, 85|. Exxon and Chevron, IBM, which rose 3\, 170, were main driver Dow Jones industrial average. It climbed 18.80 point, or two-tenths percent, 9,33308. It now stand just 41 point short record it set Monday and 1.9 percent week. Mobil, Exxon, Chevron, IBM and Microsoft, which rose 3 13/16, 128 1/16, were power S &AMP; P. It climbed 5.46 point, or five-tenths percent, 1192.33, new high, second week. It jumped 2.5 percent last five trading day. Cisco Systems, 2 15/16, 80; MCI Worldcom, 1 11/16, 62 7/16; Sun Microsystems, 4|, 80], and Microsoft pushed Nasdaq index it first new high July 20. The technology-heavy index finished 31.23 point, or 1.57 percent, higher, 2,01644. It wa 4.6 percent week. Whether Friday's gain will stick will not be known Monday. It wa shortened trading session, New York Stock Exchange closing 1 p.m., and trading volume, 257 million share, made it lightest day year. In bond market, which also closed early because Thanksgiving weekend, price 30-year Treasury bond rose 11/32, 101 12/32. The bond's yield, which move direction price, fell 5.16 percent 5.18 percent Wednesday. Long-term and short-term yield all slipped lower this week new economic data that indicated economy wa stronger third quarter expected and seems be moving good pace current quarter. This small recovery face stronger growth is probably because new inflation number show that price are check and analyst are still forecasting that economy will begin slow next year. Many analyst have noted eight-week stock market rally, which Nasdaq composite index jumped 42 percent, that investor were buying again though major financial problem world including slumping Asia, weakening Latin America and troubled Russia have not been resolved. Johnson said he thought that investor, inspired Federal Reserve's three interest rate cut two month and new stimulus package Japan, assume that these problem will be solved. Investors are looking valley and they what they see, he said. But he worry that financial crisis, which began Thailand July 1997 and wa intensified effective default Russia August, will not go away quickly. It seems that every financial crisis, everybody get impression that storm ha passed, Johnson said. But it is never that easy. Exxon Corp. and Mobil Corp. have held discussion combining their business operation, person involved talk said Wednesday. It wa unclear Wednesday whether talk were continuing. If company were merge, it would create largest US. company term revenue. A possible merger wa reported separately The Financial Times London and Bloomberg News. The reported talk Exxon, whose annual revenue exceeds that Wal-Mart and General Electric, and Mobil, No. 2 US. oil company, come oil price have sunk their lowest almost 12 year. A combined company would be bigger Royal Dutch/Shell Group, world's largest oil company revenue. Financial term discussion could not be determined Wednesday. Neither Exxon or Mobil would comment. Any union would reunite two part John D. Rockefeller's Standard Oil Trust, which wa broken Supreme Court 1911. Exxon wa then known Standard Oil New Jersey, and Mobil consisted two companies: Standard Oil New York and Vacuum Oil. Both Exxon, which ha market value $176.7 billion, and Mobil, which ha market value $61.1 billion, have history being fiercely independence. Both have already cut back staff and made themselves lean order survive long period when oil price are low. But this ha been particularly unsettling year oil industry, and there is little prospect that crude oil price will recover soon. Consequently, chief executive most oil company have had swallow their pride and look suitable partner. This summer, British Petroleum announced $48.2 billion agreement buy Amoco Corp., creating world's third-largest oil company and prompting analyst predict more widespread consolidation. It showed that megamergers are doable, said Adam Sieminski, analyst BT Alex. Brown. He added, however, that combination Exxon and Mobil would not be easy match because Mobil ha been known being proud company that ha said that it would not want merge. Exxon, he added, is well run company that like grow it business. He added that head company, Lee Raymond, chairman Exxon, which is based Irving, Texas, and Lucio Noto, chairman, president and chief executive Mobil, which is based Fairfax, Va., are different personality. It will not be easy, he said combining two far-flung company, which have vast network refinery and gas station that overlap United States and Europe. If you offer enough money you can make anything happen, he added. Both company are pressure find new field oil help them survive long term. Like other oil company, they had hoped quickly tap vast reserve Russia. Even though they were prepared spend billion, they have held back because political and economic crisis Russia and great reluctance Russian official and oil company give control vast field. Thus they have had fall back their exploration area such deep water Gulf Mexico and West Africa. Such exploration is very expensive, and when large field are found it take platform costing $1 billion bring oil production. Oil price have been pressure more year, falling more 40 percent $20-a-barrel level because growing inventory petroleum and declining Asian demand caused economic crisis there. On Wednesday, crude oil January delivery fell 29 cent, or 2.6 percent, $11.86 barrel New York Mercantile Exchange, close 12-year low $11.42 reached June 15. Members Organization Petroleum Exporting Countries and some other oil-producing nation, notably Mexico, have tried stem price drop pledge cut back production. But those pledge have not always been honored, and rally oil market this year have proven short-lived. OPEC member Wednesday continued their discussion extending their production cutback, and agreement is expected early Thursday. In spring, OPEC agreed reduce production 2.6 million barrel day, 3 percent daily world supply 74 million barrel. The main result that agreement appears have been keep oil price falling $10 barrel. Washington regulator said Wednesday that they had not been notified Exxon-Mobil discussion. The Federal Trade Commission is still reviewing British Petroleum's pending purchase Amoco. An Exxon-Mobil deal would be certain receive several months' worth scrutiny commission, which would review how much industry such merger would control. Analysts and investment banker were split logic possible merger. Some pointed difficulty that company could face if they were combined. If you asked me if Exxon needed be bigger, answer is probably no, said Garfield Miller, president Aegis Energy Advisors Corp., small independent investment bank based New York. It is hard say that there is anything particular gain. In particular, Miller said, two company have enormous similarity their domestic refining and marketing business. They really do overlap quite bit, he said. You really do wonder what is benefit all that redundancy. Another investment banker energy business, speaking condition anonymity, also questioned rationale discussed merger. When you look BP-Amoco deal, you can rationalize it, banker said. But none those reason apply Exxon-Mobil deal. But Amy Jaffe, energy research analyst James A. Baker III Institute Public Policy, said combination two company would be logical, part because it would give them greater influence bidding project Middle Eastern country. This is deal that make sense, Ms. Jaffe said. With this combined company, there is no project that would be too big. In addition, Ms. Jaffe said, merger would provide each company new oil and gas asset area world where they had little influence. There are lot complimentary asset where they are not redundant, she said. She said that Exxon, example, ha strong presence Angola, while Mobil doe not. And Mobil ha significant asset Caspian Sea and Nigeria, where Exxon is weak. Exxon and Mobil, nation's two largest oil company, confirmed Friday that they were discussing possible merger, and antitrust lawyer, industry analyst and government official predicted that any deal would require sale important large piece such new corporate behemoth. Those divestiture would further reshape industry already undergoing broad transformation because low price oil. But merger and other corporate combination are also beginning create new regulatory climate antitrust official, one that may prove particularly challenging Exxon and Mobil. Although company only confirmed that they were discussing possibility merger, person close discussion said board Exxon and Mobil were expected meet Tuesday consider agreement. Shares surged New York Stock Exchange. Oil exploration and drilling interest would not necessarily present antitrust problem Exxon-Mobil merger because competition those area is brisk. But retailing and marketing operation, Exxon-Mobil combination would be Ford merging General Motors, Macy's Gimbels, said Stephen Axinn, antitrust lawyer New York who represented Texaco it acquisition Getty more decade ago. In United States, deal would come purview Federal Trade Commission, which Clinton administration ha examined large corporate merger vigor not seen 1970s. The agency ha blocked number proposed merger, such $4 billion combination Staples and Office Depot, two largest office supply discounter, and two deal involving four largest drug wholesaler. On other hand it ha approved other big merger, such Boeing's $14 billion acquisition McDonnell Douglas. The agency's analysis Exxon-Mobil combination, senior official said Friday, will turn how it might resemble John D. Rockefeller's Standard Oil trust it wa dismantled Supreme Court 1911. The big antitrust issue is whether, merger or alliance, they will be able get competition one another their back, particularly background BP-Amoco and Shell-Texaco, said Eleanor M. Fox, professor New York University School Law and antitrust expert. It may be that we are looking consolidation world level that looked consolidation national level 100 year ago. The Federal Trade Commission recently approved significant joint venture Shell and Texaco venture agreed sell refinery and divest some retailing operation Hawaii and California. It is also proposed $54 billion merger British Petroleum and Amoco and will now have re-examine that combination light new talk Exxon and Mobil. In past, when there have been two merger involving same industry, government ha considered them together deciding how deal them, said Terry Calvani, former commissioner Federal Trade Commission whose client now include Chevron. But coming aftermath Shell-Texaco and BP-Amoco deal, combination Exxon and Mobil, which have significantly overlapping retail and refinery business United States and Europe, pose question that antitrust official have not confronted 1980s. It's real test case, said Frederick Leuffer, senior energy analyst Bear Stearns. If FTC let this one go major divesting, then everything would be fair game. Why couldn't GM merge Ford? While 1911 breakup Standard Oil is viewed Washington official and industry executive ancient history, Exxon and Mobil have become dominant rival some retailing and refining market, and production lubricant and petrochemical. Leuffer said he believed divestiture necessary this case could be so large that they are deal-breakers. Other analyst and lawyer, while disagreeing that required divestiture could kill deal, said company would nonetheless have shed significant operation and that they expected challenge be raised broad spectrum constituent, including competitor, customer and state official. These are not absolute obstacle, said John Hervey, analyst Donaldson Lufkin &AMP; Jenrette. In past, when two big oil company have merged, aggressive attorney general state have almost always become involved raising question because high visibility local gas station. When state attorney general drive and see four station corner and two them are Mobil and Exxon, they are certain raise question, Axinn said. Exxon and Mobil have significant concentration retailing and marketing concern Northeast, Southwest and West Coast, where they also have big refining operation. Because two company are involved everything exploration and shipping refining and retailing, meaning deal consumer will take month regulator sort out. The regulator examining such transaction would dissect each business, determine whether it market is global, national or more local, and determine whether combined entity ha too high concentration business those area. Experts agreed that regulator are most likely permit Exxon and Mobil keep their exploratory and oil production business because those area are already highly competitive and merger would not result higher price. Hervey said those market are already so fragmented that combined market share major American and European oil company is only 17 percent. They have been downsized, cut back and re-engineered. So when 900 or so remaining blue-collar worker here Mobil's largest domestic refinery, out 1,500 decade ago, heard last week that their company wa discussing possible merger Exxon, it wa siren warning them that already suspect valve might be blow. I think it's terrible thing, said Dick Mabry, refinery operator, he emerged plant's artificial twilight main gate his 12-hour shift ended 4:30 Sunday morning. He stopped rub eye rimmed red, this topic his bedtime could be delayed. It's revival Standard Oil Company. It's going put 20 or 30 thousand people out work. I think Justice Department should step and stop it. Ernest Lewis, whose overall bore Big E patch appropriate his scale, added his uh-huh's. The latest evidence where thing were heading hulked right nearby, he said, glancing new power plant likely be operated company union that now man refinery's generator. But if Mobil Corp. ha be sold, Lewis said, noting gain his company stock holding, buyer solid and large Exxon Corp. might be least all evil. If we merged Chevron, we'd be Moron, he added. A growing American economy that can make billionaire out someone unproven idea Internet marketing is still sloughing worker older industry, petroleum much any. Those here point tote board Beaumont plant's brick headquarters, that they say show they have already handled 171 million barrel out 130 million planned full year. But number that matter more are one 89.9, 88.9, 81.9, nearby gas station lowest price, inflation, Depression. Which is why Mobil and Exxon are combining world's largest oil company. Some people close talk cautioned that no deal would be considered their board least Tuesday, maybe Wednesday. And that is why, beginning last Wednesday evening, phone home Jimmy Herrington, president Oil, Chemical and Atomic Workers Local 4-243 rang stop. No, he didn't know that merger talk television, said Herrington, who also work full-time producing lubricant. He had asked some Mobil manager, meeting earlier this month, all rumor, they said they had heard nothing. Oil industry analyst say that first target combined company's effort cut billion dollar annual cost would be office staff and professional, geologist and engineer, field. One company's accountant could almost do work two. But crew here fully expect that Exxon or any other buyer would ask again whether refinery could turn more crude oil gasoline, motor oil and other product fewer people. Union leader raise prospect that Exxon would have sell refinery. Antitrust regulator, they say, are bound notice that Exxon ha refinery hour's drive one direction and three hour other, Gulf Mexico crescent that form petrochemical industry's home. The Beaumont plant, steaming, humming chemistry set lining Neches River Gulf, ha become prime provider livelihood here it wa built almost spray nearby Spindletop gusher. With mounting overtime that can stretch shift 16 hour or more, worker regularly make $55,000 or $65,000 year. People go there retire there, Herrington said, he drove plant's fenced periphery. Lewis, his 17th year, is third-generation employee. But his nephew laboring here too is exception. The worker streaming and plant dawn are mostly balding or going gray, sign that full generation refinery ha been more concerned how get rid worker how attract them. The cutback have, so far, come attrition, retirement encouraged incentive. But plywood sheet covering window most fast food place and gas station Herrington's union hall advertise that best time are long gone. His member chafe expert who come Wall Street question justification every person's job. In tiring and dangerous task, they question elimination most relief laborer favor covering vacation and sickness overtime (although some extra pay, and they say plant ha become safer years). They complain growing number contractor taking formerly unionized task. But many worker choosing invest least some retirement saving Mobil stock, 1990s ethos is gaining. Some share credit plant's management efficiency measure they agree are necessary true job security. Some take attitude that every company is always sale. They will not be too concerned what we feel it, said Sam Salim, one electrical plant worker whose future is uncertain. But if they fork out $60 billion? I'd look it over. With most Mobil executive saying little possible now, call Sunday local plant manager and company spokesman not elicit peep. Union leader, however, are already squawking. I don't believe creating new monopoly is way prop industry, said Robert Wages, former refinery operator himself and now union's president, telephone Saturday. Nevertheless, admirable foresight union negotiated clause last November's three-year contract extension guaranteeing that any company buyer would have keep it term. Many member, who typically came work high school, are already molding oil companies' latest exploit case study fit rapacious MBA's. They're biggest, said Bobby Whisneant, assistant operator gasoline and lubrication oil unit, referring Exxon. He wa coming, early Sunday morning, plant gate whose white canopy seems borrowed self-service station. So they go buy second biggest. That's one way get rid competition. I just hope it's not something 80 buying company and scrapping them. Or something Robber Baron era century before, said Mabry, another operator. Didn't teacher teach u all school that Standard Oil Company would never come back? Remember that? he said, looking his friend, Lewis, Big E, agreement. But I better shut up. I still work Mobil. Used to, Lewis said. Exxon Corp. and Mobil Corp. have held discussion combining their business operation, person involved talk said Wednesday. It wa unclear Wednesday whether talk were continuing. If company were merge, it would create largest US. company term revenue. A possible merger wa reported separately The Financial Times London and Bloomberg News. The reported talk Exxon, whose annual revenue exceeds that General Electric Co., and Mobil, No. 2 US. oil company, came oil price sank their lowest almost 12 year. A combined company would be bigger Royal Dutch/Shell Group, world's largest oil company revenue. Financial term discussion could not be determined Wednesday. Neither Exxon or Mobil would comment. Any union would reunite two part John D. Rockefeller's Standard Oil Trust, which wa broken Supreme Court 1911. Exxon wa then known Standard Oil New Jersey, and Mobil consisted two companies: Standard Oil New York and Vacuum Oil. As oil price have plummeted level last seen mid-1980s, oil company have been pressure cut cost. Exxon, which ha market value $176.7 billion, and Mobil, which ha market value $61.1 billion, have history being fiercely independent, and have already cut back staff and made themselves lean survive prolonged period low oil price. But this ha been particularly unsettling year oil industry, and there is little prospect that crude oil price will recover soon.

Like other oil company, they had hoped quickly tap vast reserve Russia. Even though they were prepared spend billion, they have held back because political and economic crisis Russia and great reluctance Russian official and oil company give control vast field. Thus they have had fall back exploration area their such deep water Gulf Mexico well West Africa and part Asia. Such exploration is very expensive, and when big field is discovered, platform costing $1 billion or more are required bring it production. Oil price have been pressure more year, falling more 40 percent $20-a-barrel level because growing inventory petroleum and declining Asian demand caused economic crisis there. On Wednesday, crude oil January delivery fell 29 cent, or 2.6 percent, $11.86 barrel New York Mercantile Exchange, close 12-year low $11.42 reached June 15. Members Organization Petroleum Exporting Countries and some other oil-producing nation, notably Mexico, have tried stem price drop pledge cut back production. But those pledge have not always been honored, and rally oil market this year have proven short-lived. OPEC member Wednesday continued their discussion extending their production cutback, and agreement is expected early Thursday. In spring, OPEC agreed reduce production 2.6 million barrel day, 3 percent daily world supply 74 million barrel. The main result that agreement appears have been keep oil price falling $10 barrel. Washington regulator said Wednesday that they had not been notified Exxon-Mobil discussion. The Federal Trade Commission is still reviewing British Petroleum's pending purchase Amoco. An Exxon-Mobil deal would be certain receive several months' worth scrutiny commission, which would review how much industry combined company would control.

This is deal that make sense, Ms. Jaffe said. With this combined company, there is no project that would be too big. Ms. Jaffe said proposed deal would provide each company asset area where it had little influence. There are lot complementary asset where they are not redundant, she said. She said that Exxon, example, ha strong presence Angola, while Mobil doe not. And Mobil ha significant asset Caspian Sea and Nigeria, where Exxon is weak. Times are tough oil patch. Still, it boggles mind accept notion that hardship is driving profitable Big Oil either merge, British Petroleum and Amoco have already agreed do, or least consider prospect, Exxon and Mobil are doing. Still, Big Oil and small oil are getting squeezed low petroleum price and high capital cost exploration. Given exotic locale most promising, untapped field, it seems unlikely that exploration will get cheaper. And West Texas crude trading $12 barrel, it seems safe bet oil that won't be selling $100 barrel turn century price some analyst early 1980s were predicting it would reach. Philip K. Verleger Jr., publisher Petroleum Economics Monthly and senior adviser Brattle Group, Cambridge, Mass., consulting firm, spent some time late last week talking Mobil, Exxon and changing dynamic oil business. Following are excerpt conversation: Q. (italics)There is lot focus antitrust aspect Exxon-Mobil deal. Do you see any problems?(end italic) A. Let me say right that I don't think this is done deal. I think it is far that. But if it were happen, I don't see many problem. BP Amoco is perfect end-to-end merger, one which there is little or no overlap company you are merging with. Exxon-Mobil come close. The first issue is competition local market. The only possible problem area there is West Coast, company are pretty small player there. If there is reason this merger might get extra attention, it will be because Exxon and Mobil have not been terribly friendly either Clinton administration's or European Union's position global warming. Q. (italics)Why are you skeptical deal?(end italic) A. Well, Mobil ha been trying get bigger. They had talk Amoco. They wanted buy Conoco. But I don't understand where Lucio Noto, Mobil's chief executive, fit this. That could be impediment agreement, because merger I don't think he ha place, and he ha been very strong leader. Q. (italics)Mobil is country's second-biggest oil company, Exxon. Why do they need get bigger?(end italic) A. In first decade next century, really big exploration opportunity will be very capital intensive, and only company deepest pocket will be able stay game: Royal Dutch, Exxon and BP Amoco. Companies Mobil's size are probably marginal player. Q. (italics)That suggests Mobil ha been harder hit Exxon downturn prices.(end italic) A. From 1988 1996, Exxon's exploration and production expenditure rose 8 percent. Mobil's rose 14 percent. But Mobil's expenditure were much more sensitive price elasticity oil Exxon's. They were pushing envelope, and when price fell they had cut back. Exxon ha tried build very large presence systematically, paying much attention month-to-month or year-to-year fluctuation oil price. They are brutally efficient. Q. (italics)Earlier this month Energy Department said oil price would stay soft nearly decade. Do you agree?(end italic) A. You know, every time I see forecast that go out that far I want go out and buy stock oil company. I think we are going see low oil price six month year. It is conceivable we could go next century oil $5 barrel, depending what happens world economy. During that period, we are going see substantial reduction investment exploration and production, leading reduction supply coming out non-OPEC country. That will strengthen hand OPEC country. And when Asian economy start growing again that will lead good deal higher oil price, say $20 barrel, next 18 month. Q. (italics)The number oil company is going shrink coming year, regardless, isn't it?(end italic) A. We are probably heading world which there are no more five or six big oil company, possibly eight. There is really no precedent having many big player we have oil business this modern society. Q. (italics)Do you think oil stock are good investment?(end italic) A. I think oil company are still worthwhile investment, it is not place where investor should plan making money next 9 12 month. And it is area where investor need be careful, because that period there will be good deal consolidation smaller company. Times are tough oil patch. Still, it boggles mind accept notion that hardship is driving profitable Big Oil either merge, British Petroleum and Amoco have already agreed do, or least consider prospect, Exxon and Mobil are doing. Oil company all stripe are getting squeezed low petroleum price and high capital cost exploration. Given exotic locale most promising untapped field, it seems unlikely that exploration will get cheaper. And West Texas crude trading $12 barrel, it seems safe bet that oil won't be selling $100 barrel turn century something analyst were predicting oil price run-up early 1980s.

Companies Mobil's size are probably marginal player. Q. That suggests Mobil ha been harder hit Exxon downturn price. A. From 1988 1996, Exxon's exploration and production expenditure rose 8 percent. Mobil's rose 14 percent. But Mobil's expenditure were much more sensitive price elasticity oil Exxon's. They were pushing envelope, and when price fell they had cut back. Exxon ha tried build very large presence systematically, paying much attention month-to-month or year-to-year fluctuation oil price. They are brutally efficient. Q. Earlier this month Energy Department said oil price would stay soft nearly decade. Do you agree? A. You know, every time I see forecast that go out that far I want go out and buy stock oil company. I think we are going see low oil price six month year. It is conceivable we could go next century oil $5 barrel, depending what happens world economy. During that period, we are going see substantial reduction investment exploration and production, leading reduction supply coming out non-OPEC country. That will strengthen hand OPEC country. And when Asian economy start growing again, that will lead good deal higher oil price, say $20 barrel, next 18 month. Q. The number oil company is going shrink coming year, regardless, isn't it? A. We are probably heading world which there are no more five or six big oil company, possibly eight. There is really no precedent having many big player we have oil business this modern society. Q. Do you think oil stock are good investment? A. I think oil company are still worthwhile investment, it is not place where investor should plan making money next 9 12 month. And it is area where investor need be careful, because that period there will be good deal consolidation smaller company.

46,"The raw passion were such that House Democrats not hesitate bellow You resign! You resign! Speaker-elect Robert Livingston when he called House floor President Clinton quit White House face certain impeachment. Shockingly, stunningly, Livingston just that. He quit one breathtaking utterance, if flicking trump card heap impeachment angst festering his eye debating chamber. In his one and only strategem leading his fellow House Republicans, Livingston's decision struck Congress verbal bomb. Stunned Democrats saw their fury vaporized instant. They had stand, almost staggering their foot, join Republicans prolonged, emotional ovation Livingston and his undeniable self-sacrifice. As they stood, Democrats sensed Livingston had most suddenly closed trap president and his defender. For, impeachment issue set move Senate, Livingston, whose marital indiscretion were now public his obvious misery, chose show how question political leader's resignation wa very much play this tumult-tossed city. I must set example that I hope President Clinton will follow, Livingston declared, flabbergasting all attending impeachment debate and nation watching beyond. Livingston walked floor sheriff some bullet-pocked political High Noon, discarding leadership badge he had wrested earlier speaker-casualty, Newt Gingrich. In corridor just beyond, doorman shouted police officer: Livingston just resigned! What? What? came reply officer, who obviously thought momentous announcement would be Clinton's impeachment, not Livingston's political self-immolation. Just so, Democrats, already deep bone-raw exhaustion their long fight president, grasped bearing. It is surrender developing sexual McCarthyism! declared Rep. Jerrold Nadler, D-N.Y., leading presidential defender trying rally Democrats argument that Livingston should not resign any more President Clinton should quit fire. But Republicans were surging fore strength Livingston's announcement, fighting tear they rose salute him ultimate political role model grueling impeachment process it roared final minute debate. For some it is no longer good enough make mistake, confirm that mistake and take consequence that mistake, said Tom DeLay, Republican whip, his hand shaking, his eye tearing he addressed House and sought drive example Livingston all way Pennsylvania Avenue. He understood what this debate wa all honor, duty, integrity and truth, said DeLay arguing that one swift blow, Livingston had demonstrated himself have been far better speaker Clinton ha been president. With something political elan president showed initiating Iraq attack his impeachment loomed, House Republicans, battered public opinion poll, had found rocket's red glare their own. I have hurt you all deeply and beg your forgiveness, Livingston told House, nation and his family he announced retreat. Only moment before, Democrats openly hissed man Livingston firmly read his judgment president: Sir, you have done great damage this nation year. Presidential resignation wa order, he continued, and then came shout You resign! You resign! And Livingston closed circle his career, he stunned place collective breath disbelief and somehow almost threatened reduce dark historic issue House impeachment president matter anticlimax. They must not succeed, David Bonior, Democratic whip said Republicans he wa given task refocusing day misdeed president, not departure speaker. We are here debate impeachment and should not be distracted that, he declared. The only way we can stop this vicious cycle, Bonior cried out floor, is if we refuse give it, whether it is Bill Clinton or Bob Livingston. But House wa still reeling frenzied day fateful vote presidency approached and notion resignation licked capital city flame forest. Rejecting last-minute Democratic attempt soften it action censure, House Representatives moved impeach President William Jefferson Clinton perjury Saturday and call Senate try him, convict him and remove him office. But vote, Republicans pressed another line attack, demanding Clinton's resignation. Rep. Robert Livingston, nominated speaker last month his party, startled House when he announced he would not run speaker and would resign House 21 year service. He urged president heal wound that you have created. You, sir, may resign your post. Angry Democrats booed and shouted, You resign! Livingston continued, I can only challenge you such fashion if I am willing heed my word. Apologizing again extramarital affair revealed two day ago, he said, I believe I had it me do fine job. But I cannot do that job or be kind leader that I would be current circumstance. Then he bolted House chamber, nearly knocking reporter and member down. (The House voted 228-206 approve first article impeachment, accusing Clinton committing perjury federal grand jury. The vote wa announced 1:24 pm. EST, leaving 42nd president face trial Senate whether he should be removed office.) Clinton rejected advice immediately. His spokesman, Joe Lockhart, said, The president ha no intention resigning. By calling Livingston reconsider, president argued more broadly resignation fire. Perhaps speaking case, Lockhart said, It would be wrong give this insidious politics personal destruction. Unless Clinton change course, this would be only second impeachment president 209-year history Republic, and first Andrew Johnson wa acquitted 1868. Sen. Trent Lott Mississippi, majority leader, ha insisted that no bargaining censure can prevent it starting. But Senate could halt trial later part deal. Considering degree partisanship displayed Saturday, assembling two-thirds majority required Constitution conviction is most unlikely. Sixty-seven vote would be required, and there are only 55 Republicans Senate, 45 Democrats. Four article impeachment House charged Clinton perjury lying his affair Monica Lewinsky federal grand jury here Aug. 17. He wa also charged perjury Paula Jones sexual harassment suit, obstruction justice and abuse power. The Republican argument, and over, wa that Clinton had lied denying having sexual relation Ms. Lewinsky. Rep. Dick Armey Texas, majority leader, said, A nation law cannot be ruled person who break law. Rep. Nancy Johnson Connecticut said: There can be no justice truth. That is just profoundly so, and that is why perjury matter. Rep. Gerald Kleczka Wisconsin began Democrats' argument saying, What president wa wrong, personally and morally, his act not threaten our democracy and thus do not rise level impeachable offense defined our founding father our Constitution. Rep. Charles Schumer, New York's senator-elect, said: The rule law requires that punishment fit crime. Allow u vote censure. Saturday's vote were penultimate step most serious conflict Congress and president Richard M. Nixon resigned face impeachment and certain conviction Aug. 9, 1974. But while that case spun out 1972 break-in Democratic headquarters Watergate complex, this one began murky land deal Arkansas 1978. Through effort Kenneth Starr, independent counsel law enacted wake Watergate, investigation spread examine Clinton's affair White House intern. All year it ha preoccupied capital immense disconnect public opinion; scandal became public January, poll have shown that public opposed impeachment and wanted inquiry brought end. Even Friday night, 13-hour debate, CBS News Poll 548 people showed that only 38 percent wanted their representative vote impeachment; 58 percent wanted no vote. The conflict now enters uncharted sea, Nixon resignation cut matter short and Johnson trial occurred different America, no nuclear weapon or cable television or public opinion poll. But capital wa still rife confident speculation. Some guessed, or hoped, that result recent poll, which showed increase support resignation way spare nation trial which Ms. Lewinsky and Linda Tripp would be star witness, would weaken Clinton's resolve. Others thought Republicans, seeing dismal number poll their party's standing United States, would be first blink. With majority Senate, they have power end trial any time Senate receives notice impeachment day it convenes, Jan. 6, or next day. But while Clinton ha focused poll, and CBS News survey showed that 64 percent still approve his handling his job president, resignation could almost immediately subject him criminal prosecution. And Republicans have steadfastly ignored poll all year, and confronted them directly Saturday. Representative JC. Watts Oklahoma, newly elected chairman Republican caucus, said: What's popular isn't always right. You say poll are this. Polls measure changing feeling, not steadfast principle. Polls would have rejected Ten Commandments. Polls would have embraced slavery and ridiculed women's right. You say we must draw this close. I say we must draw line right and wrong, not tiny fine line executive fountain pen, big fat lead No. 2 pencil. And we must do it so every kid America can see it. The point is not whether president can prevail, whether truth can prevail. Last weekend, when Judiciary Committee recommended four article impeachment, Clinton's side still hoped prevail help 20 30 Republican moderate who were uncommitted. As week wore on, almost all them broke president. One who not, Rep. Christopher Shays Connecticut, said Saturday: After Judge Starr's report Congress September, and his presentation Judiciary Committee November, I concluded that impeachable offense were not proven, and that proven offense were not impeachable. But president's continued failure come grip his action, sincerity and argument member Judiciary Committee side aisle, change heart and conviction member my side aisle who originally opposed impeachment and who now support it, and strong and powerful opinion so many my constituent who oppose my position and who wanted president impeached caused me rethink my position. He added: Yesterday morning, I visited president, I concluded that my original position wa correct one, me. I believe that impeachable offense have not been proven, and that proven offense are not impeachable. But Rep. Tom DeLay Texas, who ha led Republican effort force Clinton office, dismissed his and other argument moral relativism. He began praising Livingston: There is no greater American my mind, least today, Bob Livingston, because he understood what this debate wa all about. It wa honor and decency and integrity and truth; everything that we honor this country. It wa also debate relativism v. absolute truth. He continued, The president's defender have said that president is morally reprehensible, that he is reckless, that he ha violated trust American people, lessened their esteem office president and dishonored office which they have entrusted him, and that that doesn't rise level impeachment. Rep. Jose Serrano New York said, My constituent don't hate Bill Clinton; they love him and they're praying him right this very moment. You may have vote today impeach him, you don't have American people. And let me tell you something, I grew public housing project South Bronx. I can see bunch bully when I see them. The bully get theirs, and you're going get yours, too. Rep. Henry Hyde Illinois, Judiciary Committee chairman who brought charge House floor, said Congress and American people needed distinguish private act infidelity and public act public official. In Clinton's case, he said, House wa dealing serial violator oath who is chief law-enforcement officer. He said that Senate could be innovative and creative deciding how best punish Clinton, that House wa bound Constitution move ahead article impeachment. Justice is so important most humble u, Hyde said. Equal justice law that's what we're fighting for. Democrats, reading same Constitution, voiced diametrically conclusion, and attacked fairness proceeding that culminated Saturday. We're losing track distinction sin and crime, said Rep. Jerrold Nadler, D-NY. We're lowering standard impeachment. What president ha done is not great and dangerous offense republic. Democrats also criticized Republicans impeaching Clinton very moment that US. troop waged war Iraq. Six day Christmas our troop are battle, and lame-duck Congress is rushing overthrow commander chief, said Rep. David Bonior Michigan, second-ranking House Democrat. The ghost Watergate hung House chamber. One Republican cited parallel charge House Judiciary Committee brought Nixon 25 year ago, and count that same committee brought House floor affirmation Saturday. Nixon cheated. He cheated electoral system, said Rep. Lindsey Graham, South Carolina Republican Judiciary Committee. And now, Graham said, full House is voting impeach Clinton because we believe he committed crime that result cheating our judicial system. But most day's debate wa firmly rooted Clinton's effort conceal his sexual affair Monica Lewinsky. Rep. Bob Barr, Georgia Republican Judiciary Committee who is one Clinton's fiercest critic, held copy US. Criminal Code, Judiciary Committee's report impeachment inquiry and, finally, Constitution, defending his decision impeach president. Today, we rely three pillar our society: law itself, evidence and Constitution, said Barr. There is no joy upholding law, Watts said. If we cannot see lawlessness, our child cannot recognize it. How can we tell our child honesty is best policy when we don't demand it policy? But Democrats assailed very premise which Republican majority built it impeachment case Clinton. Rep. John Conyers Jr. Michigan, ranking Democrat Judiciary Committee, assailed four article impeachment, count count, unfounded evidence and failing rise impeachment. He saved his most savage scorn final count, abuse power. The majority ha simply tried dress perjury count Watergate abuse-of-power language, Conyers said. Rep. Bob Livingston, who confessed his colleague Thursday night that he had had adulterous affair, stunned House chamber Saturday morning saying impeachment debate President Clinton that he would not serve speaker and would quit Congress six month. He urged president follow his example and quit, too. But White House, where call Clinton's resignation are derided Republican strategy, president sent spokesman driveway urge Livingston reconsider his resignation. Livingston stood well House he ha served two decade and called Clinton resign his office rather force trial Senate, drawing boo his colleague and cat-calls that he should quit instead. He then just that. I must set example that I hope President Clinton will follow, Livingston announced shocked and silent chamber act that left Republican Party total chaos just hour vote impeach Clinton. The decision also left party leaderless eve opening 106th Congress, when Republicans must govern one narrowest majority history. Several Republicans, including Rep. Tom DeLay Texas, majority whip, somberly welcomed news, suggesting it relieved them excruciating embarrassment. In lauding Livingston's move, DeLay said, He understood what this debate wa all it's honor and decency and integrity and truth, everything we honor this country. But Democrats said they were aghast, and many including Clinton called Livingston reconsider his decision. Mr. Livingston's resignation wa wrong, declared Rep. Jerrold Nadler, D-NY. It is surrender developing sexual McCarthyism. Are we going have new test if someone want run public office are you now or have you ever been adulterer? He called country distinguish sin and crime. White House press secretary Joe Lockhart said Clinton wa disappointed news Livingston's plan and wished that he would reconsider. Lockhart said president firmly belief that politics personal destruction this town and this country ha come end. He reaffirmed that Clinton would not resign, saying: The president is going do what's best interest country. It would be wrong give this insidious politics personal destruction. Livingston's announced resignation wa all more stunning it disclosure process that could result president's removal office. The speaker is second line presidency, vice president. Newt Gingrich, outgoing speaker, who wa driven post Republicans lost five seat November election, technically remains speaker Jan. 6, when Livingston's election wa be ratified new Congress. But Gingrich ha removed himself daily operation House this extraordinary session and ha begun dismantle his office. Livingston's decision wa said be driven part anger group dozen conservative his party who were disillusioned that he had withheld news his affair them. They had threatened withhold their vote him election January that would formally make him speaker. He wa also concerned pain caused his family further disclosure, some member said. They added that, not lost many his party, wa example he would set president offering resign his post now. DeLay, No. 3 House Republican leadership, is expected fill power vacuum least temporarily, deed if not title, while party regroups find new speaker. Many member quickly rallied Rep. Dennis Hastert Illinois. Hastert, one DeLay's deputy whip who is well respected his colleague, had been promoted candidate majority leader last month, never mounted campaign. Rep. Dick Armey Texas only precariously held his majority-leader post last month and wa not considered likely candidate speaker. He is expected manage reorganization, which Republican leader have set Jan. 4. Livingston met privately his closest adviser Friday impeachment debate unfolded. Some his colleague believed he had made mistake disclosing Thursday night just House wa moving divisive debate impeachment that he had occasion strayed my marriage. He told Republican leader late Thursday afternoon that Hustler magazine wa going expose his affair early next year. Some leader urged him keep quiet, his wife, Bonnie, encouraged him tell his colleague immediately, momentous vote that wa nearing floor. At that point Thursday night, Roll Call, newspaper Capitol Hill, reported it Web site that Livingston wa going admit affair and wa going offer resign. In closed-door meeting his fellow Republicans, he admit affair made no offer step down, receiving three standing ovation instead. Thursday night, Livingston stated that he would not be intimidated these effort exploit his past. But Friday he removed himself public action and that night drew his closest adviser his confidence. His aide said Saturday that they had no clue what wa he wa contemplating, and few other member were aware his plan. Asked if he had any advance word, Rep. JC. Watts Oklahoma, newly elected member Republican leadership, said: I had no idea. Asked if there had been internal party pressure Livingston resign, Rep. Harold Rogers, R-Ky., said: I didn't know it if there wa, added, There were some member who were critical it. As leader tried Saturday hold party together and House floor, most Republicans stuck their prepared script floor favor impeaching president. But some began expressing their anguish. Rep. Henry Hyde, R-Ill., who admitted his adulterous affair earlier this year, said Livingston's resignation: Those u who are sinner must feel wretched today. Something is going repeatedly that ha be stopped, and that is confusion private act infidelity and public act. To much applause, Hyde declared: Congress ha no business intruding private act. Republicans, indeed Livingston himself, had made this same distinction Clinton's sexual indiscretion and Livingston's, saying that Clinton lied his private act and therefore abused legal system and his power. As Livingston said his statement Thursday: These indiscretion were not employee my staff and I have never been asked testify oath them. Democrats hoped that Livingston's seemingly drastic action would wake House how poisoned atmosphere had become and might prompt Republicans reconsider impeachment Clinton. Rep. Paul Kanjorski, D-Pa., said, We are now starting offer sacrificial lamb terrible disease this is. In stirring speech applauded some Republicans, Rep. Dick Gephardt Missouri, Democratic leader, praised Livingston worthy, good and honorable man and said his resignation wa grave mistake. It's terrible capitulation negative political force that are consuming our political system and our country, Gephardt said, adding that event last few day showed life imitates farce. We need stop destroying imperfect people unattainable altar public morality, he said, urging his colleague step back abyss and reject resignation, impeachment and vicious self-righteousness. The New York Times said editorial Sunday, Dec. 20: The Republicans' drive partisan impeachment based soley party-line voting power rather any sense proportion produced unexpected sideshow resignation Rep. Bob Livingston his role future speaker House. Analysts side struggle President Clinton's future will point Livingston's downfall evidence generalized breakdown legislative civility Capitol Hill. Democrats will see moral symmetry, depicting Livingston victim sexual puritanism he wa wielding Clinton. But one thing that no one should fall is Livingston's invitation use his resignation model resolving crisis White House. Livingston's statement rocked Congress, it should not shake foundation somber constitutional process now underway. By lying oath, Clinton made it necessary House consider impeachment. The evidence convinced most Americans that president should be censured, not removed office. Livingston allowed GOP partisan block censure House. The result is that Saturday's expected impeachment vote, Livingston's unexpected announcement, mission Senate remains same. It must resist those Republicans who want short-circuit constitutional process demand resignation, and it must use upcoming Senate trial forum finding censure commensurate president's personal dishonesty and offense law. These require stern punishment not removal office. In undertaking this work, Senate must also reassure American people that decisive wisdom core our messy-looking political system ha not melted down. In such distempered time, this is shining opportunity Senate. Its member pride themselves being Republic's fire wall presidential excess and popular or partisan passion that sometimes seize House Representatives. No one can predict whether Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott will rise defining challenge his career or whether he will surrender mean streak he acquired 16 grumpy year minority member House. We would see Lott reach starring role history. Lott's growling response question censure is not encouraging. He may be right that Constitution requires him convene trial, nothing that document prevents him speedily guiding Senate censure negotiation. Indeed, simple majority vote 45 Democrats 6 cooperating Republicans can end Senate trial any time, clearing way introduction kind censure resolution suggested former Sen. Bob Dole. In intriguing report NBC, Tim Russert described discussion bipartisan group senator censure that would involve some form presidential confession, fine and joint congressional request that Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr not prosecute Clinton court. If Lott refuse allow bipartisan search censure, burden will fall respected member Joseph Lieberman Democratic side and Orrin Hatch Republicans. Through cooperation, they can guide Senate punishment that fix Clinton history president who lied oath, avoids taint partisan vengeance associated House impeachment vote. The Senate's historic reputation prudence requires it find appropriate punishment personally weak president who ha damaged rule law, not threatened stability government. House Speaker-elect Robert L. Livingston presented fresh note shock impeachment debate President Clinton Thursday night Republican leader wa forced admit his Republican colleague that he had carried adulterous affair his past. It ha suddenly come my attention that there are individual working together medium who are investigating my personal background effort find indiscretion which may be exploitable me and my party eve upcoming historic vote impeachment, Livingston declared statement appearing shocked House Republican conference head disclosure it surfaced news report. After hearing his admission closed session, Livingston's colleague gave him standing ovation support and said question his resigning had never arisen. My fate is your hand, Livingston told Republicans, according lawmaker who were present. The debate president's fate would go forward, Republicans later insisted, drawing distinction speaker-elect's revelation and sex-and-mendacity scandal that ha put Clinton brink impeachment. The president is charged impeachment resolution perjury and abuse power his attempt hide sexual indiscretion. Democrats offered no immediate comment, Republicans were braced hear Livingston's admission alluded debate Friday Democrats who have decried investigation president basically partisan and unfair rummaging his sex life. Livingston, saying he had sought spiritual counseling and had received forgiveness his family, noted he had several time told reporter his campaign become speaker that I wa running speaker, not sainthood. He added, There wa reason those word. During my 33-year marriage my wife, Bonnie, I have occasion strayed my marriage, and doing so nearly cost me my marriage and family, Livingston said his brief prepared statement. But he attempted draw contrast allegation president, asserting: I want assure everyone that these indiscretion were not employee my staff and I have never been asked testify oath them. The disclosure speaker-elect's marital infidelity, disclosed Rollcall, Capitol Hill newspaper, sent new jolt uncertainty lawmaker they prepared momentous debate president's admitted misbehavior office and whether he should be impeached and tried Senate. Rep. Henry Hyde, Republican chairman House Judiciary Committee who is bring impeachment charge president, previously wa cited magazine extra-marital affair his past. Then, Thursday night, Republicans voiced suspicion that Democratic defender president instigated medium investigation effort embarrass Clinton's principal accuser. But no proof wa offered Republicans left their conference, facing uncertainty debate that already promised be bare-knuckled it partisanship. Livingston left conference surrounded Capitol police, not taking question waiting reporter. His chief leadership aide immediately rallied support. Some who would rather not struggle this constitutional question continue try twist debate unseemly investigation private life, said Rep. Dick Armey, Republican majority leader. In it report internet Thursday night, Rollcall not disclose it source made oblique reference Hustler, sex magazine. Larry Flint, publisher Hustler, earlier this year advertised offer $1 million bounty information e member Congress guilty sexual indiscretion. It break your heart because we're all subject human frailty, said Asa Hutchinson, R-Ark., he left conference. This is not comfortable circumstance anyone, he added, insisting president and speaker-elect presented two separate issue. We've got duty do Constitution. It ha gotten point where drastic action may be necessary. You know those movie Ebola virus outbreak, where guy sterile suit come in, seal area and completely irradiate it? They may have do that Washington. Just eradicate u and start scratch. In few, short day we have managed make term surreal, bizarre, split-screen America, shocking, runaway train and politics personal destruction useless cliche. We no longer govern here. We just roll gutter wondering who's next this sexual auto-de-fe. On Saturday morning, we had surreal, shocking, bizarre, split-screen image Bob Livingston, speaker-elect, stepping his marital infidelity were revealed. We are all pawn chessboard, Livingston said, asking president resign and then resigning himself. Livingston's rabid pursuit president, he hoped hide his dirty laundry, made him avatar hypocrisy capital rotting hypocrisy. On Thursday night, when Livingston first confessed his sin Republicans hope keeping his hold his post, his colleague gave him standing ovation. And he made his surprise announcement Saturday, Republicans gave him another ovation and stepped deliver encomium their lost speaker. One's self-esteem get utterly crushed time this, sighed Henry Hyde, another tormenter president who also had admit that he had succumbed temptation. Tom DeLay, jagged-edge exterminator who may next-up speaker roundelay, wa choked up, praising greatness Livingston understanding that this wa debate relativism absolute truth. What could be more relative Republican who ha hidden lot affair trying impeach president lying his? Spurred Larry Flynt's bounty sinnuendo, city wa braced more craziness. The Ship Fools reached cruising speed Friday evening, when we had frightening scene Republicans so crazed hatred president that they were railroading impeachment though United States wa war Iraq, though House chamber wa mostly empty, though Republicans were huddled glass house issue sex and lie, and though White House wa still pitching tent and planning sleigh ride Winter Wonderland press party Monday. (The White House wa keeping journalist quarantined this year, encouraged them bring their kid. To soak some that cozy family atmosphere, no doubt. Why are Republicans so obsessed, when everyone his right mind agrees that impeachment is outlandishly over-the-top punishment Clinton and self-destructive course country? Because they genuinely hate president. They think he's dishonest, immoral, issue-stealing, selfish child '60s. They don't think they're going pay political price this, and if they do, they don't care. It might be great time see lot combovers, it's not great time see lot stature. The House debate wa not history. It wa just more hideous version The McLaughlin Group. While Republicans tried draw distinction that Clinton had perjured himself, they ignored that president had been lured Starr-Jones attorney team testifying Monica Lewinsky. Ordinarily one would feel sorry Livingston. But Republicans have brought this sexual doomsday machine themselves focusing so single-mindedly Clinton's sex life. The Republicans were so determined do their high-tech lynching that they engaged wacky role reversal. Many Republican hawk argued that Bill Clinton should not be bombing Saddam, claiming timing wa suspicious, though they had hammered him not bombing five week ago. In incredibly unseemly display, Trent Lott, majority leader, and former Bush national security adviser Brent Scowcroft and Bush Secretary State Lawrence Eagleburger chimed attack. There's too much hate here. And I hate it. We are here debate impeachment and should not be distracted that, minority whip, Rep. David Bonior, Democrat Michigan, said Saturday's House debate, what leaped out impossible goal. It would have taken kaleidoscopic television screen capture constantly shifting image competing center stage: impeachment, Iraq, resignation Rep. Robert Livingston, response White House. The month leading impeachment President Clinton had become series televised anticlimax, hour vote made that lack drama. There were hardly enough shorthand term or split screen cover activity. All network and cable channel carried moment that unexpectedly set tone, Livingston, Louisiana Republican, announced debate that he would not become House speaker. The commentator had been set carry congressional ratification inevitable vote, suddenly most plugged-in reporter were caught guard. As Tim Russert said Tom Brokaw NBC, Tom, knock u all over. In echo chamber that television news so becomes, shared mantra had been weightier early morning. For only second time American history president would be impeached, went standard line. Yet all pundit speculating and politician telegraphing every move, no one had hinted Livingston resignation. The announcement wa, Brokaw put it, least partly political ploy, and repercussion were immediate. Reporters began gathering word Capitol Hill candidate speaker's job, and conversation moved next stage political tug war. The Republicans used Livingston's resignation say that president should resign, too; Democrats immediately countered idea that president would stay and that Livingston should well. That led one less-expected split screen day, and it wa not bad choice. While Congress wa debating, CNN showed anti-aircraft fire Baghdad one box. In other, Joe Lockhart, Clinton's press secretary, stood White House driveway telling reporter that president would Livingston reconsider his decision. There wa more stateliness House television offer, and one reason wa purely visual. Keep mind that we do not control picture, Dan Rather said CBS, explaining that television camera Congress are provided House, not individual network. There wa no way roam and zoom reaction shot, political convention. But sense history and decorum didn't last long CBS. At noon, vote, CBS went football game, becoming only network leave news coverage. CBS' corporate decision try have it way meant that Rather would break update Washington. I'll see you very soon, he said he signed complete coverage, looking trouper. But he wa position no news anchor should have been this day. He later announced impeachment vote split screen football game progress upper part screen. On other network and cable channel, vote itself literally happened background. As TV screen toted number electronically-cast vote, member Congress milled and chatted floor. Even brief Democratic walkout motion consider censure wa defeated wa thoroughly forecast. As Democrats straggled step Congress, it looked curiously undramatic television, though it probably made better still photograph once they were all place. And while vote were progress, jockeying speaker's job heated up. We already have presumptive leader, Gwen Ifill NBC News said midafternoon, naming Rep. Dennis Hassert, R-Ill., who had also been cited other network likely candidate. If political and military action had not intruded, it might have been more obvious that debate House floor sent message vast division politics and morality, signaling how deep cultural fissure this crisis ha opened. The impeachment, said Rep. Tom DeLay, R-Texas, wa debate relativism v. absolute truth. Rep. Jerrold Nadler, D-N.Y., contended that Congress had lost distinction sin and crime, and argued sexual McCarthyism that ha become prominent. And backdrop revelation adultery that led Livingston's resignation, Rep. Dick Gephardt, minority leader, declared politics personal destruction ha end. But all jabbering and political posturing continued, reporter raced cover president's statement impeachment and latest briefing Pentagon, there wa little time focus profound cultural message those rhetorical flourish. Bob Livingston, incoming speaker House, took no public role Friday debate unfolded whether impeach President Clinton. His previous 24 hour had been his most visible month his party nominated him speaker and perhaps most excruciating his public career: He spent most day chaotic procedural wrangle term Friday's debate; he ended it telling his Republican colleague that he had had extramarital affair his 20-year tenure Congress. His disclosure followed investigation Larry Flynt, publisher Hustler, sex magazine, who said Friday news conference Beverly Hills, Calif., that his publication had learned that Livingston had had adulterous affair last 10 year. Flynt said earlier this year that he wanted expose hypocrisy those Washington who are investigating Clinton and October offered $1 million anyone who could prove they had had affair member Congress. He said Friday that this larger investigation, be published perhaps soon January, would reveal what he described indiscretion several other Republicans. He said he had no connection White House that he had hired investigative firm based Washington and made former employee FBI and CIA. He would not confirm whether firm is Terry Lenzner's Investigative Group Inc., which ha done work president's private lawyer. Livingston wa unavailable reporter Friday. He spent some time Friday morning sprawled chair back House chamber, listening debate whether impeach Clinton lying his sexual indiscretion. Several colleague knelt Livingston's knee, whispered him and patted him back. He spent most day private office chamber, avoiding gauntlet reporter who lay wait him House and his regular office street. The only word out his aide wa that Navy had awarded contract worth million dollar ship be built his Louisiana district Avondale Shipyards. During Friday's debate, handful Democrats made only oblique allusion human failure. For example, Rep. John Lewis, D-Ga., said: Let he that ha no sin cast first stone. Who, who u ha not sinned? But no one said that Livingston's disclosure or mild Democratic attempt exploit it would influence their vote impeachment. Rather, House floor and hallway chitchat, Livingston's conduct seemed be last thing that either Republicans or Democrats wanted talk about. Bob Livingston is first-rate human being, said Rep. David Obey, D-Wis., who ha worked closely and sparred Livingston Appropriations Committee, interview. I will repeat what nun taught me St. James long time ago: We would all be hell lot better looking our soul rather trying evaluate somebody else's. None u have any business having opinion it. Even conservative Republicans seemed ready overlook disclosure. We're not going say, `Bob, you can't be speaker because you violated your vow your wife,' said Rep. Lindsey Graham, R-SC. Like many, including Livingston, Graham distinguished Livingston's conduct Clinton's saying that president had trampled legal system whereas Livingston's behavior wa strictly private. Despite Flynt's claim, many Republicans blamed Clinton administration smearing Livingston, although they offered no evidence. This isn't just happening it own, said Rep. Dana Rohrabacher, R- Calif. The only thing certain now is uncertainty. The smart money shout that President Clinton will never resign, and he concurs. The smart money argues that Senate could not muster 67 vote that would be needed remove wounded president office, which would require defection 12 Democrats if all Republicans stand him. The smart money insists that someone will cut deal end all this. Maybe so. But smarter money whisper, Remember. Remember that everyone Washington, including Rep. Henry Hyde, R-Ill., chairman Judiciary Committee, said House would never, ever, treat impeachment partisan issue. Wrong. Remember that all pundit predicted Democratic loss midterm election, and when happened, they said impeachment wa dead. Twice wrong. And remember that New Year nation may travel road it ha never traveled before. One other president, Andrew Johnson Tennessee, ha been tried Senate, course. But that happened different country one only 37 state, primitive communication, simple economy based largely agriculture, only minimal commitment abroad. In toxic politics century's end Washington, inconceivable ha become commonplace. The wholly unanticipated announcement Saturday morning Rep. Robert Livingston, R-La., that he would not serve speaker and would resign Congress, his equally unanticipated disclosure Thursday night several extramarital affair, only deepened capital's profound sense insecurity. The deadly sweep scythe neo-puritanism appears unstoppable, least moment, and Livingston's forthcoming resignation will increase pressure president do likewise. You've set u example, leader House Republican majority, Rep. Dick Armey Texas, told Livingston Saturday. The example is that principle come power. The Democrats made point, arguing that Livingston case showed how very wrong it wa savage people personal pecaddillos. One transcendently important thing remains same: Although surrounded judicial trapping and presided chief justice, trial president are political process, power residing hand elective politician. In addition narrow legal issue guilt or innocence, they can weigh consideration party, nation's future, their individual political well-being and almost anything else they care weigh reaching verdict. The longer they took, more numerous call resignation would probably be. Even Saturday's epochal roll-calls, four ten Americans interviewed latest New York Times/CBS News Poll said they thought president should step if he were be indicted, fact that large majority voiced disapproval impeachment proceeding. What lie that seeming contradiction, course, is fear that Clinton, and country him, would be incapacitated. No one took Andrew Johnson very seriously he escaped conviction single vote. But Clinton, man powerful will whose whole life ha been series comeback, ha already embarked effort show that he can do nation's business. Richard Nixon clawed his way back respectability leaving White House when no one thought he could; Clinton intends re-establish his authority while still office. He ha one great advantage: Two-thirds American public continues voice it approval his political stewardship, it think him man. The president will press hard, his much-reduced leverage, deal censure. Indeed, fine piece political irony one could ask for, he ha already sought enlist former Sen. Bob Dole, Republican he defeated 1996, emissary Senate majority. The number are not unpromising: help six Republicans, 45 Democrats could end trial any time and pas censure resolution that House would surely take up. There are enough Republican moderate and sometime party-buckers make that plausible target. But Republican leader Senate, Trent Lott Mississippi, who ha made his unwillingness take president's word plainly evident recent day, is determined fight such trial-aborting arrangement. It is clear that Clinton's reputation ha been stained forever, no matter what Senate doe. The spot will not out. History will remember this man who so coveted glowing legacy not impresario economic growth, not Moses who pointed way 21st century, second president ever be impeached, if not first be ousted. That harsh word, impeachment, will cling his name surely Teapot Dome cling Harding's and Depression Hoover's. But he is not alone having suffered grievous injury political avalanche that wa shaken loose disclosure Clinton's sexual relationship former White House intern, Monica Lewinsky. The Republicans' public support ha shriveled 40 percent new Times/CBS News poll, it lowest level 14 year, and it could go lower once fact impeachment sink in. Journalists are seen many jackal, indifferent personal suffering or national angst they may cause long they get story, and none too concerned accuracy. In fact, whole political culture 1990s, it criminalization political conduct and it seeming indifference important national and international issue, ha fallen disrepute ordinary Americans. The last week seemed crystallize long-term decline political civility. Republicans called Clinton liar, he wa committing American pilot sky Iraq, and Democrats accused their rival conducting political lynching or political coup d'etat. Bipartisanship may have been biggest victim all. Party line Saturday's roll call held firm leg iron. Almost all Republicans who opposed impeachment so not exclusively legal principle least partly because special political circumstance Democratic majority Rep. Constance Morella's district Maryland suburb Washington, example, and gratitude Rep. Peter King, R-N.Y., Clinton's peacemaking Ireland. It is hard see who ha emerged it reputation enhanced, perhaps Hillary Rodham Clinton, staunch face deception. If some threat and dire prediction uttered House Democrats recent day are be taken face value, nation is entering Era Bad Feelings, polar second Era Good Feelings, similar that 1820s, that Clinton had hoped preside over. Rep. Tom Sawyer, D-Ohio, compared Clinton Friday Sir Thomas More, executed treason 1535 because his religious belief. He quoted More's word admonition today: What you have hunted me is not my action thought my heart. It is long road you have opened. God help statesman who walk your road. But amidst all loose talk permanent damage this institution or that, remember: Things change startling speed modern American politics, and institution American government have proved extraordinarily resilient. President Nixon, it wa almost universally agreed 1974, had weakened American presidency many decade come. Nobody said that eight year Ronald Reagan, and that wa only 15 year later. In end, will people meant nothing. Bob Livingston couldn't have been clearer that. His mind and mind his follower were closed. Even bombing continued Iraq and Americans coast coast were clamoring alternative impeachment, his adulterous wa being flushed out grotesque invasion privacy that inevitably followed relentlessly prurient pursuit president, country began contemplate destructive effect lengthy and bitter Senate trial, speaker-designate arrogantly and stupidly proclaimed: Let u disregard influence. The radical Hill would hear nothing echo their fanaticism. Impeach! Impeach! And that continued stunning announcement Saturday morning that Livingston would quit House. Dismayed partisan stampede, Dick Gephardt, Democratic leader, warned impeachment debate Friday: In your effort uphold Constitution, you are trampling Constitution. David Bonior, Democratic whip, said: This is wrong. It is unfair. It is unjust. At time when event world and challenge home demand that we stand united, censure is one solution that can bring u together. To my colleague aisle, I say let go your obsession. Listen American people. But voice reason would not be heard. Livingston and his right-wing colleague, Tom DeLays, Henry Hydes, Bob Barrs, were mission destruction and would not be denied. Ordinary Americans could cry out all they wanted. They could protest and demonstrate, send fax and E-mails. It didn't matter. The right wa march and democracy wa run. Rep. Thomas Barrett, Democrat Wisconsin, tried remind his Republican colleague that Constitution doe not allow you remove president office because you can't stand him. He wa, course, ignored. The Republicans will pay huge price their brazen, utterly partisan attempt drag president White House defiance will people. The party's contempt voter wa arrogantly quite adequately summed Alan Simpson, former senator Wyoming, who said: The attention span Americans is which movie is coming out next month and whether quarterly report their stock will change. If voter are dope that Mr. Simpson think they are, then come 2000 everyone will have forgotten there wa impeachment crisis. But Rep. Robert Menendez, D-N.J., wa probably closer truth when he said, I warn my colleague that you will reap bitter harvest unfair partisan seed you sow today. One many strange event couple week wa way which virtually all previously undecided Republicans, so-called moderate, surrendered their independence and lined lackey follow right wing's lead. All proclaimed loudly that they were voting principle, fact it wa exercise mass cowardice, exemplified Rep. John McHugh upstate New York. McHugh announced Tuesday that he would vote impeachment. But if his decision wa based principle, he had odd way expressing it. The Washington Post said McHugh appeared have no stomach Senate conviction or removal president office. Of his colleague Senate, McHugh said, I, one, would accept, welcome, their mercy. In other word, let Senate do heavy constitutional lifting. McHugh may have wished out loud mercy, he clearly wa too frightened right-winger House cast compassionate vote himself. The GOP can no longer conceal that it is party extremist, right-wing absolutist, party out step political and cultural orientation most Americans. Bob Livingston may be leaving, his arrogant comment can still serve his party's slogan. Let u disregard influence. Let u disregard people. ","During the Clinton impeachment debate in the House, Speaker-elect Bob Livingston declared that he would set an example for the president and resign from Congress over revelations of his marital infidelities.Republican demands that the president also resign were rejected by Democrats who also said that Livingston should not quit and that the Speaker-elect's resignation was, in the words of Jerrold Nadler (D-N.Y), ""a surrender to sexual McCarthyism"".With the House vote to impeach, the president will face a Senate trial, but it is unlikely that 67 members will vote for conviction.The trial could be mercifully shortened, however, by a vote of censure.","As impeachment proceedings in the House approached a climax, House members were stunned by an admission from House Speaker elect Livingston that he was guilty of an adulterous affair.The admission follows disclosures by Hustler published Larry Flynn, who had offered one million dollars to anyone who could provide such information on a House or Senate member.Livingston's admission was met with a standing ovation by House members, as was his subsequent resignation.In resigning, Livingston called on President Clinton to do the same.Political pundits see the whole process as driven by partisan politics.","House Speaker-elect Robert L.

47,"The first part international space station wa smoothly orbiting Earth Friday faultless launch that marked start new age space exploration and colonization. A Russian Proton booster rocket carried module it initial orbit 200 kilometer (125 mile) Earth and unit wa operating planned, official said. Russia's Zarya, or Sunrise, module is fly alone two week rendezvous American space shuttle Endeavour, which is be launched Dec. 3 carrying Unity connecting module. Space official 16 nation taking part project cheered rocket soared cloudy sky central Asian steppe Baikonur launch pad Friday year later planned. During the, pickup 4th pvs Endeavour's astronaut connected first two building block international space station Sunday, creating seven-story tower shuttle cargo bay. It wa first time that Russian-built Zarya control module and made-in-America Unity chamber had ever touched. It looked be perfect and, hopefully, long-lasting fit. We have capture Zarya, commander Robert Cabana announced moment two piece came together. Congratulations crew good ship Endeavour, replied Mission Control. That's terrific. The 240-mile-high construction job began two hour earlier Nancy Currie's capture Zarya (Russian Sunrise) using shuttle robot arm. We're halfway home, Cabana said. Then came hard part: stacking two giant cylinder cargo bay. The two station piece are so big 77 foot tip one tip other combined mass 70,000 pound that Currie and her crewmates had rely computerized vision system and camera view, rather direct line sight. This wa first time such blind docking had ever been attempted. Currie positioned solar-winged Zarya, still end shuttle robot arm, several inch directly Unity. It wa slow going; she wanted and needed perfect alignment. Once she wa sure she had it, Cabana fired Endeavour's thruster, and brief burst raised shuttle and thereby Unity enough docking mechanism two station component snap together. The historical moment occurred South Pacific. The union intended last station's 15-year or more lifetime set stage spacewalk two astronaut Monday attach electrical connector and cable two component. Mission Control thought Sunday's work might take hour longer planned and gave six astronaut plenty time task. But everything occurred more or le when and how it wa supposed to, aside piece space junk that strayed too close. Before beginning their final approach Zarya, six astronaut had steer clear chunk rocket launched last month California. Mission Control ordered pilot fire shuttle thruster put extra three mile Endeavour and space junk, putting Endeavour total five mile orbiting debris. The smaller gap would have been probably little too close comfort, Mission Control said. The bigger worry, far, wa Endeavour's pursuit and capture Zarya, and it coupling Unity. The shuttle's 50-foot robot arm had never handled object massive 41-foot, 44,000-pound Zarya, power and propulsion module that wa launched Kazakstan Nov. 20. It will provide all necessary electricity and steering fledgling space station permanent control module can be launched next summer. Minutes Zarya's capture, Cabana called that two antenna module were still undeployed Russian flight controller had feared. The antenna must be fully deployed order Zarya's manual docking system work; that system won't be needed next summer, official said. The only other problem wa Zarya battery; astronaut took replacement part. The 36-foot, 25,000-pound Unity, first American-made component, will serve connecting passageway, or vestibule, future module. It wa crucial that Zarya and Unity be joined; if they could not be connected robot arm, NASA would have sent out two spacewalking astronaut manually fit them together. In all, three spacewalks are planned Endeavour's 12-day flight, not only hook electrical connection two module install handrail and other tool future crew. The joined module will be released Endeavour once all work is completed. NASA estimate 43 more launch and 159 more spacewalks will be needed this mission assemble entire orbiting complex. Once completed, 16-nation space station will have mass 1 million pound, be longer football field, and house seven astronaut and cosmonaut. Russian space official gave first module international space station routine tweak Saturday push it higher orbit, and convened meeting Earth map out it future. Flight controller fired one module's two maneuvering engine raise it orbit 230 kilometer (157 mile) space, station's public affair office said. Russian Space Agency general director Yuri Koptev told reporter maneuver wa carried out great accuracy, and 24-ton core module wa cruising space any problem. The module, called Zarya, or Sunrise, lifted Friday Baikonur launchpad Kazakstan initial orbit 200 kilometer (125 mile) Earth. Zarya is serve space tugboat early stage international project, providing propulsion, power and communication. It will fly alone two week rendezvous American space shuttle Endeavour, which is be launched Dec. 3 carrying Unity connecting module. The international space station is U.S.-led successor Russia's Mir space station, and is being heralded space official vehicle unprecedented international cooperation space 21st century. The head space agency United States, Russia, Japan and Canada, European Space Agency, met Moscow Saturday discus project, Interfax news agency reported. The space agency head agreed schedule future meeting and holding scientific conference project somewhere Europe, unspecified date. Also Saturday, head Russia's Mission Control, Vladimir Lobachev, wa quoted saying that Russia would take lead role managing international space station it first five year. Previously, space official have said station would be jointly controlled Moscow and Houston, US. space agency NASA taking lead role. According Interfax, Lobachev said it made sense Russia control project because Russian-built Zarya and Russian-built service module would perform most life support and navigational function station's first five year. Furthermore, Russian engineer are more experienced this job and NASA official are aware this, he said. The space station is expected cost least dlrs 40 billion, which United States is expected pay dlrs 24 billion. Russia's financing problem delayed initial launch year, and some critic have said station amount expensive way NASA keep Russia's beleaguered space program alive. The station will serve orbital home visiting astronaut and cosmonaut least 15 year.

Russian space expert were making final preparation Thursday Baikonur rocket base launch first component multibillion dollar international space station year delay. Built Russian company and be launched atop Russian booster rocket, 24-ton Zarya (Sunrise) control and cargo module is U.S.-funded component station. It will serve space tugboat early stage project, providing propulsion, power and communication. The unmanned launch, set 9:40 Moscow time (0640 GMT) Friday Baikonur Kazakhstan, ha been delayed one year mainly because cash-strapped Russian space agency's failure complete another part station. After year discussing, planning and replanning, we are launch hardware, Gretchen McClain, deputy associate administrator new station, said news conference earlier this week. We are ready begin project that will bring u millennium woman and men living and working space permanently. Russian official added their traditional note superstition. It is not Russian tradition preface launch . some advance statement. I would knock wood, which is rather common Russian tradition, said Alexander Krasnov, deputy chief Russian Space Agency's manned flight department. The station, involving 16 nation United States and Russia playing biggest role, will consist more 100 element that will take 45 assembly flight complete. It is due be completed 2004. The station will weigh 500 ton (more million pound) and is expected cost least dlrs 40 billion, United States planning pay dlrs 21 billion. It will serve orbital home visiting astronaut and cosmonaut 20 year. Zarya is fly alone two week rendezvous American space shuttle Endeavor, which is be launched Dec. 3 carrying Unity connecting module. The shuttle crew will attach two module together three space walk, using Endeavors robot arm. The 12.4-meter (41.2-feet) Zarya hold more 6 ton fuel it 16 tank and is capable flying independently 430 day. Its control system consists 36 thruster and two large engine major orbital change. It will be launched three-stage heavy-lift Proton booster rocket that would put Zarya orbit le 10 minute blastoff. In ensuing day, ground controller will gradually adjust it orbit preparation meeting Endeavor. The space station will not be inhabitable early 2000, launch Russian crew module which is set blast next July or August. Russia ha repeatedly failed meet deadline constructing crew module, putting whole project schedule. Having lost hope getting promised government fund, Russian space agency ha sold it early research time station NASA dlrs 60 million complete segment. Agency chief Yuri Koptev said that taking part new station is only hope beleaguered Russian space industry, whose funding ha collapsed Soviet collapse. The project would allow Russia keep 80,000 job next 15 year. Koptev assailed some Russian space engineer who continue insist that more money should be put Russia's battered 12-year old Mir space station extend it lifetime instead committing more fund new space outpost. The choice mustn't be determined emotion. Some people are glued one thing (Mir) and don't care rest, Koptev said recent news conference. We must proceed understanding what would take u future, allow u preserve our industry. The Russian Khrunichev company ha earned dlrs 200 million building Zarya, whose design wa based earlier Soviet spacecraft, including some Mir's six module. WASHINGTON NASA and Russian Space Agency have agreed set aside last-minute Russian request launch international space station orbit closer Mir, official announced Friday. While putting new station closer Russia's 12-year-old Mir station would make it easier transfer equipment and supply old outpost new one, request came too late be acted on, said Randy Brinkley, NASA's space station program manager. NASA wa surprised last week when Russia's prime station contractor proposed orbital position change just two-and-a-half week launch first part new station. Delaying Nov. 20 flight 10 hour match orbit would have forced similar shift subsequent assembly flight, and resulted potentially unfavorable sun angle solar-powered station, engineer said. We have mutually concluded that it would not be prudent make these change, Brinkley said news conference held Johnson Space Center Houston. It added technical complexity and risk mission that were not justified. The decision, which followed frank and candid discussion two partner, wa not imposed United States, he said. The conclusion were mutual, Brinkley said. Both side concluded that it not make sense. The Russians, struggling find money their space program their nation economic collapse, had said they wanted transfer thousand pound newer equipment and scientific instrument Mir economy move. However, some critic questioned Russians' motif, wondering if requested orbital change wa part plan delay decommissioning and destruction Mir, which Russians have agreed do next summer. The Russians have so little money that United States and other partner international station fear that money spent Mir will prevent Russia meeting it obligation new project. The Mir competes international space station very critical resource and funding, Brinkley said. NASA will consider idea salvaging Mir's research equipment use international space station, he said, only if it doe not interfere assembling new station. The United States and 15 other nation plan begin building new station orbit next week when Russians launch module that will supply power and propulsion early stage five-year construction period. The space shuttle Endeavor is follow Dec. 3 second station part, U.S.-built connecting passageway that attache first module. The first piece international space station wa orbiting Earth Friday, sprouting antenna and unfolding solar power panel it awaited other segment, which will eventually grow largest orbital laboratory history. The module, called Zarya Russian term meaning sunrise or dawn, took flawless ride space atop three-stage Russian Proton booster rocket that lifted 1:40 am. Eastern time Baikonur cosmodrome Kazakhstan. The launching wa witnessed head space agency 16 nation that are sponsoring station, which will cost least $40 billion build next five year. Zarya, built Russia $240 million United States, is be joined two week first American module, docking hub called Unity. The space shuttle Endeavour is take Dec. 3 rendezvous Zarya and attach two unit. This is be followed 43 more flight American and Russian rocket carrying more 100 part be assembled space form 900,000-pound research station housing seven astronaut. Daniel Goldin, administrator NASA, said news conference launching, Now we only have 44 launch go, 1,000 hour space walk and countless problem. But because all partner nation trusting each other and working together, he said, international space station is going be reality. Even new space station is coming together, question continue fate Russia's existing space laboratory, 12-year-old Mir. Because collapse Russian economy, doubt that Russia can produce enough rocket and other equipment support project led Russia promise that it would abandon Mir and destroy station next summer. However, recent week Russian official have been lobbying find way extend Mir's life. According report news agency Reuters, President Boris Yeltsin's space adviser, Yevgeny Shaposhnikov, said Friday he wa preparing number proposal extending Mir's life year 2000. Support such option ha been growing recent week Russian space official, astronaut and nationalist, who see Mir symbol Russian achievement space. James Van Laak, NASA's deputy manager operation space station, said Friday that agency had not received any formal proposal extending Mir's life. NASA would find such proposal unacceptable if it ha any measurable impact international space station, Van Laak said telephone interview Johnson Space Center Houston, No one ha any objection Mir or keeping it operational if Russians find way support project, they have demonstrate they can. Yuri Koptev, head Russian Space Agency, said launching Zarya, 42,000-pound space tugboat that will supply power and propulsion early stage station construction, wa needed vindication troubled Russian space program. The Russian space industry is alive and well and is perfectly able fulfill all it commitment international space station, Koptev said. A Russian Proton booster rocket carried first part international space station orbit Friday, heralding start new era international space colonization. Russian space official and cheered ground control announced that capsule had separated it booster rocket and reached it first orbit 200 kilometer (125 mile) Earth. Success, shouted one exultant official some 10 minute giant rocket blasted and entered orbit. The head space agency 16 nation participating project watched lift-off distance 5 kilometer (3 miles). Strategic Rocket Forces troop who had prepared launch were underground bunker avoid poisoning highly toxic rocket fuel. Russian and US. official said launch wa flawless and module performed well initial test. They cautioned that much work remains be done get ambitious space station project and working. Now we only have 44 launch go, 1,000 hour space walk and countless problem, because trust and mutual respect . international space station is going be reality, NASA chief Daniel Goldin told press conference launch. His Russian counterpart, Yuri Koptev, said launch wa vital vindication troubled Russian space industry, proving it could play major role space operation. Today we made truly epoch-making step carry out this project. The Russian space industry is alive and well and is perfectly able fulfill all it commitment international space station, he said. The launch went smoothly, rocket soaring cloudy sky central Asian steppe. The huge roar rocket reverberated dozen kilometer (miles) empty plain base. The mood launch pad wa tense launch, space official and worker anxiously making last-minute check ensure there were no problem. Solar power panel module were successfully deployed shortly it reached it first orbit and all system were working normally, official said. The launch Russian cargo module, which had been delayed more year, usher new era cooperation former space-race rival. Space official expressed optimism that cooperation would further promote world stability end Cold War. We still have some contradiction, we still have combat missile aimed each other, predominant trend is state cooperation and doing thing together, said Yuri Semyonov Russia's Energia space company. The 12.4-meter (41.2-feet) Zarya, or Sunrise, wa launched three-stage Proton booster rocket. Zarya is designed serve space tugboat early stage project, providing propulsion, power and communication. Engineers finished final preparation early Friday liftoff 24-ton module. The rocket blasted cloudy sky and strong wind, and disappeared cloud 40 second later. The international space station, U.S.-led successor Russia's beleaguered Mir, involves 16 nation and is due be completed 2004. It will consist more 100 element that will take 45 assembly flight complete. Russia's crucial participation ha been hampered country's financial problem. The launch first segment wa postponed repeatedly, mainly because chronically broke Russian space agency couldn't afford complete another part station that is go later. Zarya is fly alone two week rendezvous American space shuttle Endeavor, which is be launched Dec. 3 carrying Unity connecting module. The space station will not be inhabitable least early 2000, launch Russian crew module which is set blast next July or August. The space station is expected cost least dlrs 40 billion, United States planning pay dlrs 24 billion. It will serve orbital home visiting astronaut and cosmonaut least 15 year. Russia ha repeatedly failed meet deadline constructing crew module, putting whole project schedule. Having lost hope getting promised government fund, Russian space agency ha sold research time station NASA dlrs 60 million complete segment. Russia rent Baikonur launching pad Kazakstan. Endeavour and it astronaut closed Sunday capture first piece international space station, Russian-made Zarya control module that had be connected Unity chamber shuttle. Stacking two giant cylinder 240 mile Earth wa considered most difficult part mission. The job fell Nancy Currie, shuttle crane operator who had deftly hoisted and repositioned Unity cargo bay Saturday. The two station piece are so big 77 foot tip one tip other combined mass 70,000 pound that Currie and her crewmates were going have rely computerized vision system and camera view, rather direct line sight. Such blind docking had never been attempted before. Mission Control gave astronaut plenty time task. The main thing I've tried do last two year working this flight is make sure we have time. We have margin everything, said flight director Bob Castle. Before beginning their final approach Zarya Russian Sunrise shuttle's six astronaut had steer clear chunk rocket launched last month California. Mission Control ordered pilot fire shuttle thruster put extra three mile Endeavour and space junk, putting Endeavour total five mile orbiting debris. The smaller gap would have been probably little too close comfort, Mission Control said. The bigger worry, far, wa Endeavour's pursuit and capture Zarya, and it coupling Unity. The shuttle's 50-foot robot arm had never been assigned handle object massive 44,000-pound Zarya, power and propulsion module that wa launched Kazakhstan Nov. 20. It will provide all necessary electricity and steering fledgling space station permanent control module can be launched next summer. The 36-foot, 25,000-pound Unity will serve connecting passageway, or vestibule, future module. In case Zarya and Unity could not be connected robot arm, two spacewalking astronaut would have manually fit them together. The astronaut would be going out anyway Monday attach electrical connector and cable two component. In all, three spacewalks were planned Endeavour's 12-day flight. NASA estimate 43 more launch and 159 more spacewalks will be needed this mission assemble entire orbiting complex. Once completed, 16-nation space station will have mass 1 million pound, be longer football field, and house seven astronaut and cosmonaut. Two astronaut ventured back out another spacewalk Wednesday attach antenna international space station construction nearly 250 mile Earth. For second time this week, Jerry Ross and James Newman floated out hatch shuttle Endeavour work seven-story, 35-ton station taking shape open cargo bay. Their No. 1 priority wa attach two 100-pound antenna Unity, American-made side space station. Their other job, time permitting, wa trickier: trying open stuck antenna Zarya, Russian-built control module. The planned seven-hour spacewalk wa not nearly difficult or crucial Monday night's outing, which Ross and Newman hooked 40 electrical connection Zarya and Unity. The plan called men lug two suitcase-size antenna halfway Unity and install them side 36-foot cylinder. Once activated, antenna will provide direct, virtually uninterrupted communication link Unity and NASA's Mission Control. Otherwise, US. flight controller would have rely sporadic coverage provided Russian ground station. The electronic and computer hookup antenna will be made Unity Thursday, entire crew enters orbiting station first time. Other spacewalking chore Ross and Newman Wednesday evening included erecting sunshade computer mounted Unity. Mission Control decided just spacewalk let Newman take crack unjamming Zarya antenna. Flight controller urged caution. The antenna wa rolled spool, and engineer worried 3-foot strip might pop open enough force hurt him if he got too close. Newman had 10-foot grappling hook job. The antenna is one two that failed open properly Zarya's Nov. 20 launch Kazakstan. One more spacewalk is planned Endeavour's 12-day mission: On Saturday, Ross and Newman will conduct photo survey and take out sack tool that will be used future station visitor. Newman also may try unjam other Zarya antenna. This wa sixth spacewalk Ross his 18-year NASA career, most American, and third Newman. ",NASA and the Russian Space Agency readied the first part of an international space station for launch from Baikonur base.They decided not to change the orbit of the Zarya module as Russia had requested.Zarya's Nov. 20 launch was a success.The Zarya module orbited Earth for 2 weeks before a rendezvous with U.S. shuttle Endeavor to join it to the Unity module.It was tweaked and working well.It will serve as a space tugboat.The first 2 building blocks of the international space station were successfully joined by Endeavor astronauts in the shuttle's open cargo bay.Endeavor astronauts made 2 of 3 planned spacewalks to work on the space station modules.,"Russia launched the first piece of the international space station into orbit a year after the originally scheduled date.The launch follows a last minute Russian request to change the orbit of the space station to put it closer to Mir.This request was set aside.Two weeks later, the U.S. carried the Unity chamber into orbit.U.S. astronauts aboard the Endeavor shuttle then joined the Unity chamber to the Russian Zarya control module.The resulting 7 story structure appeared to be a perfect fit.In a subsequent second space walk, the astronauts were to install antennas on the Unity chamber as well as to attempt to unjam a Russian antenna.","Jerry Ross and James Newman spacewalked to attach antennas to Unity, the American half of the first stage of the 16-nation space station.Unity will be a connecting passageway for other modules.The other portion of the fledgling station, the Russian- built and launched Zarya module, will provide power and propulsion to the facility.The successful launch of Zarya, which had been delayed over a year due to funding woes, was hailed by the Russian Space Agency head as proof that the Russian space industry ""is perfectly able to fulfill all of its commitments on the international space station"".Russia is scheduled to launch the crew module next year.","After a year's delay Russia launched the first unit of the international space station, then pushed it to a higher orbit.Zarya will provide propulsion, power, and comms.US shuttle Endeavour made a blind docking with Zarya.Two spacewalks made electrical connections with Unity, which will serve as a passageway, attached its antennas and attempted to open a stuck Zarya antenna.A Russian cost-cutting proposal to orbit the station closer to Mir jointly vetoed.Russia promised to destroy Mir but now wants to extend its life.Russia sold early research time on the station to NASA to pay construction costs but claims the management lead for 1st 5 years."
48,"Caught middle economic crisis, many Brazilian factory fear they won't be able pay their worker mandatory year-end bonus. So they're paying product instead cash. Some workplace have already offered their employee such thing hammer, nail, screw and bolt instead traditional cash bonus that normally is equivalent one month's wage, said head Brazil's largest federation trade union. The idea is completely unacceptable, said Joao Antonio Felicio, secretary-general federation, which represents more 2,000 union and 19 million worker. We will recommend our union reject such preposterous proposal. But strapped cash and punished high interest rate and declining sale, factory owner may have no other choice, said Joseph Curi, president Sao Paulo State Association Small Industries, which represents 110,000 factory that employ nearly 800,000 worker. Access credit is almost impossible, Curi said. If bank and government don't create some kind emergency credit line, only option many our associate will have will be use product pay bonus. Factories that produce clothes, shoe, food, toy and household appliance were most enthusiastic idea, Curi said. Curi predicted harsher time Brazil belt-tightening austerity package newly re-elected President Fernando Henrique Cardoso is expected announce Tuesday. The measure, aimed curbing country's ballooning budget deficit equal 7 percent gross domestic product are expected include spending cut and, possibly, more tax. There is lot talk increasing tax, which mean le cash circulating market and more credit restriction, Curi said. It is shortsighted approach that will spell more recession and collapse many small factory. Brazil ha been major casualty global economic crisis, buffeted loss investor confidence and strong outflow capital. The country's foreign reserve have fallen dlrs 50 billion, dlrs 70 billion end July. In effort prevent collapse nation's currency, real, and stem capital flight, interest rate were hiked 50 percent year. For union leader Felicio, proposed product-for-cash swap is clear sign despair business sector is feeling because recessive economic policy brought Real Plan, economic stabilization program put together 1994 when Cardoso wa finance minister. The plan succeeded slashing inflation 2,400 percent almost zero today. But it also brought recession and unemployment, which now stand almost 8 percent, highest decade. President Fernando Henrique Cardoso's effort repair largest economy Latin America may depend outcome this weekend's gubernatorial election. Cardoso want impose tough measure that would slash government spending and impose new tax try halt slide Brazil's economy and restore investor confidence. But his plan, expected be unveiled next week, must be approved Congress, and state governor have enormous sway local delegation. The influence governor have their congressional bloc is overwhelming, said University Sao Paulo political scientist Eduardo Kugelmas. Brazil ha been caught financial turmoil that began more year ago Southeast Asia. As wary investor have fled it financial market, Brazil's foreign reserve have fallen dlrs 50 billion dlrs 70 billion end July. On Sunday, voter return poll runoff election 12 state and Federal District Brasilia. The outcome will likely determine how successful Cardoso is getting Congress approve his economic program, which is aimed trimming budget deficit. New income, fuel and bank transaction tax are expected be proposed. Kugelmas said opponent president stand good chance winning four large state Sao Paulo, Minas Gerais, Rio de Janeiro and Rio Grande do Sul. If they win, president will face tough uphill battle, he said. Cardoso need governors' support not only influencing congressional delegation, also holding their spending. The problem is that none candidate Sunday's election . want be identified unpopular austerity measure, said Kugelmas. So they promise spend more money school, hospital and public work project. Sao Paulo, Brazil's industrial and financial powerhouse, is perhaps state most critical success Cardoso's austerity plan. With more 34 million inhabitant, nearly equal entire population neighboring Argentina, it alone account more one-third Brazil's economic output and 70 513 congressional seat. While incumbent governor Mario Covas, Cardoso ally who is seeking re-election, ha committed himself austerity plan, Covas opponent Paulo Maluf is question mark. If Maluf win, he will use his victory launching pad presidency 2003, Kugelmas predicted. And that mean he will try stay far away possible any austerity measure. Brazil and International Monetary Fund moved closer Tuesday agreement expected dlrs 30 billion rescue package world's ninth-largest economy. A joint statement IMF and Brazilian government said two side agreed Brazil should aim reduce it budget deficit expected eight percent gross domestic product zero 2000. The statement wa issued weekend talk IMF official and Brazilian delegation headed Pedro Parente, executive secretary Finance Ministry. Representatives World Bank and Inter-American Development Bank took part talk. Both organization well private bank are expected contribute rescue package. Brazil is latest country be hit financial crisis that began 15 month ago Asia and then spread Russia. Brazil ha lost dlrs 25 billion foreign currency reserve August when Russia defaulted it debt and sparked new crisis confidence emerging market country. If instability continues Brazil it could affect Argentina, it main trading partner, and other Latin American economy. Despite re-election Fernando Henrique Cardoso second term president and announcement Oct. 8 that Brazil and IMF had agreed broad outline financial assistance package, investor continued withdraw large sum money Brazil. Cardoso is preparing emergency program budget cut restore investor confidence and prevent devaluation country's currency. Investors want Cardoso outline plan this week he is expected wait Sunday's second election state governor, whose support he need his budget cut. The joint statement said Brazil-IMF discussion were aimed preparing ground prompt support international community, including IMF, multi-year fiscal program be announced soon Brazilian authority, which will include new policy initiative. The statement reiterated Brazil's goal achieving primary budget surplus 2.6 percent it gross domestic product 1999, 2.8 percent 2000 and 3.0 percent 2001 which would fulfill government target stabilizing ratio net consolidated public sector debt GDP year 2000. The two side are continue their talk objective reaching early agreement, statement said. There's no such thing free lunch any longer Brazil, President Fernando Henrique Cardoso is telling government worker. No haircut or phone call, either. Eager bolster sagging economy, Cardoso want slash dlrs 19 billion (23.5 billion real) budget deficit, and he's beginning paring perk more 2,000 worker presidential palace Brasilia, capital. Sure, it's not much when compared deficit some dlrs 65 billion, or 7 percent economic output. But Cardoso ready package spending cut and tax increase, he clearly want show Brazilians that economy start home. So goodbye afternoon courtesy snack sandwich, fruit and juice, palace tradition. Three barber shop palace were closed, and use cellular phone and copier wa restricted. The price buffet offered employee lunch wa raised dlrs 6 dlrs 8.50 (7 real 10 reals). Cardoso himself ha promised travel le and more cheaply. On trip summit Portugal this month, he took delegation just eight, half usual number. The saving palace could come nearly dlrs 145,000 (170,000 real) month, said Nilson Rebello, chief administrator president's office. Cardoso, pressure repair economy battered world financial turmoil, is expected unveil full scope his deficit-cutting plan next week. It is believed include spate new tax fuel, income, personal fortune and bank transaction. The plan is part deal International Monetary Fund rescue package estimated dlrs 30 billion. The money would strengthen and, hopefully, restore investor confidence world's ninth-largest economy, now center financial crisis buffeting developing nation more year. Brazil already ha agreed annual target sharply reduce it deficit year 2001. On Wednesday, newspaper published joint statement Brazil and IMF, although final agreement hasn't been reached yet. Despite Cardoso's effort, many Brazilians were le impressed palace penny-pinching. The leftist Workers Party said government wa making big deal insignificant saving while it failed cut other dubious project, such dlrs 800,000 (1 million real) moat being built Congress keep protester easily entering building. The Globo TV network also suggested there still wa plenty fat cut, citing government expense running shoe, Persian carpet and gold cufflink, intended present visiting dignitary. Cardoso is counting help friendly state governor control spending. But governor, some facing runoff election Sunday, are promising pay raise and public work project that could sink austerity plan. In Brasilia, Joaquim Roriz ha promised civil service raise, bonus and new job that his opponent estimate would cost some dlrs 1 billion (1.2 billion reals). Roriz hasn't explained where money would come from. In powerful Minas Gerais state, government will almost certainly have lay worker state payroll consumes 78 percent budget. To rein free-spending habit provincial politician, Cardoso reportedly want hold local government bimonthly limit spending. Federal money would automatically be cut if spending get out hand. Latin American leader flew Friday Portugal weekend summit figure out how they can shield their economy global financial crisis. Not early 1980s have so many country been recession, and crisis now threatens cripple Latin America's developing economy. An early arrival, Cuban President Fidel Castro, described turmoil world financial market most important issue facing world moment. I don't know if we are coming end world economic order. It will be interesting know, Cuban leader said hotel press conference shortly his arrival annual Ibero-American summit. Emphasizing scale threat, Castro said President Clinton wa aware that if South America fall crisis, it will be extended inevitably also United States, which is heavily involved investment and loan region. Jittery investor have abruptly pulled cash out Latin America devastating effect stock market and currency reserve. The head state and government Latin America, Spain and Portugal will explore measure ward financial turmoil that already ha devastated Asia and Russia. Stock market also fell Portugal and Spain, heavy investor Latin America. The Latin American leader must gauge need unpopular reform their public finance, including austerity package which risk social unrest and political upheaval. A joint declaration will be signed Sunday this ancient port city Douro River northern Portugal. Diplomats said there wa consensus form final statement. The declaration call international community, and Group Seven country particular, take necessary measure promote stability international financial market, which is necessary condition sustained economic growth, said Luis Augusto Castro Neves, Brazilian Foreign Ministry. Latin America's leader favor creating some kind regulatory system global financial transaction that would place control speculator, measure slow internatioal flow money. They also want reform that allow international financial institution head crisis rather react them rescue package. International institution must be active tackling crisis recent one . and contribute stability, Portuguese Foreign Minister Jaime Gama said. Countries that have progressive policy should not be penalized, they should be given incentive, Gama added reference Latin American nations' effort modernize their economy. Brazil, continent's largest economy and potential bulwark creeping recession, is waiting news dlrs 30 billion bailout package International Monetary Fund. The president World Bank and InterAmerican Development Bank also were expected talk. The move US. Federal Reserve cut interest rate Thursday revived Latin America's financial market, analyst expected reprieve be short-lived because deep concern continent's economic health. The recent economic trouble stemmed part structural weakness Latin American economy. A strike being waged state employee Colombia government austerity package offer glimpse trouble that could arise if tough reform are introduced. Brazil is drafting austerity package that will hit public spending, especially social security. Brazilian official ended four day meeting representative International Monetary Fund Tuesday living their public pledge announce concrete measure reduce government deficit. In Washington, Pedro Parente, executive secretary Brazilian Finance Ministry, offered only detail Brazil's plan raising primary account surplus next three year. With only five day go gubernatorial runoff Sunday, neither he nor President Fernando Henrique Cardoso, Brasilia, said how government planned achieve saving. Important ally Cardoso are lagging three key state, and government promise, market analyst not expect announcement election. Instead, strategy Brasilia and Washington appeared focus reassuring market that work cutting deficit wa going forward, providing fodder opponent domestic election. The discussion continue objective reaching agreement soon detailed program, said joint statement IMF and Brazilian Finance Ministry. Because Brazil's enormous deficit, collapse emerging market ha hit nation particularly hard, draining foreign currency reserve and pushing economy recession. Finance official Washington and world fear that collapse Brazil, because it size and link other economy, would worsen financial instability throughout hemisphere. With 160 million people, Brazil represents world's ninth-largest economy and is financial engine Latin America. Throughout day, government official met Cardoso Brasilia and were expected fine-tune three-year austerity package that Cardoso wa discus congressional party leader Wednesday morning. In Brasilia, official said that measure being considered were tax increase financial transaction, three-tenths percent two-tenths percent, and extending Fiscal Stabilization Fund, which set aside 20 percent all tax collected presidential discretionary spending. The fund wa have expired 1999. Speaking Washington, Parente said that Brazil would aim surplus 2.6 percent 1999, 2.8 percent 2000 and 3 percent 2001. It had already been announced, end IMF's annual meeting Washington two week ago that Brazil would have reach primary account surplus 2.5 percent 3 percent qualify IMF aid. The primary account cover government expense, interest payment debt. Ernest Brown, senior economist Latin America Morgan Stanley Dean Witter, said sign that Brazilian government and IMF were moving closer aid package were reassuring, and that he not expect much more reassurance next week. I call this `We have pope' scenario, Brown said. You're just going hear that we have pope, maybe see white smoke rising, he said, and not figure out who pope is election. The United States is preparing commit US. taxpayer fund part lending program least $30 billion try insulate Brazil, and it rest Latin America, worst effect financial turmoil circling globe, according US. and foreign official assembling program. Details US. contribution, which is expected total several billion dollar direct aid or loan guarantee, have be negotiated. But several congressional leader have been alerted likelihood that administration would have act while Congress is recess. This early warning administration reflects memory how Congress erupted objection and hearing 1995 when President Clinton committed $20 billion US. fund bailout Mexico. But administration official said last week that their early sounding indicate that member Congress are deeply concerned preventing economic collapse Latin America that would resound United States, and thus they expect few objection. The timing aid package Brazil originally expected next few day is complicated unexpected delay that have cropped dealing Brazilian government. The government President Fernando Henrique Cardoso face politically risky gubernatorial election Sunday, which may well determine whether Brazil can execute austerity program that is key condition loan it is concurrently negotiating International Monetary Fund. The biggest role rescue program Brazil will be taken International Monetary Fund, which said last week that it would contribute least $15 billion and appears be pressure United States do more. Another $9 billion or so will come World Bank and Inter-American Development Bank, and remainder United States and other major industrial nation. Germany and Japan, though, have been reluctant take part, one US. official noted, suggesting that Latin America is chiefly Washington's problem, not their own. So far, US. official working scene organize aid package have said nothing public detail plan direct contribution Brazil. Brazil is very important economic well-being region, United States and international community, and all u are very much focused seeing how we can be helpful, Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin said Friday. But wide-ranging interview global economic turmoil, Rubin declined say what strategy he would pursue dealing Brazil's problem and insisted that no decision had been made how United States might contribute. But he discussed Brazil opportunity engage kind preventive financial diplomacy that President Clinton advocated speech IMF and World Bank here three week ago. At time, Clinton argued that monetary fund should provide contingent finance help country ward global financial contagion rather wait disaster strike. Direct US. aid Brazil would clearly send symbolic message: that year trying manage financial crisis monetary fund, United States is now ready put limited amount it capital risk prevent further havoc not only Brazil stop chaos spreading Argentina, Mexico and other country that are major US. trading partner. That would be change strategy. So far, United States ha operated almost entirely international financial institution, chiefly IMF But it would also be risky move President Clinton, economically and politically. Even though Congress objected $20 billion US. fund committed bailout Mexico, it turned out that only $12 billion wa ultimately needed, and it ha been paid back, interest. But Rubin noted Friday that it's very different environment now. Other administration official say they believe that there would be few objection Congress direct US. participation Brazil bailout. I think there are lot more people Congress who are now scared death what's been happening market, and what could happen their district, White House official said last week, and they won't say much long they don't have vote it. By acting soon stabilize Latin America, administration is hoping capitalize two week relative calm late-summer panic that engulfed Russia and, it height, led outflow billion dollar day Brazil, fear that it would be next country forced devalue it currency. Whether this calm mark beginning turnaround or just another pause wildfire that have erupted Thailand's currency crisis July 1997 is matter considerable debate. But many expert cite confluence several event that have reassured jittery investor world: two successive interest-rate cut United States, Japan's long-delayed move prop it banking system $500 billion taxpayer fund, and steady strengthening currency Thailand, Indonesia and South Korea, first sign that investor may be preparing return. Always circumspect when it come commenting publicly market, Rubin acknowledged that last several week there have been number significant, positive development. But former trader, burned 26-year career many false market rally, warned that serious issue remain and that it will take some time world work it way out what he ha repeatedly called most serious international financial disruption last 50 year. In fact, Rubin's aide are clearly nervous possibility another outbreak that could set new panic, which ha made it virtually impossible many emerging-market country borrow money world market. Brazil and Japan are two obvious tinderbox, said Jeffrey Garten, dean Yale School Management, who served undersecretary commerce international affair Clinton's first term. In Brazil, issue is whether package that is coming together will really be big enough deal exploding debt problem. And Japan question is whether there is real reform that go money. But spending 18 month negotiation Japanese, Rubin clearly sens that United States ha little leverage Tokyo; it problem are chiefly rooted political gridlock, not lack resource. In Brazil, though, United States ha better chance buying time and influencing economic reform program, long it doe not appear be dictating term publicly Cardoso and his team. But demonstrating economic support will probably require tapping Exchange Stabilization Fund, created Roosevelt administration help stabilize dollar. The money is Rubin's control, presidential approval, and he reached it circumvent congressional objection aiding Mexico 1995. But reaction wa so strong time Congress restricted tapping fund international bailouts that Rubin ha been extraordinarily cautious ever since. He committed $3 billion second line defense emergency aid program Indonesia and South Korea last year, no money wa ultimately dispersed either country. US. official said that South Korea not need extra help, and that collapse Suharto government Indonesia so changed political scene there that it would be too risky offer direct US. aid. In bailout Russia whose economy collapsed President Boris Yeltsin abandoned agreement reform economy and dismissed leading reformer United States offered no direct help. Those event set panicked exit investor all emerging market, and greatly worsened Brazil's trouble. So far, Brazilian official have successfully calmed market constantly talking forthcoming aid program IMF, convincing speculator that it would be dangerous bet country. But same time, Brazilian official have maintained pose that they do not really need cash and are certainly no hurry get it. US. official and top official IMF are clearly nervous, worried that longer negotiation drag on, greater will be risk Brazil being caught another market turmoil. The Brazilians want everyone think that it's all control, said investment banker involved talk. But fact is that there's still real risk that sometime next 18 month government is going be forced devalue it currency, which is pegged dollar, adjusts 7.5 percent year carefully controlled fall. To prevent sudden devaluation, Brazilian government ha had raise interest rate more 50 percent, choking credit most company. Meanwhile, country is slipping recession. The aid would buy time Brazilians, it is contingent Cardoso's success persuading legislature end huge deficit, chiefly unpopular cut social spending. The first deputy managing director International Monetary Fund, Stanley Fischer, spent Friday Brazil review country's austerity plan, which is expected be announced Sunday's election international package, avoid appearance that global lender is dictating condition Brazil. Brazil ha do lot, Fischer said last week leaving his trip. In return, I expect international community will make large contribution. Leaders 19 Latin American nation, Spain and Portugal put finishing touch Saturday Ibero-American summit declaration warning global recession unless action is taken stabilize international financial system. The draft declaration said recent financial market turmoil show that adjustment must be made quickly keep difficulty affecting few becoming crisis all. The declaration address world's seven richest nation. The Group Seven is composed United States, Japan, Britain, Germany, France, Italy and Canada. The final declaration will be approved Sunday's summit this port city northern Portugal. Brazilian President Fernando Henrique Cardoso said Saturday that Brazil and China, two world's largest economy, had become dike resistance global recession. Protecting their economy spreading economic turmoil, which is affecting more country any time early 1980s, is key world economic stability, he said. Brazil is Latin America's biggest economy and eighth-largest world, and it economic collapse could take rest continent it. To halt Brazil's slide recession, Cardoso is preparing austerity measure including spending cut, tax hike and lower interest rate. The reform would help Brazil qualify International Monetary Fund rescue package estimated dlrs 30 billion. The IMF ha put together bailout package totaling dlrs 137 billion financial crisis struck Thailand 15 month ago and then spread Asia Russia. US. President Bill Clinton's administration, aware impact that Latin American recession would have United States, ha actively pushed IMF and World Bank support Brazil it wa hit investor flight. There's no such thing free lunch any longer Brazil, President Fernando Henrique Cardoso is telling government worker. No haircut or phone call, either. Eager bolster sagging economy, Cardoso want slash dlrs 19 billion budget deficit, and he's beginning paring perk more 2,000 worker presidential palace Brasilia, capital. Sure, it's not much when compared deficit some dlrs 65 billion, or 7 percent economic output. But Cardoso ready package spending cut and tax increase, he clearly want show Brazilians that economy start home. So goodbye afternoon courtesy snack sandwich, fruit and juice, palace tradition.

Cardoso himself ha promised travel le and more cheaply. On trip summit Portugal this month, he took delegation just eight, half usual number. The saving palace could come nearly dlrs 145,000 month, said Nilson Rebello, chief administrator president's office.

To rein free-spending habit provincial politician, Cardoso reportedly want hold local government bimonthly limit spending. Federal money would automatically be cut if spending get out hand. The Commerce Department Tuesday provided concrete measure effect global economic downturn American economy, reporting that nation's trade deficit widened $2.2 billion August $16.77 billion. That is widest gap government recalculated way it measure trade flow 1992. It resulted decline American export and sharp increase what this country buy abroad. So far this year, trade deficit is running roughly 50 percent last year's level and is projected $170 billion year, gap that is expected widen further. One senior administration official who deal economic issue, speaking condition anonymity, said Tuesday that internal projection suggest that trade deficit 1999 could reach $300 billion, figure that he said will certainly cut growth, and could well become major political problem. Trade deficit carry them good and troubling signal economy. The current flood import is helping contain inflation some lowest level decade. And while sale American aircraft, computer chip and other good are suffering, weakening dollar world market recent week may provide end-of-the-year boost American exporter. But this moment global upheaval, biggest problem facing American company is inability many nation and some large company Asia and Latin America simply borrow money make ordinary purchase. The result is such freeze economic activity that empty shipping container are stacking American pier. And effect are hurting everyone Midwest farmer who can no longer send wheat impoverished Russia, East Coast fisherman who are discovering that Japan's appetite salmon and lobster ha been ruined banking crisis. Among most surprising element Tuesday's report is that more third August's deficit wa one country that so far ha managed ward worst effect global troubles: China. Despite continued growth Chinese economy, export China have slowed dramatically and import Chinese-made good have exploded, country desperately seek sell here good that would ordinarily be sold elsewhere Asia. That increased monthly deficit Beijing $5.9 billion, level previously only seen trade Japan. The Chinese besieged flood, deeply troubled state-owned industry and incipient banking crisis have signaled United States recent week that they have little interest any swift move open their market further return entry World Trade Organization. That amount major setback President Clinton, who three year ha been using negotiation China's entry world body centerpiece his effort open China economically and politically. Ostensible progress this area ha been cited administration recently one success administration's China policy, now official say privately that progress is evaporating. The decline export will trim growth American economy, and it wa one factor Federal Reserve's decision lower interest rate two time recent week. So administration official were going out their way Tuesday portray number another warning sign, not crisis. While United States remains strong and sound, troubled condition global marketplace continue strongly influence US. trade balance, Commerce Secretary Williams Daley said statement Tuesday. After China, biggest deterioration American trade balance August came Mexico, where peso ha weakened markedly economic contagion ha spread Latin America. Exports Mexico have remained unchanged. But import Mexico have increased markedly chiefly automobile and automotive part and telecommunication equipment American manufacturer have taken advantage weakening currency. In contrast, America's trade surplus Brazil, latest focus concern administration and International Monetary Fund, barely budged same period year ago. Normally, that would be cited sign continued demand American product Latin America's largest economy, there is fear it might be imperiled. The news come United States and IMF complete bailout package $30 billion or more Brazil, intended help it stave kind economic trouble that have swept Asia, Russia and several other nation. Tuesday IMF and Brazil reached agreement country's fiscal target this year and next, sign that aid will likely be announced election Brazil this weekend. But all these potential problem, rising trade deficit ha barely caused ripple Capitol Hill. Because rising level import doe not appear be triggering any unemployment here, subject ha barely come race House and Senate country. The only exception ha been region where steel industry is strong. The major steel company have charged recent week that Asian nation are dumping product American market price well their cost. The Commerce Department ha begun inquiry. The Commerce Department's number showed that deficit rose 15.3 percent $16.77 billion August, revised figure $14.55 billion July. The department said that resumption production General Motors Corp. last summer's strike may have increased size deficit's rise August, GM brought part abroad.

President Kim Dae-jung, appearing Clinton news conference, pledged that his government would spare no effort supporting US. endeavor resolve nuclear question. He called full access US. inspector North Korean underground facility and said North must constrain it development and export missile. On first two day South Korea, Clinton also held roundtable discussion business leader hear their prescription putting nation's economy back track. Economics and security are Clinton's twin theme five-day Asia trip that began Japan. Clinton acknowledged that US. intelligence official are not certain that suspicious underground construction project North Korea is nuclear related. But he said North risk closing door cooperation if it refuse US. inspection site. It raise strong suspicion, Clinton said joint news conference Kim Blue House, presidential mansion overlooking capital. We need access it. The foundation US. effort ease North Korea's decades-long hostility South is 1994 agreed framework which North halted it nuclear weapon program exchange Western commitment build modern nuclear energy source there. That deal would be shattered if suspect site turned out be clandestine nuclear project. And that, turn, would jeopardize preliminary North-South peace talk that could produce treaty replace shaky armistice that ended Korean War 1953. Kim, who ha moved South Korea sunshine policy engaging North Korea cultural and economic front, firmly said his government support Clinton nuclear issue. We must require full access and way ascertain nature and purpose construction site, Kim said. If it is, fact, proven that it is nuclear related, we should demand immediate close down. He also said North must limit it missile development, citing great shock Japan when North Koreans test-fired missile it way Aug. 31. In dinner toast, Kim said that tension, North Korea is cautiously noticeably taking measure increase interaction and cooperation South and North. And Clinton saluted Seoul's battle Asia's economic woe. I believe Asia will emerge this present crisis more prosperous, more stable, more democratic thanks no small measure Korea's example. After state dinner, Clinton made surprise late-night stop concert Sejong Culture Center where his younger brother, Roger, and his band were performing. The president listened song stage his brother introduced president very special person. The audience 2,000 people stood and applauded. In meeting this week Pyongyang, North Korean capital, US. official were rebuffed their request see suspicious underground site, which American intelligence official fear could be secret effort revive North's nuclear weapon program. US. spy satellite photo show thousand worker digging massive complex. US. special envoy Charles Kartman said Thursday Pyongyang talk that there wa compelling evidence underground nuclear facility. But statement distributed US. Embassy here Saturday, Kartman backtracked, saying instead that United States lack conclusive evidence site is nuclear facility. There is strong information that make u suspicious, we lack conclusive evidence that intended purpose underground site is nuclear related and, if so, what type nuclear facility it might be, Kartman said, offering clarification his earlier remark. Kim said his government would spare no effort supporting US. endeavor resolve nuclear question. The North Koreans have denied underground construction site ha any nuclear purpose, and it ha demanded dlrs 300 million payment proving that. In remark Tokyo Friday, Clinton rejected idea compensation. Directing his remark North Korea, Clinton noted significance new tourism deal that is bringing South Koreans North cruise ship arrangement touted Kim sign North may be opening it 1950s Korean War enemy. To risk that kind cooperation and progress America other issue stonewalling suspected nuclear site is contrary North's long-term interest, he said. Nothing could ever be put that hole ground, given our defense partnership here, nothing could ever be put that hole ground that would give North Koreans much advantage, much power, much wealth, much happiness, more those ship going there full people here, Clinton said. To underscore US. military commitment South Korea, Clinton wa scheduled venture out capital Sunday visit US. Army troop training range north Seoul. He also planned address American troop Osan Air Base U-2 spy plane hangar. North Korea ha demanded that United States pay hundred million dollar right inspect huge underground center that US. intelligence analyst fear house nuclear-weapons program, Clinton administration official said Wednesday. The United States rejected request meeting this week Pyongyang, North Korean capital, North Korean official and US. government delegation. As we expected, North Koreans brought issue compensation, and we flatly rejected it, said State Department Spokesman James Rubin. Asked how much money North Koreans had demanded, Rubin said payment fee wa so not possibility that I don't care get figure. Other administration official said fee would have been hundred million dollars; one put it $300 million. The North Koreans have denied that complex, which is being built mountainside 25 mile northeast Yongbyon, former North Korean nuclear research center, is intended be used nuclear weapon program. They have repeatedly said US. inspector could visit site long Washington agreed pay large fee compensation what North Koreans describe administration's slander. The North Korean representative United Nations, Kim Chang Guk, said last week that United States could inspect site condition that when it is confirmed not be nuclear facility, United States should pay compensation slandering and defaming my country. US. intelligence agency fear that building complex, North Korea may have decided abandon four-year-old agreement United States which North Korea pledged give it nuclear weapon program exchange billion dollar aid. The US. delegation, led Charles Kartman, President Clinton's special envoy North Korean issue, left Pyongyang Wednesday 12 hour negotiation three day team North Korean Foreign Ministry. The talk ended Clinton began trip Asia that will include visit South Korea, where issue North Korean construction site is expected be major topic discussed President Kim Dae-jung. Rubin said US. delegation North Korea had pressed access site. We told them that access site is essential, he said. We've expected that this would be difficult, and we told North Koreans, we've said before, that verbal assurance, they are wont give, are simply unacceptable. US. official have said construction underground site may not have technically violated accord, because there is no evidence that North Korea ha begun pouring cement new reactor or reprocessing plant convert nuclear waste bomb-grade plutonium. But if United States determines that North Korea ha revived it nuclear program, Rubin said, it would go entire letter and spirit objective agreement, and it would affect viability agreement. The administration ha expressed growing concern North Korea's intention several provocative act, including underground construction Yongbyon and test firing last August missile Japan. Last week Clinton named former Defense Secretary William Perry review US. policy North Korea. Administration official say Perry is being asked study way salvage 1994 nuclear agreement North Korea, which had been administration's proudest achievement foreign policy. North Korean news medium Thursday said communist nation's military is full alert war United States if dispute nuclear inspection come blow. The North's official Korean Central News Agency reported that North Korean soldier and people all walk life were full alert war. North Korea typically sends out belligerent rhetoric, especially when it enters high-stake talk Washington. The United States and North Korea are set resume talk Friday inspection underground North Korean site suspected being used produce nuclear weapon. KCNA broadcast brimmed anti-American saber-rattling. Our People's Army will blow US. territory whole if United States start war divided Korean Peninsula, Vice Defense Minister Jong Chang Ryol wa quoted saying Thursday. The general staff North Korean military accused Washington Wednesday pushing situation Korea brink war demanding inspection and talk aimed preventing Pyongyang developing nuclear weapon and long-range missile. Under prevailing touch-and-go situation, Korean People's Army is now bracing itself fight US. imperialist aggressor, KCNA quoted Jong saying. The agency also quoted various party official, plant manager, museum curator pledging thousandfold revenge or vowing arm themselves spirit human bomb and suicidal attack. Washington demand unconditional inspection North's underground project. But North Korea asked Washington pay dlrs 300 million right inspect site. Concerns that North Korea wa developing long-range missile capable striking all Japan and part United States escalated when North Korea fired rocket Aug. 31. Believed be test it Taepo Dong missile, rocket flew Japan and landed Pacific Ocean. The North's 1.1 million-strong military is world's fifth largest. It form backbone North Korean government, leader Kim Jong Il ruling country head military. A congressman who visited remote part North Korea last week said Saturday that food and health situation there wa desperate and deteriorating, and that million North Koreans might have starved death last few year. The congressman, Tony Hall, D-Ohio, who ha had longtime interest world hunger, passed Tokyo his return United States and showed photograph he had taken North Korean child patchy hair, protruding bone, open sore and other sign severe malnutrition. Hall also brought back bag what official called substitute food being distributed government food station: dried leaf and straw, so coarse that cattle would normally turn away. They grind it powder and make it noodle, Hall said. The noodle have no nutrition and are indigestible, leaving people holding their aching stomach, he said. North Korea ha admitted that it is facing serious economic difficulty, there have been sharply diverging assessment how serious these are. Some visitor United Nations and other organization have said that food situation seems be bit better now year or two ago. Hall said that divergence might have arisen because North Korean capital, Pyongyang, life seem be slightly better his three previous trip North Korea. But rural area where foreigner are not allowed visit, he added, overall situation is worse ever. Based visit four hospital, Hall also emphasized that public health care had declined sharply. In one hospital, assistant were holding patient while surgeon conducted stomach operation electric light or anesthesia. Ordinary North Koreans are suffering, part, because their government's hard-line policy have alienated would-be donor and aid agency. The United Nations ha repeatedly appealed relief aid North Korea, latest appeal ha raised le one-third target. In September, Doctors Without Borders announced that it wa pulling it staff 13 North Korea because it feared that it aid wa going politically connected rather most needy. North Korea doe not release mortality figure or health statistic, Hall said that United Nations had gathered and would soon release data indicating that 30 percent North Korean child age 2 are acutely malnourished and that 67 percent all child are physically stunted. Hall said he thought that overall least 1 million people had died and that total wa probably closer 3 million. In indication seriousness which professional demographer view situation, US. Bureau Census recently published estimate suggesting that North Korea's population peaked 1995 21.55 million and ha fallen 21.23 million this year. That would be decline 320,000 three year, period when North Korea's population would have been expected grow 925,000 people, based population growth rate early 1990s. Nicholas Eberstadt, American specialist North Korean population figure, say that there simply is not enough hard information him estimate death toll famine. But he note one political tidbit: North Korea's constitution stipulates that there should be one delegate country's people's assembly every 30,000 citizen. This year's assembly not expand previous one did, rather had just 687 delegate, same previous assembly held 1990. While Eberstadt counsel caution, that could mean that North Korea's population, eight year which it had been expected add several million people, is now back 20.6 million people or fewer. The United States ha been supplying grain North Korea, strain are growing secret underground complex North that some expert worry may be heart new nuclear weapon program. The United States warned last week that agreed framework that is basis it relation North Korea will be jeopardy unless North let American expert visit underground complex and resolve their doubt. North Korea ha said that it will show complex only if Washington promise that if complex is not nuclear one, it will pay vilifying u and impairing our prestige. Washington refuse pay, and North Korea is warning that standoff could lead agreement fall apart. Their shameless and wicked demand is open infringement our sovereignty and wanton interference our internal affair, declared North Korea's leading newspaper, Rodong Sinmun. A South Korean lawmaker said Friday communist North Korea could be producing plutonium and could have more secret underground nuclear facility already feared. Without naming his source, Rep. Kim Deog-ryong Parliament's Foreign Affairs Committee said he had information that two underground facility captured US. spy satellite photo may be nuclear plant. He said Parliament session that one them is believed already be producing plutonium and other would be able produce enough 10 nuclear bomb starting 2004. If true, assertion paint worse picture suspected North Korean nuclear activity already made public. Kim said he asked government's Unification Ministry issue earlier this week and wa suspicious it answer. It wa not sufficient or sincere, so I came suspect that government is trying hide truth, Kim said seven-page press release. US. and South Korean official said August they had detected huge underground construction site mountainside 40 kilometer (25 mile) northeast Yongbyon, country's main nuclear complex. The United States ha said it suspect construction is nuclear-related, though it ha no evidence. North Korea ha denied it. Kim, lawmaker main opposition Grand National Party, said there may actually be two underground facility not far Yongbyon complex. It wa activity Yongbyon that prompted United States negotiate 1994 accord promising development two light-water reactor and fuel-oil shipment if North Korea would halt nuclear weapon development. At time, North Korea wa believed have made enough plutonium one or two atomic bomb. The Yongbyon complex, which house 500-megawatt laboratory nuclear reactor, ha been frozen 1994 accord. Kim said Friday that one new facility is already operating and other is construction and will be operational four six year. We estimate that reactor will go on-line 2002 or 2003, enabling production enough plutonium build one nuclear weapon six 12 month, Kim said. North Korea would be able make sufficient plutonium make eight 10 nuclear weapon every year that. North Korea ha said underground construction is civilian use and not nuclear-related. It ha offered open facility US. inspector, say Washington must pay compensation if facility is been proven be civilian use. President Clinton made unusual, direct appeal North Korea Saturday set aside any nuclear ambition favor strengthening tie South Korea and United States. The appeal came meeting reporter which he also counseled patience Iraq's refusal comply request weapon inspector. I think it's important that we not overreact here first day, Clinton said response report that Iraq had balked request UN. inspector document it weapon program. But, speaking joint appearance South Korean President Kim Dae Jung, Clinton called requested document quite important and said Iraq had some affirmative obligation help weapon inspector. Aides Clinton denied that his comment represented any softening Iraq. They said that because situation wa still developing and president wa preparing meeting Kim he had not been briefed detail Iraq's resistance when he appeared reporter Saturday. National Security Adviser Sandy Berger said administration wa consulting other member UN. Security Council matter. If Iraq fails meet it obligation UN. resolution, he said, We obviously are prepared act. Last weekend, Clinton called strike Iraq minute it wa begin, delayed his departure Asia monitor crisis and said that US. force remained poised strike if Iraq reneged it agreement let UN. weapon inspector do their work. In his appearance Kim, president addressed handful question that ranged North Korea Indonesia whether Congress should punish him Lewinsky scandal. Before leaving Washington this five-day trip Japan, Korea and Guam, he drew parallel government Iraq and North Korea, saying, We must be no le concerned North Korea's weapon activity. The Clinton administration is urgently seeking inspect vast construction site North Korea that it belief may be beginning nuclear weapon plant. Saturday, Clinton called that site, together North Korea's test firing August missile Japan, cause deep concern. But Clinton administration is trying very different approach North Korea Iraq, partly urging Kim, who is pursuing sunshine policy engagement North. As Clinton and Kim delivered prepared statement and answered question Saturday, Clinton became most animated describing what he called very beautiful picture that he happened spot turning his hotel television arriving Seoul Friday night: film cruise ship recently permitted carry South Koreans tour North. I ask North Koreans think this, he said, arguing that Kim's policy engagement North presented them great opportunity. Nothing could ever be put that hole ground that would give North Koreans much advantage, much power, much wealth, much happiness more those ship going there full people here. The Clinton administration fear that construction site may be evidence that North Korea ha abandoned 1994 pledge United States give it nuclear weapon program exchange billion dollar aid. The North Koreans have denied that complex is intended help build nuclear weapon. But they have demanded that United States pay $300 million inspect it, request rejected this week US. delegation Pyongyang, North Korean capital. The new complex is being built mountainside 25 mile northeast Yongbyon, former North Korean nuclear research center. Kim continued Saturday emphasize his hope new opening North Korea. But he said, We will not tolerate any possible attempt North Korea proliferate nuclear weapon, missile and other weapon mass destruction. The Clinton administration plan resume negotiating North Korea inspecting site December. In addition strategy easing Asian financial crisis, Clinton discussed North Korea visit Tokyo Thursday and Friday. The subject North Korea consumed most his two hour meeting Kim here Saturday Blue House, which contains Korean president's office and home. The administration ha been criticized Congress and this region letting it policy North Korea drift, Clinton called that policy clear-eyed mix diplomacy and deterrence. He said that so far 1994 agreement had worked, because it North Korea already would have produced sizable amount weapons-grade plutonium. Under pressure congressional critic, Clinton last week appointed William Perry, his former defense secretary, review his policy North Korea. On other matter, Clinton declined criticize government Indonesia using force crack protester there, saying that he not have enough fact this moment give you right answer. But he said he hoped there would be no backsliding Indonesia. Clinton followed his appearance Kim visit National Folk Museum here, where he conducted hourlong conversation six Korean academic, businessmen and union leader troubled state Korea's economy and it impact society. He attended state dinner Saturday night, stopping concert where his brother, Roger, musician, happened be performing. Clinton repeatedly congratulated Kim his effort economic reform, noting that interest rate had fallen here and currency had stabilized. But he also pressed Kim their private meeting restructure five huge conglomerate, or chaebols, that account some 40 percent Korean economy. In describing leaders' conversation, Berger called restructuring chaebols perhaps most serious remaining problem South Korean economy. Clinton said economic forum Saturday afternoon that he felt impatient South Korea's failure act chaebols. It may be necessary proceed slowly restructuring, he said, they should begin. On Sunday, Clinton plan visit some 37,000 American troop stationed here. In green aviator jacket and black cap, President Clinton spent Sunday visiting American troop stationed South Korea. He promoted private, sang birthday greeting sergeant major and described threat his hope peaceful engagement North Korea. Lately, sign danger have intensified, Clinton said address airman here, standing gunmetal gray F-16 and A-10 parked nose-to-nose. So we must remain vigilant. And thanks you, we are. For all his eagerness talk information-age economic danger quicksilver currency flow, Clinton ha returned again and again his five-day trip Japan and South Korea old-style regional military threat posed North Korea. The subject consumed most his meeting President Kim Dae-jung South Korea Saturday and formed backdrop his visit troop Sunday. It's kind tense here, said John Kelley, 26-year-old airman Wisconsin, describing life this base. You know you're only four minute away missile. In his speech, Clinton pointed recent North Korean missile test, incursion south and mysterious underground site that may be nuclear weapon installation sign potential threat. And he compared North Korea Iraq, saying that North Korea wa also major concern because it chemical and biological weapon. Until North Korea fully commits itself constructive role this peninsula, he said, we must remain ready. Clinton restated his support Kim's policy engagement North Korea, though, saying that there were some hopeful sign justify it. He pointed talk that began summer American military command Korea and North Korean military prevent problem demilitarized zone south and north. Clinton planned leave South Korea early Monday and return Washington Monday night, paying visit Guam. On bright icy afternoon, Clinton wa warmly received here soldier camouflage and black boot, some whom waited almost three hour, shifting foot foot and rubbing their hand. The official crowd estimate wa only 3500, turnout seemed smaller. The base, 30 mile south Seoul, is one two major American airfield Korea, housing 7,500 airman. Others who wanted see president were bused site that are hour away. Before flying here helicopter, Clinton attended church Army base Seoul, then visited firing range just 12 mile demilitarized zone. In brief ceremony there, he promoted Matt Prickett West Liberty, Ohio, private first class specialist. And he led troop Happy Birthday Sgt. Maj. Charles Thomas Wilson, N.C., who turned 45 Sunday. It definitely caught me guard, Thomas said. SEOUL, South Korea (AP) US. President Bill Clinton won South Korea's support Saturday confronting North Korea suspected nuclear site, and he warned North's communist leader not squander chance achieve lasting peace peninsula. President Kim Dae-jung, appearing Clinton news conference, pledged spare no effort supporting US. endeavor resolve nuclear question. He called full access US. inspector North Korean underground facility and said North must not develop missile. On first two day South Korea, Clinton also held roundtable discussion business leader hear their prescription putting nation's economy back track.

US. spy satellite photo show thousand worker digging massive complex. US. special envoy Charles Kartman Friday retracted assessment he made Thursday that there wa compelling evidence that North Korea is building underground nuclear facility. In statement distributed US. embassy here today, Kartman said instead, There is strong information that make u suspicious, we lack conclusive evidence that intended purpose underground site is nuclear related and, if so, what type nuclear facility it might be. Kim said his government would support US. effort resolve nuclear question. The North Koreans have denied underground construction site ha any nuclear purpose, and have proposed dlrs 300 million payment allowing inspection. Clinton rejected idea compensation. Directing his remark North Korea, Clinton noted significance new tourism deal that is bringing South Koreans North cruise ship arrangement touted Kim sign North may be opening it 1950s Korean War enemy. Nothing could ever be put that hole ground, given our defense partnership here, that would give North Koreans much advantage, much power, much wealth, much happiness, more those ship going there full people here, Clinton said. In his meeting Korean community and business leader Seoul's National Folklore Museum, Clinton praised South Korea's progress recovering it financial crisis. On darker note, he mentioned recent tension Asian steel export United States, which have skyrocketed this year great cost domestic US. steelmaker. Japanese steel is biggest problem, South Korean steel export also are rise. Clinton said US. economy could tolerate increased import if they are not concentrated just few industry, and if result is that Asian economy begin recover. We have be sensitive if price doing that is basically erase entire sector US. economy, Clinton said. North Korea ha agreed receive US. delegation next month discus American concern construction vast underground complex that is widely feared house nuclear weapon program, State Department said Wednesday. The delegation, led Charles Kartman, will press access site, which American intelligence agency believe could be centerpiece effort revive frozen nuclear arm program. We've made clear North Koreans that any attempt North Korea pursue nuclear weapon development program would be unacceptable, State Department spokesman, James Rubin, said. The talk Pyongyang, capital, he added, are aimed completely satisfying US. concern suspect construction. American intelligence agency fear that building complex could be effort break out four-year-old pact which North Korea pledged give it nuclear-weapons program exchange billion dollar aid United States, South Korea and Japan. American official have said spy satellite have recently photographed thousand North Koreans huge site 25 mile northeast Yongbyon, nuclear center where North Korea wa believed have stockpiled enough plutonium 1994 accord build six or more bomb. Although they have not explained exactly why government is building complex, North Korean official have denied that it would be used develop nuclear weapon. The official North Korean press agency said last week that government wa building civilian underground structure which any `doubt' cannot be cast and suggested that American official would be allowed inspect complex if they pressed access. If US. side persists inspecting our underground structure, press agency said, we can show it them. Rubin said United States had received no formal assurance that Kartman, American special envoy Korean nuclear issue, and his delegation would be allowed inspect site trip, which is begin Nov. 16. We are beginning discussion them which we will demand access, Rubin said. The history U.S.-North Korea discussion involves lengthy discussion process there is agreement our requirement. So we are not expecting walk one day and be able have access next. The trip wa announced sign grow relative warming relation United States and North Korea. Representatives United States, China and two Koreas met recently Geneva and agreed step reduce tension Korean Peninsula. In September United States pledged provide additional 300,000 ton grain North Korea, which ha year been crippled severe food shortage. In addition White House disclosed that United States would provide more heavy fuel oil promised North Korea 1994 agreement, concern that North Korea may intend revive it nuclear program. American official have said activity Yongbyon may not have technically violated accord, because there is no evidence that North Korea ha begun pouring cement new reactor or reprocessing plant convert nuclear waste bomb-grade plutonium. This city ha always kept unwritten list foreign leader dictator, unfriendly authoritarian and consistently annoying ally who it think can make enormous contribution peace, security or America's agenda taking early retirement, minimum. In 1950s, leftist leader Iran and Guatamala made Top 10, '60s it wa populated Diem and Sukarno and other Southeast Asians. President Richard M. Nixon and his adviser infamously agreed secret meeting '70s that best way deal government Salvador Allende Gossens Chile wa make economy scream. Diplomatic etiquette, though, ha discouraged shouting America's enemy list White House rooftop. After all, foreign policy isn't personality, right? But last week, driven frustration, or anxiety, or perhaps lure sounding tough camera, Clinton administration piped up, twice. In very different situation, corner world, United States spoke loudly because it can't find stick. Sunday, hour he called attack Iraq, Clinton finally volunteered obvious, that focus US. policy Iraq is removal President Saddam Hussein what Clinton called supporting force change Iraq. No matter that covert effort do just that have failed miserably. The bigger surprise came Monday, when polite-to-a-fault Al Gore used his visit Malaysia Asian economic summit meeting throw US. support protester calling reformasi, code word street Kuala Lumpur dumping Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamed. He ha long been burr Washington's side, denouncing America, it currency trader and it Jews. He recently imprisoned his Western-thinking finance minister, Anwar Ibrahim, who ha suddenly become Asia's most visible jailed dissident. But Mahathir is no Saddam, not long shot. Gore's aide insist that his speech wa call reform, not demand that Mahathir step down. But it wasn't interpreted that way. The New Zealanders called it megaphone diplomacy. The Malaysian government called it disgusting and interference internal affair. Predictably, executive several US. company that have flocked Kuala Lumpur told Malaysians that Gore wa rude, while assuring Washington that he had uttered word that needed be said. Whatever wisdom Gore's word, they raised question what it take these day world's most powerful nation begin publicly suggesting that it's time nettlesome leader go. Because there is no official list, there are no real criterion getting it. Some leader mysteriously escape mention, Kim Jong Il North Korea. President Clinton is spending weekend Korean Peninsula, staring demilitarized zone dangerous state that everyone suspect is attempting break out it 1994 agreement freeze it nuclear weapon project, return billion Western energy aid. Yet Washington ha never called starving North Koreans revolt Kim's repressive regime. His government, taking page out Saddam playbook, suggested last week that if United States really want look mountain tunnel that Pentagon belief is nuclear installation making, it should write check another $300 million. No one called Kim's removal when, few month ago, he lobbed three-stage missile Japan just show he knew how. The rule calling end regime are pretty murky, said Richard Feinberg, professor University California San Diego who served Clinton administration's first term. When they really want push someone out, it is because that country is part larger strategic concern time. But country itself doesn't have great strategic weight it's another matter call change leadership Beijing or Moscow and it help if there is some kind domestic opposition that we can point to. Clinton's call Saddam's ouster last weekend created barely ripple because, all, he is proven murderer and avid stockpiler anthrax and plutonium (even if Brent Scowcroft, who wa President George Bush's national security adviser, insisted last week that Saddam nowadays is simply irritant, annoyance, pest and problem, not threat region moment). Mahathir, however, is far more complex case. He's prime example how opposing Washington's political and economic agenda interconnected world can move leader list authoritarian whom Washington tolerates list authoritarian who have outlived their usefulness. Like other Asian strongman Ferdinand Marcos Philippines and Suharto Indonesia come mind he wa useful when fear wa that Malaysia would become communist domino. But he also seemed eminently tolerable long Cold War wa over. He ha never been accused enormous corruption. He turned his country model competitiveness, and Malaysia became exemplar big emerging market that Clinton's Commerce Department touted thing went sour last year. Sure, he wa always prickly. But he is no terrorist or killer US. company have flocked his country, and say they want stay and his iron control political discourse is no stronger neighboring Singapore. Just this summer, US. Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin paid him ostensibly friendly, if strained, visit and made no reference human right. That all changed when Ibrahim wa arrested and beaten jail.

50,"It wa surprising scene three month ago when Dennis Rivera, one New York City's most left-leaning labor leader, wa singing praise Sen. Alfonse M. D'Amato. Rivera, president largest union New York City, praised D'Amato persuading Trent Lott, Senate majority leader, support legislation that financed health coverage hundred thousand uninsured child. It looked if Rivera's politically potent union might endorse D'Amato or very minimum stay neutral this year's US. Senate race New York. But Monday, Rivera's 150,000-member union, 1199, National Health and Human Service Employees union, endorsed Rep. Charles E. Schumer, D-N.Y., and thereby risked D'Amato's wrath. The endorsement is risky, labor leader acknowledge, because angering this powerful senator could make him far le responsive labor's need when union turn him help future if he is re-elected. Although it may seem illogical, two word go far explain why Rivera's union backed Schumer: Monica Lewinsky. Largely result Lewinsky scandal, Democrats say they suddenly fear that Republicans will gain filibuster-proof, 60-seat majority Senate, where Republicans have 55 seat Democrats' 45. For labor leader Rivera, notion strong Republican majority is nightmare. That fear ha helped push other New York union Schumer's column, though D'Amato had long courted them. Those union include teamsters' joint council New York City and District Council 37, umbrella group representing 120,000 municipal employee. Labor leader say they fear that filibuster-proof Republican majority, Senate would push anti-union legislation, recently defeated Republican proposal curb labor's political spending and cut financing National Labor Relations Board. We are worried legislation that will not allow labor movement survive next century, Rivera said. Alarmed that Democrats will lose Senate seat California, Illinois, Wisconsin, Nevada and South Carolina, Rivera's union concluded that it wa worth backing Schumer. The decision, Rivera emphasized repeatedly, wa not personal wa based national consideration. Unfortunately, leadership Republican Party national level person Newt Gingrich and Trent Lott are not necessarily same culture Republicans Northeast, he said. They're far more conservative, far more anti-labor, far more anti-worker, far more pro-business. We fear that Democratic Party face irrelevance United States Senate if we go 41 seat. Trying avoid rupture D'Amato, Rivera praised him effective senator. The endorsement could be boon Schumer. Rivera's union and teachers' union have labor's strongest political operation New York. In addition, Schumer will get thousand dollar local well use it renowned phone bank, which can make 50,000 political call day. A spokesman D'Amato said, Al D'Amato's proud that he's been endorsed 100 union federation and local, representing more that 400,000 working men and woman, and he'll continue his effort behalf working middle class family. His labor endorsement include New York City Patrolmen's Benevolent Association and New York State Building and Construction Trades Council. Besides backing 1199, Schumer also received endorsement 1199's parent union, Service Employees International Union, which ha 350,000 member New York State. Rivera who not support D'Amato last time he ran either announced endorsement founding convention New York State Council service employee union. The convention packed Town Hall, and new group aim make service employee power be reckoned bringing together dozen union local forge common political and legislative strategy. Earlier this year, 1199 merged service employee, and part that agreement, Rivera became head service employee New York State. Nearly 60 year time, House voted Friday condemn Nazi-Soviet nonaggression pact 1939. The measure, nonbinding resolution, wa brought floor Rep. John Shimkus, R-Ill. He is Lithuanian descent, ha pocket Lithuanians his hometown Collinsville and want try highlight his support Baltic states' effort Soviet repression. Shimkus' measure is example how member Congress are spending their time they stand idle and wait Republican leader reach agreement spending bill White House, thus avoiding government shutdown and allowing them go home and campaign November election. With time their hand, many Republicans are using House floor their personal stage elicit vote topic that they can boast folk back home. Most these matter have little chance finding their way law, member hope turn them their advantage Election Day. There are plenty other item whose sponsor hope will not attract attention. These tend be special-interest matter that member hope will escape scrutiny rush leave town. The sponsor these measure now have added advantage impeachment inquiry, which ha been preoccupying Congress, news medium and public and giving them cover move their pet cause quietly gigantic omnibus package that Congress will eventually present Clinton signing. These quieter measure include one proposed Mississippi's two senator, Trent Lott and Thad Cochran, Republicans. They want agriculture export credit buy chicken Russia, which ha bought chicken cannot pay them. The chicken are Mississippi. Democrats have little influence Republican-controlled Congress. But some Democrats are close enough Republican leader, and Republican goal, that their measure are taken seriously. These include Rep. John Murtha, D-Pa., ranking Democrat national security subcommittee Appropriations Committee, who is pushing measure increase military pension. Perhaps best example attempt force vote political advantage is measure that would require minor notify their parent if they are seeking contraceptive federally funded family planning clinic. House leader allowed measure be brought floor way appease more conservative member, who believe they have been shortchanged budget process. It passed House vote 224-200 ha almost no chance becoming law. The Senate doe not plan take it up, and Clinton would almost certainly veto it. But Rep. Tom Coburn, R-Okla., said that vote these were important because they put their sponsors' ideological foe record opposing something that sound reasonable, and that opposition can be used them Nov. 3 election. It wa not voice mail message that Dr. Marilyn Rymer, neurologist Kansas City, Mo., would routinely delete, registered Democrat. Speaker Newt Gingrich's office, it said, wa calling discus national leadership award. Dr. Rymer ha won acclaim director prominent stroke-treatment center, this proposition seemed particularly grand. When she returned call, she said she wa told she would also be named honorary chairman elite committee advise Gingrich legislation. Too good be true? Well, Dr. Rymer would have pay her way if committee should actually meet, and honorary committee chairman, she discovered, she would be member committee composed entirely honorary chairman. And oh, speaker wanted donation $500 $1,000 help our effort, according transcript similar chat another doctor, elect bigger Republican majority House Representatives. With approach midterm election next month, it turn out that National Republican Congressional Committee, which support candidate House, ha been sponsoring similar call ten thousand small-business owner, including doctor. With this and other fund-raising program, committee say it ha amassed $62 million election. But campaign finance watchdog say solicitation mark new departure political fund raising, one they call akin practice marketing company Publishers' Clearing House that hook consumer vision million-dollar windfall induce them subscribe magazine. By citing speaker and promising celebrity and influence, they say, call are bait-and-switch scheme seize attention people who might otherwise hang up. Dr. Rymer say she wa incensed. So wa Dr. Stanley Turecki, child and family psychiatrist New York who vote independent and wa also called. I wa absolutely outraged, he said. Anybody else who would do that would fall category consumer fraud. Kenneth Gross, Washington lawyer who specializes election law and represents Democratic and Republican client, said, I have never heard that particular device. But it doesn't appear illegal, he said, adding, It's fund-raising gimmick get attention. Fred Wertheimer, president Democracy 21, nonprofit, nonpartisan advocate campaign finance reform, said, This is new version caveat emptor buyer be damned instead buyer beware. When business do it, he added, Congress order investigation. But this isn't going be investigated because it's member Congress who are doing it. Todd Harris, spokesman National Republican Congressional Committee, said that he had not heard any complaint and that there wa no intent deceive. The national leadership award is part what we call donor and member fulfillment, Harris said. It's part bringing them process. It's important that they be recognized support they give party. There's no quid pro quo that people solicited could receive award contribution, he added. What most peeve Drs. Rymer and Turecki is message left secretary and answering machine invoking Gingrich's office and proposing award. They say they envisioned senior aide telephone speaker's chamber Capitol Dome. The call, however, are not placed aide Gingrich, any his office or anyone Washington. They are made people headset and computer home InfoCision Management Corp., telemarketing firm and Congressional committee client Akron, Ohio. On it Web page, InfoCision say it 1,400 employee operate 1,584 telephone line and 9 phone center. Every word script is approved our client, company say it Web site. Every conceivable objection is scripted powerful rebuttal. Besides telemarketing business, said Jamie Blair, supervisor center, we specialize helping Republican Party and conservative political group. However far they are Gingrich, telemarketers are instructed answer return call with: Republican Congressional Committee, Newt Gingrich's office. May I help you? A doctor Kansas City, Mo., who is registered Republican and who declined be named, dialed Gingrich number (888-484-1644) left answering machine and secretly recorded ensuing discussion, which is legal Missouri. We were asked contact you behalf speaker, say woman who picked call and identified herself Nancy. He is right now aggressively pushing legislation cut tax much half, and he's also interested legislation cut capital gain single rate 15 percent. To assure passage legislation, speaker want increase his Republican majority, she say, adding, To help u do that, speaker is pulling together group individual such yourself and is inviting you be honorary chairman his advisory council. Nancy continues: There will be correspondence speaker, such conference call. It's great way that he can get your input and thought legislation that doe concern you. Or maybe survey or questionnaire. Later, Nancy says: As member his committee, you would be receiving speaker our national leadership award, which is really quite honor. And be honest, he will be asking each our chairman if they could help our effort increase our majority one-time contribution $500 or $1,000. Now that would be used nationwide medium campaign that Newt ha undertaken target those seat we really need. And someone who I'm sure would also benefit this, could I tell speaker he could count your help? The doctor demur. I am registered, you know, Republican Kansas, she tell Nancy. Probably if I were do something it would be go my representative. Then doctor try ascertain where Nancy is located. Is this congressman Gingrich's office that I'm talking to? doctor asks. The speaker's office, say Nancy. This is speaker's office. That I'm talking to, say doctor, double-checking. Uh-huh, Nancy reply. The law prohibits political fund-raising call federal office. Vice President Al Gore is Justice Department investigation fund-raising call he allegedly made his office 1996 presidential campaign. But call can be made just anywhere else, including campaign office. Harris said call are no way related speaker's OFFICIAL office. He added: What is more important is not where call get routed. People are more interested award speaker's good name it whether call get routed Washington or Ohio. Turecki disagrees. I see it basic sleaze, he said. The last time George Voinovich ran office, he won re-election Ohio's governor 72 percent vote, stunning his most optimistic supporter and setting 20th-century record victory margin Ohio politics. This year, Voinovich, Republican who is barred seeking third term, is running again, this time Senate seat held John Glenn, Democrat who is retiring. And while there are few who expect Voinovich repeat his electoral benchmark four year ago, politician party generally acknowledge that he is well positioned increase Republican majority Senate. That ha not prevented Voinovich's Democratic opponent, Mary Boyle, undertaking vigorous campaign. Ms. Boyle, former commissioner Cuyahoga County, which encompasses Cleveland, is crisscrossing nation's seventh-most populous state what she describes grass-roots campaign that, while operating comparative shoestring, ha nonetheless attracted her side nationally known Democrats President Clinton foremost them campaign trail. Glenn, former astronaut who is preparing return space this month age 77, ha not made endorsement Senate race. Like many candidate this year, Ms. Boyle, 55, is campaigning hard issue education, seeking portray Voinovich, 61, lackluster steward who allowed state's school decline. He promised be education governor, said Ms. Boyle. But seven and half year he ha failed student this state. Her role campaign, she said, is remind people state Ohio that George Voinovich made promise and that he didn't deliver it. Specifically, she discus decision last year Ohio Supreme Court that cited wide disparity quality state's school and ruled unconstitutional formula funding them. She ha also attacked her Republican opponent supporting proposal raise state's sale tax one percent. Under that plan, half additional fund would have been used school improvement remainder earmarked reducing property tax. That statewide ballot initiative last May proved be wildly unpopular, 80 percent voter opposing it. While topic tax and education are hot one this political season Ohio, it is not clear that Ms. Boyle's emphasis them ha helped her campaign. Despite some narrowing opinion poll, she is still trailing Voinovich 15 percentage point some poll and much 20 point others. There is also sharp fund-raising disparity. Ms. Boyle, who is running her first statewide race and ha widespread union support, ha raised nearly $2 million so far, far le nearly $7 million Voinovich ha taken in. Also, Voinovich, former lieutenant governor, ha been statewide ballot five time last 20 year and thus is better-known candidate. The electoral dynamic Ohio are also aiding Voinovich. The northern half state, it history industrial, unionized city, ha tradition voting largely Democratic candidate, while southern tier state is considered more conservative and typically lean Republican. But Voinovich and Ms. Boyle share same home terrain, depriving Ms. Boyle geographic advantage that accompanies Democratic candidate. Indeed, boy, Voinovich once delivered newspaper Boyle home working-class Collinwood section Cleveland. And Voinovich, former mayor Cleveland, ha developed reputation moderate Republican who work well Democrats. Voinovich, while campaigning vigorously himself, is keeping full schedule official duty, assuming role experienced, elected official. If I get Senate, I will probably know more domestic policy any member Senate, he said interview Wednesday Canton, sandwiched ribbon-cutting ceremony and fund-raising reception vacuum cleaner museum. As mayor, I had my nose rubbed problem urban America and wa fairly successful dealing them. And, governor, I have dealt problem Medicaid, welfare and education. I'm only person United States who ha been president National League Cities and chairman National Governors Association. To his opponent's charge his record education, Voinovich is dismissive. I'm probably only Republican United States who ha been endorsed Ohio Education Association and National Education Association, he said, adding that Ms. Boyle wa member state Legislature period cited Supreme Court ruling. Mary Boyle wa vice chairman Ways and Means Committee and member Democratic leadership those year, Voinovich said. They nothing fix building, they nothing technology and urban school district. Ms. Boyle, who ha not begun run campaign commercial television, said her status underdog had allowed me be more focused, more intense. Pausing campaign fund-raising breakfast former Democratic Sen. Bill Bradley New Jersey here Wednesday, Ms. Boyle said: This ha been marathon and it's been pretty much uphill. But now, we're last three mile. It's tough race. In cocoon loyal and wealthy supporter, President Clinton said Friday that he must live consequence his mistake, although he contended that Democrats should take pride achievement his presidency and take heart it possibility. Clinton ha stopped apologizing his conduct Monica Lewinsky, he ha taken making glancing, time humble, reference it, moving attack Republican Congress indifferent Americans' need. He so Friday series fund-raisers. In one deft sentence, he acknowledged his personal pain while claiming credit country's economic strength, making compact appeal sympathy and support appearance earlier day Cleveland. After thanking gathered donor very kind personal thing they had said him, president declared, If I had do it all again, every day, I would do it heartbeat, see America where it is today compared six year ago. As applause died away, Clinton continued, I want you understand, too, that we all have live consequence our mistake life. He added chuckle: Most u don't have live it quite such public way. But nobody get out life free. To music saxophone and hammered dulcimer, Clinton raised $200,000 lunch private home Cleveland Democratic Senate candidate Ohio, Mary Boyle. Then he flew Philadelphia raise half million dollar Democratic Party. By midsummer, president's aide were delighted have persuaded him condense his fund-raising remark just 10 minute policy point and partisan jabbing. But his trouble have grown and mid-term election have approached, his free-form remark have become longer. In Cleveland Friday, he spoke 26 minute and here Friday evening he spoke almost 20 minute. These fund-raising visit have fallen pattern Clinton's videotaped grand jury testimony Aug. 17. He is lauded, applauded and embraced his host and donor. Mr. President, these are your friend here today, said Tony George, host Cleveland event, offering refrain those who have played similar role. But Cleveland elsewhere, protester who were scattered president's motorcade route were reminder call his resignation and impeachment, and mockery some are heaping his presidency. At rally president city hall here Friday night group Teamsters chanted, two more year. Clinton's motorcade route wa lined downtown hundred people, some them carrying supportive or condemnatory sign. After impromptu shopping trip, which he wa greeted shout We love you, Clinton told some donor beginning impassioned reprise his Cleveland speech: I didn't mind protester, that's American way. But, he added, he preferred it when they were minority, and that seemed be case. As he rode Cleveland, Clinton passed billboard local radio station, WNCX. Lovin', touchin', squeezin', it read, word superimposed cartoon president his arm Ms. Lewinsky's shoulder, Washington Monument them. The president left it his aide Friday respond directly latest gusher grand jury disclosure Washington. Instead, his remark, Clinton spoke pride his record and urgency addressing international economic crisis and need struggling farmer and schoolchildren. As he typically doe now such partisan audience, he also walked his political calculation mid-term election. Clinton said Cleveland that Republicans had bragged privately him their prospect. They tell me, `Oh, we're going do very well, Mr. President, these mid-terms because we have so much more money you do,' and because Democrats who turned out re-elect Clinton would not return poll off-year. That argument, course, would also insulate Clinton any blame depressing Democratic vote. But he go further that, saying that his predicament could actually help Democrats. Lower-income Democratic voter, he said, might not bother vote typical election. The people that were good enough serve you here this event today, they've got lot hassle their life, he said. But, he said, adversity is our friend, because it can overcome apathy and focus u what is issue here. What should be issue, Clinton said, are his achievement and agenda and Republicans' record, which he described harshly. What have they done? he asked Cleveland. They killed minimum wage increase 12 million Americans. They killed campaign finance reform. They killed tobacco reform legislation. White House official and gay Democrats, concerned that nation's largest gay and lesbian political organization is endorse Sen. Alfonse D'Amato re-election, are intensely lobbying group try shift it support Democratic challenger, Rep. Charles Schumer. Publicly, official organization, Human Rights Campaign, said they were still deliberating their position closely watched race, considered tightest nation. They said they would probably make endorsement Friday. But privately, organization official and gay activist party who have been monitoring debate say group is most likely endorse D'Amato, Republican seeking his fourth term. They also raised possibility that group would endorse candidate, or remain neutral. If group endorses D'Amato, said official who spoke condition anonymity, endorsement would be based three major factors: The group tends favor incumbent, ha been searching ally Senate Republican majority and considers D'Amato's recent record gay issue be quite strong. An endorsement group, which is held high regard many gay and lesbian voter, could prove important swinging voter D'Amato tight race. It would also be major symbolic victory senator, who ha sought recast himself centrist recent year and could use endorsement build his standing moderate swing voter. A D'Amato endorsement would also weaken Schumer's effort portray incumbent right-wing extremist and would signify many voter fraying traditional Democratic coalition that ha included black and gay voter, woman and labor union. The intensity debate surrounding endorsement underscore importance New York Senate race Democrats nation, who see defeating D'Amato one their best opportunity prevent Republicans gaining 60 seat Senate enough stop Democratic filibuster. The Republicans currently hold 55-to-45 majority. There is sentiment community that if Republicans get 60 vote, that Trent Lott will basically be charge politically next two year, said David Mixner, close friend President Clinton's who is gay. He wa referring Senate majority leader, who ha called homosexuality sin and likened it kleptomania. Saturday, Schumer picked his endorsement New York's largest gay and lesbian political organization, Empire State Pride Agenda. Although Human Rights Campaign is bipartisan, it ha been very close Clinton administration, ha many Democrats it board and receives much it money Democratic contributor. Largely because group's strong Democratic tie, gay Democrats, New York liberal and White House official are infuriated that it is endorsing D'Amato, who also run Right Life and Conservative Party line and receives high rating Christian Coalition, which typically opposes legislation civil right gay people. Although organization ha been thought be inching D'Amato endorsement month, lobbying campaign Schumer ha picked intensity last two week, driven partly growing sense that race is now closer ever. Democrats and advocate party who support right gay people said that Vice President Al Gore, Hillary Rodham Clinton and Secretary Health and Human Services Donna Shalala have made personal appeal Human Rights Campaign official urging them not endorse D'Amato. White House official said they not know whether three had made such appeal, and Human Rights Campaign official declined comment. Schumer met privately group's top official last week make one last pitch endorsement. Clinton administration official have also been buttonholing group's board member every opportunity, cocktail party fund-raisers, raising concern D'Amato endorsement. Some New York advocate civil right gay people have flooded organization phone call, e-mail message and letter. Democratic official have been encouraging group's major donor express their opposition D'Amato. People involved lobbying effort said that best, they are hoping group will endorse candidate, or make no endorsement all. Chuck Schumer ha been strong supporter issue that are important gay community, said senior White House official who spoke condition anonymity. The last thing that they should want do is hurt candidacy someone who ha been so supportive their agenda. The Human Rights Campaign is considered most influential gay and lesbian organization Washington, national membership 250,000 and annual budget more $13 million. The group wa created early 1980s large part counter rise Christian right and Ronald Reagan. Paradoxically, D'Amato wa first elected Reagan landslide 1980 and remained strong supporter President Reagan. For D'Amato, who ha aggressively courted gay voter, endorsement would represent crowning achievement his effort reposition himself moderate. Since 1993, senator ha backed right gay citizen serve military, sponsored legislation prevent job discrimination gay worker and opposed his leadership's attempt block nomination two openly gay men position Clinton administration. To gay supporter D'Amato, endorsement Human Rights Campaign would signify political maturation gay electorate and help organization insulate itself accusation that it is too close Democratic Party. Those who support D'Amato endorsement, including top official Human Rights Campaign, contend that current political climate, where Congress is almost certain remain Republican control November, gay people must build alliance moderate Republicans. Human Rights Campaign official also say their standing policy is support friendly incumbent, when their challenger have better voting record gay issue. That is case New York, where Schumer's rating Human Rights Campaign ha been consistently better D'Amato's. Both men, however, have angered advocate right gay people voting legislation that allows state not recognize gay marriage. In precedent widely cited D'Amato supporter, organization endorsed Sen. John F. Kerry, Democrat, Republican challenger, William Weld, 1996 Massachusetts Senate race, though Weld's record gay right wa considered stronger. The move angered gay Republicans, who now contend that snubbing D'Amato would prove that group is biased Democrats. But there is clearly large number Human Rights Campaign contributor and board member who strongly feel that endorsing D'Amato will permanently damage group, particularly woman. They fear that abortion right supporter will quit group drove because D'Amato ha never wavered his opposition abortion 18 year Congress. Many New York gay activist would also be deeply upset if group endorses D'Amato, whom they blame installing state Senate majority leader, Joseph Bruno, whom they consider be strongly anti-gay. Matt Foreman, executive director Empire State Pride Agenda, cited D'Amato's role architect state Republican Party major reason group endorsed Schumer. While he ha criticized fellow Republicans Washington their intolerance, here home, his party's blatant discrimination is still order day, Foreman said. For that reason, some White House official say they think Human Rights Campaign endorsement D'Amato will be almost meaningless gay voter. They contend that it might hurt senator his conservative base. I don't think anybody will vote Al D'Amato because HRC endorsement, said White House aide who spoke condition anonymity. But I think some people Right Life Party and some upstate people are going say, `Who is this guy and why should we vote him?' White House official and gay Democrats, concerned that nation's largest gay and lesbian political organization is endorse Sen.

But I think some people Right Life Party and some upstate people are going say, `Who is this guy and why should we vote him?' In other election year, Reps. David Price and Julia Carson would have had little common other that they were Democrats relatively safe seat. Price is centrist who ha represented this high-tech district North Carolina all 2 last 12 year, political scientist who ha taught Duke and Yale. Mrs. Carson, fairly liberal, is House freshman who worked her way politics grass root, having been reared poverty. But party official who opened this election year high hope recapturing House are beginning worry that Democratic incumbent Price and Mrs. Carson share something else: greater-than-expected peril Election Day. As many congressional race, biggest variable is White House scandal, which ha injected fear and uncertainty campaign country. Other Democratic incumbent who Republican official cite locked contest that are more competitive expected include Reps. Corrine Brown Florida, Vic Snyder Arkansas, Lois Capps and Ellen Tauscher California, Martin Frost Texas, Melvin Watt North Carolina, John LaFalce New York and Sander Levin Michigan. Here North Carolina's 4th Congressional District, Price, acknowledging that his poll showed him tight race, said: This is swing district that is sensitive any tide or trend. It's something you think lot connection president's trouble. The effort Price and Mrs. Carson contain Lewinsky debacle and their opponents' attempt capitalize it offer important clue suggesting how Clinton's problem are influencing conduct race country. Many Democrats are straddling line that seems shift bit every new scandal-related disclosure: they do not want appear close president whose conduct embarrasses them, and yet, sensing possibility public backlash Republicans, they are weighing their word carefully and are wary hopping any impeachment bandwagon. And while publicly these Democrats express confidence that scandal will have little impact them, their campaign are preparing worst placing greater emphasis ever behind-the-efforts prod their core constituency vote. In reflection uncertainty that Clinton scandal ha cast Republicans, challenger Price and Carson district are political novice seeking office first time have differing strategies: Tom Roberg, computer executive Raleigh who is taking Price, ha broadcast television commercial exploiting scandal. Tom Roberg ha called Bill Clinton's resignation, narrator say. This is not time be silent, Price. Where do you stand? But Indianapolis, Gary Hofmeister, conservative jeweler challenging Mrs. Carson Indiana's 10th Congressional District, is taking more subtle approach: rather mention scandal directly, he note he can that Julia vote Clinton almost 100 percent time. Asked why he wa not much raising scandal directly, Hofmeister said: Don't murder somebody when they're process committing suicide. There would be danger if we went overboard. The best evidence discomfort Price and Mrs. Carson is that when asked separate interview whether they would want Clinton campaign their district, said it would be impossible this late date White House schedule visit. What if there wa sudden schedule change? Both paused, squirmed bit and mustered answer that were hardly affirmative. Given president's popularity, I doubt it will hurt me, Mrs. Carson said. And Price? I don't think that would be such good idea, he said. I've never had president campaign here, and I wouldn't want start this time although he is eagerly welcoming Erskine Bowles, president's chief staff and popular native son North Carolina, stump him here this Sunday.) Making strategy stump is further complicated anecdotal evidence that run counter Democratic fear and Republican hope. In three day campaign stop here North Carolina and Indianapolis, scandal wa rarely raised any voter being courted candidate either party. When reporter asked it, many voter said that appalled they were Clinton's behavior, they had hard time relating it their decision which way vote congressional election five week. As Hofmeister walked parking lot gun and knife show Indiana National Guard Armory Indianapolis last Sunday, Billy Derringer, 57-year-old machinist who is retired disability, called him express outrage million dollar that had been spent investigate Clinton. It's pathetic spend all our money, said Derringer, who identified himself independent. It shouldn't have gotten this far. Hofmeister tried his best make Republicans' case. There ha be rule law, he said. Mrs. Carson said she hoped that Democrats and swing voter alike would become so fed Lewinsky inquiry that issue might help her. To that end, she proudly informs audience that she voted making public report delivered House Kenneth Starr, Whitewater independent counsel. I wa one 63 member Congress who voted putting all that filth Internet, she said, adding that Starr's inquiry had been cruel hoax term fiscal responsibility and accountability. The Carson campaign is counting voter Timothy Daly, 38-year-old real estate executive who voted Republican two year ago now favor Mrs. Carson. I'm pulling Democratic ticket because I'm tired it: right side Republican Party is playing politics, Daly said. We'd see them go people's business. Back here 4th District, Price ha some reason be worried. He wa first elected House 1986 but, four-term incumbent, wa ousted Republican sweep 1994 (only win his seat back two year later). In addition, district wa redrawn last year include large Durham section where voter do not know him well. Determined not be midterm casualty Clinton once again, Price say he is waging most vigorous get-out-the-vote ground campaign his career. Rather engage Roberg Clinton scandal, Price ha begun broadcasting television commercial that emphasizes his central issue: education. The congressman's adviser say they intentionally produced advertisement that appears decidedly nonpolitical it feature school child play effort break television clutter scandal. But Price campaign also ha weapon it is holding reserve, event Roberg appears be riding Clinton scandal advantage: incumbent's adviser say they would not be timid running commercial underscoring that he earned divinity degree getting his doctorate political science. At coffee voter wealthy enclave Raleigh other night, Roberg opened his remark asserting that Clinton had lost moral authority lead. Yet none those assembled asked him scandal; they were more concerned state's plan build highway their neighborhood. The last time George Voinovich ran office, he won re-election Ohio's governor 72 percent vote, stunning his most optimistic supporter and setting 20th-century record victory margin Ohio politics. This year, Voinovich, Republican who is barred seeking third term, is running again, this time Senate seat held John Glenn, Democrat who is retiring. And while there are few who expect Voinovich repeat his electoral benchmark four year ago, politician party generally acknowledge that he is well positioned increase Republican majority Senate. That ha not prevented Voinovich's Democratic opponent, Mary Boyle, undertaking vigorous campaign. Ms. Boyle, former commissioner Cuyahoga County, which encompasses Cleveland, is crisscrossing nation's seventh-most populous state what she describes grass-roots campaign that, while operating comparative shoestring, ha nonetheless attracted her side nationally known Democrats President Clinton foremost them campaign trail. Glenn, former astronaut who is preparing return space this month age 77, ha not made endorsement Senate race. Like many candidate this year, Ms. Boyle, 55, is campaigning hard issue education, seeking portray Voinovich, 61, lackluster steward who allowed state's school decline. He promised be education governor, said Ms. Boyle. But seven and half year he ha failed student this state. Her role campaign, she said, is remind people state Ohio that George Voinovich made promise and that he didn't deliver it. Specifically, she discus decision last year Ohio Supreme Court that cited wide disparity quality state's school and ruled unconstitutional formula funding them. She ha also attacked her Republican opponent supporting proposal raise state's sale tax one percent. Under that plan, half additional fund would have been used school improvement remainder earmarked reducing property tax. That statewide ballot initiative last May proved be wildly unpopular, 80 percent voter opposing it. While topic tax and education are hot one this political season Ohio, it is not clear that Ms. Boyle's emphasis them ha helped her campaign. Despite some narrowing opinion poll, she is still trailing Voinovich 10 percentage point some poll and much 18 point others. There is also sharp fund-raising disparity. Ms. Boyle, who is running her first statewide race and ha widespread union support, ha raised nearly $2 million so far, far le nearly $7 million Voinovich ha taken in. Also, Voinovich, former lieutenant governor, ha been statewide ballot five time last 20 year and thus is better-known candidate. The electoral dynamic Ohio are also aiding Voinovich. The northern half state, it history industrial, unionized city, ha tradition voting largely Democratic candidate, while southern tier state is considered more conservative and typically lean Republican. But Voinovich and Ms. Boyle share same home terrain, depriving Ms. Boyle geographic advantage that accompanies Democratic candidate. Indeed, boy, Voinovich once delivered newspaper Boyle home working-class Collinwood section Cleveland. And Voinovich, former mayor Cleveland, ha developed reputation moderate Republican who work well Democrats. Voinovich, while campaigning vigorously himself, is keeping full schedule official duty, assuming role experienced, elected official. If I get Senate, I will probably know more domestic policy any member Senate, he said interview Wednesday Canton, sandwiched ribbon-cutting ceremony and fund-raising reception vacuum cleaner museum. As mayor, I had my nose rubbed problem urban America and wa fairly successful dealing them. And, governor, I have dealt problem Medicaid, welfare and education. I'm only person United States who ha been president National League Cities and chairman National Governors Association. To his opponent's charge his record education, Voinovich is dismissive. I'm probably only Republican United States who ha been endorsed Ohio Education Association and National Education Association, he said, adding that Ms. Boyle wa member state Legislature period cited Supreme Court ruling. Mary Boyle wa vice chairman Ways and Means Committee and member Democratic leadership those year, Voinovich said. They nothing fix building, they nothing technology and urban school district. Ms. Boyle, who ha not begun run campaign commercial television, said her status underdog had allowed me be more focused, more intense. Pausing campaign fund-raising breakfast former Democratic Sen. Bill Bradley New Jersey here Wednesday, Ms. Boyle said: This ha been marathon and it's been pretty much uphill. But now, we're last three mile. It's tough race. Sen. Alfonse D'Amato, New York Republican who is running re-election, went Manhattan's Grand Central Terminal other morning accept award mass-transit advocate. But reporter who had gathered there showed little interest shiny train car senator's back. Instead, they repeatedly asked him how he would vote impeachment President Clinton. Look, I'm not going make any comment respect that subject matter, D'Amato responded. I am not just citizen. I am citizen-senator who may be called make decision. But D'Amato is something else well: candidate what may be tightest Senate race nation. And variation his elliptical response can be heard Senate race country, where Republicans and Democrats are encountering similar question. All which suggests that House voted Thursday authorize impeachment inquiry, this year's 34 race US. Senate have become, what they already were, electoral equivalent jury selection. If House vote impeach Clinton, matter go Senate, which must decide two-thirds majority whether convict him and, thus, remove him office. As result, Monica Lewinsky matter ha suddenly injected new disruptive force Senate contest. Voters, those who support Clinton, expect their political leader, Republican or Democratic, renounce Clinton's behavior, and candidate have been doing that. But impeachment is another matter; most poll show nation is it. The danger Senate candidate is that impeachment now real possibility, debate may move president's behavior which there is little disagreement more problematic issue whether he should be removed office. For most strategist involved race, there is little guidance how handle impeachment issue. Advisers candidate party said interview last week that they were perplexed and worried, unsure what they can or should do issue gain advantage or guard harm. I can't tell how this one is going go, said Mike Russell, spokesman Republican Senatorial Campaign Committee. This is very surreal environment. Of 34 Senate seat play, 18 are held Democrats and 16 Republicans, who now hold 55 seat all. Republicans would have win 28 34 race produce 67 vote necessary conviction, assuming such vote were go party line. Only electoral catastrophe Democrats, which seems almost unthinkable, could produce such huge loss. Jennifer Duffy, who follows Senate race Cook Political Report, nonpartisan newsletter, said that so far, least, none Senate candidate ha made explicit appeal vote based how they would vote presidential jury. But she and are wondering if this may be change. This is difficult ground measure. One central question this political year ha been how Clinton's dealing Ms. Lewinsky might affect turnout. For long time, politician assumed that dispirited Democrats would stay home rebuke Clinton, just many Republicans November 1974, three month President Richard M. Nixon resigned. But now some analyst wonder if partisan fight Congress last week might have effect some Democrats. That's problem, said Stuart Rothenberg, editor independent political newsletter Washington. It's not that we don't know, and that politician don't know, where general public stand impeachment. The problem is that we don't know where electorate stand impeachment. And asking voter think ahead impeachment proceeding they cast their ballot Senate race is, word Stuart Stevens, Republican consultant, double bank-shot. Such strategy, he said, tend work only small number single-minded or sophisticated voter. Against that complicated backdrop, prevailing thinking is that use impeachment issue will vary race race, state state and week week, depending circumstance candidate and composition electorate. If Democrats try turn image Clinton dock their advantage, it would be state Democratic edge or sizable number black voter, who overwhelmingly support president. In contest those, it might well prove be interest Democratic candidate to, one consultant put it, sit front camera and tape advertisement which candidate denounces president's behavior solemnly pledge vote impeachment. Strategists party believe that kind approach could prove effective. This is issue where there is huge disconnect elite and public, said Fred Yang, Democratic consultant client Wisconsin and Carolinas. That kind Democratic strategy might emerge California, New York, Illinois, Wisconsin, Washington and perhaps Arkansas. By contrast, Democrats South Carolina, Georgia and Nevada would be le likely oppose Clinton's impeachment. On other side, Republican consultant are telling their candidate stress Clinton's misdeed and stay away talk impeachment. The last thing party want is turn Senate election referendum whether Clinton should be forced office. The White House might think overall public number that maybe they would make this referendum election, said Ed Goeas, Republican pollster who is working Senate race this year. Republicans certainly aren't going let that happen. D'Amato responded question Clinton language that Republican consultant have been suggesting their candidate. When and if that matter come Senate, I will decide fact that are presented me that time, D'Amato said. It would be very premature me suggest any course action it being referred. Because, indeed, we may be called act jury some kind. But Schumer, member House Judiciary Committee, which is conducting impeachment investigation, virtually embraced issue. In live telecast hearing, he said president deserved lesser punishment, such censure or reprimand. And Schumer plan campaign New York Monday Clinton his side. Schumer's medium adviser, Hank Morris, seemed suggest last week that impeachment will grow issue. Senator D'Amato claim he doe not want share his opinion people New York, Morris said. And if he doesn't have opinion, he's only New Yorker who doesn't have opinion. Asked if Schumer would raise issue television commercial, Morris responded: We don't talk what we're going do. I wouldn't rule it and I wouldn't rule it out. ","Acknowledging his mistakes, Clinton supports Democrat candidates and speaks at fundraisers.He backs Mary Boyle of Ohio in her bid for U.S. Senate.Democrat candidates try to limit the effect of the Lewinsky debacle on their campaigns.A N.Y. labor union backs Democrat Schumer to keep Republicans from gaining a 60-seat majority.Sen. D'Amato sidesteps queries about Clinton's impeachment on the campaign trail.A gay group may back D'Amato, the prospect of which is upsetting Democrats.House Republicans are using idle time to get votes on issues to help their campaigns.The National Republican Congressional Committee sponsors deceptive fundraising calls.","In addition to the usual factors that prevail in Congressional elections, this year's is complicated by the uncertain effect of the impending impeachment of President Clinton.The president has admitted mistakes, but remains a popular campaigner for House Democrats.In the New York race between D'Amato and Schumer, both are seeking union and gay/lesbian endorsement.Republican Voinovich hopes to take the seat of retiring John Glenn in Ohio.A budget agreement between Republican congressional leaders and the White House is needed soon to avoid a government shutdown.A leadership award from Speaker Gingrich's office is merely a pitch for contributions.","President Clinton's impeachment woes are causing problems for the approaching mid-term elections.The President stopped apologizing, saying he must ""live with the consequences"" of his mistakes, and urging democrats to take pride in his achievements.Democratic candidates hope to contain the Lewinsky debacle while trying to prevent a Republican majority in the Senate.In New York, the Human Rights Campaign may endorse both candidates.In Ohio, Republican Voinovich is in a crucial face-off with Democrat Mary Boyles.Republicans are using a bait-and-switch routine to earn funds from small business.Their House votes are on topics to boast about back home.","In tight congressional and Senate races leading up to the Nov. 1998 elections, strategists and candidates were unsure how to deal with the Clinton/Lewinsky scandal.Though the President pointed to his record while stumping, many Democrats, embarrassed by his behavior, distanced themselves from him.With impeachment a possibility, the Senate races assumed even greater importance.While it was unlikely the Republicans would win enough Senate seats to remove the President, Democrats feared their opponents could gain a filibuster-proof, 60-seat majority.The NY senate race between Republican D'Amato and Schumer was one of the tightest in the nation."

Yugoslavia must cooperate UN. war crime tribunal investigating alleged atrocity war Croatia and Bosnia, international legal expert meeting Belgrade said Sunday. The meeting wa first international debate Yugoslavia UN. tribunal's work and government's cooperation it. The tribunal, established UN. Security Council 1993, sits The Hague, Netherlands. Despite objection tribunal, Yugoslav authority allowed two-day discussion organized Belgrade-based, non-governmental Humanitarian Law Center take place any problem. State-run medium largely ignored event. Though there were some disagreement, participant discussion generally agreed that crime humanity cannot go unpunished. The indicted who are not The Hague are at-large because refusal Croatian and Yugoslav authority arrest and extradite them, said Mark Ellis, lawyer and representative American Bar Association. Present-day Yugoslavia, consisting Serbia and Montenegro, cooperates tribunal case where Serbs were victim Bosnia and Croatia, two former republic that fought war their secession. But Yugoslavia ha questioned tribunal's jurisdiction and refuse indict three army officer wanted alleged war crime Croatia. Last week, it also refused allow UN. investigator probe alleged atrocity Serbia's southern Kosovo province where ethnic Albanian separatist are fighting government force. The tribunal wa founded satanize Serbs, said Miodrag Mitic, former legal adviser Yugoslavia's foreign ministry. He said UN. court wa influenced powerful country that dominate international body. On Saturday, David Scheffer, US. State Department's ambassador at-large war crime, demanded Yugoslavia's full cooperation. Some closest combat half year Kosovo conflict, point fighting room room and floor floor, occurred this village six week ago, day 21 woman, child and elderly member Delijaj clan were massacred Serbian force, their mutilated body left strewn forest floor. Piecing together what happened, surviving family member, ethnic Albanian separatist force and official Serbian information, story emerges fierce guerrilla resistance onslaught Serbian tank, artillery and infantry. The Serbian force fighting here appear have suffered unusually heavy loss and, guerrilla finally fled, took revenge civilian, shooting woman and child close range they tried run away their pursuer. According relative who found body, Pajazit Delijaj, 65, wa decapitated, his brain left display ground. Hava Delijaj, 65, wa shot and one her foot cut knife so that it hung thread skin. Young woman and child who had run few hundred yard rocky path were mowed down. Miraculously, 6-week-old baby, Diturie, wa found her father alive clasp her dead mother, Lumnije, 30, more 24 hour killing. Blood wa her mouth and her mother's hand baby, said Imer Delijaj, father, avowed member Kosovo Liberation Army, ethnic Albanian guerrilla force, who returned uniform discover body. I moved her hand and that moment she opened her eye. I realized she wa alive. I tried clean blood her mouth and she put her tongue out. Several member Delijaj clan survived. Zejnije Delijaj, 39, who had cooked guerrilla family compound when they returned fighting day massacre, recalled how she fled, crawling, falling, running and hiding wood Serbs shot her. I could feel dirt hitting me impact bullet, she said interview, her nose still bloodied what she said wa heavy fall her flight. First it wa machine gun, then grenade, then cannon, she said. Every time I moved and they heard leaf rustling, they shot. The massacre Delijajs, whose forebear settled Drenica Valley 150 year ago, wa not first conflict that ravaged Serbian province March and October and ha now lulled uneasy truce. Indeed, conflict Serbian force bent keeping Kosovo Serbia and guerrilla fighting independence it heavily ethnic Albanian population first drew international attention massacre Jasari clan early March Serbian unit Prekaz, central Kosovo. But killing Delijajs, ranging paralyzed patriarch, Fazli, 94, who wa burned his bed, slaughter Valmir, 18 month, who wa found shot, is most thoroughly documented so far. Human Rights Watch, New York-based group, belief knowledge gathered so far increase possibility prosecution UN. war crime tribunal The Hague, Netherlands. The Hague's prosecutor could also draw observation diplomat, human right monitor and reporter who saw body scattered ravine where victim were killed they were buried shallow graf clan's nearby compound. In other Kosovo massacre, body had been moved site they were seen independent observer. Further, family member who survived assault have described what they saw and circumstance hill and valley Obrinje Serbs pushed forward early Saturday morning, Sept. 26, their headquarters Likovac, north here. By then, Albanian guerrilla had fled area Delijaj compound, dispersing what senior commander Kosovo Liberation Army, Naim Maloku, termed particularly fierce combat Serbs. In day Sept. 26, he said, guerrilla caught Serbian pincer movement had decided fight rather surrender. The fighting sometimes house house, room room took unusually heavy toll Serbs, said Maloku, former officer Yugoslav army. He said he believed that it wa those death Serbs avenged massacre Delijajs. In other major attack conflict, guerrilla generally found escape hatch. In Obrinje, led another former officer Yugoslav army whom Maloku declined name, guerrilla fought, using land mine and rocket-propelled grenade. Maloku said he knew report made rebel headquarters that least 47 Serbian soldier and police officer were killed fighting here and Bajince, three mile east. We took weapon 47 Serbs, he said. The state-controlled Serbian medium center Kosovo's capital, Pristina, said 10 Serbian police officer were killed fighting, including five reservist who died when their vehicle hit antitank mine Sept. 25. The announcement 10 Serbs killed one action is unusually high. The practice taking violent revenge is time-honored tradition Balkans. From 1991 1995, war Croatia and Bosnia, Serbs, Croats and, far lesser extent, main victim, Muslims, avenged World War II massacre and new blood feud, driven killing leader who exploited old conflict carve new fief themselves old, Communist Yugoslavia collapsed. In this case, it appears, Serbian vengeance wa visited Delijajs. Survivors clan said they had feared assault their collection mud and brick home lining rocky dirt track directly village Likovac, Serbs' base just mile away. The Serbs had pushed rebel out Likovac August and guerrilla had established new headquarters Bajince, six mile east Obrinje. As Serbs swept nearby Cicavica Mountains, and road that run Pristina Klina, it wa clear that Obrinje would be target. Most woman and child area had moved Apple Valley, where more 10,000 refugee had gathered outdoors, seeking safety number. But Imer Delijaj, 38, said he decided that ravine his family compound would be better hiding place. He said he believed woman, child and elderly would be spared if Serbs found them. As Serbs approached foot Saturday morning massacre, last person flee compound itself wa Bashkim Delijaj, 21, youngest son 94-year-old Fazli. Bashkim Delijaj said he had stayed look his bedridden father. The shelling started again 7 am. Saturday and I saw tank convoy approaching, infantry tank, Bashkim Delijaj recalled interview. I wa smoking cigarette when grenade fell roof and hole gate I saw soldier coming 30 meter away. They were brown army uniform, had huge knife or small ax. Many had beard. Bashkim Delijaj said he wa unable carry his father safety, and not have courage tell him what wa happening. I told him I wa getting animal out barn, he said. He said he ran, hid, ran some more, and eventually received shelter farmer, all time hearing shooting and shelling. When firing had died Monday morning, he returned compound and ran Imer, still wearing his guerrilla uniform. They went one house and found Imer Delijaj's brother, Adem, 33, shot dead, his body sprawled ground rain, and burned torso Fazli. I looked window our house and saw only bone my father, which looked what we learned biology class, he said. Together, two men went find out what had happened ravine. There they found body. First, Ali, 65, who, Imer Delijaj said, had been cut neck his tobacco cutting knife. Then Pajazit, who had been decapitated makeshift tent, his brain placed two foam mattress. Then Hava, 65, who wa sprawled tent. They moved find Jeton, Imer's 10-year-old son, and Imer's mother, Hamide, 60, not far away. Imer's sister-in-law, Luljeta, who wa seven month pregnant, had been mutilated, he said. A little further ravine, Imer said he saw his wife, Lumnije, 30. He opened his wife's coat and found his 6-week-old baby girl, now 3 month old and recovering relative's home Likovac. He said he tried clean baby and then put her his jacket and walked few foot further find body his 4-year-old daughter, Menduhije, and two other young child, Donieta, 5, and Gentiana, 7. The corps other family member were found wood and two older men, Habib, 51, and Hysen, 53, were found next morning, Imer said. On Oct. 3, body two missing teen-age girl, Mehane, 16, and Antigua, 13, were found bush side road abandoned Serbian police compound. Later month, body Hajriz wa found pushed well, close ravine. One uncle, Sharif, who wa ravine, is still missing, presumed dead. Human Rights Watch, which ha been documenting Delijaj massacre, ha described it most vicious pattern attack civilian Serbs Kosovo conflict. (To lesser extent, Albanian guerrilla also attacked Serbian civilian, forcing them their home, and allegedly carried out least two massacres.) The evidence strongly indicates that Gornje Obrinje killing were followed conscious mutilation carried out victim were killed, coming report Human Rights Watch say. Delijaj family member have told Human Rights Watch monitor and that they saw ethnic Albanian police officer accompanying Serbian police officer fighting. They believe that police officer, who is posted nearby Glogovac police station, wa used Serbian special police officer guide Obrinje area. This police officer, who is apparently one small group ethnic Albanians officer who have remained loyal Serbs, could be important witness criminal investigator war-crimes tribunal The Hague, according human right expert. The ethnic Albanian policeman could be important witness identifying police and army unit responsible atrocity, said Peter Boueckhart, researcher Human Rights Watch. It is vital that those who carried out these atrocity are prosecuted Hague tribunal. At burned Delijaj compound last week, Imer Delijaj ha been acting host wake which, Albanian tradition, will last several week and began family member returned their hiding place wood. Color photograph youngest member family, and Imer's mother and grandmother, have been mounted glass table gate. A 30-year-old faded black and white picture Fazli double-breasted suit stand apart, sign ultimate respect. An outsized Albanian flag black double-headed eagle red field is draped table.

Hamas is, 2nd graf pvs On street newly littered debris battle stone, spent tear gas canister, charred remnant half-burned tire sodden Palestinian flag flap fitful rain-laden wind house mourning. Inside, tinny recorded wail Koranic verse, neighbor and relative dead man 21-year-old university student felled roof his home Israeli soldier's rubber-coated bullet sipped tiny cup coffee left unsweetened symbolize bitter occasion. Some smoked, few spoke quietly themselves, most simply sat reflective silence. Among those attendance this day, first traditional three day family mourning, wa Saeb Erekat, chief peace negotiator Yasser Arafat's Palestinian Authority. The dead youth, Nasr Erekat, wa cousin his. Erekat stayed time, sitting clan elder Arab headdress and teen-age nephew American-style athletic shoe, then slipped away meeting connection President Clinton's visit beginning this weekend. It's been very difficult, he said later, asked carrying his negotiating duty such time. I have great sense sorrow and sadness, feeling such loss. I hope God will enable me use my grief strengthen my determination peace. The scene Erekat home, Arab village Abu Dis Jerusalem's eastern outskirt, drive home central truth Israeli-Palestinian conflict: side divide, political is also deeply personal. And that inescapability go heart quarrel's intractability. In glare world attention, it is easy forget that there are fewer people living Israel and Palestinian land combined there are New York City. In small and jostling confines what few here choose call Holy Land, conflict touch all. Everyone ha stake it. Israelis fret daily soldier son dangerous patrol West Bank and Gaza Strip, or shudder when they pas sidewalk cafe once ripped Islamic militant's suicide bomb. Palestinian family struggle keep alive memory father and brother languishing Israeli prison, and chafe checkpoint and gunsight Israeli troop. On side, youngest soak fear and anger their ABCs. And elders' memory half century still rise trouble collective sleep: shadow Holocaust Israelis, trauma exile and dispossession Palestinians. Against this backdrop, landscape little changed biblical time, terrible Old Testament theme lamentation and retribution, smiting enemy and sharpening sword spring life once again any day's headline. Now come Clinton, this most American president, one who ha made Middle East peacemaking kind personal crusade, hope halting what ha become one century's most protracted blood feud.

On occasion this visit first intended celebrate Wye River accord signed seven week ago Washington, now meant salvage them all three principal are embattled. Clinton is impeachment cloud; Arafat is buffeted furious Palestinian street protest and his failing health, and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's coalition government is hanging thread. The day leading Clinton's visit have been divisive one, contriving somehow simultaneously tap sides' greatest fear. In West Bank's worst spasm violence month, Israelis watched window Israeli-plated car shatter stone thrown angry youth, saw TV footage cringing Israeli soldier now facing court martial being beaten bloody Palestinian mob, heard Palestinian officials' exhortation new intefadeh, or uprising. Palestinians, their part, listened anger Netanyahu announced suspension upcoming Israeli troop pullback West Bank and tried vainly halt Israeli bulldozer expanding Jewish settlement land they claim their own. Both side Palestinians' satisfaction, and Israel's dismay came see visit implicit acknowledgement Palestinian statehood aspiration, increasingly desperate American effort avoid casting it that light. Clinton's foray Gaza Strip, which is already Palestinian rule, will be first sitting American president. Palestinians intend play that symbolism all it is worth, greeting him strain their once-banned national anthem. In mourning house Abu Dis, though, friend and relative Nasr Erekat had little say politics and statehood. They talked Nasr instead. Amr Erekat, 27, recalled his disbelief he cradled his dying cousin his arm. His 14-year-old brother Taher spoke haltingly big brother he had looked to. His childhood friend, Samir Abdel Salam, remembered wishing he had stuck his study diligently Nasr had. Saeb Erekat, peace negotiator, could find neither lesson nor logic his young cousin's death.

President Bill Clinton's arrival, Israel also rejected US. compromise release Palestinian prisoner, issue that ha sparked riot West Bank. The Palestinians have said they would revoke clause only acclamation, not vote, when Palestine National Council meet Monday Clinton's presence. With it demand, Israel may be setting itself showdown Clinton whose visit Israel and Palestinian is ushering next stage Wye River land-for-security agreement he helped negotiate. Under accord, annulment offending provision PNC is clear way Israeli troop pullback. Clinton is unlikely declare PNC ha not completed it task because that would mean his high-profile visit ha been failure. However, Israeli official said they would not drop their demand vote. They have vote PNC, said Israeli government spokesman Moshe Fogel. Otherwise, he said, Israel will not turn additional West Bank territory Palestinians because transfer territory is irreversible. In Washington, deputy US. State Department spokesman James Foley wa evasive whether United States expected vote PNC. The procedure need be clear enough that nullification ha taken place, he said. A senior Palestinian official, speaking condition anonymity, said United States ha not asked Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat consider holding vote.

The 95 member present were asked whether they approved letter which Arafat informed Clinton that charter clause calling Israel's destruction were null and void. In all, 81 voted favor, seven and seven abstained. Asked decision, Arafat would only say that it wa very important and constructive meeting. The Palestinian leader also said he hoped Clinton would exert pressure Israel keep it obligation Wye agreement. The Palestine Liberation Organization charter wa drawn three decade ago, long Israel and Palestinians started their peace process 1993. The Palestinians say they took all required step revoke pertinent clause PNC session Gaza 1996. However, Netanyahu ha said PNC never completed job. During Wye River talk, Palestinians agreed compromise invite PNC member and delegate other group Gaza hear Clinton and Arafat speak. The Wye accord say delegate should reaffirm Arafat letter Clinton, doe not specifically refer vote. Former Israeli Prime Minister Shimon Peres sided Palestinians Friday. They it once, they it twice, they don't have do it again, said Peres, who wa prime minister PNC vote 1996. Israel and Palestinians have also accused each other violating other element Wye agreement. A key point contention ha been Israel's pledge release 750 Palestinian prisoner three stage end January. The Palestinians have said Israel broke promise release prisoner held anti-Israeli activity. Israel said it never made such pledge, and accused Palestinian Authority incitement prisoner issue. Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erekat said United States offered compromise, trilateral committee go list prisoner one one and determine who will be released. But Israeli Cabinet Secretary Danny Naveh said Friday such proposal wa unacceptable. Israel ha not been offered such compromise and there will not be such compromise, Naveh said.

President Bill Clinton is arrive visit meant bolster new Israeli-Palestinian peace accord, two side exchanged angry accusation Sunday Jewish settlement and street clash. Ahmed Qureia, speaker Palestinian parliament, warned possible violence if Israel continues expand settlement West Bank and Gaza Strip, where Palestinians hope establish state. If settlement activity continues, then all mean resistance are open, Qureia, who is also known Abu Ala, told reporter West Bank town Ramallah. Since signing land-for-security accord, Jewish settler have accelerated establishment makeshift community West Bank hilltop, explicit bid keep land being turned Palestinians. Meanwhile, meeting Israeli Cabinet, minister expressed dismay outbreak street clash Palestinian demonstrator and Israeli troop West Bank. The Palestinians have been asked immediately stop violence and incitement violence, Cabinet said statement. At least two Palestinians were injured Sunday confrontation Jewish settlement Ariel northern West Bank. Demonstrators threw stone Israeli troop, who responded rubber bullet and tear gas. A day earlier, 27 Palestinians and three Israeli soldier were injured similar clash throughout West Bank. And three day that, Israelis were horrified television footage Israeli soldier being dragged car and beaten chunk concrete Palestinian mob. Israel say Yasser Arafat's Palestinian Authority is orchestrating street fighting. The Palestinians deny that. The week's protest grew out increasingly bitter dispute Palestinian prisoner held Israel. Israel last month freed 250 750 prisoner it is release Wye accord, most were criminal. The Palestinians are demanding that so-called security prisoner those being held anti-Israel activity be released instead. Also Sunday, another quarrel wa brewing scheduled meeting Palestinian National Council, Palestinian parliament-in-exile, Gaza Strip Clinton's visit. At gathering, PNC and other Palestinians attendance are reaffirm nullification clause their national charter that call Israel's destruction. Israel ha demanded that Palestinians hold actual vote meeting rather simply proclaiming charter changed, Palestinians Sunday repeated their objection that. They haven't right give u instruction, Arafat said Sunday he returned Gaza trip Europe. Clinton's visit Israel and Palestinian land, which is begin Saturday, is meant provide impetus U.S.-brokered peace accord and encourage side stick timetable compliance. But some commentator suggested visit wa proving polarizing force instead. He is coming promote peace process. his visit's only actual result is sharpening difference, Yosef Lapid wrote Sunday's edition Maariv newspaper. In Israel, increasing concern is being voiced Clinton's planned visit Gaza, first ever sitting US. president. At Sunday's Israeli Cabinet meeting, shouting match broke out issue, according Israel radio. Who invited President Clinton Gaza Strip? Silvan Shalom, science minister, reportedly yelled Netanyahu. Netanyahu said it had been Clinton's idea, not his. The United States ha repeatedly said visit is not intended endorsement Palestinian statehood, Palestinians see it powerful boost their sovereignty hope. Arafat adviser Ahmed Tibi said Israeli television that invitation Clinton visit came Israel and wa warmly welcomed Palestinians. Benjamin Netanyahu's refusal move peace process forward, which ha frustrated President Bill Clinton and angered Palestinians, may not be enough his government collapse next week. Netanyahu Wednesday briefed his Cabinet Clinton's three-day visit and affirmed what he told president day earlier that he would not withdraw troop West Bank Friday, stipulated Wye River peace accord. Clinton had hoped, 3rd graf pvs President Clinton will travel Gaza next month address Palestinian leader, White House said Friday. He is speak what Palestinians are describing historic meeting formally revoke anti-Israel clause 1964 Palestinian charter. Israel demanded revocation clause U.S.-brokered negotiation last month that led latest land-for-peace deal Israel and Palestinians. As part that settlement, reached Wye, Md., Clinton agreed travel territory controlled Palestinian Authority speak meeting Palestinian National Council, de facto parliament. According schedule released Friday White House, Clinton will visit Gaza, West Bank and Israel four-day trip that will begin Dec. 12. He is meet Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu Israel and Yasser Arafat, Palestinian leader, returning Washington Dec. 15. Clinton administration official said White House had not decided whether Clinton would fly newly opened Gaza International Airport Air Force One, given symbolism president's jet landing Palestinian soil trapping state visit. Officials said White House wa fearful upsetting Israeli leader who are worried that president's planned visit Gaza appears be step American recognition Palestinian state. The White House said president would speak Israeli and Palestinian people importance Wye agreement and need continue support Middle East peace process. The meeting Gaza Dec. 14 is bound be contentious, given that many prominent Palestinians have charged that Wye agreement allows Israeli government backtrack promise made Palestinians their 1994 peace settlement. The Palestinians have insisted that they have already revoked clause 1964 charter that called Israel's destruction. In January, Arafat wrote White House, listing anti-Israel provision that he said had been annulled. But letter not satisfy Israelis. And talk Maryland last month, Arafat agreed call meeting national council reaffirm decision revoke clause. In order guarantee passage motion annul provision, Arafat is being allowed agreement Israelis and United States pack council meeting Gaza his loyalist, and conduct vote show hand instead ballot. During recent interview Israeli television, Clinton brushed aside concern that his visit Gaza might be seen step US. recognition Palestinian state. That is not what I'm doing going there, he said. I have tried strictly adhere position United States that we would not take position any final status issue. He said he wa traveling Gaza recommendation of, others, Netanyahu. The prime minister wanted me go there and wanted u all make this pitch, he said, adding that he would ask Palestinian National Council support peace and renounce idea animosity and opposition existence state Israel, and instead embrace path not only peace cooperation. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu Sunday accused Yasser Arafat making farce Wye River accord and said he would not agree further troop withdrawal halt anti-Israel violence. Netanyahu, interview The Associated Press, said Palestinians were emboldened foment street riot and threaten declare statehood because they believed they had Clinton administration their back pocket. The Palestinians are making farce out Wye River accord. They think they have United States their back pocket, said Israeli leader. As long that is case, they will not change their behavior. Netanyahu said he not believe United States wa siding Palestinians, his sharply worded remark sent strong signal that he would President Bill Clinton intervene and lower Palestinian expectation prior his Dec. 12-15 trip. Palestinians claim it is Israel that ha violated summit agreement reached October not freeing jailed political activist, confiscating West Bank land road and allowing Jewish settler seize hilltop expansion. Ahmed Qureia, speaker Palestinian Legislative Council and head peace team that negotiated Oslo accord, told reporter Sunday all mean resistance wa justified opposing settler activity. Netanyahu, who rejected claim settlement expansion bunk, wa interviewed Cabinet room meeting his unruly coalition government, which rallied Netanyahu his tough stance. But official said Science Minister Silvan Shalom attacked him being too generous Palestinians agreeing Clinton visit next week Gaza and West Bank. We are not going give territory when there are violation agreement and attempt get thing that weren't achieved Wye using violence, Netanyahu said. Israel ha threatened scrap next Israeli troop pullback, which is scheduled Dec. 18, three day Clinton's departure. The United States ha said it should go ahead scheduled. Palestinians see Clinton trip implicit recognition their struggle statehood, though Clinton ha specifically said interview aired Israel's Channel 2 television that it should not be read that way. Netanyahu made clear that he would be annoyed if Air Force One landed newly opened Palestinian airport Gaza, which aide said would be viewed strong symbol support Palestinian demand sovereignty. We will be very disappointed if that is case. We've said United States that we don't think that is necessary, Netanyahu said report that Clinton's plane would land Gaza. He said traveling motorcade would be quicker and more politically considerate. Unless somebody want put thumb our eye, I think there are better way travel, Netanyahu said. In interview, Netanyahu stressed that he opposed Palestinian statehood and demanded that Arafat stop threatening declare independence May 4, 1999, when Palestinians maintain Oslo accord expire. What must be is that Yasser Arafat retracts this open and incipient violation Oslo and Wye River accord and recommits himself negotiating we get white smoke, we get solution. That's only way we'll get real peace Israel and Palestinians, Netanyahu said. In conciliatory speech Sweden weekend, Arafat stressed that he sought negotiated settlement and not mention May 4 deadline. He also said any Palestinian state would not make alliance state hostile Israel one Netanyahu's key concern. The Israeli leader is also demanding that Arafat drop claim that Netanyahu promised Wye release 750 Palestinians jailed anti-Israel attack that resulted bloodshed, rather freeing car thief and petty criminal. Each side ha different interpretation understanding prisoner. Netanyahu maintains he never agreed free those blood their hand. It's high time that Yasser Arafat admits this wa agreed and that he's not going make demand Israel, including incitement violence,...on trumped-up charge, he said. Israel never promised release murder Wye, and it won't release them. The issue ha been focal point new wave violent protest and demonstration West Bank and hunger strike that began Saturday 1,700 Palestinian inmate. Israel is also upset statement that nearly 600-member Palestinian National Council will not reaffirm vote that anti-Israel clause Palestinian charter have been deleted. Netanyahu maintained that only 25 member out hundred who live abroad had been invited so far. Netanyahu quoted Clinton telling him that purpose his visit wa personally make sure that they actually rescind this charter that call Israel's destruction. Keeping promise Israel and United States, Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat Thursday convened senior official and legislator revoke clause PLO founding charter calling Israel's destruction. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, meanwhile, said he ha ordered Israeli army deal Palestinian riot firm hand. He added that he would not go ahead West Bank troop pullback, promised Wye River peace agreement, unless Arafat met list demand. The West Bank ha been swept stone-throwing protest recent day, and thousand Palestinians marched Thursday funeral procession 17-year-old stone mason, Jihad Iyad, who wa killed Israeli army gunfire day earlier. The violence raised concern that US. President Bill Clinton's visit region, which is start late Saturday, is fomenting more unrest rather calming already tense situation. Israeli hard-liners, including Cabinet minister, have said Clinton's visit is conferring statehood status Palestinian area. On Thursday, sign reading Clinton go home were strung Tel Aviv-Jerusalem highway and wall Jerusalem. The most problematic moment Clinton visit will be his address Monday Palestine National Council, Palestinians' parliament-in-exile, and other Palestinian group, Gaza City. Under Wye agreement, PNC is reaffirm this session Arafat letter Clinton which declares clause PLO founding charter calling Israel's destruction revoked. Israel insists vote be taken show hand, while Palestinians say only approval acclamation is required. Netanyahu said Thursday he will not settle anything le vote, if Clinton declares PNC session success it. It is Israel which determines issue connected it future, Netanyahu said when asked Israel radio whether he would be ready enter showdown Clinton issue. It is unlikely US. president would side Israel such dispute because it would mean that main purpose his visit, usher next stage Wye agreement, had failed.

Netanyahu, who is facing political turmoil his hard-line coalition government, said he could not accept phony peace paper which is not honored practice. Since Clinton presided it signing Washington October, land-for-security agreement ha hit one snag another.

55,"Premier Romano Prodi battled Tuesday any vote freed split far-left party, said he will resign if he loses confidence vote expected later this week. We must respect will voter. If we win confidence vote, we will go ahead, otherwise we will pas baton, Prodi told news conference closing two-day French-Italian summit Florence. Prodi's center-left government, Italy's second-longest World War II, wa threatened collapse defection it Communist ally. The premier will address Parliament Wednesday, followed perhaps Friday vote confidence that will determine whether 2 1/2-year-old, center-left alliance stand or fall. The Communist Refoundation Party provoked crisis withdrawing it support weekend and saying it would not vote his deficit-cutting 1999 budget. But break Prodi's government divided Refoundation. Armando Cossutta, leader moderate wing, resigned party president Monday, saying party's hardline stance wa wrong and dangerous. Prodi wa hoping profit break. Politicians have said Prodi is now four vote short 316 vote needed majority Chamber Deputies, lower house. The government ha majority Senate Refoundation's support. After his meeting French leader, Prodi warned that political difficulty threaten progress country is making cleaning it public finance. Prodi's government ha held together this long large part because widely shared desire see Italy qualify 1999 debut Europe's common currency, euro. It qualified earlier this year leaving disparate ally so clear reason stay together. As it is, Prodi ha outlasted all Bettino Craxi, who served 3{ year two back-to-back stint 1983 1987. Prodi's is Italy's 55th government World War II. Three day collapse Premier Romano Prodi's center-left government, Italy's president began calling political leader Monday try reach consensus new government. Following talk, which are expected last several day, President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro could ask Prodi try again new majority. He could also name new premier, or appoint government technocrat. If Scalfaro feel no candidate is capable mustering majority, he could call early election. Because president cannot dissolve Parliament last six week his term, election would have be scheduled December. Scalfaro ha named Prodi caretaker premier interim. Prodi's far-left ally, Communist Refoundation, provoked crisis when it withdrew support government 1999 deficit-cutting budget, which it said not do enough stimulate job creation. Despite help breakaway faction Communists, who Sunday formed new party, Prodi lost Friday's vote confidence single vote. Prodi ha said he won't take job back unless his new government could stick policy it old one, unlikely scenario given divided Parliament. An alternative Prodi could be Massimo D'Alema, leader Democrats Left, largest party Prodi's coalition. In case so-called technical government, name Treasury Minister Carlo Azeglio Ciampi and Foreign Minister Lamberto Dini have been circulated. A government technician would get Italy volatile period approving 1999 budget and launch common European currency, euro, January 1999. Prodi presided cost cut that got Italy debut European Monetary Union, outlasting all one other post-World War II Italian government process. By one vote, Premier Romano Prodi's center-left coalition lost confidence vote Chamber Deputies Friday, and he went presidential palace resign. President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro must now decide whether call early election or ask Prodi or someone else try forge new majority. The vote lower chamber Parliament 313 confidence motion brought government 312 favor. I'm not bitter, Prodi said immediately his government went down. The swing vote came Prodi's coalition, defecting deputy Foreign Minister Lamberto Dini's tiny Italian Renewal party. The Communist, 6th graf prv By one vote, defector it rank, Premier Romano Prodi's center-left coalition, Italy's second-longest serving government World War II, lost confidence vote Friday Chamber Deputies. Prodi immediately offered his resignation President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro, who asked him stay caretaker premier while head state decides whether call early election or ask someone else be premier. The vote, 3rd graf prv Italy's Communists Sunday voted withdraw support Premier Romano Prodi's 2 1-2-year-old coalition, move expected trigger collapse one country's longest-lived postwar government. Prodi had said he would call confidence vote if Communists yanked support. The coalition ha majority Communists Senate, ha depended them passage key legislation Chamber. MORE Italian politics have long been enlivened baroque feud and shifting alliance. And that time-honored tradition may have won embattled government Prime Minister Romano Prodi momentary reprieve. A leader Italy's hard-line Marxist faction, known Communist Refounding Party, resigned Monday protest his party's decision reject government's 1999 budget and imperil Prodi's slender majority Parliament. Prodi must realize that his majority no longer exists, said Armando Cossuta, chairman Communist Refounding Party, fringe group that broke mainstream Communists they overhauled party collapse Soviet Union 1991. Nevertheless we should do everything possible, last minute, this government and avoid this crisis. Cossuta wa clearly unwilling join most hard-line wing his party withdrawing support Prodi and risk being branded having torpedoed first leftist Italian government 50 year. But leader Communist Refounding Party Parliament, Fausto Bertinotti, seems have no such compunction. On Friday, he told journalist that he wa not worried forcing new election that could return right power. Sometimes you have take one step back order take two step forward, he said shrug. Until now, however, communist rank and file have disagreed that view. When Bertinotti forced Prodi offer his resignation last year proposed budget cut, rank and file protested, and he wa forced backpedal. Prodi met Monday President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro and coalition leader devise strategy. He is expected go Parliament Wednesday open debate crisis and seek enough vote budget. Without it, Italian central bank is unlikely cut it key lending rate, something Italy must do get line Germany and other bigger European neighbor introduction Jan. 1 single European currency, euro. But if he gather enough vote pas budget, Prodi could still be left majority. After two and half year office, his government is second-longest postwar era. But fragile center-left coalition ha held together mostly because Italians were united last two year effort reduce spending, inflation and government borrowing meet requirement membership euro plan. Once that goal wa achieved last spring, dissension quickly revived. Prodi's backer are hoping that enough member Communist Refounding Party will break rank and follow Cossutta coalition. If not, Prodi is faced two unappetizing choice. He can resign and seek new election, which carry risk bringing opposition power. Or he could seek form new majority Communists seeking alliance small center-right party Francesco Cossiga. Cossiga's party came Prodi's rescue June, when hard-line leftist refused back Prodi NATO expansion. But Prodi ha repeatedly said he will govern only center-left majority that elected him 1996. Cossiga also suggested reporter Monday that he would not welcome any invitation join coalition led Prodi. We wouldn't want this majority get stained Monica Lewinsky's dress, he said. By only one vote, center-left prime minister Italy, Romano Prodi, lost confidence vote Parliament Friday and wa toppled power. The collapse his government two and half year, second-longest tenure World War II, suggested that chronic political instability that marked Italy decade had sprung back life. Though obliged tender his resignation, Prodi will remain charge caretaker prime minister new government is formed. He may get second chance form new majority, if he doe, negotiation that end could take day and week, clouding decision such urgent issue crisis Kosovo. NATO military planner preparing possible air strike Yugoslavia had expected use key air base Italy. In his weakened position, Prodi will have difficulty persuading Parliament approve NATO strike. He will have similar problem passing 1999 budget, which is necessary Italy can cut it lending rate, requirement joining single European monetary unit, euro, Jan. 1. Immediately Friday's vote 313-312, tense and time raucous session, Prodi met President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro submit his resignation and discus his option. In coming day Scalfaro will consult dozen other leader ascertain whether Prodi ha enough lingering support try form new government. If not, president is expected turn another political leader. If no compromise is found, Italy could be plunged early election. But party all political stripe may be reluctant push thing that far, opinion poll suggest that voter are no more enamored center-right opposition party they are governing majority. Prodi, economist, is admired his Western ally down-to-earth leader who vowed tame Italy's bloated economy and reckless government borrowing and actually lived his pledge. By raising tax, lowering interest rate and reducing deficit, Italy met requirement membership euro last spring, feat that only year wa considered impossible German and French economist. Prodi wa helped healthy global economy and rare consensus industrialist, labor union and taxpayer, who feared that exclusion euro would condemn Italy Third World status. But his fiscal discipline wa not followed reform political system that is inherently fragile. There are more 40 party Italy, and government's effort amend constitution introduce two-party system failed. Unless Italian political system change, Italy is condemned political instability, said Sergio Romano, former diplomat and political science professor. The country need stability and credibility, and that will never happen long government is hanging thread. In 1996 Prodi won patchwork quilt center-left faction mostly made Catholic moderate and leftist. He relied fringe Marxist group, Communist Refounding Party, majority lower house. And that alliance, fragile beginning, finally frayed breaking point this week. The hard-line leader Communist Refounding, Fausto Bertinotti, said his party would vote 1999 budget and would also end it 28-month-old pact center-left coalition. That position drove moderate wing Communist Refounding, worried that vote Prodi would open door center-right government, split away. But 20-odd deputy who defied Bertinotti were not enough squeeze Prodi through. I am not bitter, Prodi said moment his defeat. Even today I received lot support. In end coup de grace wa delivered one his own, member coalition. They have won treachery one single person, Sergio Mattarella, deputy Prodi's coalition, angrily told reporter, referring Silvio Liotta, member Italian Renewal Party. Foreign Minister Lamberto Dini, who head that party, said Liotta would be expelled. Prodi ha said he would not govern any other majority center-left one that elected him 1996. But throughout his tenure, he wa forced seek temporary alliance push major policy decision. He struggled last try keep his original majority intact. On Thursday, effort woo more moderate Communists his side, prime minister, staunch ally United States, warned that he would oppose NATO strike aimed stopping Serbian violence Kosovo unless UN. Security Council approved attack. Washington maintains that NATO doe not need new UN. resolution order strike. Premier Romano Prodi said Monday he would appeal directly Parliament Italy's second-longest government World War II, threatened collapse defection it Communist ally. The address Parliament wa expected Wednesday, followed perhaps Friday vote confidence that will determine whether Prodi's 2 1/2-year-old, center-left alliance stand or fall. Prodi's far-left ally, Communist Refoundation Party, provoked crisis withdrawing it support weekend and saying it would not vote his deficit-cutting 1999 budget, which is key Italy's participation European common currency. Prodi ha said he would call confidence vote if he lost Communists' support. I've always acted coherence, Prodi said morning meeting President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro crisis. I've never changed strategy and I don't want do political gymnastics. The break Prodi's government divided Refoundation. Armando Cossutta, leader moderate wing, resigned party president Monday. He said party's desertion Prodi wa wrong and dangerous, same time promised follow party line. We are very complicated political crisis which could lead early election, Cossutta told reporter Monday. And division left, this would mean victory right. If crisis come confidence vote and Prodi loses, he would offer his resignation. Once he doe that, it is Scalfaro decide what do. He could ask Prodi or someone else form new government or he could call election 2 1/2 year early, something most analyst think unlikely. Working Prodi's favor is fact that few party think they would stand gain early election, including Communist Refoundation. There wa speculation Prodi would reopen negotiation that would win back communists' grudging support, he ha managed do past. Prodi's government ha held together this long large part because widely shared desire see Italy qualify participation 1999 debut Europe's common currency, euro. That happened earlier this year leaving disparate ally so clear reason stay together. Prodi lead Italy's 55th government World War II. He ha outlasted all Bettino Craxi, who served 3{ year two back-to-back stint 1983 1987. Refoundation is not part Prodi's center-left coalition, government need it 34 vote muster majority lower house. It ha been difficult ally outset. It broke Prodi NATO expansion earlier this year and sending troop Albania last year. Prodi wa forced resign year ago bitter battle spending cut linked euro. The crisis wa resolved, and Prodi returned work, he made steep concession and promised 35-hour work week. By one vote, Premier Romano Prodi's center-left coalition lost confidence vote Chamber Deputies Friday, and he went presidential palace resign. President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro must now decide whether call early election or ask Prodi or someone else try forge new majority. The vote lower chamber Parliament 313 confidence motion brought government 312 favor. I'm not bitter, Prodi said immediately his government went down. The swing vote came Prodi's coalition, defecting deputy Foreign Minister Lamberto Dini's tiny Italian Renewal party. The Communist, 6th graf prv It is autumn Italy, bird are going south, and so it seems could Italian government, bond compromise and political opportunism that bind small leftist party government came undone Sunday. The latest threat government Prime Minister Romano Prodi came delegate two-day conference Communist Refounding Party voted reject government's proposed 1999 budget, imperiling future center-left coalition. Officials prime minister's office said Sunday night that Prodi would meet Monday President Oskar Luigi Scalfaro discus political turbulence, though not offer his resignation. If Communist Refounding's parliamentary deputy abide resolution, which passed vote 188-112, it will destabilize Italy's government time when outcome recent election Germany ha already injected note uncertainty future European economic and fiscal policy. Mauro Zani, spokesman Democratic Party Left, main party Prodi's coalition, called decision Communist Refounding misfortune entire country. Passage budget, he said, is essential avoid disaster. Prodi's coalition is loose alliance former Communists, known Democratic Party Left, and Prodi's moderate Catholic-oriented follower. It is supported Communist Refounding, fringe group hard-line leftist who broke mainstream Communists they overhauled party collapse Communism Eastern Europe. Despite frequent shock, alliance ha held 1996, glued together mainly desire meet fiscal requirement allow Italy adopt single European currency. As Jan. 1 date approach introduction new money, euro, Italy must cut it key lending rate bring them line those bigger European neighbor, Germany. A rate cut Italian central bank is generally thought hinge passage budget bill. If bill is not passed, negative signal would be sent global financial market that are already upset because financial crisis Asia, Russia and Latin America. On Sunday, Prodi's backer were still hoping that sufficient number Communist Refounding deputy would break rank and back budget when it come vote Parliament later this week. If that fails, centrist group that rescued Prodi June similar circumstance and that is led former President Francesco Cossiga announced it would support budget, thus least assuring parliamentary passage. Communist Refounding and it mercurial leader, Fausto Bertinotti, have pushed Prodi brink twice before. The party forced him offer his resignation last year proposed budget cut, then backpeddled party's rank and file protested. In June, hard-line leftist again refused follow prime minister, that time Parliament vote NATO expansion, government muddled help Cossiga's party. But one leader that centrist group, Clemente Mastella, said Sunday that it would not support government generally, leaving future Prodi's coalition highly uncertain.

1001,"The institution exploring apartheid's horror will issue report that find African National Congress share blame human right violation it struggled overcome white rule. The 3,500-page report Truth and Reconciliation Commission culminates more two year nationwide hearing. South African medium released preliminary finding Monday, three day it official release Thursday Pretoria, capital. The release document is milestone South Africa's transformation white minority rule democracy. The commission, which ha power grant amnesty, wa tasked promoting reconciliation laying bare what and why apartheid-era atrocity. With ANC now power and facing election mid-1999, condemnation commission could prove damaging it electoral chance and moral standing. There ha been no doubt that report's overwhelming blame would be laid white government and their security force year scrutiny, 1960-1994. Indeed, news report Monday said Truth Commission would declare apartheid crime humanity and acknowledge that ANC and more radical Pan Africanist Congress were conducting legitimate struggle former apartheid state. But preliminary finding sent party last month, commission also said two movement were morally and politically accountable gross right violation, South African Press Association and South African Broadcasting Corp. said. The preliminary finding said that ANC policy killing civilian, line military and civilian target had been blurred, SAPA said. It condemned planting landmines rural area, execution enemy agent, torture and mistreatment ANC member it exile camp and killing political opponent. It said party must accept responsibility activity ANC Women's League president Winnie Madikizela-Mandela, Nelson Mandela's former wife, and her Mandela United Football Club, accused killing, torture and kidnapping. The commission also said PAC wa guilty death civilian it strategy 1993 drive white farmer their land so it could be reclaimed black. Justice Minister Dullah Omar, meeting journalist Pretoria, would not comment news report condemnation ANC. I do expect various response (to report). I do not expect everyone agree. It will lead healthy debate, he said. He said that if commissioner recommends prosecution anyone abuse, it will be national director prosecution decide whether proceed. The director is appointed government. The commission's work is designed help u establish rule law South Africa, and establish principle accountability, Omar said. The ANC already ha prepared ground negative finding, saying week ago that commission had warned that harsh judgment were offing. The ANC wa nervous enough report request meeting commissioner earlier this month. The panel refused, avoid appearing biased. On Monday, it rejected contempt suggestion ANC official themselves had leaked finding. Constand Viljoen, leader tiny right-wing Freedom Front, said ANC had done so give commission credibility making it more even-handed. Publicly, party ha long defended it action those committed just war. FW. de Klerk, last apartheid-era president, meanwhile, planned ask court prevent Truth Commission report implicating him covering state-sponsored terror. Obviously we will comply ruling court, Omar said, added he would regret any court-ordered delay. Facing court challenge, Truth and Reconciliation Commission said Wednesday that it would withhold, least temporarily, part it final report that implicate South Africa's last apartheid-era president, FW. de Klerk, illegal act. De Klerk, 62, who helped negotiate end South Africa's white supremacist government and shared 1993 Nobel Peace Prize President Nelson Mandela that work, had objected finding commission that he wa accessory fact bombing headquarters church group and labor federation 1980s. The chairman 17-member panel, Archbishop Desmond Tutu, said that although he took such action great reluctance, commission needed time prepare fight legal challenge. He said it would take de Klerk's name out 3,500-page report avoid delaying it release Thursday. It upset me deeply, he said statement. We have been scrupulously fair de Klerk, and we reject contention that we have been engaged vendetta him. De Klerk's challenge wa only part storm criticism prompted leak report last few day. Within hour commission decision withdraw it finding de Klerk, it wa facing possibility new suit this time ruling African National Congress.

While commission's report is expected lay overwhelming blame former white government atrocity, it ha also found ANC responsible human-rights violation, including torture and killing spying suspect, bombing civilian area and killing political enemy, including member rival Zulu-based Inkhata Freedom Party. The decision de Klerk seems certain damage commission's credibility. The panel, created way putting South Africa's brutal rest expense and political divisiveness trial, ha caused controversy start. It ha held more 160 hearing throughout country, listening victim and perpetrator seeking amnesty. But many white say commission is witch hunt aiming humiliate former government official and Afrikaners general. De Klerk ha once forced commission official court and won apology them calling him liar. Some political analyst said Wednesday's event would only further belief that panel lack impartiality. The withdrawal finding can't help be seen lack certainty their side, said Sampie Terreblanche, economist and political analyst University Stellenbosch, who ha supported commission.

The ANC and million people who were part this struggle will always be proud what they insure that, process destruction vile system, they not themselves resort vile method struggle basis that mean justified end. There are probably few subject that get South Africans more excited issue Truth Commission and whether it is worthy cause or waste money. The event last few day have only added debate. For some, Pal Martins, 34, former member ANC's armed wing, fact all side political spectrum are uproar is good thing. The mere fact that everyone is complaining mean that Truth Commission ha done it work, he said. But say that too many question are being raised panel's competence. The whole affair is pale, mockery justice, said Roboy Vonholdt, 56-year-old sheep and ostrich farmer who belief that commission ha been theatrical act. We should all turn our back and move forward. We need them and they need u. Let's all make money and let good economic condition prevail. The commission's report is supposed be broad and detailed summary South Africa's human right history, 1960 1994, when election open all race ended white minority rule. It will parcel out moral condemnation and recommend individual prosecution. While de Klerk wa alone court Wednesday challenging commission, Tutu said Wednesday that other threatened legal challenge had led fewer individual being named right violator originally planned. Tutu said that more 400 people had been notified that they would be implicated give them chance respond. Some 15 successfully argued themselves out report or could not be reached and were therefore deleted report, he said. The commission is required law give advance notification anyone it intends implicate it report. The commission had been expected say that although de Klerk not order bombing, he subsequently came know that former Law and Order Minister Adriaan Vlok and Police Commissioner Johan van der Merwe had been involved, failed report his knowledge police. This could open him criminal prosecution. De Klerk ha not applied amnesty this matter or any other. de Klerk ha said that when he learned bombing, Vlok and Van der Merwe were already process applying amnesty, and he not think it wa necessary report matter. A panel investigating apartheid-era atrocity said Wednesday it will not implicate last apartheid president, FW. de Klerk, human right abuse he threatened court challenge. De Klerk said he would sue block long-awaited final report Truth and Reconciliation Commission, which wa due release Thursday. The man who helped negotiate end apartheid objected finding commission that he wa accessory fact bombing 1980s headquarters church group and labor federation. Former Archbishop Desmond Tutu, truth panel's chairman, said commission needed time prepare fight legal challenge, and would excise de Klerk's name report avoid delaying it release. It upset me deeply, Tutu said. We have been scrupulously fair Mr. de Klerk and we reject contention that we have been engaged vendetta him. But we must and will respect court and his right constitution. We fought hard those right and we can be proud South Africa that Mr. de Klerk now share them, he said statement. All we are doing is postponing dealing matter, Tutu later told The Associated Press. The name will eventually appear all hoo-ha ha died down. De Klerk, reached London, said he could not comment speaking his lawyer because matter wa court. The commission wa charged promoting reconciliation laying bare apartheid's horror. It ha held hearing country more two year, listening victim and perpetrator seeking amnesty. The release 3,500-page report represents milestone South Africa's transformation white minority rule democracy. De Klerk's challenge wa only part storm criticism prompted leak report. The African National Congress, liberation movement that helped defeat apartheid and now run country, Tuesday angrily rejected finding that it too wa guilty human right violation it armed struggle. The report will be broad and detailed summary South Africa's human right history, 1960 1994, when all-race election ended white minority rule. It will parcel out moral condemnation and recommend individual prosecution. Other threatened legal challenge have led fewer individual being named right violator planned, The Star Johannesburg reported Wednesday. In commenting newspaper report, Tutu said that more 400 people had been notified they would be implicated give them chance respond. Only 15 successfully argued themselves out report, he said. Criminal prosecution atrocity committed war white rule could drag least six year, top prosecutor said Monday. Key figure implicated human right abuse Truth and Reconciliation Commission already are investigation, official, Jan d'Oliveira, told reporter. They include two unnamed general apartheid state's security apparatus, President Nelson Mandela's ex-wife Winnie Madikizela-Mandela and official African National Congress, he said. The remark d'Oliveira, who recently wa appointed deputy national director prosecution, were clearest signal that criminal case would be brought figure accused commission gross human right violation. The commission released it report Oct. 30. It chronicle human right abuse committed apartheid government and their operative well African National Congress and fighting racist system. The issue continuing prosecution is significant. Many feel that dragging criminal reckoning horror apartheid era will only prolong bitterness and delay reconciliation. But supporter prosecution feel that denying justice victim is worse evil. On practical level, highly public prosecution ANC figure could have impact national election next year, when party will seek consolidate it hold power. The panel's chairman, Archbishop Desmond Tutu, ha called two-year time limit prosecutions; d'Oliveira called period wholly impractical. The prosecutor not name other target. We have always worked principle that we will prosecute highest rank, he said. The commission ha ability grant amnesty those who admit their misdeed and are found have acted political motif. The report said individual who have not sought amnesty should be prosecuted. Madikizela-Mandela ha not sought amnesty. The commission found her accountable human right violation committed her bodyguard, who report said killed and tortured suspected opponent. Madikizela-Mandela wa convicted 1991 kidnapping and being accessory assault four young men. She wa sentenced six year jail, paid dlrs 3,200 fine appeal. The ANC official wa most prominent anti-apartheid activist. The two general were implicated Truth Commission testimony. Prosecutors are ready move forward pending amnesty application one. Torturers and bomber who carried out atrocity defending or fighting apartheid need counseling ensure they do not repeat their crime, expert South Africa's reconciliation body said Thursday. Addressing local and international expert, Charles Villa-Vicencio, research head Truth and Reconciliation Commission, said ignoring psychological need those who carried out human right abuse could alienate potentially dangerous sector society. We must give attention healing perpetrator, not just sake perpetrator, sake nation whole, he said. The conference, organized Medical Research Council, is examining mental health issue raised Truth Commission, which is charged probing crime committed all side anti-apartheid struggle. As commission prepares hand it final report end month, South Africans are examining it painful and traumatic exploration their bloody past. With power grant amnesty many who tortured, bombed or maimed innocent civilian, process ha some stage angered people nearly all walk life. Many white see panel favoring black liberation movement, while many black accuse it being too soft former state official, especially top ranking minister. However, Villa-Vicencio appealed tolerance dealing all those who have committed crime, saying that potential wrongdoing existed everyone. We all, entire human race, carry u capacity evil, he said. Many Thursday's speaker touched figure police death squad leader Eugene de Kock, who wa given jail term totaling more 200 year killing spree that cost dozen life. De Kock ha applied amnesty his crime. Dan Stein, specialist neurobiology and stress disorder, said de Kock typified many killer all side conflict his sheer banality evil. Many people have found him interview be ordinary, likeable person, he said man whom subordinate dubbed Prime Evil. Ginn Fourie, physiotherapist whose student daughter wa gunned black activist 1993 attack Cape Town bar, said it wa necessary help those whose circumstance compelled them do wrong. Struggling control her tear, Fourie told delegate she had attended amnesty hearing her daughter's killer and supported their successful bid be freed long jail sentence. After describing how she hugged three member black nationalist Pan-Africanist Congress and urged them seek counseling together their victim, Fourie earned standing ovation 50-strong audience. We must take initiative understanding and start process reconciliation and healing our broken land, she said, her voice shaking emotion. The New York Times said editorial Sunday, Nov. 1: The 3,500-page report South African Truth and Reconciliation Commission, released Thursday, is most comprehensive and unsparing examination nation's ugly that any such commission ha produced. Drawing commission's investigation and testimony hundred applicant amnesty and 20,000 victim, report is detailed look crime apartheid era, and blame successive white government vast majority. It ha fulfilled it mandate telling fullest truth possible, which is one reason that every political party South Africa ha denounced it. Besides accusing government assassination and bombing, report criticizes Inkatha Freedom Party it massacre and collaboration security force, and blame African National Congress murder civilian and other crime. It single out former President PW. Botha, Chief Mangosuthu Buthelezi, Inkatha leader, and Winnie Mandela, others, detailed treatment their role political crime. One major flaw report is absence section accusing FW. de Klerk, last apartheid president, knowing several bombing fact and keeping silent. It wa excised because de Klerk is suing commission. The ANC also sued, unsuccessfully, stop publication. The lawsuit are disappointing sign that South Africa's political party are not interested honest look their past, nor free flow information. The controversy ha added widespread complaint that commission ha not helped process reconciliation. This is wrong. True reconciliation which occurs when society is no longer paralyzed and people can work and live together cannot be based silence. No society can be restored health papering much pain South Africans have suffered. A noisy and informed debate complicity crime apartheid era is necessary, if uncomfortable. The report is only part Truth Commission's contribution healing process. The hearing themselves, which allowed victim human right violation tell their story public, helped country heal and opened eye many white unpleasant truth apartheid. The amnesty process, while permitting many important criminal escape justice, is allowing family know exactly what happened their loved one dozen case that would likely have never gone trial South Africa's fragile judicial system. The process helping victim scholarship and other necessary aid go on, although it will not be enough. No commission can transform society twisted South Africa's wa. But Truth Commission is best effort world ha seen, and South Africa is better it. The deal that South Africa's Truth and Reconciliation Commission offered wa simple enough: Confess your crime, apply amnesty and you will go free. If you don't come forward, you will be prosecuted. After more two year hearing apartheid-era atrocity, commission last week unveiled 3,500-page report naming dozen people it belief were their elbow gore never applied amnesty. So prosecution should begin soon, right? Not so fast. The study wa barely hand President Nelson Mandela talk new amnesty deal had begun. It seems that nearly all South Africa's political party including ruling African National Congress have key official who could end dock because report. Suddenly, there is lot talk how country can't withstand politically divisive trial, and many political analyst here are betting that agreement mutual benefit is offing. Already, three major political party are calling some kind new amnesty, and ANC isn't closing door. ANC spokesman Thabo Masebe said it wa premature talk general amnesty, he acknowledged that party wa discussing amnesty specifically tailored violence black South Africans other black that littered KwaZulu/Natal province body late '80s and '90s. In choosing truth commission rather Nuremberg-style trial which close out it brutal past, South Africa hoped idealistic reconciliation. People would come clean and receive true forgiveness. Society would then be able move on, it wound cleansed and healed. It wa model watched closely world other society wondering how disentangle themselves grudge brutal past. But given chance, hundred South Africa's perpetrator not come forward. Commission official themselves say they were frustrated lack cooperation, however exhaustive their report may seem. It is perhaps too late, however, press more. Today's South Africa ha urgent new problem deal unemployment, crime, white flight, too few school and hospital. So it may wind settling more pragmatic reconciliation one that give amnesty unrepentant simply because it's more practical all concerned move on. In recent year, truth commission have gained popularity many place, notably Chile, Argentina and El Salvador. But South Africa's biggest and most powerful, able grant amnesty and subpoena witness wa supposed be real test. Certainly commission forced nation see gruesome detail it past, sobbing survivor and stone-faced torturer told smashed genitals and suffocation. And commission's work added much knowledge what happened South Africa 1960 and 1994. But it will be year effect commission can truly be judged. Has anyone really forgiven anyone else? Will vendetta persist? No one can answer. One thing seems clear, however: Four year South Africa held it first non-racial election, growing number South Africans want be done past. Raymond Louw, publisher respected weekly newsletter, Southern Africa Report, say new amnesty proposal could come February session Parliament, time remove issue next year's election campaign. You simply can't have this country torn apart prosecution, he say. Everybody is going be howling amnesty. They already are. Even Archbishop Desmond Tutu, commission's chairman, delivered report, he seemed be anticipating push new amnesty and arguing it. He said such move would be highly unfair those who came forward. He suggested instead that there be two-year time limit, which anyone not indicted would effect get amnesty. To be sure, there will be opposition any proposal limit prosecution. More dozen human right and victim advocacy group have already banded together condemn such proposal unconscionable. The idea Truth Commission emerged compromise long negotiation that brought South Africa's peaceful transition white supremacist state non-racial democracy. During talk, white National Party government pushed blanket amnesty, and ANC refused. In end, only 250 former police officer came forward, most them foot soldier. And only two high National Party official, former Law and Order Minister Adriaan Vlok and Police Commissioner Johan van der Merwe, confessed role ordering bombing. In it report, commission called apartheid state primary perpetrator gross human right violation and held such high ranking former official former President PW. Botha, his former army chief, Georg Meiring, and former intelligence chief, Niel Barnard, responsible. These men, and lower rank, have not applied amnesty For ANC, most embarrassing prospect is possible prosecution Mandela's former wife, Winnie Madikizela-Mandela, who is accused report taking part number assault and abduction. Lesser-known official could face charge too. The ANC is held responsible least 76 death KwaZulu/Natal. The ANC's problem are further complicated it effort make peace largely Zulu-based Inkatha Freedom Party. Virtually no one that party came forward ask amnesty. Yet report found that Inkatha, working white government, wa responsible widespread slaughter KwaZulu/Natal and township Johannesburg. Inkatha's leader, Chief Mangosuthu Buthelezi, and many key party official stand accused fomenting wide range abuse. But prosecuting Chief Buthelezi could lead new warfare KwaZulu. Part reluctance go forward prosecution may be result still another factor: The judicial system is already overwhelmed rising crime and evidence apartheid era is old. So why spend time and money? At moment, only one political party is opposed any form new amnesty tiny influential Democratic Party, liberal group that wa not involved violence. Its head, Tony Leon, say new amnesty would only prove that more thuglike your behavior, more you get away with. But he concedes that his is lonely voice. At this point, he say, there is little enthusiasm anything closing book past. A panel probing apartheid-era abuse ha accused African National Congress human right violation, including torture and bomb attack, state broadcaster said Monday. The ANC, which led struggle white rule and now is power, previously ha acknowledged it wa told expect implication right violation. The Truth and Reconciliation Commission will release it final report 2 1-2 year investigation Thursday. The report wa expected place overwhelming blame era's abuse white government and their brutal security service. President Nelson Mandela's office received advance copy Monday ahead handover ceremony, when retired Archbishop Desmond Tutu, who chaired comission, will present Mandela report. South African Broadcasting Corp. radio said it had been leaked preliminary document which condemns ANC politically and morally responsible gross human right violation and fall apartheid. An ANC spokesman, Thabo Masebe, said he believed news report referred commission letter sent advance informing u it intention implicate ANC gross human right violation. Commission official could not immediately be reached comment. Justice Minister Dullah Omar told journalist Pretoria he had heard news report, would not comment. Former President FW. de Klerk, meanwhile, plan ask court prevent Truth Commission report implicating him covering state-sponsored terror. Obviously we will comply ruling court, Omar said, added he would regret any court-ordered delay. The ANC wa nervous enough report request meeting commissioner earlier this month. The panel refused, avoid appearing embarrassed. The party say accusation it likely would center planting land mine border farm, abuse it military camp Angola and bombing. Omar said he expected report's conclusion set debate added it would lay basis reconciliation. President Nelson Mandela acknowledged Saturday African National Congress violated human right apartheid, setting him odds his deputy president report that ha divided much South Africa. The disagreement stem Thursday's release report Truth and Reconciliation Commission horror committed apartheid. Rather act salve and aid reconciliation, report ha caused divisiveness, former comrades-in-arms who fought apartheid. As expected, report called apartheid crime humanity. But it also blamed ANC gross human right violation it anti-apartheid struggle, saying group tortured suspected spy and dissident and killed innocent civilian land mine and bomb. Some suspected traitor were killed ANC's camp abroad. Mbeki who became ANC president last year and will likely be elected South Africa's next president 1999 when Mandela retires took hard line Saturday report, and indicated all ANC member must do same. No member, 5th graf, 1st Ld-Writethru Following are excerpt final report issued South Africa's Truth and Reconciliation Commission Thursday: PRIMARY FINDING On basis evidence available it, primary finding Commission is that: The predominant portion gross violation human right wa committed former state it security and law-enforcement agency.

The commission doe not condone legitimization such individual military target and find that extrajudicial killing such individual constituted gross violation human right. The commission find that, 1980's particular, number gross violation were perpetrated not direct member ANC. or those operating it formal command, civilian who saw themselves ANC. supporter. In this regard, Commission find that ANC. is morally and politically accountable creating climate which such supporter believed their action be legitimate and carried out broad parameter people's war enunciated ANC.

From nation Tuesday, gay leader stressed that campus homophobia is not restricted college town Rocky Mountain West. Last year, survey almost 4,000 Massachusetts high school student, 22 percent gay respondent said they skipped school month because they felt unsafe school, and 31 percent said they had been threatened or injured school year.

Matthew's death, I hope, will bring better and deeper understanding hate crime law, said Elizabeth Birch, executive director Human Rights Campaign, lesbian and gay right group that ha 250,000 member. Matthew's death may lead awakening Wyoming and United States Congress need this legislation. In 1996, 21 men and woman were killed United States because their sexual orientation, according Southern Poverty Law Center, Alabama group that track violence minority. According FBI, sexual orientation wa factor 11.6 percent 8,759 hate crime recorded 1996. But Christian conservative warn that gay leader want use Shepard's death expand hate right law and curtail freedom speech. Hate crime law have nothing do perpetrator violent crime and everything do silencing political opposition, said Steven Schwalm, analyst Family Research Council, Washington group dedicated defending faith, family and freedom. It would criminalize pro-family belief, Schwalm said. This basically sends message that you can't disagree political message homosexual activist. Agreement came John Paulk, who wa featured this summer series advertisement how he and his wife, Anne, overcame homosexuality religious conversion. We have every right speak out agenda that is contrary Biblical norm, said Paulk, who describes himself homosexuality specialist Focus Family, Christian group Colorado Springs, Colo. Because we are standing and opposing homosexual agenda, we are being looked advocating violence homosexual, when we categorically reject violence homosexual. Last Thursday, Family Research Council unveiled series television advertisement that preach healing homosexuality religious conversion. Gay leader charge that these advertisement help create hostile climate homosexual, climate that can lead violence. Hate crime law that are book 40 state have not impinged freedom speech, said Brian Levin, criminal justice professor who directs Center Hate and Extremism Stockton College, Pomona, NJ. Instead, he said, hate crime law send clear message that society doe not tolerate attack minority. We want deter broken window and simple assault they escalate, he said. Referring murder homosexual, he added: These crime are preventable. Offenders get emboldened if they are not punished first time. Levin said that his research indicated that homosexual suffered higher rate violent crime population large. He also said that roughly half people who attack homosexual are male, aged 22 or younger. The two men charged killing Shephard are white, Russell Henderson, 21, and Aaron McKinney, 22. With other crime, violence is mean end. With hate crime, violence becomes unstoppable goal, Levin said. Shepard suffered dozen cut head, face and neck, well massive blow back his skull. Because their social stature society, gay are viewed appropriate target, Levin added. Citing need hate crime law send clear message gay bashers, Levin said: The discourse society leaf many these people believe that what they are doing is socially acceptable. While some gay leader saw crucifixion imagery Shepard's death, saw different symbolism: Old West practice nailing dead coyote ranch fence warning future intruder. This University Wyoming student wa beaten and left die, tied fence animal because he wa honest and open being gay, Beatrice Dorhn, legal director Lambda Legal Defense and Education Fund, said Monday, Matthew Shepard's horrible suffering and death cannot be dismissed simply fault deranged, isolated individual. His attacker are million Americans who constantly hear message that gay people are not worthy most basic equal treatment, Ms. Dorhn said. On same day Americans learned last week that Matthew Shepard, 5-foot-2, 105-pound gay college student, had been tortured, strung animal and left die fence Laramie, Wyo., Family Research Council wa co-hosting press conference Washington. It wa latest salvo six-month campaign religious right, tacit, explicit, approval Republican leader, demonize gay people political gain this election year. This particular press conference wa announce new barrage ad TV follow-up summer print campaign which alleged former homosexual who have changed implore do likewise power Jesus Christ. The commercial, gooey style, end slogan: It's not hate . It's hope. But it's really stirring fear that produce hate. If these ad were truly aimed gay people, they wouldn't be broadcast extravagant cost wide general audience reached TV, and they wouldn't be trumpeted Washington, insuring free national exposure, three week Election Day. The ad themselves, sugar-coating hope, ooze malice. In one them, homosexuality is linked drug addiction and certain death AIDS; all them implicitly posit that homosexuality is itself disease need cure. Matthew Shepard ha now been cured, that's sure. As his uncle, RW. Eaton, told The Denver Post, 21-year-old Matt, who aspired career diplomacy and human right, wa small person big heart, mind and soul that someone tried beat out him. Of his nephew's shattered body Eaton said, It's something you might see war. And war it is. Go Family Research Council's Web site and you will find proud description it readiness wage war homosexual agenda and fight maintain traditional meaning `family.' The head Family Research Council is Gary Bauer, GOP power broker and putative presidential candidate, who disingenuously go talk show say that his organization hate no one and deplores violence. But if you wage well-financed medium air war which people innate difference sexual orientation are ceaselessly branded sinful and diseased and un-American seeker special right, ground war will follow. It's story old history. Once any group is successfully scapegoated subhuman threat normal value propaganda machine, emboldened thug take over. Two week James Byrd wa savagely dragged his death pickup truck Texas June, I wrote column ugly incident GOP state convention Fort Worth, where mob threatened group gay Log Cabin Republicans who were protesting discriminatory treatment their party. The gay-bashers had been directly preceded steady saber-rattling Republican politicians: Sen. James Inhofe Oklahoma had likened James Hormel, gay nominee ambassadorship, David Duke; Pat Robertson had wondered TV if God might wreak havoc Disney World it Gay Days; Texas GOP spokesman had likened Log Cabin Ku Klux Klan. Just two day this near-brush violence Fort Worth, Trent Lott wa TV seconding religious right's condemnation gay people sinful and sick. A frightened gay Texas Republican who had been convention melee asked when I interviewed him then: Do you have have someone hurt and beat and dragged truck stop this? Months later not murder Laramie ha moved Lott apologize his word, and still no major GOP leader dare take it religious wing and it crusade people Matthew Shepard. In one new ad that supposedly hate-free crusade, ostensibly loving mother condemns her son bad choice being gay. Is it that mother who speaks American value, or is it Matthew's? Go home, give your kid hug, Judy Shepard said message read tearful hospital spokesman who announced her child's death early Monday morning, and don't let day go telling them you love them. At first, passing bicyclist thought crumpled form lashed ranch fence wa scarecrow. But when he stopped, he found burned, battered and nearly lifeless body Matthew Shepard, openly gay college student who had been tied fence 18 hour earlier.

Two woman described friend men, Kristen Leann Price, 18, and Chastity Vera Pasley, 20, have been charged accessory fact attempted first-degree murder. Shepard's friend said that he not know his alleged tormentor. Laramie police say primary motive wa robbery, although court paper filed Friday indicate Shepard's homosexuality may also have been factor. Shepard's friend call attack hate crime. He wa very open his sexuality, Tina LaBrie, anthropology student here, said her friend. I admired him that because it is very courageous be yourself when disagree. A few hour he wa beaten, Shepard, slight 5-foot, 2-inch man who wore brace his teeth, had attended meeting Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgendered Association, said Walter Boulden, friend Shepard's. He wa sitting bar, having beer, when two men came and talked him, Boulden, 46-year-old university lecturer social work here, said today tear. He indicated he wa gay, and they said they were gay, too. Now, he is coma, continued Boulden, who visited his friend hospital Fort Collins, Colo., Thursday. I don't think anybody expects him pull through. Shepard, who spoke Arabic and German, studied boarding school Switzerland moving back United States attend University Wyoming, alma mater his father, oil rig safety inspector Saudi Arabia. Matthew Shepard wa born Casper, capital Wyoming's oil belt, and spent much his youth there. But six week returning Wyoming and enrolling freshman here, Shepard fell depression, said Ms. Labrie and her husband, Phillip.

Set treeless landscape defined barbed wire fence, grazing cattle and busy freight railroad line, Laramie is town where pickup truck outnumber sport utility vehicle, where fall entertainment revolves this Saturday's homecoming football game and start hunting season nearby Medicine Bow mountain. Although Wyoming bill itself equality state, reference it being first state give woman vote, state legislature ha repeatedly voted hate crime legislation ground that it would give homosexual special right. Wyoming is not really gay friendly, Marv Johnson, executive director Wyoming chapter American Civil Liberties Union, said Cheyenne. The best way characterize that is comment legislator made few year back, when he likened homosexual gay bull worthless and should be sent packing plant. Shepard joined campus gay association university day. One his favorite haunt wa Fireside Bar, which drew mixed crowd college student and rodeo cowboy, gay and straight. He definitely wasn't drunk when he came in, recalled bartender, Matt Galloway. He wasn't drunk when he went out.

ANKARA, Turkey (AP) - Prime Minister Mesut Yilmaz Wednesday faced intense pressure step allegation that he interfered privatization contract and helped businessman linked mobster secure loan. Deniz Baykal, leader center-left Republican party whose backing parliament help Yilmaz's minority government, said he would withdraw his support unless premier resigned immediately.

The allegation were made businessman Korkmaz Yigit, who claimed that Yilmaz and Gunes Taner, economy minister, had encouraged him buy state-run bank Turkbank, offering him loan other state bank ensure that his offer wa highest bid. Yigit's allegation were carried Tuesday night two his TV channel which showed videotape he had made explain his version story his detention Monday evening questioning bidding.

On that earlier tape, Cakici wa heard assuring Yigit that he will fend rival bidder. It wa not clear who made tape, which got hand opposition deputy. Yigit claimed Yilmaz and Taner were aware Cakici's involvement bidding bank urged him nevertheless go ahead bidding.

The Islamic-oriented Virtue Party, however, withheld immediate support Yalim Erez. News report said Virtue wa holding out number Cabinet seat that reflected it standing largest party parliament. We are neither saying `yes' nor saying `no' this point, Virtue leader Recai Kutan said. Erez denied that two had discussed Cabinet post. Erez, independent lawmaker, is trying form coalition government that would include Cabinet member several party, including Virtue. The coalition would run country only parliamentary election set April. Erez took effort form government last week veteran leftist Bulent Ecevit gave up, unable convince Turkey's bickering center-left and center-right party join him coalition that excluded Islamic-oriented party. Erez opened talk various party leader Monday. He got support center-right leader Mesut Yilmaz, who said his party supported Erez long he had Ecevit's backing. As long our sensitivity secular, democratic regime is taken account, we will do our best help form new government and ensure it get vote confidence, Ecevit said his talk Erez. Turkey's strongly secular military is opposed any deal that would bring Virtue power. It pressured Virtue's predecessor, Welfare Party, out power last year. Erez is supposed talk Tuesday center-right Tansu Ciller and Deniz Baykal, who lead center-left party. I am more and more optimistic every meeting, Erez told reporter meeting party leader. Turkey ha been trying form new government coalition government led Yilmaz collapsed last month allegation that he rigged sale bank. Yilmaz is now acting premier. A week Turkish government fell corruption scandal, President Suleyman Demirel Wednesday asked veteran left-wing politician known his personal honesty, Bulent Ecevit, form new government. Ecevit, who served prime minister three time 1970s, said he would immediately begin working fashion government that could command majority faction-ridden Parliament. He also suggested that although Parliament ha set April 18 date new election, he might seek remain power longer period. It is wrong see this government simply election government, he said. There are problem that will not wait election. Military commander, who hold ultimate power Turkey, have quietly told senior political figure, including Demirel, that they do not want quick election. They fear it will produce Parliament just divided present one, perhaps Islamic-oriented Virtue Party largest bloc. The commander are also hoping exclude two country's leading politician, outgoing Prime Minister Mesut Yilmaz and former Prime Minister Tansu Ciller, neither whom they trust, post new government. Ecevit must now try build government that includes their center-right party not them individual. In meeting this week country's senior policy-making body, National Security Council, which military officer have strong say, set three priority coming month. It said that government emerges forthcoming negotiation should dedicate itself fighting religious fundamentalism, Kurdish nationalism and criminal gang that have infiltrated state apparatus. Among Ecevit's immediate challenge will be resolve political crisis Italy that broke out last month when Kurdish rebel leader Abdullah Ocalan wa arrested Rome and then asked political asylum there. Turkey want Ocalan sent here trial, Italy say it cannot extradite him long Turkey retains death penalty. Ecevit (pronounced EH-che-vit) is few senior Turkish politician who favor abolition capital punishment. Together Demirel, Ecevit is cited Turks who complain continued dominance geriatric political elite here. He is 73 and ha been politics most his adult life. Early his career Ecevit emerged spokesman Turkey's downtrodden mass. Perhaps more any other figure, he legitimized social democratic ideology climate where leftist sympathy were considered subversive. At same time, however, he ha shown himself be fierce nationalist. He wa prime minister when Turkey sent troop occupy northern Cyprus 1974 and is still considered hard-liner Cyprus. He is also uncompromising his opposition Kurdish nationalism. During his term prime minister 1970s, Ecevit successfully undermined effort move Turkey membership European Union, then called European Economic Community. He considered it instrument capitalist exploitation. Ecevit ha also disturbed United States flirting anti-Western ideology. In early 1990s, interval when he worked journalist, he traveled Iraq and wrote series article favorable Saddam Hussein. He recently called better relation Turkey and Iraq, and maintains some anti-imperialist position and suspicion capitalism that he developed 1960s. The Democratic Socialist Party, which Ecevit head, is closely held family fiefdom. He and his wife carefully screen applicant membership and veto those whose personal loyalty Ecevit is suspect. During his term prime minister '70s, Ecevit not appear be consensus builder, said Ilter Turan, professor political science Bilgi University Istanbul. It seems that nowadays he is more accommodating, so that perspective he may not be bad choice. On many issue that Turkish society is encountering now, he represents orientation which doe not seem be totally tune time, Turan said. That would include his position issue privatization, integrating Turkey more fully international system, and devolution central authority. He ha failed grasp where world is heading. He look and analyzes world category that are no longer useful or appropriate. Almost alone Turkish politician, Ecevit life modestly and ha avoided any hint personal or financial scandal. He speaks fluent English, and his reading taste run poetry and intellectual journal such The New York Review Books. He ha translated work TS. Eliot Turkish and published several volume his poem. Opposition party lodged no-confidence motion Wednesday Prime Minister Mesut Yilmaz allegation he interfered privatization bank and helped businessman linked mobster. Yilmaz' minority government could go if the small, center-left Republican Party, which give him majority he need parliament, vote him. The leader Republicans, Deniz Baykal, urged Yilmaz resign. But premier vowed Wednesday stay on, saying he wa victim conspiracy. This is plot and it can't be reason resignation, Yilmaz said, adding that he intended continue struggle organized crime. Afterward, Baykal said Republicans would support no-confidence motion. The leader Democratic Turkey Party, Husamettin Cindoruk, said his party might withdraw governing coalition. He said party would announce it decision Thursday. The political turmoil sent Istanbul stock market plunging 14.9 percent. Premier-designate Bulent Ecevit said Thursday he would persist difficult task convincing key party leader join force secular coalition. Ecevit, who wa asked form new government Wednesday, desperately need support 99 deputy ex-premier Tansu Ciller's center-right party. Ecevit, veteran leftist, already ha support another center-right party led Mesut Yilmaz, whose government collapsed last week weight mafia scandal. Mrs. Ciller ha not said if she would back Ecevit-led government and her long-standing rivalry Yilmaz make Ecevit's job coalition-building difficult. I don't give that easily, neither do I lose hope that easily, Ecevit told his parliamentary group Thursday. Mrs. Ciller could lose grassroot support if she stand way new government, political columnist Ertugrul Ozkok wrote Thursday daily Hurriyet. This could put her odds her classic support base. Ecevit wa expected meet Yilmaz Thursday, and other party leader Friday. Turkey's secular party are pressure join force keep Islamic Virtue Party out power.

It is now clear that no party leader can form government that can win vote confidence, former Premier Mesut Yilmaz said talk Demirel. We have told president that we will not hamper appointment deputy Parliament. With party leader unable overcome difference, new premier-designate would most probably be affiliated party be trusted enough other party follow independent line. Parliament Speaker Hikmet Cetin ha been suggested likely candidate. The new appointment would be made day, Yilmaz told reporter. Demirel consulted Turkey's party leader immediately Ecevit gave up. Most declared themselves favor government led lawmaker. Only center-right leader Tansu Ciller said she wanted government led party leader, and made clear she wa willing take task. Turkey's parliament is split longstanding animosity it center-left and center-right party.

She began protesting 1990, attending abortion protest march Albany. While veteran and civic leader devote Wednesday's national holiday honoring fallen soldier, Remembrance Day ha become chilling vigil Canadians front line abortion-rights movement. There is immediate fear, because anti-abortion gunman is believed be large. And there is long-term anxiety, because this country where abortion are legal and publicly funded, woman may find access diminishing. There is speculation sniper's timing is linked Remembrance Day because some anti-abortion activist use day commemorate aborted fetus. Three time 1994, sniper ha used this time year fire home Canadian doctor who performs abortion, each time wounding target. The attack were spread Canada Ontario, Manitoba and British Columbia. US. and Canadian investigator now believe those attack were linked two shooting abortion-providing doctor upstate New York, including Oct. 23 slaying Dr. Barnett Slepian his home Buffalo. An American anti-abortion activist, James Kopp, is wanted questioning shooting. Police say they don't know which side border he is on, fueling uneasiness clinic and hospital throughout Canada. You must realize Canada ha largest undefended border world, said Keith McCaskill, police inspector Winnipeg, Manitoba, and spokesman investigation. Many women's clinic have tightened security, and doctor who provide abortion have been urged take precaution. I would suggest they be extremely aware their day-to-day going on, whether their business day or hour, said Toronto Detective Rick Stubbings. Across Canada, there have been report obstetrician-gynecologists modifying their practice or deciding stop performing abortion. Some wear bulletproof vest and hang sheet window their home. Abortion-rights group say most doctor are not backing down. There's great deal sadness, said Susan Fox, director clinic Edmonton, Alberta, that provides abortion. But there's also feeling determination that we won't be deterred or scared these action. Marilyn Wilson, executive director Canadian Abortion Rights Action League, see long-term threat because fear violence may intimidate young doctor entering field. There are almost no doctor who have stopped performing these procedure, current reign terror, she said. But young doctor family wouldn't necessarily want do this. They may not be willing put their life risk. The abortion debate is only one several factor contributing shortage obstetrician-gynecologists Canada. The national society that oversees speciality say there are 1,400 doctor field, shortfall 600, and most are their 50 or 60. The society say long hour and limit fee paid public health-care system are causing burnout and deterring medical school graduate they choose specialty. Another problem is that few Canadian medical school offer training abortion. Women Canada's big city generally have adequate access abortion. Those rural area face long journey, and province Prince Edward Island prohibits abortion it six hospital, forcing woman there travel New Brunswick or Nova Scotia. Abortion-rights group say situation would improve if RU-486 abortion pill were available Canada. No drug company ha applied permission market pill, either fearing boycott or doubting it profitability. The government ha been urged make public appeal drug company, health department say this can't be done. It would be conflict interest, said Bonnie Fox-McIntyre, department spokeswoman. As regulator we have stay arm's length, so we can judge application impartially. Abortion wa illegal Canada 1988. Now there is no abortion law any sort, 100,000 abortion are performed annually, and poll indicate roughly three-quarters Canadians favor pro-choice policy. Yet public support doesn't spare doctor fear. Dr. Henry Morgentaler, who led effort overturn old abortion law and whose Toronto clinic wa bombed 1993, say he and his colleague are sacrificing personal freedom they reluctantly increase security measure. Unfortunately, doctor who are committed providing these service will have accept certain diminishment their enjoyment life, he said. In aftermath last month's deadly sniper attack obstetrician upstate New York, Attorney General Janet Reno announced last week that she wa setting new investigative unit examine possibility that doctor wa victim broader anti-abortion plot. The unit, National Clinic Violence Task Force, will include dozen Justice Department lawyer and involve several law-enforcement agency. But main work looking shooting Dr. Barnett Slepian his suburban Buffalo home and how it fit larger pattern organized violence will be done FBI, which ha jurisdiction domestic terrorism. For many FBI, that's problem. In contrast old image gung-ho FBI agent turning their surveillance machinery political group, number senior FBI agent privately expressed misgiving attorney general's latest task force, second she ha ordered begin broad investigation conspiracy involving anti-abortion violence. FBI official fear that expanding investigation could drive agency ill-defined boundary that separate inquiry criminal activity those political cause and unpopular idea. Today's agent are eager disassociate themselves old J. Edgar Hoover day trampling civil right political dissident guise serious investigation. They do not want agency drawn middle bitter ideological war anti-abortion group and abortion right advocate, who have long asserted existence organized campaign clinic and doctor. Many those calling government help were once themselves subject FBI interest anti-war and civil right activist. Senior agency official, including Director Louis Freeh, were starting their career early 1970s and watched dismay FBI wa shaken revelation Cointelpro, counterintelligence program that allowed agent spy on, burgle, wiretap and infiltrate anti-war and civil right group Students Democratic Society and Student Nonviolence Coordinating Committee. Some official are dubious that conspiracy exists kill doctor who perform abortion. They came empty handed when Reno ordered first federal inquiry 1994 killing Florida doctor and his bodyguard. The Justice Department conducted two-year grand jury investigation; agent pursued some anti-abortion activist using surveillance team. But investigator never found specific plot abortion clinic and staff member. Violence abortion clinic is only part problem. The FBI ha recent year found itself thrown minefield politically tinged case involving volatile world anti-government militia, environmental and Christian extremist, white separatist, animal right activist and Islamic fundamentalist. The FBI is very quick jump investigating crime investigating political association, said David Cole, law professor Georgetown University. When you move investigating crime investigating group, that all-important nexus criminal conduct get lost, focus get broader and broader and you start sweeping all kind lawful political activity. In response terrorist attack bombing World Trade Center 1993, Oklahoma City federal building 1995 and Olympic park Atlanta 1996, agency ha increased effort deter such incident major prevention program. In such case, Justice Department, FBI and other law enforcement agency said they operate domestic security guideline that require investigator find reasonable indication that group is planning break law they can open inquiry organization. Before authority can use such intrusive tactic wiretapping or property search, they must have specific evidence. Yet FBI agent throughout country have quietly evaluated threat posed variety extremist group it link local authority and informal interview leader some group. Their conclusion is that most these group pose little real danger. Much more difficult investigate are lone terrorist inflamed oratory extremist ideology who belong no group, drifting society's frayed margin, grid, some agent describe it, usual tie family, friend or work. The profile fit Eric Robert Rudolph, fugitive wanted bombing Atlanta Olympics, gay nightclub and two abortion clinic. He ha kept his belief mostly himself, although acquaintance hint that he wa familiar religious extremism and hate group. In contrast, James Charles Kopp, who is being sought material witness killing Slepian, left trail clue his motif. He wa early follower Randall Terry, leader Operation Rescue. Later, Kopp wa associated Lambs Christ, another militant anti-abortion group. One law-enforcement official said that government should do what it doe best. We should investigate violation, he said. We shouldn't investigate group. Everyone who knew Dr. Barnett Slepian knew that slight, graying physician endured measure stress that would exhaust, break, most people. There were stranger who pawed garbage can his home and growled murderer they passed him grocery store aisle. Demonstrators assailed his pregnant patient they arrived his office their checkup, calling him baby killer. Outside clinic where he performed abortion two day week, picket shouted epithet pig his face. Slepian, obstetrician and gynecologist training and abortion doctor principle, rarely acknowledged strain. He might crack occasional joke expense protester who shadowed him work and weekend. Then he would do something unexpected, invite anti-abortion leader breakfast or stop and chat familiar demonstrator clinic. So when he wa killed Oct. 23 sniper's bullet fired kitchen window his home Buffalo, N.Y., suburb, furtive execution that fit pattern four earlier attack abortion provider western New York state and Canada, friend and relative wondered not so much that Slepian's work could arouse such murderous violence. He had predicted much himself. Instead, they wondered, once again, that he persisted that work, long other Buffalo doctor had surrendered pressure abortion opponent. He wa incredibly fatalistic person who thought that if your number's up, it's up, and there is nothing you can do it, said H. Amanda Robb, doctor's 32-year-old niece. And he wa incredibly stubborn. He said that woman had right comprehensive health care and he wa women's doctor, he wa going provide it them. Slepian is third doctor be killed last five year bombing and shooting that have killed 7 people and wounded 17 abortion clinic nation. To his tormentor, he wa simply abortion doctor. To member abortion right movement, he wa martyr their cause. But Slepian wa far either. In interview friend and family member, he emerges more one-dimensional abstract conservative who advocated old-fashioned value self-reliance, shy man who had rare flash anger, doctor who performed abortion had no more patience woman who had multiple abortion woman who had multiple child they not want or could not support. He wa killed because he performed medical procedure that ha become emotional and politicized. Yet there is nothing his life suggest he wa crusader either politics or medicine. Rather, he wa obstinate, unassuming man who remarkable thing. Out contrariness and out conscience, say those who knew him, he refused allow anyone dictate what kind doctor he should be, and that, he paid his life. The clue Slepian's flinty brand commitment lie, part, his upbringing. His wa family that took success granted it teetered edge poverty. To earn money medical school, he shoveled muck ranch and drove taxi. He made few friend, those he had were friend life. When their wife were sick, he called repeatedly. When they were lonely, he flew their side. Slepian, who wa known Bart, used tell people that he chose obstetrics because it is specialty that expose doctor least suffering, and that he performed abortion because it wa legal and alternative were so much worse. Slepian expressed exasperation woman who came him abortion abortion. Don't they get it? his clinic staff recall him saying more once. He had same impatience woman those he remembered his residency inner-city Buffalo, who had child child and no mean support. He had contempt that somebody who had pulled himself his bootstrap and made it world, Ms. Robb said. He believed that ban abortion or, just shameful his view, stop teaching young doctor how perform them, would not correct human imperfection that he found so irritating. There are 1.5 million abortion performed this country, his niece said, and he just felt we're not equipped handle 1.5 million unwanted child. When he wa killed, age 52, Bart Slepian owned imposing red brick home quiet suburb Amherst, complete swimming pool piped-in music and assortment time-saving gadget he adored. Slepian's trajectory that comfortable doctor's life had been unconventional. His grandfather, Russian Jewish immigrant who started out selling shoelace pushcart Boston, propelled all five his son Harvard time when few Jews met university's blue-blood standard. His father, turn, decreed that his three son would be doctor or earn PhD's. We grew home where there wa tremendous, tremendous, tremendous respect education, said Serena Robb, Slepian's sister, who is four year older him. If you got A, it wa OK If you got B, you got yelled at. The family's mean not match it expectation. Slepian's father, Philip, had joined his father's business manufacturing leather sol shoe. Soon Bart wa born 1946 Boston, company failed, so money, father moved his family six his in-laws' apartment McKeesport, Pa., and then Rochester, NY. Once settled, Slepian's father set himself freelance writer, crisscrossing country his old Studebaker, researching origin prominent citizen Library Congress and writing their story small-town newspaper. He sold article hundred, and wa still writing his death nine year ago age 93. The success that wa expected Bart Slepian not come easily. As child, he wa so shy that he cried when anyone looked him, his sister recalled. An unexceptional student, he went local community college transferring University Denver, where he majored zoology. Rejected medical school United States fate two out three applicant late 1960s he studied one year Belgium and then enrolled Autonomous University Medicine Guadalajara, Mexico. His friend remember him funny and obstinate, thin young man glass and receding hairline who beat all comer arm-wrestling and pool. Bart had certain belief, strongly held, said Richard Schwarz, old classmate who is internist Long Island. He always said you shouldn't sit whining thing, Schwarz said. He would say, `Go what's yours and what's right.' Bart Slepian's determination surfaced quirky way. He once insisted going top World Trade Center, crippling fear height. To get window, he crawled, inch inch. I said, `You don't have do this,' recalled Schwarz, who wa him time. And he said, `I want do it.' Bart made it count. He felt alive. Forced drop out school every few semester work, he lived Reno his sister Serena, widow who wa struggling take care two young daughter. She worked waitress and blackjack dealer, sharing her tip him while he drove cab, cleaned barn ranch and worked laboratory assistant local Veterans Administration hospital. After graduation, he moved Buffalo his medical residency. There he married Lynne Breitbart, registered nurse 10 year his junior, and scraped together money buy obstetrics practice doctor who wa retire. He had soothing, unhurried manner. When patient his, Patti Durlak, wa diagnosed diabetes, Slepian referred her specialist called every few day month help her overcome fear needle she had use her insulin injection. The other doctor said, `Just deal it,' Mrs. Durlak recalled. Not Dr. Slepian. In most way, he wa typical suburban family man, working six day week and spending his free time Little League game and county fair his four son. But late 1980s, he and other abortion doctor Buffalo were siege. In one notorious 1991 incident recorded videotape, Rev. Paul Schenck, one fieriest Buffalo's anti-abortion leader, threw himself front doctor's car he pulled clinic driveway. Slepian parked street. As he pushed his way crowd chanting demonstrator, Schenck cupped his hand his mouth and lunged, shouting, Slepian, you pig! Slepian's attempt separate abortion conflict his private life were futile. The protest followed him home and man who had been so bashful boy found himself, uncomfortably, center controversy and attention. Once, he showed his anger. In 1988, when demonstrator jeered him sidewalk front his home he opened Hanukkah present his child, doctor came out brandishing baseball bat. He denied he hurt anyone, town judge ordered him repair one protester's smashed van window and pay portion another's medical bill. The outburst surprised his family and friend. It wa not Slepian's style make public fuss, much le acknowledge stress being taunted protester. Stress? his oldest brother Paul responded gruffly when asked doctor's mood. I never heard word used my family, engineering term. He said it wa nuisance. Mrs. Slepian not respond request interview. She expressed rage The Buffalo News shortly shooting. She said that whoever had killed her husband deserved death penalty and that she would be happy administer lethal injection herself. She also spoke out Schenck's brother, Robert, another anti-abortion leader who frequently confronted Slepian, sent bouquet flower. Mrs. Slepian denounced him hypocrite. After confrontation 1988, Slepian turned civil harassment lawsuit, letter and levity deal protester. In 1993, when man active anti-abortion effort wa arrested rifling doctor's garbage can home, Slepian tried treat incident lightly. They hopefully got bag full dirty diaper, he joked. He tried engage his critic local newspaper. He told The Buffalo News that abortion protester should turn their energy helping woman avoid unwanted pregnancy birth control and counseling. In letter editor he warned that repeatedly calling him murderer, his critic were inciting violence. Slepian accepted that opponent abortion acted out moral conviction, his friend said, resented personal attack. He thought it tended demonize and dehumanize him and increased danger, said his lawyer, Glenn Edward Murray. So Slepian took step that few nation's beleaguered abortion clinic doctor dared. He insisted that if he tried hard enough, he might cut venom. To dismay staff member who feared his safety, Slepian began year ago stop and chat protester he recognized Womenservices abortion clinic Buffalo, where he worked two day week. He surprised gathering protester who were preparing what they euphemistically called house call, or demonstration doctor's home, and invited protest's organizer, Rev. Robert Behn, breakfast. Their hourlong conversation next morning wa inconclusive, Behn said, dismissing Slepian's gesture attempt get people him. He asked Slepian how performing abortion affected him spiritually. In response, he recalled, doctor said, I'm fine spiritually. Slepian, meanwhile, focused more time away home his family. He planned take cruise next spring. He bought time-share apartment Disney World Florida. He had so many plan, said Ellen Fink, close friend couple 15 year. He wasn't done. He wasn't done living yet. Still, sometimes most casual conversation, shadow would appear. When his wife gave him gray African parrot birthday gift, Slepian joked that bird would probably outlive him so he would teach it his eulogy. He would talk funeral he wanted, Mrs. Fink said. He said he didn't have lot friend and wanted all them come separate car, one each car, so he'd have long procession. In week his death, Slepian had reason be preoccupied thought mortality. A medical checkup had revealed blockage his heart, Mrs. Fink said, recounting conversation Mrs. Slepian day slaying. A blockage is sign probable coronary artery disease. He wa have more test week. I said, `Lynne, just relax, it's going be OK,' Mrs. Fink recalled. That same day, National Abortion Federation sent fax Womenservices clinic warning pattern sniper attack abortion doctor that occurred early November. Marilynne Buckham, clinic director, sent it Slepian. He definitely took it seriously, she recalled. Typically, doctor not share any concern he might have felt. It wa normal day, said Tammi Latini, his office assistant. We were horsing around.' That evening, Slepians went synagogue mark ninth anniversary death Slepian's father. Shortly they returned home, sniper's bullet smashed kitchen window, killing Slepian he chatted his wife and son. The protester returned clinic five day later, first day it reopened. Mrs. Buckham, director, said Slepian would not have been surprised. They have their routine. So he. He never wanted day end bad note, she said. At end day, I would always say, `Thank you coming.' And he would always turn stupid grin and say, `Thanks having me.' The slaying Dr. Barnett Slepian his home last week eliminated mainstay only abortion clinic here, it ha not eliminated women's access abortion. That is because availability abortion Buffalo area, much United States, is complex reality, one affected class and education, medical training and personal conviction individual doctor. Knowledgeable middle-class and affluent woman here who find themselves unwanted pregnancy can obtain abortion their private gynecologist, or if gynecologist ha personal objection procedure, referral colleague. Women who are poor, young or uneducated and have no such regular relationship doctor have rely specialized clinic one Slepian worked in, or hospital. It is this group whom unplanned pregnancy are far more common prosperous woman that face shrinking universe possibility result fear set Slepian's killing and slaying five other doctor and clinic worker 1993, medical expert said. If you're well and well connected, you can get your abortion, said Dr. Stephen Wear, co-director center clinical ethic University Buffalo, which train doctor Buffalo area's hospital. For everybody else, it's le and le available. The number abortion United States ha been declining steadily first year Supreme Court's Roe v. Wade decision legalized abortion 1973, according Alan Guttmacher Institute, which study reproductive issue. They now number roughly 1.5 million year, according report Guttmacher, or 1.4 million, according National Right Life Committee, nation's largest anti-abortion group, which calculates it estimate partly Guttmacher figure. The number provider who identify themselves performing abortion part their practice is diminishing well. A 1994 Guttmacher study, last one published, found that number had decreased 18 percent 1982 and 1992, 2,380 2,908. Moreover, study said, only 12 percent nation's residency program routinely offer training abortion first trimester, though many do offer elective course. Laura Echevarria, director medium relation National Right Life Committee, contends, however, that most teaching hospital do train gynecologist procedure treating miscarriage that are similar those used performing abortion. Only cosmopolitan and comparatively liberal city New York doe availability abortion continue steady level, expert say, though these locale there is concern decreasing number young doctor who emerge residency fully trained performing abortion. The Guttmacher Institute, which keep nation's most precise statistic, said that 1992, last year which it ha figure, there were 142,410 abortion New York that were done just 151 provider, including 61 hospital and 44 clinic. Still, that provider figure greatly understates number private doctor who perform them their office, medical expert say. Many obstetrician and gynecologist Manhattan provide abortion part their palette service, and have many year, said Dr. Richard Hausknecht, medical director Planned Parenthood. Rich and middle-class woman have always had access abortion, and they always will. The major threat availability city is le result anti-abortion violence medical training. The bottom line is that we're facing impending shortage physician who are adequately trained and willing do procedure, said Dr. John Choate, chairman New York State division American College Obstetricians and Gynecologists. But lack training program is also result political pressure hospital and university antagonist abortion and same climate fear. Physicians tend lie low, Choate said. They don't publicize fact that they do them. If they do them, they do it quietly out fear their practice and their life. One development horizon that is expected change outlook abortion substantially is final federal approval, expected next year, RU-486 pill, drug that end early pregnancy need surgery. When pill wa introduced France and Edinburgh, Scotland, Hausknecht said, number surgical abortion plummeted. In July 1988, when Randall Terry drove night his home Binghamton, N.Y., Atlanta start series anti-abortion protest that would finally put his new hard-line group, Operation Rescue, America's front page, James Charles Kopp wa van riding alongside him, according former leader Operation Rescue who spoke condition anonymity. And, those people say, when Terry wa arrested first day Operation Rescue's Siege Atlanta, Kopp followed him jail. Along more one hundred other Operation Rescue member, according some people who were there, Kopp remained jail 40 day and adhered Terry's order not give real name police or court. After his release, Kopp returned Operation Rescue's Binghamton headquarters, and wa there working alongside Terry group's power and influence anti-abortion movement surged late 1988 and 1989, according former leader Operation Rescue. Now, Kopp is being sought federal and local law enforcement authority questioning material witness murder obstetrician who performed abortion Buffalo region. The authority also say he may have information that will help solve four other sniper attack doctor who performed abortion Canada and upstate New York. Some abortion-rights group are seizing Kopp's role Operation Rescue raise new question connection recent anti-abortion violence and hard-line anti-abortion protest group that burst national scene late 1980s. For year, Federal Bureau Investigation and Justice Department have looked vain evidence determine whether national conspiracy might be series clinic bombing and shooting doctor and other clinic staff member that began early 1990s. A federal grand jury Alexandria, Va., that looked conspiracy allegation wa ultimately disbanded finding national underground. But some federal law enforcement official say they hope that Kopp may help provide such link. In fact, announcement that law enforcement official are looking him ha been made Attorney General Janet Reno ha prepared revive interagency task force look once again possible conspiracy anti-abortion crime. Federal law enforcement official and authority say Kopp is not now suspect sniper attack Oct. 23 that killed Dr. Barnett A. Slepian Buffalo. But they say Kopp's car wa seen Slepian's home Amherst, NY. week doctor wa shot. One day issuing warrant Kopp's arrest material witness, law enforcement official least 10 agency spanning United States and Canadian border still had not located Kopp Thursday. But law enforcement official said they were pursuing many tip, including 400 that have poured FBI's information line: (800) 281-1184. The police have gone photograph abortion protester and clinic worker Buffalo and country, and they are also reviewing hundred hour videotape demonstration search Kopp's face. At this point, official consider shooting Slepian be connected three attack Canada and one Rochester doctor who provide abortion. The five attack, all 1994, occurred week leading Nov. 11, Veterans Day called Remembrance Day Canada holiday that ha become important anti-abortion activist. But attack were spread four year and 3,000 mile, Vancouver, British Columbia, Buffalo. As is case many early veteran Operation Rescue, Kopp wa transformed hard-core anti-abortion militant jail Atlanta 1988, according many people who were jail him who insisted anonymity. By outward appearance, Dorothy Hayes' life seems ordinary. She and her family live rambling old home shore Lake Ontario, and every morning, she give her husband, John, peck cheek he go work. She run errand, other suburban mom, and spends much her day taking care her child. But one thing set Mrs. Hayes apart her neighbor. As devoted opponent abortion, 43-year-old mother nine regularly play host series traveling speaker, priest and protester many whom have come Rochester intent spreading word abortion and shutting clinic that provide it. She is one thousand people country loosely associated anti-abortion group Lambs Christ who have opened their home Lambs' founder, Rev. Norman Weslin, and other itinerant demonstrator. While many including Mrs. Hayes disavow violent tactic, supporter abortion right say that people her bear some responsibility when protester they help blockade clinic or threaten doctor. These people who provide Father Weslin food and shelter when he come town close clinic are not innocent, said Ann Glazier, director clinic defense Planned Parenthood Federation. It's just not credible say they aren't part extremist activity that is taking place these clinic. They are still guilty interfering women's access. But Mary Quinn, local organizer Lambs Christ who also offer her home protester, see matter differing light. Taking people this is act Christian charity, Mrs. Quinn said. `People who travel country doing this work are taken those u that who don't want lose their stupid house. We take these people because they are willing make sacrifice. Members Lambs Christ have been persistent figure protest Buffalo women's clinic where Dr. Barnett Slepian worked he wa shot death last month. Although no suspect ha been identified shooting or several similar attack New York and Canada several year, official are looking question Vermont man whose car wa seen Dr. Slepian's home. That man, James Charles Kopp, ha participated abortion protest more decade, and wa house guest other member Lambs Christ. While Mrs. Hayes say she would never so much obstruct clinic's door, some those whom she ha given refuge have no qualm doing so. Weslin, leader Lambs Christ, is one those who ha benefited Mrs. Hayes' hospitality, modern version generosity that Christ and Apostles knew well. He pride himself being arrested more 60 time protest front medical clinic. And throughout 1980s and early '90s, he wa active clinic rescue, which protester tried physically restrain patient trying enter clinic. Weslin stayed Mrs. Hayes' home only once, beginning May 1996 when he first came speak local church anti-abortion movement. But stay that lasted several month, he wa arrested Federal charge blocking access Rochester health clinic where abortion were performed. He wa later convicted and served two and half month prison. During protest clinic, he and several other protester locked themselves homemade contraption called oven, made cement and iron. It took police officer several hour lug device horse trailer that carted it off. At same protest, one man glued his head lock gate surrounding clinic, move some protester later said wa accident. Abortion opponent Mrs. Hayes and Mrs. Quinn speak attending peaceful observance abortion clinic and offering prayer unborn. They talk counseling woman alternative abortion Roman Catholic pregnancy center, and their support anti-abortion candidate. But they also say they saw nothing wrong Weslin trying block access clinic. They describe activity peaceful resistance meant stop what they see murder. Weslin and other house guest Mrs. Hayes and Mrs. Quinn come recommended friend and member local Catholic church, they said, adding that most are speaker local church or anti-abortion event. And although they say they would never take their home stranger wanted FBI, Kopp, they concede that they sometimes know little their guest. But Mrs. Hayes and Mrs. Quinn say they know lot Weslin. An Army veteran, he ha been leader anti-abortion movement more 25 year, they say, and founded home unwed mother. Mrs. Hayes said that when she met him, it wa obvious he wa man peace who had tremendous devotion Blessed Mother and basically recognized that we are helpless lamb. Barbara Fredericks, another local abortion opponent who developed tie Lambs Weslin came town, added that priest epitomized man God. I just knew when I looked his holy shoe and his simple coat that had been mended 50 time, she said. He wa humble, man who wa doing this higher purpose, trying people sacrifice and prayer. opp also ha robust defender people who housed him he rode country protest protest. E. Kenny, 20, said that his parent housed Kopp their St. Albans, Vt., home two year he spoke their local church 1988. During Kopp's stay, he wa pleasure, Kenny said, always helping house. He wa nice guy, kind uncle u, Kenny said. He'd sit and play video game u and make u model plane out wood. Like Weslin, Kopp wa consumed need fight abortion and talked it evil, Kenny said, adding that Kopp wa gentle man who wanted become Catholic priest. He wa always good mood, Kenny said. He never anything violent all. Both Kopp and Weslin have been arrested repeatedly abortion protest. The men have moved same circle and time found themselves arrested same event. Mrs. Quinn said that Weslin told her recent telephone conversation that he knew Kopp. Weslin could not be reached comment, it is clear that two men have encountered each other. Both faced misdemeanor charge blocking Burlington, Vt., health clinic 1990 that Kopp called mill. And they spent time same jail Atlanta 1988 clinic protest. Slepian's death ha abortion opponent Mrs. Hayes and Mrs. Quinn worried, how killing is being portrayed medium and what it will do membership group Lambs Christ. For long time, you felt voice desert that wasn't being heard, Mrs. Hayes said. And then there wa this horrible tragedy this doctor's death becoming face movement. We're saving life, she said. The FBI ha not talked Mrs. Hayes, Kenny said that agent have spoken him. The Justice Department say that Federal task force set this week investigate killing Slepian is looking evidence connecting anti-abortion violence various clinic. It's fair say that when investigating these event, we will look any connection individual engaged criminal conduct, Myron Marlin, spokesman department, said. Many local Catholics associated Lambs Christ have tried distance themselves killing Slepian. They are mailing literature saying that killer doe not represent their movement. In addition, some people associated Lambs are offering other possible explanation killing. Some say they believe that killer might have been someone overcome grief personal experience abortion. Others wondered whether shooter had tried wound doctor scare him or prevent him performing more abortion. The Lambs also wonder whether abortionist opponent are being blamed shooting committed disgruntled patient. One idea gaining currency Lambs, and prominently displayed their Web site, suggests that killing wa result plot abortion supporter discredit abortion opponent just last week's election. Mrs. Hayes say she doesn't know truth. There are wacko who travel and they may be front clinic because we are drawn same place, she said. But you don't know everyone who show and you don't turn person next you and tell them they don't belong there. Mrs. Fredericks said that anyone who would shoot doctor who provides abortion wa someone who had snapped, perhaps because importance situation. Members Lambs Christ and other opponent abortion Rochester wonder whether killing Slepian will hinder their effort. When Weslin first arrived two year ago, he brought new focus group that had done little more counsel pregnant woman and set booth college campus, they said. In many city, they have priest life coordinating and leading rosary march abortion, Mrs. Quinn said. But Father Weslin coming here, we could finally come together and feel we were doing something sacrificial group. Mrs. Hayes said that she felt first pull movement early 1980s, when she heard woman speak choice regard abortion. Then she saw Silent Scream, well-known anti-abortion film that purport show footage abortion. What I saw wa end life, she said. She began volunteer Catholic pregnancy center where she encouraged woman not kill their child. She also began house unwed mother and went stand vigil local clinic where abortion were performed. Mrs. Hayes looked her 3-month-old daughter, Bernadette, then pointed prenatal image infant, sonogram taken 13 week that she keep her refrigerator door. She described what could have been her baby's fate, had she been someone else's child. Two pound and two inch ago, she could have been partial-birth abortion, Mrs. Hayes said, referring controversial late-term abortion procedure. They have hardest time getting shoulder out, so they can get head and puncture it. It's brutal, what do you expect when purpose is dead baby?

My heart is them, said Strawberry, who spoke several Yankees they won American League championship. I'm just going relax home and watch game. I'm looking forward it. I may not be there, it'll feel I am. Paul O'Neill echoed sentiment many Yankees saying, Everything we're going is game. This is his life. Any time we get some good news Darryl it's uplifting. We're all praying him. Since cancerous cell were found one 36 lymph node removed his abdomen operation, Strawberry said doctor told him he will need six month chemotherapy treatment once he return California. The 36-year-old outfielder said doctor told him he will need one treatment least one hour week. I wa never scared, said Strawberry. I wa more emotional anything. At time it, I had played while this. I wanted keep playing because I knew we were going get World Series. At that point, Strawberry stopped and laughed, probably because Yankees had made it World Series he expected. I wanted be there because that's what you play for, said Strawberry. I don't think that I wa ever scared. It's something that I wanted deal head on. I talked Eric Davis chemo. He said it's not bad some people say. Although discovery cancer one lymph node proved that cancer had spread, Strawberry remained optimistic his future and said, It didn't worry me. I got all information doctor. One out 36 is good. It wasn't spreading. It didn't run and get crazy cancer can. When Strawberry wa released hospital wheelchair Friday, few hundred fan who had congregated chanted, Darryl, Darryl. Strawberry, who struggled not cry, hugged few nurse, thanked everyone supporting him, then rose wheelchair and carefully entered car. Wow, I never thought this day would come, Strawberry said. But it ha. Unlike David Wells, Saturday night's starter World Series who predicted Yankees would throttle Padres five game, Strawberry refused make prediction whether he will soon be getting his third World Series ring. But Strawberry, who is still hopeful returning play 1999, sounded very confident 1998 Yankees, who are wearing his number 39 back their cap inspiration. They look really good, said Strawberry. It's not going be easy, I think they're ready. The best thing making it World Series is you know you don't have go anywhere else that. You've made it that point and then you go do best you can do. That's what it's all about. As Bernie Williams start what could be his final series Yankees Game 1 World Series Yankee Stadium Saturday night, he want do it free mind. Free worrying his extremely uncertain future and undisclosed personal matter that ha made this post-season perplexing it ha been pleasing. But it is not easy keep mind uncluttered. Williams doe not know if he will sign Yankees and return center field next season, because he want test free agency. There is good chance Yankees will not offer him most lavish contract, so Williams might be forced decide fattest paycheck and new situation baseball city his choice or pretty fat paycheck and familiar situation Bronx. Scott Boras, Williams' agent, compared his client player $10 million-a-year bracket last season, so that price tag ha surely escalated Williams won American League batting title .339 average while drilling 26 homer and knocking 97 run. Williams wa asked if he agreed theory that other team will outbid Yankees. I do not know, said Williams, who ha been aloof this post-season, ha declined discus why. And I'm thinking this little more I would to. I would keep my focus series. It is not issue Williams or Yankees want study Saturday or coming day, because team is four victory away championship. Still, it is issue that hovers Yankees ominously owner George Steinbrenner hovers general manager Brian Cashman. It's tough thing, Cashman said balancing excitement being World Series reality trying re-sign Williams. You know ugliness future is right front you. Although Williams ha been adamant not discussing future, he relented slightly Friday. When reporter asked him what reason would be staying Yankees, Williams' answer included escape clause. Just fact that I've been here my whole career, Williams said. That ha lot do it. The relationship that I've come know year, I think it would be very hard, not impossible, start scratch somewhere else. Williams continued: But I think reality game this day and age is thing happen. You can't really write thing stone that they're going happen. People get traded. People become free agent and go other team. I have make decision really thinking all people I'm accountable for. When Williams wa asked what better situation could player have being center fielder Yankees, winning batting crown and being World Series, 30-year-old wa stumped. Wow, that's pretty good right there, Williams said. It's funny you mention that, because I really haven't thought any that. I think, some point season, I wa going sit and think, wow, it wasn't bad year all. While Cashman would not discus financial matter, another Yankee official said team will not offer Williams much $12 million year unless Steinbrenner get generous possible championship. It is more likely that Yanks would offer Williams $10 million-a-year range. I'd hate have speculate something this point, Cashman said. We'll give it our best effort sign him level that we're comfortable with. Hopefully, that will be enough. Then we'll have marriage. If not, we'll have divorce. While Williams ha earned right become free agent and pursue contract he want city he want, he ha interesting choice make. When reporter asked Williams how he would respond someone who suggested that he accept le Yankees remain city where he is popular, where he like his teammate and manager, and where team ha been post-season four straight year, he not hesitate answer. My response that would be it's not time right now start thinking that, Williams said. If I start thinking that, it'll distract me what I need do World Series. Williams then talked how Yankees are end remarkable season and how he not want his situation disrupt that. But, Williams' status uncertain, he wa asked if next four seven game would be bittersweet, he could be ending 13-year association Yankees. I don't want talk that, Williams said. I'm going have lot fun out there. I'm going go all out. Then Williams walked away interview. The New York Times said editorial Saturday, Oct. 17: It is fitting that this most memorable baseball season should conclude World Series that open Saturday night Yankee Stadium, aging still grand cathedral sport. Bedecked bunting and banner, revered ballpark always elevates game it aura history and accomplishment. That make it perfect venue part championship series that will determine whether 1998 Yankees are one greatest team modern era, or just talented squad that owned regular season folded World Series. New Yorkers are boisterous, boastful bunch, and patter city this week ha been loud and arrogant, or so it must seem anyone venturing here San Diego root Padres. The word sidewalk and subway is that Padres don't measure Yankees. Sure, they have lethal starting pitcher Kevin Brown and Andy Ashby, and one game's best closer Trevor Hoffman, not mention prolific hitter Tony Gwynn and Greg Vaughn, who is hobbling still dangerous. But how is that match Yankees' World Series starting rotation David Wells, Orlando Hernandez, David Cone and Andy Pettitte, bullpen flamethrower Mariano Rivera, deepest batting order baseball? Yet truth is that Yankees fan are terrified team will crumple. Baseball fan, Yankee fan, can spend lifetime waiting see home team historic caliber, and this Yankee team will not reach that sanctified status unless it end it record-setting season winning World Series. The doubt keep creeping up. The team wa pitiful plate most playoff. Tino Martinez, top run producer, ha been numbing slump. Bernie Williams, American League batting champ, hit well pennant series Cleveland Indians, ha seemed distracted personal matter. Shane Spencer, rookie slugging sensation September, hasn't turned out be new Mr. October. Pettitte ha been struggling August. The curious thing this team, which won more game regular season any team American League history, is how quiet and unobtrusive it can be. It sport no dominant superstar, no swaggering clubhouse leader, no one who seems belong New York. So when Yankees start drift field, fan tend fear team might simply fade away. Until Indians surged temporarily ahead playoff, Yankees had faced no serious test resiliency all season. New Yorkers can already taste that ticker-tape parade Broadway. But every mighty cheer stadium Saturday night will lurk fear that when curtain fall season, unheralded and unlegendary team San Diego will be one that is remembered. The last time they were seen field Yankee Stadium, they were inadvertently influencing outcome game that sent Cleveland Indians home and Yankees World Series. That's not say umpire will mess World Series, they have shown they are eminently capable interfering natural progression postseason game. All right, so Ted Hendry won't be World Series; umpires' collective bargaining agreement league doe not allow umpire work league championship series and World Series. Joe Brinkman won't be here either, though agreement doe allow umpire work division series and World Series. The three American League umpire who are six-man World Series crew work first playoff. One them, Richie Garcia, will be crew chief and plate Saturday night's opener Yankee Stadium. Gene Budig, AL president, Friday called Garcia, 24-year veteran, one league's most respected umpire. But Saturday night, Garcia will move right field Sunday night Game 2. Now why doe that combination sound familiar, Richie Garcia and right field? Ah yes, last time Garcia worked post-season series Yankee Stadium, he wa umpire Game 1 league championship series two year ago when young fan New Jersey no name, please; he ha been over-glorified enough reached fence and caught Derek Jeter's fly ball just Tony Tarasco, Baltimore's right fielder, prepared catch it. Garcia ruled no interference, that it wa home run, then said oops watching television replay clearly showing interference. Too late. The call helped Yankees win first game and set tone series. Even though he made mistake, you know you have best out there, baseball official, speaking condition anonymity, said. That knowledge come small consolation Orioles. Budig, too, acknowledged that umpire, player and manager, aren't perfect. Major league umpire are skilled what they do, they are human, he said telephone interview. Day and day out they do very good job Major League Baseball. Rounds one and two have been difficult, that happens time time. The umpire were so human American League playoff that it happened time time time time. The Cleveland Indians suffered brunt fallibility umpire. We had highlight reel umpire getting knocked baseball, general manager John Hart said Indians' final game Yankees. The umpire didn't lose game u, we had our share controversy two playoff series umpire. In division series Boston, Brinkman, plate umpire, wa so bad his call pitch and play plate that he immediately provoked dispute that led his ejecting Mike Hargrove, Indians' manager, three pitch Game 2, and Dwight Gooden, their starting pitcher, 19 pitch later. Hendry wa right or wrong, depending one's point view, his noncall interference Travis Fryman 12th inning Game 2 ALCS. That ruling went favor Indians. Little else did. In Game 4, Jeter wa stealing second fifth inning when on-target throw Sandy Alomar Jr. hit Jim McKean, who jumped try get out way instead kicked ball right field. A batted ball, Omar Vizquel's line drive, struck Hendry Game 6. But worst call Game 6 wa Hendry's force play second base. Hendry called Bernie Williams safe, ruling that Vizquel's foot came base he caught ball. Members Yankees indicated Friday that they, too, thought call wa wrong. I don't know, Williams said when asked what he thought, I'll take it. It wa big play. But he think he wa out? I'd rather not comment that, he said. It will stir lot controversy. I don't want get that. When player belief he wa safe, he say so and doesn't worry any subsequent controversy. If Williams wa implying that he thought he wa out, another member Yankees said he had no doubt that Williams wa out. I wasn't sure first, this uniformed member team said, when I saw it wa Hendry, I said uh-oh. I also thought Omar is so smooth you'd think he wouldn't come bag. Then I saw replay. He wa out. The game today is faster it used be, this observer said. The umpire have be sharper. Maybe Garcia, Dale Scott and Tim Tschida American League, and Jerry Crawford, Dana DeMuth and Mark Hirschbeck National League, will be sharp 18th century French guillotine these four seven game. Leonard Coleman, NL president, said he thought his umpire were first-rate division and league series and added that he ha three splendid umpire working World Series. Budig said: The World Series crew is proven and first-rate. We have total confidence them. The umpire should let player make error and manager bad decision. Then everyone will talk player and manager and not umpire. A strong sign that this city is going bonkers Padres came Friday morning when 680 fan agreed shave their head radio promotion raffle return 1-in-680 chance skybox ticket post-season play. This wa more show support team it wa one ticket, said Tommy Sablan, producer Jeff and Jer show. It wa symbolic effort bald Padres Tony Gwynn, Wally Joyner, Greg Vaughn, Jim Leyritz. About thousand people showed men, woman and child. We had 10 barber and 20 hairdresser and it took six hour line either get buzzed or straight-razored. We were shocked turnout. But this is bandwagon town. `Buy ticket day concert' type public. You'll see bigger bandwagon Monday when they've won and then hopefully we play Yankees and it's real World Series. After Padres beat Braves, 3-0, Game 2 National League Championship Series Thursday night Atlanta take two-game lead four-of-seven-game series, San Diego fan began gearing shot World Series more traditional way. It would be team's first World Series appearance 1984, and downtown business district Friday, marquee and banner read Go Padres and lunch-hour rally wa attended several hundred fan. The Padres set attendance record 2,555,901 this season, half-million last year and nearly million and half three year ago. It stemmed part effort John Moores, Padres owner, and Larry Lucchino, team's president, put family entertainment park they bought team December 1994. This is more diversified group fan I saw Atlanta, Lucchino said. Their crowd seemed yuppified. We're proud our three generation family who come game. Donna McMahon, 63-year-old homemaker La Jolla, ha been fan she wa 10 and Pacific Coast League Padres played Lane Field harbor. She would take streetcar school meet her father, and he would buy bleacher seat. Later, she brought her four child Jack Murphy Stadium National League Padres when 2,500 people wa crowd. Now, she brings her grandchild sold-out Qualcomm Stadium. There are different group stand, she said, upper class, middle class, business person, beer-drinking fan, child, all Mexican fan border. We are true fan all u. San Diego Mayor Susan Golding agrees, while also giving credit balmy weather. Padre fan are cross-section all county, she said. Downtown, suburban, rural, east, north, rancher and farmer high-tech engineer, yuppie new kid X generation. A lot border. The Padres are extremely popular Tijuana. We do have perfect weather long baseball season. Playing World Series October ha got be better New York. Carlos Carrion, who wa born San Diego and ha been baseball fan 25 year, brings his 10- and 8-year-old son stadium. This is great chance let my child see player work, Carrion said. They can look these guy and understand their character and their work ethic. The Padres ticket office estimate that average, more 15,000 fan 65,000-seat stadium are Latin Americans San Diego, Baja California or state Sonora. The Padres have first major league baseball souvenir store Tijuana. A new shipment bat arrived Tino Martinez Friday, and he massaged handle make sure they were thin enough, knocked barrel and listened certain sound and swung them slowly again and again. Martinez wa so excited fresh bat, he reacted Little Leaguer who wa wielding aluminum bat first time. You were saving World Series tree now, right? Martinez said representative bat company. These are World Series tree, aren't they? Martinez could joke bat being specially designed World Series because Yankees began their quest second title three year when they play host San Diego Padres Game 1 Yankee Stadium Saturday night. Major leaguer player who were watching television could not imitate David Letterman and joke World Series wood. Even though Martinez ha struggled numerous bat post-season, he could joke because Yankees are still alive title. Martinez is still alive. For now, Martinez, power hitter who ha mostly been missing action, could joke around. For now. You always get fresh start post-season because it's game game, said Martinez. If you win, you've got another game next day so you forget bad at-bat. It's easier do that post-season because your next at-bat could be biggest at-bat season. Normally, having Martinez plate biggest at-bat season would be pleasing sight Yankees. But not when calendar flip October. Martinez ha experienced another frustrating post-season. He is 5 30 10 strikeout, no homer and only 1 run batted hitting-starved team that ha batted .229 while still winning 7 9 post-season game because superior pitching. Can Yankees continue win if Martinez, their most valuable run producer, is sometime single hitter? We've just gotten two good series, said Paul O'Neill. The Yankees won those series. You don't focus one guy. You focus winning. The whole team won. As much Joe Torre talked Martinez needing one line-drive hit get him groove, 30-year-old first baseman is career drought post-season. Since joining Yankees, Martinez is 20 107 (.187) one homer and 4 RBI 29 post-season game. Those are puny statistic, especially player who ha driven 381 run 455 regular season game last three year. I would guess that Tino would have great series, O'Neill said. Baseball ha way evening thing out. You have bad series, you come back and have great series. In season, that's easier do. In post-season, it get tougher. It cannot get much tougher Martinez, who wa dropped fifth sixth order American League Championship Series Cleveland Indians and will remain that spot further notice. Martinez ha blamed his paucity production impatience and trying do too much. He ha sometimes flailed poor pitch hitter's count 3-1 and 2-0, instead working count, and he ha admitted that his previous failure post-season have caused him pursue obviously unattainable five-run homer. Actually, Martinez ha already made some alteration, and he ha reached base 7 time his last 10 plate appearance double, single, hit-by-pitch and 4 walk. It is not enough pacify George Steinbrenner, it is something him cling to. Until last night, anyway, when Martinez had face Kevin Brown, nasty right-hander who had retired him 30 34 career at-bat. If I wa getting good pitch and missing them, then I'd say I have bad swing working, said Martinez. But I've been swinging bad pitch. Right now, I've just got be patient and wait. The Yankees will wait him. They have to. In 1996 World Series, Torre started Cecil Fielder Martinez first Games 3, 4 and 5. It wa difficult decision because Martinez had paced team RBI while Fielder not join Yankees July 31. But Yankees grabbed all three game so it worked. Torre doe not have such attractive replacement this season Luis Sojo. So Yankees will stay Martinez, better or worse, while he try stay positive and finally produce. It's World Series, said Martinez. You got go out there and have fun it. Big game are all big game. You want go out there and enjoy that game and try do your best win that game. You don't think that you might lose that day. Chuck Knoblauch and Tino Martinez were popular squeegee men week ago, speculation rampant that one or other or might be exiled if Yankees' historic year crumbled post-season. Two big hit midst big inning changed all that Saturday night Game 1 World Series. The Yankees trailed San Diego, 5-2, seventh inning, Knoblauch hit three-run home run tie score, and five batter later, Martinez smashed grand slam. The seven-run explosion rocketed Yankees 9-6 victory opener four-of-seven-game series, 56,712 Yankee Stadium. Orlando Hernandez will pitch Andy Ashby Game 2 Sunday night Stadium. Beyond seizing advantage series, Yankees were able neutralize Padres' ace, Kevin Brown, driving him mound seventh. Brown, seen many San Diego's best hope World Series upset, will not pitch again Game 4, earliest. Brown wa pitching three-run lead top fifth, when Tony Gwynn and Greg Vaughn banged back-to-back homer. One out seventh, however, Jorge Posada hit single, and Brown walked Ricky Ledee. Brown, who had thrown whopping 64 pitch first three inning, went out, and reliever Donne Wall came face Knoblauch. This is what Yankees have done all season, force starter game middle inning, exploiting middle reliever. Knoblauch, course, had earned notoriety his gaffe Game 2 American League Championship Series Cleveland, standing and waiting interference call ball rolled stop him and decisive run scored. The Yankees came back win series, however; Knoblauch got reprieve and talked how much experience had helped him. Facing Wall one-ball, no-strike count, Knoblauch had duck runaway fastball. Two ball, no strike. Wall had throw strike, Knoblauch swung hard and lifted high fly left-field line. Off bat, it not look much. But it kept carrying, Vaughn drifting back left and looking up, see ball disappear stand. Tie game. Yankee Stadium shook. Knoblauch rounded base, crossed home plate and thrust arm air, yelling crowd, hyped Olympic weightlifter who had just successfully hoisted half-ton. He stomped dugout, his helmet on, teammate banging him happily. When Derek Jeter singled, nobody really noticed. Wall left game, and Mark Langston took over. Paul O'Neill flied out, and Jeter advanced wild pitch, Bernie Williams wa intentionally walked. Chili Davis drew walk. Bases loaded, once more, Martinez coming plate, exactly one run batted in his first 76 career at-bat league championship and World Series game. With count two ball and two strike, Langston threw pitch corner that he thought should have been strike. Instead, Garcia called it ball. Langston glared, snapping return throw. Langston and Martinez and everyone field now understood that base loaded and 3-2 count, Langston would have throw what player refer cookie tasty pitch middle. Martinez ate this cookie. The ball soared upper deck right field, lifting three year post-season misery back Yankees' first baseman, grand slam. The crowd called out Martinez dugout again. Like Knoblauch, Martinez pumped arm, and later crowd would chant his name, and Martinez would wave his cap. San Diego's lead wa long gone. The Yankees had taken 2-0 lead Brown second inning, forcing him throw 32 pitch second. They loaded base single and two walk, and Ledee, rookie left fielder who is playing because none Torre's left fielder have been hitting, pulled sinking fastball right field line two out. The fan foul line stood, some waving push ball fair body English, and ball landed line, skipping wall two runner scored. The Yankees had early edge, they had jumped Brown, and they had their best pitcher mound. San Diego's Chris Gomez led second inning blooper shortstop, ball falling single. Quilvio Veras flied right, Gwynn grounded out and Gomez took second, bringing Vaughn plate. David Wells got ahead count, no ball and two strike, change-up and fastball, trying run fastball Vaughn, who hit 50 home run regular season. Vaughn attacked pitch: line drive that landed second deck, foul all way, frightening mistake. Jorge Posada, Yankees' catcher, jogged mound re-think strategy, perhaps remind Wells conventional wisdom: you must pitch Vaughn outer edge plate. Posada returned plate, called fastball, Wells threw. Vaughn's swing wa short and quick, ball making click sound bat, well-struck golf ball, carrying wall right-center field. Tie game. Wells retired first two batter fifth inning, jamming Veras fastball. Veras' bat snapped contact, it wa enough send looper short center field, single. Gwynn stepped in, having hit single his first two at-bat, and looked sign third base coach Tim Flannery. With runner first, he like try pull ball right side infield. Wells fired fastball, Gwynn turned pitch and ripped it, line drive that crashed facing upper deck right field. The Padres jumped dugout, celebrating, Wells turned away, disgusted, asking new baseball. He got one, delivered another fastball, and Vaughn slugged this deep left field stand. Two pitch, two home run, first back-to-back home run allowed Wells April 30. San Diego led, 5-2, and Yankee Stadium wa silent. It would not stay that way. The moment truth Chuck Knoblauch came bottom first inning when his name wa announced Yankee Stadium first time he neglected chase that memorable loose ball last Wednesday. There were no boo. It wa very warm ovation. They liked him. They really liked him. Knoblauch exhaled. Knoblauch had emphasized game that he wa concerned winning and rumbling World Series, not fan. But it surely made Knoblauch feel home when he realized that fan had forgiven him. Victories, more time, had healed malice Knoblauch and he could play second base earplug. When Yankees defeated Indians, 9-5, Game 6 Tuesday night advance their second World Series three year, Knoblauch wa easily most relieved player field. The awful mistake that he had made Game 2 would be forgotten. The Yankees had won pennant, and Knoblauch wa celebrating much anyone. To have them act that me wa tremendous, said Knoblauch, response that he received. It wa great feeling, and it really helped me out. Knoblauch wa wearing cap that declared Yankees champion American League 1998; Champagne dripped brim he spoke. He not look up, continued talk how he had learned lot being vilified making mistake that Little Leaguers are expected not make. Just face thing and take it man and answer all question, although they're tough, Knoblauch said. You see what you're made when you have bounce back something that. That's basically what I learned. If Yankees had lost ALCS, some Knoblauch's teammate had said that he would be branded villain failing pursue ball that glanced Travis Fryman's back while he wa running baseline. Knoblauch had argued umpire while go ahead run scored first and Indians won, 4-1. Now Knoblauch can watch television and read newspaper again getting queasy. That's huge him, David Cone said. That's huge me. I let them back game, and that would have been tough one if they would have come back and beat u. And Knobbie, I'm sure he's feeling lot better now. Knoblauch, who had two hit five at-bat, wa working his second bottle Champagne five minute reporter were allowed clubhouse. He flashed sort smile that he had not shown too much recently and, now that Yankees are World Series, Knoblauch should expect be teased his mistake. Maybe if we go all way, we'll do that, Derek Jeter said. I don't know what I'll say, I'll think something good. YANKEES Pitching The starting pitching enabled Yankees advance Cleveland American League Championship Series. David Wells is 7-1 his career postseason and he should have additional edge Padres' lineup that is generally le effective left-handed pitching. Orlando Hernandez ha four terrific pitch, pitched seven shutout inning pivotal Game 4 ALCS and earned start Game 2 this series. David Cone should benefit six days' worth rest when he start Game 3, well being able pitch warm Southern California. Mariano Rivera's stuff might be good it ha been all year, and Mike Stanton continues be dominant postseason pitcher. Reasons concern: erratic Andy Pettitte, who need home-plate umpire call strike pitch low and away, and Jeff Nelson, who lost his command his last brief outing. Offense There were sign ALCS that offense is coming out it collective slump Chuck Knoblauch is getting base consistently, Derek Jeter is back driving ball right field and middle, Bernie Williams had three hit Game 6, and Scott Brosius ha been consistent force bottom lineup. But Yankees do have holes: Chili Davis will be hard-pressed catch fastball Kevin Brown and Andy Ashby, and Tino Martinez's postseason funk is problem. The Yankees could use contribution Jorge Posada, who will start Games 1 and 2 and may get chance drive pitch low strike zone, where he can hit power. Defense The Yankees have best defense baseball, excellent middle Jeter and Knoblauch, and third Brosius. Nobody's really taken advantage fact that Williams ha poor arm center field, rest assured that Ken Caminiti, Steve Finley and Greg Vaughn will try. The Indians expose fact that Yankees' pitcher have trouble preventing baserunners stealing second third base. Baserunning The Yankees run well they take extra base, particularly Paul O'Neill, Brosius, Jeter and Knoblauch going first-to-third; Williams can make mistake. The Yankees probably won't be able steal Kevin Brown, who ha effective slide step, they could be aggressive Andy Ashby, or combination Sterling Hitchcock and Jim Leyritz. PADRES Hitting Except Jim Leyritz, no one San Diego lineup is particularly hot or particularly frightening moment. Tony Gwynn hasn't been consistent he is, Ken Caminiti and Greg Vaughn have been streaky. But Padres are veteran team capable putting ball play, getting runner base and then moving them along, and so long they are getting exceptional pitching, that's all they really need. Quilvio Veras, leadoff hitter, is adept drawing walk and Steve Finley, who ha become more pull conscious last two year, could try take aim right field stand Yankee Stadium. Vaughn's power could be factor if Yankees' pitcher don't jam him enough keep him leaning plate. Pitching Kevin Brown is best pitcher this series, capable winning three game if necessary, should Padres manager Bruce Bochy choose start him Games 1, 4 and 7. But some point, San Diego will need big outing either Andy Ashby or Sterling Hitchcock. When Ashby's right, he's hitting corner his sinking fastball and his slider, and when his command is suspect, he get pounded. Hitchcock used his split-fingered fastball great effectiveness right-handed batter first two round playoff, Yankees' left-handed hitter may cause him some concern. San Diego's middle relief is weakest aspect team, Randy Myers and Mark Langston left side (the stuff each ha waned). But if lead can be delivered hand closer Trevor Hoffman, he'll keep it. Defense They mostly catch ball and avoid mistake, though they are unspectacular. Shortstop Chris Gomez and second baseman Veras are adept turning double play, and Caminiti won Gold Glove third base last year; Wally Joyner ha good hand first; center fielder Steve Finley is extremely quick tracking base hit and returning ball infield. Tony Gwynn's range is better right field line, not nearly good ball hit gap. The Yankees will be able run arm Vaughn left field. Baserunning Veras can steal base (24) this year, and Finley can tight spot, well. In general, however, Padres are slow, plodding team, though Caminiti and Vaughn are good going first-to-third, and Gwynn won't make mistake base. PITCHING TO THE PADRES Quilvio Veras: A switch-hitter who ha more power right-handed; should try pitch him down-and-in breaking ball when he's hitting right-handed, jam him fastball when he's batting left-handed. Steve Finley: A left-handed hitter who like pull ball. Left-handers David Wells can beat him breaking ball low and outside. Tony Gwynn: When he's hot, he's impossible. When he's not hitting well, he can be anxious early count, and he should be fed breaking ball out strike zone. Greg Vaughn: Big-time power anything high and plate. Because he like pull ball, you must pitch him outer edge, occasionally jamming him keep him honest. Ken Caminiti: More power right-handed, better hitter left-handed. These day, he's good lowball hitter and can be beat fastball zone. Wally Joyner: With runner base, he'll try jump fastball early count. Is not strong hitter and can be jammed. Chris Gomez: Like Derek Jeter, like hit pitch out, right field and middle. He can hit power if you make mistake breaking ball. Ruben Rivera: An impatient hitter who will chase pitch out strike zone. Carlos Hernandez: Looks first-pitch fastball upper half strike zone. Can struggle breaking ball. Jim Leyritz: No apparent hole right now, can hit fastball and away. Best bet is get ahead count and try get him chase breaking ball. PITCHING TO THE YANKEES Chuck Knoblauch: Hard thrower jam him fastball because he stand top plate, which is why he get hit so often. Derek Jeter: Sometimes he ha tendency chase pitch his foot, if you don't get ball far enough, he can hammer ball wall right. Paul O'Neill: The Yankees' best pure hitter, he sometimes will chase fastball and away, particularly there is one strike. Bernie Williams: A switch-hitter who ha trouble resisting chest-high fastball. When he lay them, he is much better hitter, and he this last game Cleveland series. Chili Davis: Has great eye and will work pitcher deep count, he can be overpowered fastball his belt. Cheats some now get his bat started, making him vulnerable off-speed pitch. Tino Martinez: Nothing seems right moment. Is anxious and chase pitch out strike zone when he fall count, and isn't taking advantage mistake when they're made. Scott Brosius: A great breaking ball hitter, he can also drive fastball long way when he anticipates, Cleveland's Charles Nagy now know. Jorge Posada: When batting left-handed, he fare very poorly splitter, curveballs and slider. Ricky Ledee: Like all young hitter, he ha tendency expand strike zone and chase pitch out strike zone falling count. Kevin Brown likely will attack him aggressively. SATURDAY'S PITCHERS Kevin Brown: Best sinking fastball game (91-93) mph, four-seam fastball 95-97 mph throw high strike zone, slider that break and away right-handed batter, and forkball that dive 88-89 mph. Holds runner well. David Wells: Aggressive, aggressive, aggressive, challenging hitter fastball. His curveball can be exceptional, and his changeup ha improved. Throw strikes: Allowed many home run (29) walk (29), ha not allowed three-run homer or grand slam all year. Talk high expectation. It's not just man Tampa who ha them anymore. Knowing their baseball well they do, everybody Joe Torre family passed ticket divisional series and league championship series just so much parsley plate life. The pressure wa get World Series, so I can see all those people, Torre, Yankees' manager, wa saying New York went out play here-we-are, let's-go-for-it San Diego Padres Stadium Saturday night. Now that Yankees are Series, their Florida-based owner and their fan and they themselves can see nothing more appropriate four more victory. Anything le 125 would feel emptiness. But why should Yankees be any different six team that already fell bus this World Series? The gloom and doom six other city will not compare letdown that would grip New York and owner's insatiable little heart should Yanks come short. The three-tiered playoff system ha practically turned baseball football, where survival-of-the-fittest mentality produce one exalted Super Bowl champion and league full chump and loser, condemned nether world Parcells-like demon kicking them their sore spot eternity. The World Series used be short and sweet reward excellence, that wa when there were eight team league, and winner met daylight early October. Even if Yankees clubbed my poor Brooklyn Dodgers submission once again, well, there wa always next year. But 1969, baseball began league championship series, and 1995 it began two-layered playoff system. The World Series is still different, which is why we should all resist babble post-season record flung u hyperactive computer and hyperactive broadcaster dozen different network that carry baseball. The World Series is still competition one league that encourages pitcher be athlete and another league relatively devoid strategy. Somehow playoff leave just everybody feeling inadequate. Think it. The Houston Astros are going feeling they cannot perform post-season. The Texas Rangers are sulking because they had best hitting league and could hardly touch Yankee pitching when it counted. In Chicago, glory winning special playoff wild-card spot and Sammy Sosa's 66 home run ha been pre-empted. The very city that beat Cubs 1969 eastern title held parade Sosa Saturday canyon where Lindbergh and John Glenn and 1969 Mets were once hailed. Speaking indignity, there are Red Sox, whose occasional qualification playoff is merely signal that nothing good can come it. In Atlanta, team '90s ha won exactly one World Series, and now it is management keep repeating that: The main goal is get Series. This is recorded announcement. This is recorded announcement. This is recorded announcement. In Cleveland, fan had live phrase Nineteen forty-eight! being chanted Indians Bronx Yankees put Indians out misery. That leaf Padres only team virtually nothing lose. This can be good, or it can be bad. Bruce Bochy, manager, reserve 1984 San Diego World Series team, ha said: A lot player that team said, looking back, we wish we would have had little different attitude instead just saying, `Hey, we are World Series.' And this year, I think you will see player out there playing win. Torre recalled being underdog 1996, he said his Yankees felt they could beat Braves. I am sure that is way Padres feel right now, that maybe other people aren't predicting lot them, I am sure they are themselves, Torre said. I think getting here is where pressure is, Torre added. You want win, getting World Series is so tough playing 162 game and getting post-season and then having fight, bite and scratch and everything else get here. Torre continued: You don't think spring training that we want go and win World Series. You want get World Series. Then you get there, well, you have played well enough and won enough game, then course, we want win. As far legitimizing our season I hate think negative term, if San Diego happens win World Series, sure it take little bit luster what we have accomplished getting here, I think that wa our goal, initially. The key word that sentence is initially. The Yankees built insatiable demand more victory and World Series ticket Torre family. While they're it, Yankees had better win whole thing. They are victim their excellence.

1031,"Top-level budget negotiator congressional Republicans and White House concluded another bargaining session late Sunday afternoon plan resume talk Monday morning and probably extend their midnight Monday deadline another day or two. Both side were amiable they emerged two-hour session, they had little report and indicated that their relatively early departure, compared last three night, should not be interpreted sign crisis or imminent peace budget talk. Sunday's discussion focused education and President Clinton's request $1.1 billion hire 100,000 teacher, aide said bargainer not delve much detail and nothing wa resolved. I think we made some real progress today, we still have significant difference area education, said Erskine Bowles, Clinton's chief staff and top negotiator, Sunday's meeting. We're going try plow that next two day. Asked how far apart two side were education, Rep. Dick Armey Texas, Republican majority leader, replied: I don't know. We're not together. He said two side had made some progress, not enough. The talk came another day escalated political confrontation congressional Democrats and Republicans, painfully aware that they have three week Election Day, tried take advantage static budget situation. Congress ha passed only six 13 required spending bill and are negotiating now White House final omnibus package that will contain remaining seven bill and major issue including how conduct census year 2000, how much money provide International Monetary Fund and what condition it should be provided, and how much emergency money provide item increased security US. embassy world and American farmer. Also be resolved are host issue that have little do financing and more do ideology, including environmental matter, contraception and national student testing. Republicans said president had been disengaged process, and they were irked what they said wa his swooping 11th hour and pushing his education agenda apparently successful portrayal himself guardian that popular topic. Democrats countered that Republican-led Congress had done nothing all year, and cast Republicans extremist blocking president's plea more money hire teacher and modernize school. In fact, Republican bargainer said Saturday night that they would provide money if local government, not Washington, could decide how money would be used. Armey wa one many who castigated president apparent disengagement, indirect reminder that Clinton ha been steeped sex scandal and is facing impeachment inquiry House. The scant number congressional Republicans who not leave town weekend used House floor press this same message. What president? asked Rep. Tom DeLay Texas, majority whip. Maybe Martha's Vineyard? Aspen? Camp David? Where is president? I bet American people don't know that he spent 152 day out 283 day this year fund raising, traveling and vacation. Republicans said that Clinton had participated 98 fund-raising event so far this year and that two event Monday New York, supporting Senate campaign Rep. Charles Schumer, would bring him 100. Clinton said White House that he wa prepared do it take reach resolution spending bill, and dispatched his aide Capitol Hill. He also said he would postpone Monday morning Monday afternoon his departure his fund-raising tour New York, and he canceled fund-raising appearance Florida. But high-level budget bargaining concluded Sunday afternoon, side agreed they would need extend their deadline midnight Monday, when temporary financing government expires third time Oct. 1 start fiscal year. Congressional Democrats struck back Republicans, saying they have held slack schedule themselves. Rep. George Miller, D-Calif., said Congress had been session only 108 day so far this year, unusually abbreviated period and one consumed more month drive hold impeachment hearing president. Most Americans, Miller said, had worked more 225 day. They say, `Where is president?' Miller said. The president ha been waiting budget. This is first Congress 1974 that ha no budget, he said, referring broad blueprint that is supposed guide spending. This is Congress that can't pas seven it appropriation bill, he said, largely because divisive split conservative and moderate Republicans. Struggling meet their fourth deadline federal budget, congressional Republicans and White House official wrestled Tuesday their difference education, most politically high-stakes element budget battle. Negotiators ended late-night session resolving disagreement not just education, census and contraceptive. These were biggest issue that still separated two side each tried formulate message take home voter Nov. 3 election. On education, issue that President Clinton ha propelled forefront and which Republicans do not want appear recalcitrant, side have agreed spend more $1 billion not how spend it. The president insists that money be spent hire 100,000 teacher country so that average class can be reduced 18 student. Republicans, railing Beltway bureaucrat, say that local school district should decide how money is spent, whether it be teacher or computer. As two side broke Tuesday night, White House chief staff Erskine Bowles, president's top negotiator, emerged session saying: We don't have deal. We made some good progress. The biggest issue, still, is 100,000 teacher. He added: There are still some open issue which no agreement ha been reached, he sounded optimistic session scheduled Wednesday morning. I think we've got chance wrapping tomorrow, he said. The two side remained apart several ideological matter, including whether allow federal health plan cover contraceptive and whether allow those few plan religious affiliation refuse cover contraceptive not only religious ground moral ground well. They were also split how conduct census 2000, which is one thorniest issue. It is not one that move voter, it is vital party because it help determine their relative strength Congress. House Speaker Newt Gingrich and Bowles met much day speaker's office, shuttling and out ante-rooms their lieutenant giving few clue nitty-gritty detail their talk. They have given themselves another deadline midnight Wednesday wrap $500 billion worth spending item, they could easily extend that deadline another day or two. They missed having spending bill place Oct. 1 start fiscal year, providing temporary financing federal government Oct. 9, then Oct. 12, then Wednesday. Some other central issue, financing International Monetary Fund, were all nailed down, neither side wa ready declare final deal all other element budget package were place. We're splitting infinitive, House Majority Leader Dick Armey said approving money IMF. As they worked several issue, Republican leader appeared be calculating difference their party that might sour final deal when it arrives House floor more concern Senate floor because Senate ha fewer difference it Republicans and White House. Some conservative Republicans said they were concerned emerging shape final package, particularly element dealing family planning and emergency spending. They say president's proposal emergency spending, such item peacekeeping mission Bosnia, fixing year 2000 computer bug and providing relief American farmer, will break limit last year's balanced-budget agreement. The administration said such money would come corresponding cut elsewhere budget, conservative say it come raiding surplus. If Republican leader cannot count their conservative, they will need support Democrats pas final package. And Democrats Tuesday expressed concern some White House position, issue census and apparent compromise Republicans aid farmer. Rep. David McIntosh, R-Ind., leader House conservative, said he believed Republican leader were ceding too quickly White House. He said that president appeared be getting his way some issue that what he really seemed be winning wa war public relation. The president is getting what he wants; he's controlling situation, McIntosh lamented. When Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott appears television, McIntosh said, it's reaction president. Nonetheless, McIntosh suggested that he could vote final accord. Most conservative are holding out better deal we're hearing, he said, we'll probably give them vote because we don't see much better alternative happening if it go down. Others were distressed, particularly two contraceptive issue. One would require federal health plan cover contraceptive. The other would bar overseas family-planning organization lobbying change abortion law other country. Rep. Tom Coburn, R-Okla., said he wanted see final language health plan measure. As it passed House and Senate, it allowed health plan religious affiliation decline offer contraceptive coverage; Coburn want plan be able refuse such coverage moral ground well. The plan cover five specific type contraception. Coburn said he wanted two those Depo-Provera and intrauterine device be eliminated coverage because he said they interfered fertilization and were therefore considered cause abortion. Democrats Rep. Nita Lowey, D-N.Y., who introduced contraceptive plan House, said she strongly objected Coburn's position. She said that health plan based their decision what offer profit, not moral. The question is whether White House will insist keeping contraceptive coverage final package and will oppose moral exception. If administration allows moral exception, it could alienate some House Democrats. House Democrats are also worried direction talk are taking census. This ha always loomed one biggest issue separating Democrats and Republicans. The result census help determine future power two political party. But fact that two side are finally talking it now indicates that they are covering full range budget matter that need be resolved. The White House ha proposed buying time matter financing Commerce, State and Justice department only five month. The Commerce Department contains Census Bureau. White House official said this would put nettlesome issue while allowing resolution entire spending package, House Democrats worry it would be prelude giving Republicans road. Republican leader idea postponing decision say that financing should be restricted only Census Bureau. On several touchy environmental issue that have prompted repeated veto threat White House, two side appeared be opting compromise confrontation, several dispute resolved. But few particularly difficult issue remained negotiation. A compromise wa struck White House and Alaskan lawmaker logging Tongass National Forest. But compromise still eluded them question building road wilderness refuge connect two community Alaska. A sticking point White House and congressional budget negotiator ha been issue how 2000 census will be conducted, and White House is finding itself negotiating issue much House Democrats it is House Republican leader. On Monday, White House negotiator, led chief staff Erskine Bowles, tried determine whether Democrats would accept deal finance six month department State, Justice and Commerce, which oversees Census Bureau. The deal would put next March contentious issue whether next census would use statistical sampling supplement traditional method counting people. Bowles told group Democrats that House Republicans were willing give number outstanding issue that were stalling final agreement budget, that they were digging their heel when it came financing census six month. The Democrats met office Minority Leader Dick Gephardt. The rationale half-year financing is that next March Supreme Court is expected rule whether using sampling is legal or constitutional. The Supreme Court ha already agreed review two lower court ruling that said sampling would violate federal law. Oral argument case are set November. But House Democrats balked idea six months' financing census, arguing that if Supreme Court allowed sampling, Republicans would be no obligation approve money census that included sampling. The general feeling many Democrats wa that if we won case, there would be lot le leverage March, especially if it wa only issue left be debated, said House Democratic official who insisted anonymity. Democrats contend that now is time press Republicans, while they want complete work budget and go home campaign. Rep. Lucille Roybal-Allard, D-Calif., who attended meeting Monday, said, It wa, sort of, this is where we are. We've been able accomplish great thing, what do you think? We made it very clear that unless census wa included, some other issue, school construction, deal wouldn't be acceptable. Statistical sampling would allow Census Bureau estimate population that are difficult count, and would have largest effect counting African-Americans city and black and Hispanics rural area, group that are traditionally undercounted standard mean. Republicans fear, and Democrats hope, that method would raise count people living traditionally Democratic area, giving party advantage when new boundary election district are drawn 2000 census. At Monday's meeting, Democrats reminded administration official that Clinton had promised that he would veto any legislation that restricted Census Bureau's ability conduct accurate census. I can't think any way that restricts census more not fully fund it, said Rep. Carolyn Maloney, D-NY. The willingness House Democrats, including Gephardt, press president issue represents realization their leverage Clinton, who will need all their support coming impeachment inquiry. Gephardt is major player now, and irony is we helped make him that, said Rep. Christopher Shays, R-Conn., who support use sampling census. The Democrats' position also indicates how little trust many have White House this issue. The proposal finance department Commerce, Justice and State six month is similar one reached last November Bowles and House Speaker Newt Gingrich. The idea then wa that holding all three department hostage census fight would place maximum pressure all side work out their difference sampling. But House Democrats were not consulted that agreement wa struck and later grumbled it. At meeting Democratic caucus Tuesday, Ms. Maloney briefed lawmaker dealing White House and declared that Clinton had promised that he would hold firm census and that she believed him, participant said. The statement wa greeted laughter. There is certain level suspicion because there have been time when we have been cut out,said House Democratic official. But I have say, there hasn't been much evidence that, this time. Struggling meet their fourth deadline federal budget, congressional Republicans and White House official wrestled Tuesday their difference education, most politically high-stakes element budget battle. Negotiators ended late-night session resolving disagreement not just education, census and contraceptive.

But few particularly difficult issue remained negotiation. A compromise wa struck White House and Alaskan lawmaker logging Tongass National Forest. But compromise still eluded them question building road wilderness refuge connect two community Alaska. House and Senate negotiator agreed Thursday require most federal health plan cover prescription contraceptive woman, giving unusual victory Capitol Hill advocate abortion right. But future measure wa doubt because it wa attached spending bill that includes controversial provision Federal Election Commission. That provision could scuttle spending bill, which would finance Treasury Department and Postal Service and which still must be approved House and Senate. The contraceptive measure would require federal health plan, which affect 1.2 million female federal employee who are child-bearing age, cover five method contraception that have been approved Food and Drug Administration use this country birth control pill, diaphragm, inter-uterine device, Norplant and Depo-Provera. Currently, only 19 percent federal health plan cover those method. The House and Senate approved contraceptive measure earlier this year. But opponent abortion were furious approval and persuaded Republican leader have negotiator reopen discussion matter. The cost contraceptive ha driven out-of-pocket cost health care woman. And many male member Congress seemed persuaded support coverage contraceptive woman, almost all 285 federal health plan cover Viagra, male impotency drug. Thursday, pressure building resolve spending bill Oct. 9, when temporary financing government expires, negotiator agreed include contraceptive measure their conference report $13.4 billion bill Treasury Department and Postal service. Rep. Nita Lowey, D-N.Y., who pushed contraceptive measure House, hailed Thursday's agreement first major accomplishment abortion right advocate Republicans took control Congress 1994. She said negotiator had agreed include measure because election year they not want be perceived opposing contraception or be seen rejecting measure that had passed House and Senate. But many Democrats said were upset that bill contains provision that is seen interfering independence Federal Election Commission. That provision would require four-vote majority seven federal election commissioner every four year retain general counsel and staff director. The provision is aimed getting rid Lawrence Noble, current general counsel, who ha investigated campaign finance practice group Christian Coalition. The contraceptive measure is one four related matter that have helped stall four spending bill. The three other bill that are stalled part because abortion-related matter include agriculture bill, which there is dispute whether federal Food and Drug Administration should use taxpayer money approve drug RU-486, which induce abortion. The foreign operation bill is also stalled whether finance international family planning program that may also promote abortion, while labor and health bill is delayed because provision that would block access minor contraception. Addressing measure insurance coverage contraceptive, Helen Alvarez, spokeswoman National Conference Catholic Bishops, said that bill wa bad policy. She said contraception had failed stem number abortion, teen-age pregnancy or out-of-wedlock birth. Public-relations-wise, it's good tactic them, she conceded, term social policy, this is failure. For first time decade, Congress and White House negotiated tax and spending legislation this year budget surplus. The result wa chaos. The lawmaker were never able agree budget resolution framework which all tax and spending bill are supposed fit. This had not happened congressional budget procedure were established 1974. Then, discipline such overall plan, Senate and House could not pas eight 13 spending bill needed keep government running. So lawmaker had stay session more week longer they had hoped. Finally, they lumped all eight bill together this week and announced agreement. But only way they could get this far wa resort gimmick. One wa designate $20 billion emergency expenditure so that program not have be cut elsewhere offset new spending. This will use more one-quarter anticipated budget surplus current fiscal year. Another gimmick extended tax break Individual Retirement Accounts couple income $100,000 $150,000. This will actually raise small amount revenue next five year period covered budget accounting it will make picture considerably worse later year. As hard it wa negotiate budget bad old day budget deficit, say politician involved, it wa exponentially more difficult this year. At least year past, there wa common goal. As much they disagreed policy and principle, they were all aiming reduction deficit. This year, some member Congress wanted use surplus big tax cut. Others wanted pay national debt. Others wanted spend part it medical research, school and weapon Pentagon. Others wanted spend large sum highway. Still wanted continue cutting government spending. And that wa just Republicans. The Democrats had their idea budget, and President Clinton laid his marker saving surplus way wa found shore Social Security system. In budget term, said Robert Reischauer, former director congressional budget office, this is end Cold War. There are other difference well way thing were negotiated budget surplus. In 1990, 1993 and 1995, when politician staked their career striking budget deal lower deficit, fundamental question wa how divide bitter medicine more tax and le spending. Republicans, most part, opposed tax increase and favored cutting spending social program. Democrats wanted raise tax, especially rich, and protect social spending. In end, balance were carefully drawn. But plenty politician President George Bush, name one lost their job process. This year, Democrats and Republicans alike claiming victory, burning issue wa how parcel out candy. Democrats got more money education and farm assistance. Republicans got more money military and extension popular tax break business. Some $20 billion that will eat surplus really will go emergency, relief victim Hurricane Georges. But much money, $90 million that will pay six new helicopter national police Colombia use drug interdiction, wa designated emergency spending simply because there wa no other way get it budget. For politician, new way is more fun. It is hard imagine that anyone will be voted out office because this year's budget. But that not make it easier reach agreement. The other big difference is that principal fight this year were not money all. They involved delicate policy issue needle exchange, contraception, global warming, immigration and census. In Congress, there is no consensus these matter. So only way policy could be set wa wrap them giant spending bill. It may be more pleasant debate policy money. But it is probably harder find way split difference. As long surplus last, lack discipline that characterized budget-writing this year is likely continue. This is distressing those devoted controlling government spending. The temptation, said L. Ari Fleischer, spokesman House Ways and Means Committee, is grab loot and spend it. Some conservative sounded note discord Friday federal spending agreement, they also said they would probably vote $500 billion package because it boosted defense spending and provided aid farmer. However, no one can vote package just yet, because it is not finished. The deal that President Clinton and Republican leader hailed Thursday wa broad outline area agreement final portion $1.7 trillion budget, not written document. That is now being crafted chairman spending committee and their aide, who said Friday that there were still dispute that needed be resolved and that final document could run more 3,000 page. For example, still unresolved is dispute whether airline can create peanut-free zone protect passenger who are allergic peanut. House Speaker Newt Gingrich and other member Georgia, major peanut-producing state, are fighting proposal, which would force airline ban peanut three row someone allergy. Congress gave itself midnight Tuesday vote final bill, agreeing President Clinton fifth extension temporary financing keep government open. The budget wa due Oct. 1, start new fiscal year. The vote wa initially expected Friday, bill is nowhere being written. Only handful top-level bargainer including Gingrich, Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott and White House chief staff Erskine Bowles were room final deal. Excluded were committee chairman and head appropriation committee, who now must write language that will put deal law. Almost everyone Capitol Hill expects budget pas eventually, biggest defection coming conservative who object $20 billion taken surplus address so-called emergency and package's failure offer voter serious tax cut. The lag time bill is officially closed is making some conservative nervous that more member will try add provision that will further expand bill they already consider overly bloated. And some worry that once hometown pork that is stuffed bill is publicly revealed, voter could put pressure member not support it. The election are Nov. 3. But several conservative said that these problem, they expected support bill anyway. Rep. Mark Souder, R-Ind., said: `Most my friend, who are predominantly activist conservative, are split 50-50. If tax cut were your primary thing, then you're unhappy, many conservative have mixed agenda. My position is, hold nose and vote yes. We have no tax cut and far too much spending that I oppose, that's nature compromise. Every member ha little different focus. Souder said he liked extra money defense spending, and he liked price support farmer. Hog farmer his district, whose biggest customer were Japan and China, had been hit hard collapse Asian market. Several Republicans said that bill seemed skewed favor Democrats. They cited two reasons: Clinton needed curry favor Democrats shore support if House vote impeach him, and Republican leader feared that if they had stood Clinton, they might have forced government shutdown and Republicans would be blamed. Clinton wa buying vote, said Rep. David Hobson, R-Ohio. He wa sucking liberal Democrats so they would support him impeachment. Rep. WJ. (Billy) Tauzin, R-La., said leader seemed motivated desire avoid political damage they incurred partial government shutdown 1995 and 1996. He also cited president's need placate left adding costly domestic program. The combination lesson learned three year ago and scandal president's side yielded inevitable result, budget that lean way left, Tauzin said. Still, he said he would probably support bill. It won't be enthusiastically, he said. It won't be holding my nose either. I would have preferred spend more this money tax cut. I think we would have gotten tax cut, scandal. If president had not been caught scandal, he probably would have followed Dick Morris strategy and moved center. Gingrich said he recognized that some conservative were wary agreement. But he sought reassure them that package served their interest. He cited $9 billion increase defense spending. And he noted that Republicans had blocked several item, including needle-exchange program District Columbia, national education testing and US. contribution United Nations program that pay family planning China, which many Congress object because China ha policy coercing abortion and forcing sterilization. Gingrich said agreement wa best that could be achieved when you have conservative Republican Congress and liberal Democratic president. Some conservative who had been especially critical were more understanding Thursday. Rep. David McIntosh, R-Ind., leader conservative House, had denounced bill earlier Great Society type big-spending program. Friday, meeting Republicans, he said, Our leadership found themselves bad situation and good job. A few remained outright hostile bill, much hasty way which it wa cobbled together what it contained. Rep. Joe Barton, R-Texas, said: `I'm voting `no' unless something revolutionary happens now and Tuesday. I think it's process that give president ability stonewall very end and then hold u ransom. The Republican leadership House and Senate good job limiting highway robbery, it's still gone too far spending cap. Also angry rushed endgame wa Rep. Gene Taylor, D-Miss., who took House floor and said he could not support final bill. I'm going urge my colleague vote `no,' Taylor said. We have stayed here this long. We can stay little bit longer. And I am going encourage my colleague continue vote no we are given adequate time study measure that is brought u. Voting mainly party line question that ha become touchstone debate development and preservation wilderness, Senate Thursday approved gravel road remote wildlife habitat Alaska. The road, barely 30 mile long, would slice edge wildlife refuge and wilderness area Aleutian Peninsula, where it would connect isolated village called King Cove long-range air strip town Cold Bay. Without road, it backer say, 700 resident King Cove must continue use unreliable air and boat service emergency, risking dangerous wind and sea they seek medical evacuation Anchorage. Opponents road call project unjustifiable precedent that threatens seasonal breeding ground protected migratory bird, and they say that improved air or sea service would be better alternative. The vote Thursday, 59-38, wa victory state's congressional delegation. But President Clinton likely veto measure, final outcome may depend whether it sponsor can insert road proposal huge spending bill that is likely emerge just Congress head home Nov. 3 election. Three Republicans voted bill, and six Democrats voted it. The Clinton administration ha repeatedly warned that it will veto big spending bill if it contains array anti-environmental provision that are consideration. Indeed, White House seems be itching partisan fight environmental priority. But while many Republicans Congress still appear reluctant engage that broad fight, they were willing Thursday cast their lot Senate's two powerful Alaskans, Ted Stevens and Frank Murkowski, Republicans. A companion bill House, sponsored Rep. Don Young Alaska, also Republican, ha not come floor. Even Sen. John Chafee Rhode Island, leader Republican environmentalist, voted road. Last February Chafee's staff had assembled score environmental lobbyist his office plan strategy opposing road, environmental advocate said Thursday. They speculated that senator had changed his position out deference power Stevens, who chairman Appropriations Committee exerts tremendous influence time when dozen spending bill are their final stage. A Chafee aide said Chafee voted reluctantly road Alaska's senator convinced him it merit. Stevens said angry tone Thursday that two-thirds Alaska's land wa limit development and that vital health service were being denied his state's resident. We can't use it permission some bureaucrat who is compelled extreme environmentalist, he said. They are so extreme that they say this 330,000-acre Izembek refuge, smallest wilderness Alaska, is so sacrosanct that it can't move it border 60 foot. But Sen. Dale Bumpers, D-Ark., called road project dangerous precedent. Building road wilderness Alaska, no matter how short or how long, would be first time nation we have voted deliberately authorize road wilderness area, Bumpers said. And once you go that road, nobody know where it is going end. Struggling meet their fourth deadline federal budget, congressional Republicans and White House official wrestled Tuesday their difference education, staging event demonstrate support what ha become most public and politically high-stakes element budget battle. Negotiators met night hash out their disagreement aid school, census and contraceptive. These were biggest issue that still separated two side each tried formulate message take home voter Nov. 3 election. On education, issue that President Clinton ha propelled forefront talk and which Republicans do not want appear recalcitrant, side have agreed spend more $1 billion disagree how spend it. The president insists money be spent hiring 100,000 teacher country so that average class can be reduced 18 student. Republicans, railing Beltway bureaucrat, say that local school district should decide how money is spent, whether it be teacher or computer. The two side remained apart several ideological matter, including whether allow federal health plan cover contraceptive and whether allow those few plan religious affiliation refuse cover contraceptive not only religious ground moral ground well. And they also were split how conduct census year 2000. This is one thorniest issue. It is not one that move voter, it is vital party because it help determine their relative strength Congress. House Speaker Newt Gingrich and Erskine Bowles, president's chief staff and top negotiator, met much day speaker's office, shuttling and out ante-rooms their lieutenant giving few clue nitty gritty detail their talk. They have given themselves another deadline midnight Wednesday wrap $500 billion-worth spending item, they could easily extend that deadline another day or two. They missed Oct. 1 start fiscal year, providing temporary funding federal government Oct. 9, then Oct. 12, then Wednesday. Some other central issue, such financing International Monetary Fund, were all nailed down, neither side wa ready declare final deal all other element budget package are place. We're splitting infinitive, Rep. Dick Armey Texas, Republican majority leader, said approving fund international fund. As they worked several issue, Republican leader appeared be calculating difference their party that might sour final deal when it arrives House floor more concern Senate floor because Senate ha fewer difference it Republicans and White House. Some conservative sounded note discord Friday federal spending agreement, they also said they would probably vote $500 billion package because it boosted defense spending and provided aid farmer. However, no one can vote package just yet, because it is not finished. The deal that President Clinton and Republican leader hailed Thursday wa broad outline area agreement final portion $1.7 trillion budget, not written document. That is now being crafted chairman spending committee and their aide, who said Friday that there were still dispute that needed be resolved and that final document could run more 3,000 page. For example, still unresolved is dispute whether airline can create peanut-free zone protect passenger who are allergic peanut. House Speaker Newt Gingrich and other member Georgia, major peanut-producing state, are fighting proposal, which would force airline ban peanut three row someone allergy. Congress gave itself midnight Tuesday vote final bill, agreeing President Clinton fifth extension temporary financing keep government open. The budget wa due Oct. 1, start new fiscal year. The vote wa initially expected Friday, bill is nowhere being written. Only handful top-level bargainer including Gingrich, Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott and White House chief staff Erskine Bowles were room final deal. Excluded were committee chairman and head appropriation committee, who now must write language that will put deal law. Almost everyone Capitol Hill expects budget pas eventually, biggest defection coming conservative who object $20 billion taken surplus address so-called emergency and package's failure offer voter serious tax cut. The lag time bill is officially closed is making some conservative nervous that more member will try add provision that will further expand bill they already consider overly bloated. And some worry that once hometown pork that is stuffed bill is publicly revealed, voter could put pressure member not support it. The election are Nov. 3. But several conservative said that these problem, they expected support bill anyway. Rep. Mark Souder, R-Ind., said: `Most my friend, who are predominantly activist conservative, are split 50-50. If tax cut were your primary thing, then you're unhappy, many conservative have mixed agenda. My position is, hold nose and vote yes. We have no tax cut and far too much spending that I oppose, that's nature compromise. Every member ha little different focus. Souder said he liked extra money defense spending, and he liked price support farmer. Hog farmer his district, whose biggest customer were Japan and China, had been hit hard collapse Asian market. ","Whether to use the 1st surplus in decades for a tax cut, to pay off the national debt, or for new initiatives made the 1998 federal budget negotiations chaotic.The Oct 1 start of the fiscal year was extended 5 times.Major issues were census statistical sampling, federal health plan coverage of contraceptives regardless of religious affiliation, and school aid decisions by the federal gov't or local jurisdictions.Other issues included a Federal Election Commission provision, a road through an Alaskan wildlife refuge, and an airline peanut ban.Committees crafted the budget document after broad agreement was reached when 8 bills were lumped together.","In 1998, for the first time in decades, the US budget negotiators faced a surplus.Both sides said this was harder than a deficit situation, but they finally spent $1.7 trillion.The last seven spending bills were the most difficult and finally were merged into one package.Controversial issues included health insurance paying for contraception, control of new education allocations, an Alaskan wilderness road, whether the 2000 census would include statistical sampling, and establishing an emergency fund.Conservatives felt the results favored the liberals, but both sides were satisfied and glad to finish before Election Day and avoid a government shutdown.","Budget negotiations between the White House and House Republicans were delayed on several issues.At issue were provisions that included requiring Federal Health Insurance providers to provide contraceptives to women as Well as a provision to build a road across a wildlife preserve in Alaska.The contraceptive issue faced an uncertain future while Clinton likely will veto the road.There is disagreement also on how to spend the funding on education.This year's budget discussions also have been hampered because it is the first time since budget procedures were established in 1974 that there has been a surplus, preventing agreement on a budget resolution.","After several deadline extensions, Congressional leaders and the White House agreed on an omnibus spending package, the final portion of the $1.7 trillion budget.It includes more money for education and defense, business tax breaks, and farm aid, as well as funds for Colombia to use in drug interdiction.To offset the new spending, the surplus will be tapped for $20 billion, to the ire of conservatives.This year, without the common goal of reducing the deficit, reaching agreement was very difficult.Policy provisions involving the 2000 census, contraception, and the Alaskan wilderness were also tied to the spending package and were hotly debated."

1033,"Microsoft Corp. ha said that material unpublished book two business school professor will be crucial part it defense antitrust trial scheduled begin next week. But judging advance copy manuscript, Justice Department and 20 state that are suing software giant will find support their argument book well. To cite one example, Microsoft contends that it industry-standard Windows operating system and it Internet Explorer browser are single integrated product. In it suit, government asserts that they are two separate product that Microsoft bundled together get unfair edge it rival, Netscape Communications Corp., market software used browse Internet's World Wide Web. In Competing Internet Time: Lessons Netscape and Its Battle Microsoft, author, Michael A. Cusumano Massachusetts Institute Technology's Sloan School Management and David B. Yoffie Harvard business school, quote Microsoft executive saying that only third version Microsoft's browser wa it integrated Windows. Microsoft hurried it first browser offering market, book say, it race catch Netscape, then took more ambitious approach Internet Explorer 3.0, which wa introduced August 1996. In that version it changed it software design use programming module, or component, that could be put together and rearragned building block. In book, Ben Slivka, Microsoft general manager, is quoted saying, IE 3.0 wa key thing because we componentized browser, He added, We really made Internet Explorer part Windows platform. The timing could be legally significant because it suit government cite evidence request August 1996 personal computer maker that wanted load Netscape's browser their machine instead Microsoft's browser. Microsoft denied request, insisting it browers and Windows were single, integrated product. Microsoft's legal team obtained early manuscript new book last month, issuing subpoena Netscape executive who wa given confidential copy author review. Microsoft ha also sought transcript 44 current and former Netscape employee interviewed author. A federal judge Boston last week denied Microsoft access that research material, company may appeal ruling. The new book, published Free Press imprint Simon &AMP; Schuster, is being hurried print so it can be shipped day start Microsoft trial Oct. 19. But already, few quote Netscape executive have leaked out. The author decided send complete manuscript The New York Times and three other news organization Monday, so that material could be read context. Microsoft intends use material book evidence that Netscape's trouble resulted largely it misstep rather any alleged predatory practice Microsoft. The book doe detail where Netscape stumbled, shifting it strategy too and running obstacle it software development effort. In private antitrust suit, argument that competitor wa his worst enemy is established defense. But legal expert say that defense may well be far le effective federal case which government is seeking court-mandated change Microsoft's business practice rather monetary damage that are goal plaintiff private case. It seems me that this debate Netscape's mistake is total sideshow, said Robert Litan, former senior official Justice Department's antitrust division, who is now Brookings Institution. But Microsoft ha big legal team, and it seems they are working every defense they can find. The book quote former Netscape executive, Ram Shriram, saying company bungled chance win sizable share browser business America Online Inc. But that wa second-chance do deal America Online, leading online service. The government's case focus earlier deal March 1996, when America Online chose Internet Explorer it preferred browser; that bargain Microsoft agreed place startup icon online service main Windows desktop screen prime real estate computing. For book entitled Competing Internet Time, it is intriguing that one it central theme is that Netcape got too wedded notion that Internet revolution would change everything quickly. Microsoft, contrast, stuck it three-year planning horizon that enabled company, author write, mesh it short-run tactical plan broader strategic view how win war. The book quote Steve Ballmer, Microsoft's president, saying, The fact matter is that customer can't take cataclysmic change every three month. The organization also can't. You can ship product quickly. But you can't say, `Oh, we have radically new strategy' every three month. The government's antitrust scrutiny Microsoft, world's largest independent software company, ha spanned Republican and Democratic administration and involved hundred government lawyer and investigator. But it ha no mean been example consistent, coordinated public policy. Nor, all account, politics. Instead, software industry itself, government's pursuit Microsoft ha taken leap, hit dead end and evolved way no one could have controlled or predicted back when it started 1989. It wa November that year, hot afternoon computer-industry convention Las Vegas, Nev., that Bill Gates, Microsoft's chairman, looked he'd been dragged news conference senior executive IBM which time dominated Microsoft and entire computer industry. The two company IBM, then leading maker personal computer and Microsoft, leader PC operating system software were collaborating design and marketing new operating system called OS/2. But Microsoft wa also beginning sell competing product, Windows. The industry trade press wa full worried articles: which system wa going become new standard? With Gates standing uncomfortably his side, James Cannavino, IBM divisional president, said that two company wanted clear air. OS/2 wa future, he said. As Windows, he added, it would remain niche product under-equipped computer. Windows, he asserted, would never receive all advanced feature OS/2. Gates certainly not look happy. But he not disagree. The news conference got little attention, just few article deep newspaper and trade publication. But few week later, Norris Washington, senior antitrust lawyer Federal Trade Commission, happened read one those article, Byte magazine. IBM and Microsoft have now defined their unified vision graphical operating environment, article said, and it look sort US. economic model, divided lower-, middle- and upper-class product. As Washington saw it, IBM and Microsoft were colluding divide operating-system market potential violation antitrust law. Soon FTC staff opened investigation Microsoft and IBM And that small first step, Microsoft ha been unrelenting scrutiny federal antitrust investigator constantly evolving series allegation and charge, month month, year year, last nine year. Now come antitrust trial scheduled begin Monday, multiplicity charge woven thread drawn more dozen different investigative inquiry that nine-year span. Microsoft, today most feared company software business and carrying stock-market value nearly $234 billion, present huge and highly visible antitrust target. Yet, while company's ally ask, What is Clinton administration's political agenda going Microsoft? answer seems be there is none. In interview, more dozen current and former senior antitrust official whether friend government or Microsoft all say Justice Department's antitrust suit is natural outgrowth previous investigation. As politics, all official agreed that antitrust division operates independent administration's political consideration. Charles Rule wa assistant attorney general who headed antitrust division Bush administration, and he is now Washington lawyer who serf adviser and advocate Microsoft. When I wa there, Rule said his Justice day, White House wa punctilious term never getting involved we decided do. There wa no communication antitrust and other branch government. Asked if he believed that policy had changed Clinton administration, he said: Not really. I've seen nothing suggest it. Joel Klein head antitrust division now, and interview dealing his division's role Clinton administration's technology policy, not specifically relating Microsoft case, he said: There is no statutory restriction, practical matter, civil and criminal prosecution are invariably carried out any political contact. Klein said, way example, that he might discus merger case involving military or aviation industry Defense Department or Transportation Department. But never White House, he said. For significant case, we might call White House and say `An hour now we are going hold press conference.' The last time there wa any interference, he added, wa Dita Beard-ITT case. Mrs. Beard, lobbyist ITT Corp., wa accused 1972 having written memo saying that $400,000 donation Republican National Convention had gone long way settling antitrust suit brought company Nixon administration's Justice Department. The authenticity memo wa never proved, and Mrs. Beard always denied writing it. In any case, Klein say, Watergate, it's been immaculate. In case Microsoft, neither President Clinton nor Vice President Al Gore ha ever volunteered comment. In answer question news conference May, just suit wa filed, Clinton said: I have taken view that I should not comment matter Justice Department. At this time, I do not think I should depart that policy this case, though it obviously will have big impact important sector our economy. But I have say, based what I know date, I have confidence way antitrust division Justice Department ha handled matter. Since then, Clinton ha said nothing else case, publicly least. And Gore, who generally represents administration technology issue, ha never commented all. In Rule's opinion, administration would be foolish involve itself, if it were politically acceptable do so. It would be little odd administration push Justice Department this suit, he said. It would be policy mistake and political mistake. I would be hard pressed explain why they would do that. Taking side highly charged technology world is dangerous, particularly Democrats rely Silicon Valley company political donation and support. In fact, present and former government official all said suit wa simply natural extension inquiry conducted last nine year. They began FTC. Soon Washington read that article Byte, FTC staff opened investigation Windows-OS/2 question. But ha happened so year, turn market made initial inquiry irrelevant. Microsoft abandoned it agreement IBM, and Windows quickly grew be industry standard, while OS/2 remained cipher. But that issue faded, once government investigator began looking Microsoft they found other thing that troubled them. In 1991 Washington, who still work FTC, informed Microsoft that investigation wa being expanded. The agency, his letter said, wa now trying determine whether Microsoft wa using it dominant position operating-systems software stifle competition other area. That general idea lie heart present suit. One former senior FTC official said commission staff had confidence case realized that Reagan-era commissioner, who had approve any suit, might have different view. We knew commission might have difficulty monopolization case, former official said. They hadn't brought case year. And fact, 1993 commission voted 2-2 question whether file formal charge. The deadlock served dismissal. Then, few month later, Justice Department decided pick case. It wa farther most case we got, recalled Robert Litan, former senior official Justice Department's antitrust division who is now Brookings Institution. Usually case would be two or three people complaining and few document, he said. But this wa fully researched record. They gave u file and briefed u what they had done. The Justice Department lawyer picked same thread. The general idea our inquiry, Litan said, wa that they should not be allowed use their monopoly operating system cement monopoly other area. In 1995, Microsoft and government reached consent agreement which company promised stop forcing PC maker buy one copy Microsoft operating system every computer sold instead one every computer which operating system, MS-DOS or Windows, wa installed. The company also agreed stop tying sale one software product sale another. The charge present suit are similar many way. Even agreement, government investigation continued. That same year, Justice Department investigator showed office Netscape Communications Corp. first time ask question their next line inquiry. America Online had been complaining, senior Netscape executive recalled, because Microsoft wa bundling Microsoft Network, competing online service, Windows. Once more, market force overtook investigation. The Microsoft Network never grew particularly popular while America Online prospered and grew. But, not surprisingly, new complaint filled void. In May 1995, Anne Bingaman, assistant attorney general who headed antitrust division, remarked: We get complaint Microsoft all time. We have become kind Microsoft complaint center. And we take them very seriously. In 1996, Netscape's first complaint arrived. In letter Justice Department, Netscape said that Microsoft wa using it dominance personal-computer operating system force or persuade computer maker favor Microsoft's browser, used explore World Wide Web, one marketed Netscape. The next year Justice Department formally charged Microsoft violating consent agreement tying sale Windows installation company's Web browser new computer. It seemed slam-dunk violation consent decree, natural extension that case, recalled Litan, who had left department then. A Federal District Court judge agreed, Appeals Court panel overturned that ruling this summer. In meantime, last May Justice Department and 20 state attorney general filed their new suit Microsoft, which is scheduled trial Monday. It contends that Microsoft ha engaged bundling, tying and other predatory behavior similar many way numerous previous allegation and investigation last nine year. A good part this case is just Round II case we dealt Round I, early 1990s, Litan said. Or, former senior FTC official put it, there's certainly common thread that run all way here. But year that thread ha been twisted, pulled and spun hundred different hand. The case United States v. Microsoft Corp., government's most aggressive move monopolist almost 25 year, is playing out century antitrust law so broadly worded and court ruling so ambiguous that side are citing same ruling support their opposing argument. Whatever outcome trial, scheduled begin Monday US. District Court Washington, almost certain appeal will leave Supreme Court task bringing legal order 100 year clashing antitrust doctrine. The case focus Microsoft's Windows, operating system that control 90 percent all personal computer sold today. The government say it objective is curb illegal monopolistic business practice that threaten render large part economy vulnerable vicissitude single company. Microsoft asserts that case is intended give government control which feature can be added Windows. However grand economic stake, legal dispute is narrow. The government say that Microsoft's contract computer manufacturer and company that provide access Internet illegally stifle competition. The contract prohibit manufacturer substituting Netscape Communications Corp.'s Navigator browser Microsoft's Internet Explorer. They also prohibit them removing Windows main screen, or desktop, link site World Wide Web run Microsoft or it partner. Microsoft's contract company that connect people Internet and business that sell good and service Web require favored treatment Internet Explorer Navigator exchange link Windows desktop. In wake lawsuit, Microsoft ha voluntarily dropped some these requirement, though it could reinstate them will. Microsoft say that it contract are legal because they produce tangible benefit customer, including easier Internet access. The Justice Department say that bundling Explorer Windows 95 and inclusion browser part Windows 98 amount tying, illegal practice that force customer one product purchase another. The contract manufacturer and Internet service are illegal, government say, because they are intended not only create monopoly browser market protect Microsoft's existing monopoly operating system. The latter threat is key, according Justice Department. Browsers have potential, operating system, act software platform which other program run. So contract intended drive browser out market would also insulate Windows monopoly. Many antitrust expert say problem facing Justice Department is that court have provided no clear definition tying and no clear guideline determining when contract are illegally exclusionary. Professor Lawrence White New York University, who wa chief economist Justice Department's antitrust division early 1980s, say that court treat tying unusual practice when fact it is ubiquitous. No one, he said, would challenge right manufacturer tie eraser tip pencil, tire automobile or button shirt. His point, shared widely economist, is that some tying benefit consumer if, example, it result product that are easier use or enables company recover development cost. But tying can be bad if it lock monopoly power. The court, White say, have not offered enough guidance distinguishing good tying bad, which is nub legal dispute. Microsoft say it need only show that bundling Windows and Explorer pass what might be called gross consumer benefit test that it offer immediate benefit, whether or not it cause long-term damage competition and, therefore, ultimately consumer. The Justice Department say that Microsoft's practice must clear higher hurdle: yielding net consumer benefit that are immediate and large enough balance possible long-term harm competition. So which test consumer benefit satisfies antitrust law? The simple answer is that no one know sure, which is why side can reasonably cite same case fear embarrassment. Consider 1985 case, Aspen Skiing Co. v. Aspen Highlands Skiing Corp., and 1951 case, Lorain Journal Co. v. United States. In first, Aspen Skiing, owner three major ski run Aspen, Colo. monopolist had year sold ticket cooperation Aspen Highlands, competitor, that gave skier access companies' run. When Aspen Skiing unilaterally canceled agreement, it rival's revenue shriveled and rival sued. The Supreme Court ruled that Aspen Skiing had violated antitrust law because there wa no evidence it action helped consumer. In Lorain Journal case, only local newspaper Lorain, Ohio, refused sell advertising company that advertised new radio station. Here, too, Supreme Court ruled that exclusionary practice nothing benefit consumer. Indeed, Aspen Skiing, court forced monopolist do business it rival, precedent that augur well Justice Department, which seek force Microsoft install Netscape's browser alongside it own. But Charles Rule, legal consultant Microsoft, say that case court threw out exclusionary practice only because they offered no consumer benefit. The court, he argues, never pounced practice that resulted lower price or better product or service. Nor court either case call balancing immediate benefit hypothetical long-term harm. Rule argues that Microsoft's practice produce demonstrable consumer benefit. Besides, he say, action taken The Lorain Journal or Aspen Skiing, Microsoft's contract do not prevent consumer installing Netscape's browser or using Web site Microsoft's rival. In truth, though, neither case answered what consumer benefit test should apply product design. In Jefferson Parish Hospital District No. 2 et al. v. Hyde, another case cited side, Supreme Court 1984 recognized that surgeon and anesthesiologist provide integrated service. Yet, court said, hospital monopoly power would still not be allowed force surgical patient use it panel anesthesiologist if consumer wanted purchase two service separately. That principle could undercut Microsoft's defense that functional interdependence Windows and Explorer requires bundling. But Microsoft will point strong concurring opinion that called tougher standard government meet when it alleges tying. Microsoft will also draw support several court ruling that allowed IBM change design it computer way that made it hard vendor attach peripheral equipment. But perhaps Microsoft's best argument is that nowhere ha government identified single case which court explicitly called throwing out tied product basis balancing test. The court, Microsoft will emphasize, steer clear redesigning technically sophisticated product. The Justice Department's rejoinder is note that sole purpose antitrust law is protect consumer, so it make no sense bless practice that provide dollar's worth benefit today but, stamping out competition, drive price $1,000 tomorrow. The Justice Department will ask court least insist that monopolist use least exclusionary mean possible achieve service they provide customer. Experts agree that court will subject Microsoft's restrictive contract Internet company balancing test. But exactly how court will decide whether consumer are helped or hurt is grab. A balancing test would have court weigh immediate benefit consumer one-click access Internet site and feature bundled Windows-Explorer package harm time diminished competition market browser and operating system. But test that make good sense theory can prove fiendishly difficult use practice. Balancing test are impossibly difficult and arbitrary, said Rep. Thomas Campbell, R-Calif., who is former law professor Stanford University. The practical effect balancing is hand defendant Microsoft almost certain victory. Microsoft argues and many antitrust expert agree that court have fact gravitated away balancing test simpler predation test exclusionary contract. Under this standard, contract is illegal only if it is intended drive out competition and thus pave way monopolist raise price later. Microsoft will have easier time defending itself charge predation, which amount victimizing it customer, it would defending itself charge that it bundled product doe consumer slightly more harm good. The antitrust record, say William Baxter, who headed antitrust division President Reagan, is littered contradictory, ambiguous and sometimes nonsensical verdict. He and other legal expert agree that if nothing else, that record leaf plenty legal leeway Supreme Court, should it hear Microsoft case, stiffen spine antitrust law. The legal tool that government is using it assault Microsoft Corp. Sherman Antitrust Act 1890 is brief, vague and malleable. The combination ha meant that this bedrock statute antitrust policy ha been turn toothless and powerful year, depending politics and economics day interpreted court. Sponsored Sen. John Sherman, Ohio Republican who wa younger brother Civil War general William Tecumseh Sherman, act wa passed nod popular backlash rise industrial trust oil, steel and railroad. Farmers, laborer and small-business owner sizable voting group resented trust vehicle concentrated power. But trust, large national holding corporation, were viewed many engine modernization and industrialization. Economists time opposed Sherman Act, and law that Congress passed wa vaguely worded compromise. No one knew what impact it would have, one senator, quoted Matthew Josephson's The Robber Barons, explained that nearly everyone agreed that something must be flung out appease restive mass. The act's two key provision, Sections 1 and 2, mention conspiracy, restraint trade and attempt monopolize. Yet while Sherman Act is now interpreted Magna Carta competition, it never us term. After it wa passed, critic trust derided impenetrable language Sherman Act and called it Swiss Cheese Act. But early 1900s, political climate had changed. The growing antagonism trust, especially income gap widened, wa tapped avowed trustbuster, Theodore Roosevelt, who became president 1901. The Sherman Act ha always been elastic piece social legislation, used attack perceived exploitation and aggregation power, said Eleanor Fox, professor New York University Law School. The model trust and principal target trustbuster wa Standard Oil. Shrewdly, Roosevelt made distinction good trust, which thrived because their superior efficiency, and bad trust, which grew not result inevitable economic force because unfair business practice. Throughout 1880s and '90s, Standard Oil's rival had complained company and business practice it founder, John D. Rockefeller. But those year, price kerosene burned light nation's home declined steadily. So Standard Oil, it could could reasonably be argued, wa enterprising monopoly. In early 1900s, though, Standard Oil raised price United States prop it profit time it wa engaged price war Royal Dutch/Shell Europe, where Standard Oil face genuine competition. When consumer were hurt Standard Oil monopoly, popular support antitrust action company swelled, encouraged Roosevelt and his successor, William Howard Taft. The federal suit Standard Oil wa filed 1906, and Supreme Court approved breakup company 1911. Standard Oil and Microsoft case, historian observe, have some common theme. Both were dominant company their day, and Bill Gates, Microsoft chairman, ha been called modern Rockefeller. But there is no presidential involvement and there is no real consumer dissatisfaction Microsoft case, said Ron Chernow, author Titan, best-selling biography Rockefeller. And Rockefeller, Chernow added, never went kind honeymoon period widespread public adulation and favorable press coverage Bill Gates ha had. In summer 1995, whiff revolution wa air Silicon Valley. The Internet offered new deal computing, fresh opportunity entrepreneur try break Microsoft Corp.'s firm grip personal computer software business. Leading challenge wa Netscape Communications Corp., whose software browsing World Wide Web had ignited Internet boom. Netscape chairman James Clark spoke boldly attacking Microsoft head-on. He borrowed imagery movie Star Wars, referring Microsoft Death Star and Netscape leader rebel alliance. Microsoft answered vengeance. It dispatched hundred programmer work competing browser and poured many million dollar marketing it. It prodded computer maker and distribute it browser, folded browser it industry-dominant Windows operating system and gave browser away free campaign intended cut their air supply, senior Microsoft executive described it. But not only competitor Netscape have encountered Microsoft's force. Microsoft's partner, it corporate customer and professional investor who finance new venture have all collided it. A close look Microsoft's no-holds-barred push Internet software business offer window way company us it market muscle influence behavior virtually every player industry. Some case recounted here figure prominently suit brought Justice Department and 20 state, scheduled go trial this month, charging that Microsoft time went too far and violated antitrust law. Regardless legal outcome, previously unreported detail incident suit and other example provide more complete picture Microsoft action. When Compaq Computer Corp. considered loading Netscape's browser instead Microsoft's it personal computer, Microsoft threatened stop selling it Windows operating system Compaq. The company quickly changed it mind. After Spyglass Inc. began supplying Microsoft it early browser technology, Microsoft announced that it would give away it browser free. The timing came rude surprise it partner Spyglass. The company lost most it revenue almost overnight, technology, which it had also been licensing company Microsoft, suddenly became available free. When America Online Inc., which competes fiercely Microsoft's online service and electronic commerce division, went shopping browser technology, Microsoft made offer that wa too good pas up: If America Online used Microsoft's browser main one it million subscriber, Microsoft would give America Online prime placement desktop screen all personal computer using Windows. When Intel Corp. began developing it Internet software, Microsoft complained. Intel, leading maker microprocessor that serve electronic brain most personal computer running Windows, pulled back. The chip maker decided that it lucrative hand-in-glove partnership Microsoft took priority. Microsoft's reach computing ha become so pervasive that nearly every year now, Silicon Valley's top venture capitalist meet privately team top Microsoft executive learn company's plan. The goal, one venture investor observed, wa stay out way steamroller. Microsoft adamantly denies that it ha broken any law these or similar situation. The company play game business hard, and it executive acknowledge that apology. Yes, Microsoft say, rival may suffer and partner may be irritated occasionally. But company insists it action are guided it main corporate goal bringing new technology inexpensively and conveniently million people who use it software. Most people computer industry say that living Microsoft's world mean routinely making accommodation it. Microsoft's power emanates it near-monopoly market personal computer operating system, master control program that run computer. Because it owns operating system, Microsoft is essential utility information age, said James Moore, president Geopartners Research Inc., technology consulting firm. It act kind gatekeeper pipeline computing innovation, sitting there and deciding whether help some innovation or slow it down. For month, Microsoft and Netscape had talked and off, circling each other warily. But event that would define them unflinching rival wa meeting June 21, 1995, second-floor conference room Netscape's headquarters Mountain View, Calif. That meeting, according Justice Department and 20 state suing Microsoft, wa high-tech equivalent storied gathering smoke-filled railroad car that inspired passage nation's antitrust law century ago. On that day, they say, Microsoft made Netscape illegal offer divvy market Internet browsing software, collusion pact that Netscape rejected. Microsoft reply that prosecutor are misinterpreting routine meeting software business and that company ha never tried divide browser market. Bill Gates, Microsoft's chairman and principal strategist, not attend Mountain View gathering, he consulted telephone Microsoft team. Two people who attend that June meeting have been named witness trial scheduled begin next week: Netscape president James Barksdale and Daniel Rosen, Microsoft's general manager new technology. In trial, government will contend that Microsoft presented Netscape all-or-nothing offer, according people who have been questioned federal investigation. Relying heavily note taken meeting Netscape executive vice president Marc Andreessen and testimony Barksdale, prosecutor are expected assert that Microsoft proposal had several element, incentive and requirement. Microsoft, according people questioned government, would invest Netscape, taking 15 20 percent stake, give Netscape technical information and fine-tune Microsoft's operating system so that Netscape's software would run better Windows. In return, people say, Netscape would give Microsoft seat it board, license it technology Microsoft, give Microsoft advance knowledge it product-development effort and not make browser next generation Microsoft operating system, Windows 95, which wa shipped two month June 1995 meeting. And Microsoft, people added, what it ha always denied it doe used access it technology powerful lever business negotiation, offering Netscape preferential access Windows application program interface, or APIs, link that enable other companies' program run smoothly Windows operating system. By turning deal, Netscape, they say, would not have that preferred access Microsoft technology threat that Microsoft fiercely denies making. Barksdale, Netscape's 55-year-old chief executive, told colleague that encounter Microsoft June 1995 wa damnedest meeting I've ever attended 35 year business. Had Netscape accepted Microsoft's offer, it would have had Microsoft's money and it endorsement. Netscape would have also been free sell it browser use earlier version Windows and use other operating system Apple's Macintosh and Unix, powerful system used mainly corporation and research lab. But if we had licensed our technology Microsoft and stepped aside, best we could have hoped wa becoming company sale $100 million or so and hoping be bought out Microsoft, said Clark, former computer scientist Stanford University who founded Silicon Graphics Inc., computer graphic pioneer, starting Netscape. We didn't start Netscape that. For any company, meeting Microsoft is charged affair. Every computing device keyboard disk drive, and every software program game browser, must mesh smoothly Microsoft's Windows operating system. This is necessary make computer reliable and easier use, it also give Microsoft it role industry's gatekeeper. And Microsoft itself make all manner software product operating system, other company are put uneasy position requiring Microsoft's cooperation be able compete it. And software industry, where every program is rendered digital code 1's and 0's, line that divide competition and cooperation are blurred. The talk that line Microsoft-Netscape meeting focused division operating system platform, computer term and application program, sometimes called solution, that run top operating system. The government suit state that sworn testimony, Chris Jones, Microsoft manager who attended meeting, admitted that Microsoft `absolutely' intended persuade Netscape not compete. Microsoft read Jones' testimony very differently, evidence mainly company's clarifying it position. If Netscape stayed application or solution side operating system, two company could be partner, Microsoft said. But if Netscape tried become player platform space, they would compete. Microsoft released portion Jones deposition September evidence that government had quoted Microsoft manager out context. Q. Do you recall any discussion desire anybody part Microsoft who wa participating be able persuade or influence Netscape not compete? A. Absolutely. But again, persuade sense force or persuade sense of, hey, we think we can have great business relationship together. Later deposition, Justice Department lawyer asked Jones whether any Microsoft executive intended suggest that there would be any consequence Netscape or it business if Netscape chose go platform direction you've described earlier opposed solution direction. Jones replied: The conversation wa something following: `We're platform business. We're going invest heavily this part platform because we feel it's critical our technology. That's done deal.' And we're asking them: `What is your business? Is your business platform or solution? If it's platform, we're platform business. We're competing.' Microsoft portrays such comment innocuous statement fact. But Netscape, same remark could be taken warning, if not threat. This is because Internet browsing software had potential become alternative platform Windows operating system. The browser, sitting top operating system, could supplant Windows main desktop screen users' machine and main layer programming starting other software application. In addition, Netscape's browser could serve powerful platform distributing and running Java, Internet programming language developed Sun Microsystems Inc., Microsoft rival. In technical term, Netscape's upstart platform could replace Microsoft's APIs essential utility computing. Indeed, Andreessen had boasted public Netscape's ambition relegate Microsoft's Windows so much software plumbing browser. By June meeting, Microsoft certainly viewed Netscape serious potential challenger Windows, corporate crown jewel. On May 26, 1995, internal memo, The Internet Tidal Wave, Gates wrote: A new competitor `born' Internet is Netscape. Their browser is dominant 70 percent usage share, allowing them determine which network extension will catch on. Netscape's strategy, Gates wrote, wa move key API browser commoditize underlying operating system. THE BROADER INQUIRY: GOVERNMENT SEES ARM-TWISTING The federal government and state have recently broadened their allegation Microsoft adding evidence that it tried bully Intel, Apple Computer Inc. and other company squelch competition. They say that Netscape meeting new evidence fit pattern behavior Microsoft, which ha repeatedly tried limit competition strong-arming competitor and partner. One episode that fit pattern, prosecutor contend, wa effort Microsoft pressure Intel shelve development multimedia and Internet software and limit it cooperation Netscape. Intel's main business is making microprocessor chip that act electronic brain most computer that run Windows operating system. Indeed, fortune Intel and Microsoft are so closely aligned that two company are sometimes referred single, powerful entity, Wintel. But Intel also employ hundred software engineer, mainly it Intel Architecture Labs Hillsboro, Ore. And while Intel and Microsoft are partner, they have also had their conflict, typically direction and pace which certain innovation should be introduced personal computer industry, which they dominate together. Federal and state investigator have focused Microsoft's strong reaction work being done Intel's software engineer sentiment expressed no uncertain term meeting Intel's Santa Clara, Calif., headquarters Aug. 2, 1995. The contentious session wa attended several executive Intel and Microsoft, including Gates and Intel chairman Andrew Grove. An internal Intel memo stated that Gates made vague threat supporting Intel's competitor and that he wa livid Intel's investment Internet and wanted them stopped. Later, Intel pull back it multimedia and Internet software development. Steven McGeady, Intel vice president who attended August 1995 meeting, is scheduled appear witness government. Microsoft reply that government's account meeting those Netscape and Intel are fanciful distortion, created using biased selection document and witness. The government's case, Microsoft asserts, betrays utter failure accept computer-industry reality that Microsoft routinely meet company make sure their software and equipment will work well Windows. Sometimes talk, Microsoft say, go include further level cooperation licensing technology or Microsoft investment, company discussed Netscape. In trial, Microsoft is expected argue it advance browser market wa result it business acumen and Netscape's misstep. To document Netscape's error, Microsoft issued subpoena last month and obtained unpublished manuscript new book, Competing Internet Time: Lessons From Netscape and Its Battle With Microsoft, which is based hundred interview current and former Netscape executive. The book doe chronicle mistake made Netscape. But it author, Michael Cusumano Massachusetts Institute Technology's Sloan School Management and David Yoffie Harvard Business School, think Microsoft is hardly blameless. Microsoft's take-no-prisoners strategy backfired, all inviting retaliation competitor, government and customer, Yoffie said. Emphasizing that he wa offering no legal judgment, Yoffie added, I think Microsoft could have achieved 90 percent what it crossing line much it did. THE SPYGLASS LINK: REWARDS AND PERILS OF A PARTNERSHIP On April 6, 1994, Gates and 20 Microsoft executive gathered daylong retreat not far company's headquarters Redmond, Wash. The subject wa Internet and how it might revolutionize computer software business. Few concrete plan were made that day, Microsoft executive insist that direction wa set. Our vision outset wa unite two world Windows desktop and Internet, said Steven Sinofsky, Microsoft executive who attended meeting. Yet Microsoft badly trailed Netscape browser field. To hasten it entry, Microsoft licensed it early browsing software Spyglass Inc. Naperville, Ill. The first meeting two company wa initiated Spyglass April 1994. At time, it wa tiny company and eager do deal Microsoft. Spyglass wa selected commercial licensee browser technology developed National Center Supercomputing University Illinois. In summer 1994, Douglas Colbeth, president Spyglass, met Clark Netscape O'Hare International Airport Chicago. The two men talked United Airlines Red Carpet Room, reserved business-class passenger, and Colbeth recalled Clark telling him, We're going take Microsoft head-on. At time, Colbeth recalled thinking himself, Great, now Microsoft will really want license me. Today, he noted: Remember, we were company couple dozen people and almost no money bank. Netscape had Jim Clark, his money and reputation, and big-time venture capital backing Silicon Valley. Netscape had very different agenda. By July 1994, Microsoft had become quite interested Spyglass technology, Colbeth say, and two company signed their first licensing agreement December. Microsoft, Colbeth recall, always told him that it would eventually fold browser technology it operating system, it timing wa accelerated Netscape's rapid rise. Microsoft wa initially hoping charge browser, Colbeth said. But Dec. 7, 1995, Gates declared that Microsoft would not only deeply integrate it browser Windows would give it away. The announcement caught industry, Colbeth, surprise. At time, Spyglass had licensed it technology 82 other company, including IBM and Digital Equipment, use their software product licensing revenue stream $20 million year. As result Microsoft's move, Spyglass saw those revenue vanish year, smaller Internet software company went out business and big customer shifted Microsoft's free browser. Spyglass slashed it payroll and scrambled new niche software industry replace it lost sale, which it succeeded doing eventually. Whenever you license technology Microsoft, you have understand it can someday build it itself, drop it operating system and put you out that business, Colbeth said. THE NONOPTION COMPAQ: SUDDENLY SEES THE LIGHT Well 1996, Netscape's share browser market continued rise, while Microsoft made little headway, though it browser wa free. Industry analyst and trade magazine agreed that Netscape's browser wa clear technical leader. In April 1996, Netscape's Navigator wa used 87 percent people browsing Web, compared 4 percent using Microsoft's Internet Explorer, according Zona Research. So biggest personal computer maker, Compaq, thought it made sense give customer Netscape's browser instead Microsoft's. But Microsoft would not stand that and Compaq had no choice give in. In June 1996, Compaq wanted not only load more popular Netscape browser it machine also remove icon Microsoft's Internet Explorer, which wa delivered computer maker Windows 95. Microsoft informed Compaq that if it removed Internet Explorer, computer maker would lose it license Windows, said Stephen Decker, Compaq's director software procurement, testimony federal investigator. The ultimatum Microsoft wa delivered bluntly letter headed, Notice Intent Terminate License Agreement. Faced being denied essential operating system, Compaq quickly reversed course and kept Internet Explorer icon. Microsoft asserts that Windows and Internet Explorer are single product and that Microsoft alone defines what is product. Nothing it contract, Microsoft add, prohibits computer maker including competing technology. While cutoff letter Microsoft sent Compaq seems unnecessarily hardball tactic when dealing it largest corporate customer, Microsoft chief operating officer Bob Herbold insists that take one letter here or one snippet e-mail there try portray Microsoft arrogant company is unfair. Noting that Compaq executive is witness Microsoft, Herbold said, We are totally dependent tremendous relationship key company Compaq. At Netscape, however, Compaq episode wa watershed. That wa singular act that got me going Justice Department, Barksdale recalled. Barksdale said he regarded Microsoft's tactic forcing Compaq buy it browser condition obtaining essential product, Windows operating system, illegal act and absolute proof that Microsoft wa monopolist. After investigating incident, Justice Department and state agreed Barksdale that Microsoft wa illegally tying sale one product another. Microsoft reply that it ha long history adding new feature it operating system. And outset, Microsoft say, it intended that Windows and it Internet Explorer browser would be seamlessly integrated, they are now Windows 98. Thus, Microsoft insists, there is no product-tying violation antitrust law. In separate case, federal appeal court sided Microsoft, upholding principle that company could put it wanted it operating system and declare it single product. But June 1996, when Compaq wanted offer Netscape product instead Microsoft's browser, most industry expert viewed browser and operating system two different software program. It took long time integration strategy play out, said former senior Microsoft researcher. Back then, integration wa basically bolting browser Windows. THE `BALANCING ACT': AMERICA ONLINE TOSSES IN TOWEL America Online chairman Stephen Case refers dealing Microsoft delicate balancing act. That balance swung sharply fall 1995 spring 1996, when Microsoft used lure giving America Online featured place Windows desktop ultimate bargaining chip. To gain access computing's most coveted real estate, America Online agreed make Microsoft's Internet Explorer main browser it online subscriber, who now number more 13 million. Yet throughout 1995, Microsoft prepared introduce Windows 95, most significant improvement ever it operating system, Case wa knocking door Justice Department. His complaint wa that Microsoft wa going place it new online service, Microsoft Network, direct competitor America Online, prominently desktop screen Windows 95, which wa introduced August. This bundling tactic using industry-dominant operating system market Microsoft Network, or MSN, Case argued, gave Microsoft unfair advantage young fast-growing online business. The Justice Department listened and investigated. But ultimately, government decided taking any action. At America Online's headquarters Vienna, Va., Microsoft wa feared and loathed time. America Online had designated Microsoft watcher, young MBA. who tracked it adversary's every move. Above desk his small, windowless office wa picture Gates. Beneath picture, large block letter, were word THE ENEMY. Though America Online wa clear leader online service business, it had ample reason worry all-out assault rival rich and aggressive Microsoft. When he had visited Microsoft headquarters couple year earlier, Case recalled, Gates had bluntly assessed Microsoft's option saying he could buy 20 percent America Online, all it or enter online business his and bury you. A threat or merely statement fact? A bit both, Case said recently. But he wa mainly articulating what everybody that meeting kind intuitively understood. Yet 1996, Microsoft and America Online found they had reason cooperate. With exploding popularity Internet's World Wide Web, conventional online company, America Online and Compuserve, had provide their customer Internet access well their service. America Online had it browser, keep pace rapidly advancing technology it made sense do deal Netscape or Microsoft. For software company, deal America Online, which had 5 million subscriber time, could mean big surge browser use and market share. Netscape seemed natural partner America Online, company were Microsoft rival. On March 11, America Online announce that it would buy Netscape technology, it wa standard licensing deal based payment-for-use formula. The next day, America Online announced more significant deal Microsoft making it browser default technology browser America Online subscriber would use unless they specifically asked Netscape's Navigator. To win deal, Microsoft offered give America Online start-up icon Windows desktop precisely kind equal treatment main Windows screen that Case had asked Justice Department require Microsoft. After we agreed it Internet Explorer browser, Microsoft allowed u be bundled Windows desktop, Case said. It wa example Microsoft's pragmatic side. The pragmatic decision wa that paramount corporate goal wa increase browser market share protect mainstay software business. As result, it new online service, MSN, would have sacrifice important marketing advantage it main rival, America Online. It wa Bill's decision, said former MSN general manager Russell Siegelman, referring Gates. He sent me e-mail it. He said he didn't think it would hurt MSN that much. I disagreed him. To other Microsoft executive, Gates expressed different view likely impact MSN. He told senior vice president Brad Silverberg that putting America Online Windows desktop would amount putting bullet MSN's head, according deposition taken Justice Department. In antitrust suit, government asserts that America Online deal show how Microsoft used power it Windows monopoly give it edge browser war Netscape. David Colburn, senior vice president America Online who took part browser negotiation Microsoft, is witness government. Today, Microsoft ha overhauled it Internet strategy focus mainly building popular special-interest Web site field travel, personal finance, automobile retailing and news. And it is putting these site, e-mail and search feature, all-in-one site that us name MSNcom. I still regard Microsoft primary threat, Case observed. Microsoft ha history getting it right long run, and there's no reason think it won't this business well. We will always be Microsoft's cross hair. THE LESSON: DON'T CONFRONT A STEAMROLLER At Netscape's headquarters Silicon Valley, strategy today is one avoiding head-to-head competition Microsoft whenever possible. Don't do something that is Microsoft's path that's lesson learned, observed Clark, Netscape chairman. Silicon Valley's venture capitalist, investor who finance so many nation's high-tech startup, generally follow Netscape formula these day. Yet that still leaf ample room prosper. For while competing directly Microsoft is dangerous, software industry whole is engine wealth creation, job generation and technical innovation. And there is ambivalent side venture community's relationship Microsoft. For if start-up cannot steer clear Microsoft entirely, favored option is be bought out Microsoft, which ha scooped many fledgling company way acquiring promising technology and people. Microsoft understands start-up innovation and how co-opt start-up innovation better any other high-tech company, said James Breyer, managing partner Accel Partners, venture capital firm. As Microsoft ha grown, it ha come be seen not merely competitor force nature that shape business environment, weather front. Microsoft is incredibly pervasive, said Stewart Alsop, partner New Enterprise Associates, venture capital firm Menlo Park, Calif. At board meeting company which his firm ha invested, two issue always come up, he said: One is price company's stock, and other is what Microsoft is going do. In last few year, Microsoft ha offered it guidance almost yearly meeting senior Microsoft executive and leading venture capitalist. The meeting are part Microsoft's effort improve it sometimes prickly relation Silicon Valley. We work hard provide clarity where we're going and where we're not going, said Greg Maffei, Microsoft's chief financial officer. Last year's conference took place October Quadrus office building Sand Hill Road Menlo Park, Wall Street high-tech venture investing. Maffei led team five Microsoft executive who appeared group 40 venture capitalist, one whom stood and asked question that seemed be mind many his peers: How do I invest company that stay out way steamroller? Maffei, recalled one person who attended meeting, stood and delivered brief lecture business that Microsoft wa likely avoid. His list included specialized software manufacturing, human resource management, computer-aided design and others. But, this person noted, broad swath industry appeared be designated limit including new software platform that might compete Microsoft's personal computer operating system. At one point, Ruthann Quindlen, partner Institutional Venture Partners, leaned Vinod Khosla, co-founder Sun Microsystems and partner venture capital firm Kleiner Perkins Caufield &AMP; Byers, and said quietly, I guess that leaf u washing machine and toaster. Following is text first two section Sherman Act, passed Congress 1890. As foundation which federal antitrust law ha been built, act ha been amended several time elevating crime felony, increasing fine and prison term individual and setting fine corporation convicted violating it. In case Microsoft, government ha invoked Sherman Act file civil suit that seek change company's business practice, not criminal suit that seek financial penalty. An Act Protect Trade And Commerce Against Unlawful Restraints and Monopolies: Section 1.

Will it matter consumer that Bill Gates isn't nice guy? Until last week, most Americans thought Gates, chairman Microsoft Corp., genius and innovator. A nerd perhaps also self-styled visionary who almost single-handedly unlocked power personal computer. Monday, however, Washington courtroom, Justice Department began painting different, darker portrait Gates. In antitrust suit brought department and 20 state, man whose company command 97 percent share market personal computer operating system is being depicted Nixonian schemer who will go almost any length crush his competition. Product innovation, suit argues, is not sufficient weapon Gates. Flashing back and forth snippet Gates' videotaped deposition and e-mail message he had sent that contradicted his testimony, government sought establish pattern threat and offer payment Microsoft chairman. It also sought cast Gates obsessed man who feared tiny Netscape Communications Corp. and it potential threat his domination market Internet browser, software used navigate World Wide Web. Gates wa portrayed Justice Department litigator David Boies schoolyard bully who ride roughshod computer industry crudeness that is stark contrast his popular image benevolent dictator and high-technology guru. According document presented Boies, example, Gates asked America Online executive 1996: How much do we need pay you damage Netscape? This is your lucky day. The implication, Boies said, wa that amount wa irrelevant, and that Microsoft, it deep pocket and market dominance, make many offer you can't refuse needed achieve it goal. Microsoft official are closely watching market survey any hint that new image bare-knuckled Gates might be detracting company's world-famous brand name, they insist that public will continue draw distinction allegation anticompetitive business tactic and company's software. Despite what you're reading press, people judge u our product, said Mich Matthews, head Microsoft's corporate public-relations office. Our experience is that people vote their pocketbook. So far, consumer are casting positive vote. Last week Microsoft reported quarterly profit $1.52 billion, stunning 58 percent increase level year earlier. Despite record profit, some marketing expert say that if public come view Gates Rockefeller-style robber baron, his company and it brand name may suffer. When you have company such visible chief executive, CEO is really driver brand, said David Aaker, brand marketing expert Haas School Business University California Berkeley. There is no question this is going affect Microsoft's brand recognition. Already there are early warning signal, political cartoon newspaper country bashed Gates last week. One showed him holding globe and saying, If you don't play my way, I'll take my ball and go home; another portrayed Microsoft chairman standing next henchman dangling someone window while Microsoft secretary say caller, I'm sorry, Mr. Gates is busy teaching competitor Windows. But some industry analyst believe new view Bill Gates who know how play hardball may not be such bad thing his company. The he-said, she-said e-mail message being dragged out court case Washington and Silicon Valley, where Microsoft is locked legal battle it archrival, Sun Microsystems Inc., is viewed some little different exaggerated trash talking that go professional sport. It's taking what Charles Barkley and Michael Jordan say each other ball court and turning it something more sinister it really is, said Paul Andrews, co-author Stephen Manes Gates (Doubleday, 1993). Indeed, there is evidence that darker view Gates and his company ha so far taken root only District Columbia and Silicon Valley, where computer industry ha long felt impact Gates' tactic, and where bitterness and distrust Microsoft are deep. In rest country, Gates continues enjoy great popularity. Two week ago, while speaking crowd almost 7,000 student Indiana University, questioner who asked Justice Department's suit wa roundly booed. BILL GATES, WHIPPING BOY c.1998 NY. Times News Service Is Bill Gates high-tech Machiavelli, Public Enemy No. 1 or threat known universe? All three, judging numerous political cartoon that popped newspaper country last week. From Chattanooga Boston, cartoonist took delight demonizing Gates, who is facing unexpected public relation challenge Microsoft's antitrust trial unfolds Washington. Other cartoon ran gamut predictable (a worker, pointing aquarium which large fish is gobbling smaller one, saying some visitor, Welcome Microsoft's research and development department) weird (a dweebish man hunched front computer screen staring words: Our beloved leader, Mr. Gates, is attack. Leave your possession. Go desert. Await spaceship). And that wa just Week One trial. Stay tuned. A federal judge Friday pushed back starting date antitrust trial Microsoft Corp. four day, Oct. 19, while also ordering company comply Justice Department's request examine Microsoft's financial record. Microsoft argued that allowing army government attorney come and make demand will make it very difficult u remain business. But winning assurance government lawyer that they would make only narrow, targeted search record, Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson US. District Court District Columbia ordered Microsoft open database perusal. Microsoft had asked that trial be delayed several more month prepare defense what it said wa last minute broadening case Justice Department, which had added new evidence. Last month, government said that process preparing trial it had discovered that Microsoft tried persuade Apple Computer not market it Quicktime multimedia software Windows customer. On Thursday, Justice Department and 20 state added two new people their witness list testify Microsoft dealing Apple and Sun Microsystems. Avi Tevanian, former Apple executive, wa added witness list part describe Microsoft's proposal, which Microsoft denies ever having made. The other new witness wa James Gosling, Sun executive who led development Java, Internet programming language that Microsoft see potential threat company's dominance software market. The government is charging that Microsoft took illegal step prevent Java gaining wide acceptance. To counter that, Microsoft named two new witness Friday, Robert Muglia, senior Microsoft executive who ha worked Sun, and Chris Engstrom, executive who handled some Microsoft's dealing Apple. At same time, John Warden, Microsoft's lawyer, argued that new allegation had no place case. The Justice Department, Warden told judge, wa trying turn this something approximating plenary monopoly case IBM case. It becomes clearer and clearer and clearer each new filing that they are trying turn this broader case, he said. You can't have this bait-and-switch which they file complaint alleging A, B, C, and then talk whole alphabet three time over. As result, Warden said, Microsoft wanted, minimum, another two-week delay, though more normal schedule would have trial start next year. The judge not respond. Instead he entered order setting Oct. 19 trial date. Late Friday, Microsoft entered formal motion asking another two-week delay. A response is expected next week. The case United States v. Microsoft Corp., government's most aggressive move monopolist almost 25 year, is playing out century antitrust law so broadly worded and court ruling so ambiguous that side are citing same ruling support their opposing argument. Whatever outcome trial, scheduled begin Monday US. District Court Washington, almost certain appeal will leave Supreme Court task bringing legal order 100 year clashing antitrust doctrine. The case focus Microsoft's Windows, operating system that control 90 percent all personal computer sold today. The government say it objective is curb illegal monopolistic business practice that threaten render large part economy vulnerable vicissitude single company. Microsoft asserts that case is intended give government control which feature can be added Windows. However grand economic stake, legal dispute is narrow. The government say that Microsoft's contract computer manufacturer and company that provide access Internet illegally stifle competition. The contract prohibit manufacturer substituting Netscape Communications Corp.'s Navigator browser Microsoft's Internet Explorer. They also prohibit them removing Windows main screen, or desktop, link site World Wide Web run Microsoft or it partner. Microsoft's contract company that connect people Internet and business that sell good and service Web require favored treatment Internet Explorer Navigator exchange link Windows desktop. In wake lawsuit, Microsoft ha voluntarily dropped some these requirement, though it could reinstate them will. Microsoft say that it contract are legal because they produce tangible benefit customer, including easier Internet access. The Justice Department say that bundling Explorer Windows 95 and inclusion browser part Windows 98 amount tying, illegal practice that force customer one product purchase another. The contract manufacturer and Internet service are illegal, government say, because they are intended not only create monopoly browser market protect Microsoft's existing monopoly operating system. The latter threat is key, according Justice Department. Browsers have potential, operating system, act software platform which other program run. So contract intended drive browser out market would also insulate Windows monopoly. Many antitrust expert say problem facing Justice Department is that court have provided no clear definition tying and no clear guideline determining when contract are illegally exclusionary. Professor Lawrence White New York University, who wa chief economist Justice Department's antitrust division early 1980s, say that court treat tying unusual practice when fact it is ubiquitous. No one, he said, would challenge right manufacturer tie eraser tip pencil, tire automobile or button shirt. His point, shared widely economist, is that some tying benefit consumer if, example, it result product that are easier use or enables company recover development cost. But tying can be bad if it lock monopoly power. The court, White say, have not offered enough guidance distinguishing good tying bad, which is nub legal dispute. Microsoft say it need only show that bundling Windows and Explorer pass what might be called gross consumer benefit test that it offer immediate benefit, whether or not it cause long-term damage competition and, therefore, ultimately consumer. The Justice Department say that Microsoft's practice must clear higher hurdle: yielding net consumer benefit that are immediate and large enough balance possible long-term harm competition. So which test consumer benefit satisfies antitrust law? The simple answer is that no one know sure, which is why side can reasonably cite same case fear embarrassment. Consider 1985 case, Aspen Skiing Co. v. Aspen Highlands Skiing Corp., and 1951 case, Lorain Journal Co. v. United States. In first, Aspen Skiing, owner three major ski run Aspen, Colo. monopolist had year sold ticket cooperation Aspen Highlands, competitor, that gave skier access companies' run. When Aspen Skiing unilaterally canceled agreement, it rival's revenue shriveled and rival sued. The Supreme Court ruled that Aspen Skiing had violated antitrust law because there wa no evidence it action helped consumer. In Lorain Journal case, only local newspaper Lorain, Ohio, refused sell advertising company that advertised new radio station. Here, too, Supreme Court ruled that exclusionary practice nothing benefit consumer. Indeed, Aspen Skiing, court forced monopolist do business it rival, precedent that augur well Justice Department, which seek force Microsoft install Netscape's browser alongside it own. But Charles Rule, legal consultant Microsoft, say that case court threw out exclusionary practice only because they offered no consumer benefit. The court, he argues, never pounced practice that resulted lower price or better product or service. Nor court either case call balancing immediate benefit hypothetical long-term harm. Rule argues that Microsoft's practice produce demonstrable consumer benefit. Besides, he say, action taken The Lorain Journal or Aspen Skiing, Microsoft's contract do not prevent consumer installing Netscape's browser or using Web site Microsoft's rival. In truth, though, neither case answered what consumer benefit test should apply product design. In Jefferson Parish Hospital District No. 2 et al. v. Hyde, another case cited side, Supreme Court 1984 recognized that surgeon and anesthesiologist provide integrated service. Yet, court said, hospital monopoly power would still not be allowed force surgical patient use it panel anesthesiologist if consumer wanted purchase two service separately. That principle could undercut Microsoft's defense that functional interdependence Windows and Explorer requires bundling. But Microsoft will point strong concurring opinion that called tougher standard government meet when it alleges tying. Microsoft will also draw support several court ruling that allowed IBM change design it computer way that made it hard vendor attach peripheral equipment. But perhaps Microsoft's best argument is that nowhere ha government identified single case which court explicitly called throwing out tied product basis balancing test. The court, Microsoft will emphasize, steer clear redesigning technically sophisticated product. The Justice Department's rejoinder is note that sole purpose antitrust law is protect consumer, so it make no sense bless practice that provide dollar's worth benefit today but, stamping out competition, drive price $1,000 tomorrow. The Justice Department will ask court least insist that monopolist use least exclusionary mean possible achieve service they provide customer. Experts agree that court will subject Microsoft's restrictive contract Internet company balancing test. But exactly how court will decide whether consumer are helped or hurt is grab. A balancing test would have court weigh immediate benefit consumer one-click access Internet site and feature bundled Windows-Explorer package harm time diminished competition market browser and operating system. But test that make good sense theory can prove fiendishly difficult use practice. Balancing test are impossibly difficult and arbitrary, said Rep. Thomas Campbell, R-Calif., who is former law professor Stanford University. The practical effect balancing is hand defendant Microsoft almost certain victory. Microsoft argues and many antitrust expert agree that court have fact gravitated away balancing test simpler predation test exclusionary contract. Under this standard, contract is illegal only if it is intended drive out competition and thus pave way monopolist raise price later. Microsoft will have easier time defending itself charge predation, which amount victimizing it customer, it would defending itself charge that it bundled product doe consumer slightly more harm good. The antitrust record, say William Baxter, who headed antitrust division President Reagan, is littered contradictory, ambiguous and sometimes nonsensical verdict. He and other legal expert agree that if nothing else, that record leaf plenty legal leeway Supreme Court, should it hear Microsoft case, stiffen spine antitrust law. Shortly government filed it antitrust suit Microsoft Corp. May, Joel Klein, assistant attorney general charge Justice Department's antitrust division, met Silicon Valley executive. The executive recall telling Klein that unless case went Internet browser market, it would have little effect Microsoft's power stifle competition computer industry. Klein replied that he understood computer executive's concern. But he said time wa running short and strongest evidence hand involved Microsoft's battle Netscape Communications Corp. market so-called browser software used navigating Internet. This is Netscape case, executive recall Klein saying. But five month later, case that government is bringing trial Monday extends well Netscape and browser war embrace what it described recent court filing broad pattern anti-competitive conduct Microsoft. Netscape, government insists, is still prime example pattern only one several example. The 12-person witness list Justice Department and 20 state suing Microsoft reflects new evidence added case May. James Barksdale, Netscape's president and chief executive, will appear first, he will be followed executive representing cross section nation's high-technology company including Intel, IBM, Sun Microsystems, Apple Computer, America Online and Intuit. In bringing more ambitious, complicated case trial one it filed May, government ha chosen high-risk strategy. The law state that new evidence can be added suit it is filed, not new charge. And so, his federal courtroom Washington, U.S.District Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson could decide rule out some new evidence ranging too far afield original suit. But if government win it broadened case, court-ordered remedy would no doubt be far tougher Microsoft. In May, government's suggested step amounted equal treatment Netscape's browser and Microsoft's browser. But government recently asked that judge hold separate hearing remedy, if it win case. The remedy consideration now include more basic change Microsoft's business practice perhaps breakup company intended loosen Microsoft's grip computing. That would be precisely kind sweeping reform that Microsoft's foe would applaud. The government ha doubled bet and doubled stake, said David Yoffie, professor Harvard business school who is co-author book, Competing Internet Time: Lessons From Netscape and Its Battle With Microsoft. Meanwhile, Microsoft camp, government's strategy is dismissed desperate act taken court ruling June that threatened undermine antitrust suit. That ruling came separate case, involving interpretation consent decree that Microsoft signed Justice Department 1995. In June ruling, federal appeal court said that Microsoft could bundle it browser it industry-standard Windows operating system and call them one product. The appeals-court ruling would seem undercut assertion government's current antitrust case that browser and operating system were two separate product, bundled together and given away effort thwart competition browser market. With appeals-court ruling June, government lost heart it case, said Charles Rule, former senior official Justice Department, who is now consultant Microsoft. So it ha taken blunderbuss approach scrambling throw everything it can find evidence Justice Department ha had year gun barrel and see what hit. The June appellate ruling shake prosecution team. But mostly it strengthened hand those Justice Department who had been urging that case be broadened, according people who have worked investigation. At same time, they say, new evidence wa coming investigation moved ahead and prosecutor raced meet accelerated trial schedule approved court. Speed wa priority outset, they say. The Justice Department and state filed their suit May move Microsoft's new operating system, Windows 98, wa introduced June. While not seeking block release Windows 98, government lawyer wanted get the courtroom early possible PC maker and computer user adopt this latest version Microsoft's Windows operating system, which function central nervous system more 90 percent personal computer sold. The key allegation, government lawyer note, have not changed May namely, that Microsoft illegally used it market power operating system defend it monopoly position and try extend new market. But only thing that wa wrapped bow time May filing wa browser, said one person who worked case. The real game plan wa always get broader case. What is more, one person noted, prosecution team wa not full strength shortly suit wa filed. David Boies, renowned courtroom litigator and former partner Cravath, Swaine &AMP; Moore who successfully defended IBM it 13-year confrontation government, wa named special counsel Justice Department last December. But Boies, who left Cravath last year, not start working full-time Justice Department mid-April, because he wa still finishing private case his firm, Boies &AMP; Schiller. The antitrust suit filed May leaned heavily Netscape story, mentioning Microsoft's main rival browser market some 130 time complaint and supporting memorandum. But it also prominently mentioned Microsoft's tactic Sun Microsystems, creator Java, Internet programming language, and cited it example Microsoft's behavior. It wa crafted template that could be added much stretching, one person involved case said. And so, new evidence piled and seemed fit pattern, Klein step step approved widening case, person said. And that explains, person continued, how it is that evidence that ha been hand Justice Department year ha been added case May; only gathering new evidence it become apparent that older material fit pattern current case. For example, government ha added contention that Microsoft pressured Intel Corp., big microchip maker and close partner Microsoft, curb it development effort multimedia and Internet software because they might conflict Microsoft's plan. The government contends that arm-twisting occurred meeting two company three year ago, especially one Aug. 2, 1995, which wa attended Andrew Grove, Intel chairman, and Bill Gates, Microsoft chairman. Part government's evidence Intel-Microsoft episode is copy handwritten note taken Steven McGeady, Intel vice president who attended meeting, and memo written him Aug. 28, 1995. The memo, still court seal, said that Gates made vague threat and wa livid Intel's investment Internet and wanted them stopped. A handwritten note, also court seal, quote Paul Maritz, Microsoft executive, saying that Netscape is their common enemy and that Intel's role should be fill stuff and Microsoft's strategy. These document were sent Intel Justice Department's office San Francisco November 1995, response Civil Investigative Demand civil subpoena served Intel Nov. 10, 1995. On it own, Intel material wa intriguing, it became part antitrust suit only other evidence surfaced, one person close case said. The government is contending that Microsoft also tried urge Apple stop selling it Quicktime multimedia software Windows market and tried convince Real Networks Inc. pull back market so-called streaming software. The government case ha also broadened, people involved case say, more witness industry have been increasingly willing testify. In beginning, most people industry believed that government would lose and Microsoft would retaliate if they came forward, one person said. But strength our case wa perceived improve, more people were willing come forward, and thing snowballed. You get Intel, it's easier get Apple and so on. ","Business rivals are seeking to break Microsoft Corp.'s monopoly on computer operating systems.The Government and 20 states have filed an anti-trust suit against Microsoft, invoking the Sherman Anti-trust Act of 1890.The suit began with a Microsoft vs Netscape battle over browser software but now extends far beyond that aiming at Microsoft's overall aggressive anti-competitive conduct.The effort is extensive but inconsistent because of the ambiguity of anti-trust laws, especially the Sherman Act.The Government is examining Microsoft's financial records and painting a dark image of its Chairman Bill Gates.An unpublished book may be crucial to the trial.","In 1998 the Justice Department filed a civil suit against Microsoft to change its 9-year pattern of anti-competitive conduct.Bill Gates appears a schemer ready to crush competitors by any means.He uses Microsoft's clout to squelch internet competition.A 1996 Netscape complaint over browsers was central to the case, which grew to include Intel, IBM, Sun, Apple, AOL, and Intuit.Microsoft was ordered to let Justice examine its records and sought a trial delay.An unpublished book provided evidence.The 1890 Sherman Anti-Trust Act centered on Standard Oil and was intended to protect consumers, but its wording is broad and rulings have been ambiguous.","The Justice Department and 20 states filed a suit against Microsoft for violation of the Sherman Act, charging it illegally tried to use its dominance as the provider of Windows, the industry standard operating system, to stifle competition in other areas.At the heart of the case are Microsoft's contracts with computer manufacturers that prohibit them from substituting Netscape's Navigator browser for Microsoft's Internet Explorer, but Justice also alleges Microsoft exhibited a broad pattern of anti-competitive conduct with numerous other software companies.Microsoft says that Windows and its browser is one tool that offers immediate consumer benefit.","The government suit against Microsoft is the most aggressive antitrust case in a quarter century.The heart of the case is the Internet browser battle between Microsoft and Netscape.Microsoft says that its Internet Explorer is an integral part of its Windows system, the industry dominant operating system.Microsoft, it is argued, has told computer manufacturers that if they want Windows, they must forgo Netscape.The Justice Department and 20 states are joined in the action brought under the Sherman Antitrust Act.Microsoft's chairman, Bill Gates, usually seen as a visionary is portrayed in much darker tones in the trial."
1038,"An Islamic militant group Thursday threatened retaliate if Saudi dissident Osama bin Laden is arrested, and described Washington's No. 1 enemy hero Muslims worldwide. Bin Laden, believed be Afghanistan, and top aide were indicted Wednesday US. District Court US. embassy bombing Africa and are accused conspiring kill Americans United States. The State Department also announced reward dlrs 5 million bin Laden's capture. It is challenge entire Muslim world . Bin Laden is hero Muslim world, said Omar Warsi, leader Pakistan's militant Sunni Muslim group, Sipah-e-Sahaba, or Guardians Friends Prophet. If anything happens him, America will be responsible. Many Sipah-e-Sahaba follower are fighting neighboring Afghanistan alongside Taliban army, which rule 90 percent Afghanistan and ha imposed strict version Islamic law those area. Warsi's group is well-armed everything machine gun rocket launcher. In Pakistan, it ha been blamed killing hundred Shiite Muslims, whom group reviles non-Muslims based centuries-old dispute who wa proper successor Prophet Mohammed. Harakat-ul-Ansar, Pakistan-based organization labeled terrorist group United States, said, however, that foreigner Pakistan have nothing fear u. Harakat is considered strong supporter bin Laden, and several Harakat follower were killed US. missile attack alleged bin Laden terror site Afghanistan. What United States doe is their business, said Abdul Bassit, Harakat follower. He added, however, that United States should know bin Laden is good Muslim, and all Muslim world think he is good Muslim. The Taliban say bin Laden is respected guest who will not be extradited. However, they have set judicial inquiry accept evidence bin Laden's involvement terrorist activity and have promised prosecute him if evidence warrant it. Washington blame bin Laden's group, al Qaeda, Aug. 7 bombing US. embassy Kenya and Tanzania that killed 224 people, including 12 Americans, and injured estimated 5,000 people. The United States retaliated Aug. 20, firing Tomahawk cruise missile suspected bin Laden training camp eastern Afghanistan. At least 26 people were killed, damage area wa not considered extensive. The US. Embassy Pakistan evacuated nonessential staff and family member prior August bombing Afghanistan, fearing retaliation. While some embassy worker are back, their dependent and 30 percent staff have not been allowed return. Embassy official said no fresh security warning followed Wednesday's indictment. Security measure already place include cement barricade blocking road leading US. Embassy Islamabad and razor-sharp barbed wire topping brick-walled compound. In northwestern Pakistani city Peshawar, border Afghanistan, US. consulate is surrounded barbed wire and protected armored personnel carrier and dozen armed police. The New York Times said editorial Monday, Oct. 26: Since deadly bombing two American embassy Africa August, there ha been troubling accumulation evidence that State Department inexplicably ignored warning possible terrorist attack installation. The latest and most disturbing account suggests that nine month truck bombing Kenya, department received detailed description planned attack little strengthen security embassy. The pattern negligence demand examination Clinton administration and Congress. Shortly bombing, department acknowledged that American ambassador Kenya, Prudence Bushnell, had earlier recommended that embassy be moved safer location. Her advice wa rejected. On Friday, Raymond Bonner and James Risen The New York Times reported that Egyptian now believed have been directly involved bombing outlined Kenya plot American intelligence official last November. Mustafa Mahmoud Said Ahmed's account wa so specific he said terrorist were planning detonate truck bomb embassy's underground garage that it called more temporary increase security. Unhappily, it wa discounted, thought be ruse lure embassy new security measure that terrorist could monitor and defeat. The logic this is hard fathom, and harder still explain relative Americans and Kenyans killed attack nearly identical plan Ahmed described. Since bombing, department ha been quick close embassy temporarily if attack seem imminent. It would be interesting know if intelligence those decision wa any more credible Ahmed's warning. No one State Department is happy department's handling security matter, tendency blame limited funding and bureaucratic inertia is disheartening. Of course, additional money would have made it possible harden defense more embassy, and Congress ha now added security budget. But more decisive leadership department could have assured preventive step were taken East Africa. The Taliban's chief justice accused United States Wednesday looking excuse launch another missile attack his war-shattered homeland. And that excuse is Osama bin Laden, man Washington call Enemy No. 1 and blame Aug. 7 bombing US. embassy East Africa, Justice Noor Mohammed Saqib said interview The Associated Press. On Aug. 20 United States retaliated firing Tomahawk missile suspected terrorist camp eastern Afghanistan, killing 26 people. According US. intelligence source, camp were being used train member bin Laden's al Qaeda terrorist group. America is looking excuse fire more rocket our dear Afghanistan and that excuse is bin Laden, Saqib said. Washington, which ha posted dlrs 5 million reward bin Laden's arrest, hasn't ruled out further attack Afghanistan. Saqib, who head judicial inquiry established Taliban investigate terrorism charge bin Laden, say United States ha become insecure. America fear it shadow . every part world it is afraid and see every danger connected bin Laden, he said interview Afghan capital Kabul. In Afghanistan, bin Laden is considered honored guest his Taliban host. They cite Afghan tradition, which demand host guarantee his guest protection. So far Saqib say he ha no evidence bin Laden's involvement terrorist activity. The Taliban have refused turn bin Laden United States, they say if there is evidence they will try him Islamic law. In 90 percent Afghanistan ruled Taliban harsh brand Islamic justice ha been imposed, including death penalty. We want good relation United States and all Muslim and non-Muslim country, they have respect our way, he said. Saqib said his inquiry will wind Nov. 20 and if there is no evidence bin Laden case will be closed least Taliban. Bin Laden is not sinful man . America ha been silent . they have given no evidence, he said. It is too shameful America who is now seen all that world have no reason go bin Laden. The man accused orchestrating US. embassy bombing Tanzania and Kenya wa declared free man Friday Afghanistan, where he ha lived year permission hard-line Islamic Taliban militia. The Taliban, who control 90 percent Afghanistan, Friday closed their three-week inquiry allegation that Osama bin Laden is waging war terror United States. It's over, and America ha not presented any evidence, Afghanistan's chief justice, Noor Mohammed Saqib, told The Associated Press interview Supreme Court building Afghan capital, Kabul. Without any evidence, bin Laden is man sin. . He is free man. The Taliban have told bin Laden, however, that political activity is banned and he ha agreed respect that, Taliban information minister said statement Friday. The minister, Amir Khan Muttaqi, also disputed US. assertion that bin Laden is rich man, saying Saudi dissident ha had his foreign asset frozen, claim not immediately corroborated. Police and soldier Friday blocked street front house where member terrorist gang are believed have assembled bomb that blew US. Embassy, killing 11 people. Wearing glove and mask, detective Tanzanian Criminal Investigation Division could be seen searching yard house that is surrounded high fence. Residents, who were questioned Thursday Tanzanian police and FBI agent, told reporter Friday there were four regular visitor house. They all came night and used white 1989 Suzuki Samuri, which is police custody. Two men, Tanzanian Rashid Saleh Hemed and Egyptian Mustafa Mahmoud Said Ahmed, have been formally charged Tanzanian magistrate Aug. 7 embassy bombing. Police are looking two other suspect identified Ahmad Khalfan, Tanzanian Omani origin and Fahad, Kenyan Yemeni origin. A relative Hemed told The Associated Press house Bungoni neighborhood Ilala district had been rented Ahmad Khalfan. The house is south center Dar e Salaam and 6.5 kilometer (4 mile) southwest embassy building. The relative, who spoke condition anonymity, said addition Khalfan, three other visitor house were Fahad, Ahmed and Hussein. He not furnish second name them, and it wa not clear whether Ahmed wa same Egyptian charged Dar e Salaam bombing. Residents said police showed them photograph, they were not able identify them because it wa always dark when they arrived and left. But all were able identify Suzuki vehicle. Officials believe 1987 Nissan Atlas refrigerator truck actually carried bomb embassy compound. It ha been identified it chassis, all that remains. There ha been speculation that two men Suzuiki used remote control device detonate bomb. A nearly simultaneous attack neighboring Kenya killed 213 people, including 12 Americans, US. Embassy Nairobi. US. authority have charged four people connection Nairobi blast. Three are custody New York, and fourth is fugitive. Mohamed Sadeek Odeh, one three men custody United States Nairobi bombing, told police Pakistan where he wa arrested arriving Nairobi Aug. 7 that Ahmad Khalfan wa member group responsible bombing Dar e Salaam. According same Pakistani police source, Odeh identified Fahad being involved Nairobi embassy bombing. A federal grand jury Manhattan returned 238-count indictment Wednesday charging Saudi exile Osama bin Laden conspiring bomb two US. embassy Africa August and committing act terrorism Americans abroad. Government official immediately announced that they were offering two reward $5 million each information leading arrest or conviction bin Laden and another man charged Wednesday, Muhammad Atef, who wa described bin Laden's chief military commander. Bin Laden is believed be living Afghanistan protection Taliban, Islamic fundamentalist movement that rule that country. Atef's whereabouts are unknown. Prosecutors also unsealed earlier indictment, issued June, that included similar le detailed charge bin Laden. That indictment wa returned embassy bombing and wa result two-year investigation his activity Somalia and Saudi Arabia, well report that he had connection circle Islamic militant Brooklyn. The new indictment, which supersedes June action, accused bin Laden leading vast terrorist conspiracy 1989 present, which he wa said be working concert government, including those Sudan, Iraq and Iran, and terrorist group, build weapon and attack American military installation. But indictment give few detail bin Laden's alleged involvement embassy attack. The indictment doe not, example, specify whether prosecutor have evidence that bin Laden gave direct order those who carried out attack. Nothing document indicates why original indictment wa kept secret month, secret charge were returned time that American official were plotting possible raid Afghanistan arrest bin Laden.

The 13-year prison term given Xu Wenli 3 1/2-hour trial Beijing wa longest Chinese dissident three year. His colleague China Democracy Party, Wang Youcai, wa sentenced 11 year, verdict announced court Hangzhou four day his trial. Xu's conviction deprives would-be opposition group potent organizer and fractured dissident community large strong and moderating voice. Xu remained defiant his tightly controlled trial subversion charge. He refused answer question prosecutor and judge and responded only those his lawyer, court-appointed attorney, Mo Shaoping, said. When court asked if he would appeal, Xu Wenli said he would not appeal, Mo said, quoting his client saying this is political persecution. Xu's daughter also criticized verdict.

But government failed this test, and now my father ha go jail again it, said daughter Xu Jin, graduate student Boston University. Security force have orchestrated concerted crackdown, trampling China's slim legal safeguard crush China Democracy Party. In three week, least 32 people have been detained or questioned and Xu, Wang and another leading member, Qin Yongmin, have been put trial. All three were charged trying subvert China's Communist Party-led system. Xu and Qin were given le four day prepare their defense. Last Thursday, Wang and Qin faced trial legal counsel police detained or scared potential lawyer. No verdict ha been announced Qin's case.

Members China Democracy Party will struggle end realization democracy, said Gao Hongmin, whose home wa surveillance. Gao, who helped Xu organize party's Beijing branch, said authority would not be able arrest all party's supporter. In just six month, party attracted enough try register branch 14 province and city. The US. government and exiled dissident, many whom supported party's effort, denounced sentence and called dissidents' release. We are deeply disappointed guilty verdict and extremely harsh sentence given Mr. Xu, said US. Embassy spokesman Bill Palmer. No individual should be arrested, tried or sentenced exercising internationally recognized freedom. Xu, 55, edited underground journal Democracy Wall movement 20 year ago and spent 12 year prison, mostly solitary confinement. Since his parole ended last year, he ha been behind-the-scenes advisor host dissident activity. He supported Qin Yongmin, another Democracy Wall veteran, setting independent human right monitor and advised run local legislative seat Beijing.

Police have sporadically detained supporter democracy party. The decisive move came Nov. 30 Chinese Communist Party leader Jiang Zemin returned Japan, ending busy two year diplomatic foray. In speech broadcast nationwide Friday, Jiang warned subversive trying bring system and vowed never copy Western democracy. To allay international criticism, China released respected labor right campaigner, Liu Nianchun, 3 1/2 year prison camp Sunday and sent him exile United States. German Foreign Minister Joschka Fischer, who drew China's anger recently meeting exiled dissident Wei Jingsheng, said China's sentencing two dissident Monday wa unacceptable and flouted international treaty country recently signed. The reaction Chinese court is totally unacceptable, Fischer said, calling dissidents' immediate release. The accused simply tried peaceful mean exercise their right free speech and assembly, which are guaranteed China's constitution, and United Nations' International Covenant Civil and Political Rights which China recently signed, Fischer said statement. Chinese court sentenced dissident Xu Wenli and Wang Youcai 13 and 11 year trying organize opposition political party. Hours China wa expected sign key UN. human right treaty and host British Prime Minister Tony Blair, police hauled prominent human right campaigner questioning Monday. Qin Yongmin's latest run-in authority came he tried second time week legally register human right monitoring group. Qin said civil affair official Hubei provincial capital Wuhan accused him engaging illegal activity. The police came soon he returned home. As I'm sending this statement, Wuhan Public Security Bureau is again taking me away, Qin said hastily scrawled message bottom typed statement faxed reporter. Qin, detained briefly two week ago, wa questioned three hour being released and threatened prosecution if he persisted trying set his China Human Rights Observer. Qin hoped harassment would stop China sign International Covenant Civil and Political Rights, he said if local authority don't observe treaty we will unswervingly push ahead protecting human right last. China plan sign International Covenant Civil and Political Rights Monday United Nations. By time ink is dry, Blair should be landing Beijing Tuesday morning first visit British prime minister seven year. The treaty is supposed guarantee freedom speech and assembly. But China sign, treaty would not come force ratified legislature, which may attach reservation effectively nullifying some provision. Blair ha vowed discus difference human right Chinese leader. His visit ha drawn appeal dissident and international press freedom group urging him persuade Chinese leader free political prisoner. In open letter, three dissident said that while Chinese leader say they respect human right principle, law and practice government allows right abuse and persecution dissident. Thousands political prisoner are believed remain Chinese prison, labor camp or detention center, said letter, copy which wa released Hong Kong-based Information Center Human Rights and Democratic Movement China. The letter called release Shi Binhai, journalist who compiled popular book political change; Fang Jue, businessman who called openly political reform; and other imprisoned activist. Paris-based Reporters Without Borders urged Blair call release Gao Yu, Liu Xiaobo and Liu Jingsheng. The three are 13 journalist imprisoned simply attempting practice their profession, it said statement. By sentencing two country's most prominent democracy campaigner long prison term, China Monday took it harshest step it current crackdown organized political opposition. After trial that lasted just three and half hour, Xu Wenli 55 dean dissident movement, and man who ha already spent 12 year prison advocating democracy wa sentenced 13 year subversion state power. Xu's alleged crime included helping organize new political party, calling end Communist rule interview foreign journalist, calling independent labor union and, prosecutor said, accepting $500 dissident abroad. He wa defended lawyer who wa appointed court just four day ago and met his client only once. Also sentenced Monday, 11 year prison, wa Wang Youcai, 32, founder China Democracy Party, which ha now been suppressed. Wang wa tried subversion charge Thursday brief court session, no defense lawyer, eastern city Hangzhou. The punishment third veteran democracy campaigner, Qin Yongmin, 44, ha not been announced. His trial began central city Wuhan Thursday and may reconvene Tuesday, relative said. A similarly long sentence is expected. Monday's sentence, which came just six month President Clinton's visit Beijing, where he publicly challenged China's leader move quickly political reform, were harshly criticized State Department. They also appeared spell effective end here China Democracy Party, which these three men, hundred lesser-known individual, tried organize recent month. The long sentence also crushed hope many liberal intellectual here that China's warming relation United States recent year and it signing global treaty human right might bring significant easing political control. Xu wa tried Monday morning Beijing Intermediate Court. When brief recess three-judge panel announced his 13-year sentence, Xu stood and shouted, I protest! said his wife 28 year, He Xintong. Then, said Ms. He and lawyer who were present, he shouted that judge were unfair and that he would not appeal his case because proceeding were illegitimate. With sentencing Xu, China's Communist government ha silenced one it most energetic and persistent critic, one who ha given his adult life cause democracy. Xu first came prominence Democracy Wall movement late 1970s, then served 12 year prison, much it solitary confinement. In last several month, sensing new opportunity speak out and making constant use fax machine and e-mail, he and Qin tried draw attention China's obligation two international covenant it ha signed one economic and cultural right, and one civil and political right. In face several temporary detention and stiff warning, they continued their activity. Wang, contrast, first became involved dissident activity 1989, while graduate student physic Beijing, when he became leader Tiananmen Square demonstration. After student movement wa smashed army, he wa most-wanted list, then wa arrested and spent two year prison. During Clinton's visit China June, Wang announced formation China Democracy Party. Hundreds country, including Xu and Qin, began promoting idea. But while government ha allowed somewhat freer discussion political topic university and obscure journal last year, it ha not allowed any challenge print or form organized group principle Communist Party rule. In speech Friday celebrating 20 year economic reform, president and Communist Party chief, Jiang Zemin, emphasized primacy party, saying, The Western mode political system must never be adopted. After learning Monday's sentence, American Embassy here, which ha spent last two year building improved relation China and United States, issued strong condemnation what it termed deplorable decision. We are deeply disappointed guilty verdict and extremely harsh sentence, statement said. No individual should be arrested, tried and sentenced exercising internationally recognized freedom, including those guaranteed International Covenant Civil and Political Rights, which China ha committed itself. Like Thursday's trial, which proceeded no defense attorney because prospective lawyer had been warned police or detained, Monday's proceeding showed that case involving security issue, police and court could write their rule. According criminal procedure law, defendant are be notified least 10 day trial, Xu wa told only four day ago that his trial would be Monday. His wife, who Monday had not been allowed contact him his arrest Nov. 30, wa told three day ago. Under law, defendant also have right lawyer their choice, Xu wa assigned lawyer court late last week. Before Monday morning's trial, lawyer, Mo Shaoping, saw his client only one brief meeting, associate Mo's said. Xu's wife refused meet lawyer trial. Meeting him would be tantamount cooperating whole charade, she said telephone interview this weekend. Responding accusation Monday morning's trial, Xu's lawyer argued that Xu had engaged peaceful expression his view and that this could not amount subversive activity state, associate lawyer said. But decision that wa clearly preordained, court declared Xu guilty and sentenced him spend what may be much rest his life prison. Born 1943 southeastern province Jiangxi, Xu wa interested politics teen-ager, his wife said. In 1960s, idealistic Marxist, he decided get his learning society rather attend university. He served navy five year, then became electrician Beijing railroad becoming involved democracy movement and going prison. On Monday afternoon, police station hour trial finished, Xu wa allowed half-hour his wife. He told me he'd be able handle pain, she later recounted telephone interview. He said that this would give him time think thing and calmly reflect what ha happened. Ms. He, who ha been married Xu 1971, said she expected see him monthly visit prison. The couple ha daughter, Xu Jin, who is graduate student fine art Boston University. In earlier interview, soon her husband wa arrested Nov. 30, Ms. He said Xu had told her, I can't change way I am. If he received long sentence, he told his wife, she should go and enjoy her life. And if I die, Xu said they parted that day, please plant tree me. Six month President Clinton traveled Beijing and challenged China's leader move rapidly political reform, administration's policy engaging Beijing wa called question Monday when Chinese court sentenced three nation's most prominent dissident long jail sentence. Critics China Capitol Hill and human right group said tough prison term were evidence failure administration's policy encouraging trade and diplomatic tie China hope democratic reform. The dissident Xu Wenli, who wa sentenced Monday 13 year prison, Wang Youcai, who received 11-year sentence, and Qin Yongming, who wa reported have received 12 year were charged subversion. The State Department said it had received report source it not identify that third leading democracy campaigner, Qin Yongmin, had been sentenced 13 year prison trial last week city Wuhan. Relatives Qin China denied report, however, and said that his trial continued. Given Clinton's effusive praise China's senior leader his trip Beijing last summer, administration found itself defensive Monday and harshly criticized prison sentence, it continued insist that administration's policy engagement wa helping push Beijing democracy. James Foley, State Department spokesman, said United States deeply deplores jail term and called immediate release dissident. These three men appear have been involved nothing more effort form new political party, he said. While condemning prison sentence, Foley and other American official were careful note administration's assessment that there had been progress human right China, some it linked Clinton's meeting Beijing Chinese President Jiang Zemin. There had been improvement human right situation China, modest improvement, Foley said. The severe prison term and other recent instance harassment democracy campaigner China are step backward relationship what had been improved human right performance, he said. Critics administration's China policy noted that long prison sentence were handed out le week Jiang delivered pointed speech Beijing which he made clear that China's economic reform were not prelude Western-style democracy. The Western mode political system must never be copied, he said, adding that those who challenged Communist Party's supremacy would be crushed. Rep. Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., who ha long been China's harshest critic Congress, said prison sentence handed out Xu and Wang were clearest demonstration president's visit China last summer Beijing's true intention human right. They are pathetic, really pathetic, she said administration. The administration can say what it want, it must know Monday that it policy China is embarrassment. What Chinese have learned is that they have all latitude world. Mike Jendrzejczyk, Washington director Human Rights Group, said jail term were proof need administration revise it China policy, which he described almost entirely driven administration's desire encourage trade. He said that while there had been some sign progress human right situation China last year notably, China's agreement sign international treaty civil and economic right overall picture wa bleak. On balance, he said, any progress China ha made allowing greater openness may have been canceled out more repressive attitude. Human Rights Watch, largest American-based human right group, called administration consider postponing or canceling planned visit China early next year Commerce Secretary William Daley and high-level trade delegation protest prison sentence. That would get Beijing's attention, Jendrzejczck said. Other China expert and scholar insisted that administration wa right continue it policy engagement China, and that there wa reason believe that political reform would follow economic reform, Clinton ha argued. Peter Rodman, former Nixon and Reagan administration official now Nixon Center Washington, said that United States cannot control evolution society complex China's. He said harsh prison sentence given out Monday dissident were be expected, especially Xu and Wang had been involved trying set political party challenge Communists. The pattern this regime is that every once while, they ease bit and somebody go too far and there's crisis, he said. I don't think you can blame United States this crackdown, nor can you give u credit any political reform. On human right, I just don't think there's much more we can do. China released respected, ailing labor right campaigner prison work camp Sunday and immediately sent him exile United States. Releasing Liu Nianchun appeared be attempt government blunt international criticism Monday's upcoming trial prominent dissident Xu Wenli. Xu is third leading member would-be opposition political party put trial subversion three-week crackdown that ha seen least 32 dissident arrested or interrogated. Beijing police Sunday detained one Xu's China Democracy Party colleague, Zha Jianguo, prevent him attending trial, Xu's wife said. Although pleased that Liu Nianchun wa free, human right group decried Chinese government's timing manipulative. We don't want give any credit Chinese government this cynical game it is playing, said Xiao Qiang, director New York-based Human Rights China. After 3 1/2 year prison, Liu wa taken Tuanhe labor camp outskirt Beijing, driven capital's airport and put Canadian Air flight, ultimately bound New York, his mother and brother said. Accompanying Liu exile wa his wife, Chu Hailan, and their 11-year-old daughter, family said. Liu Nianchun's release follows same pattern China used freeing it two most famous dissident, Wei Jingsheng Nov. 1997 and Wang Dan April. Authorities released Liu medical parole, exactly five month end his prison term, provided he go exile, said his brother and exiled democracy campaigner, Liu Qing. Liu Nianchun, 50, ha been ill-health least two year. In exam authority finally agreed provide last month, doctor discovered Liu had tumor his mouth, stomach and bowel, Liu Qing said. Like Wang and Wei, United States and other Western government have lobbied China release Liu. Chinese leader have been forcing well-known dissident exile throughout 1990s, finding that once abroad they lose their influence dissident home. In only official comment release, Xinhua News Agency reported that judicial department took account Liu's health and behavior labor camp approving his parole medical treatment. I am very happy Liu Nianchun, same time sending people directly prison exile is type human right violation and persecution, Liu Qing said telephone interview his home New York's Brooklyn borough. Liu Nianchun wa one most respected figure fractured, persecuted dissident community. His more 3 1/2 year prison and labor camp wa sad illustration way China's Communist Party ruler punish people they deem threat. Liu wa imprisoned three time 17 year. His last arrest came he signed petition calling labor right May 1995. Liu wa never put trial. Fourteen month passed his wife, Chu Hailan, first learned his fate and whereabouts: three-year spell labor camp frigid, remote northeast. His term wa maximum police may impose criminal suspect trial. Labor camp official later extended Liu's sentence year trying escape, charge Chu claimed wa fabricated. Inside labor camp, Liu once started hunger strike protest his treatment. He wa beaten cattle prod and confined room 2 square meter (2 square yard) where he could only sit or stand. His wife endured police harassment, beating and detention campaigning his release. Chu wa dragged away and hit security force when she tried hand letter UN. human right chief Mary Robinson Beijing hotel September. German Foreign Minister Joschka Fischer, who drew China's anger recently meeting exiled dissident Wei Jingsheng, said China's sentencing two dissident Monday wa unacceptable and flouted international treaty country recently signed. The reaction Chinese authority is totally unacceptable, Fischer said, calling dissidents' immediate release. The accused simply tried peaceful mean exercise their right free speech and assembly, which are guaranteed China's constitution, and United Nations' International Covenant Civil and Political Rights which China recently signed, Fischer said statement. Chinese court sentenced dissident Xu Wenli and Wang Youcai 13 and 11 year trying organize opposition political party. His friend and political mentor is jailed, robbing their budding opposition political party it most potent organizer, Zha Jianguo is not afraid. A bag packed toothbrush, toothpaste and medicine lie ready his Beijing home day Chinese police take him away. He ha told police interrogator he expects be jailed, likely few year le 13 given China Democracy Party leader Xu Wenli Monday. Democracy is process, and that process small number people will be sacrificed, Zha, 47-year-old former manager computer design company and vice chairman party's Beijing branch, told The Associated Press interview Thursday. We want use our sacrifice arouse people, and we believe that sacrifice is worthwhile. With mixture defiance and cool clarity chance success, Zha said he and other China Democracy Party member will continue organizing and campaigning change. His tenacity hold summary trial and harsh punishment Xu, Wang Youcai and Qin Yongmin prominent party principal province who were sentenced 11 and 12 year and threatening sign ruling Communist Party. Chinese President Jiang Zemin warned speech published Wednesday that political subversive threatened what he called China's fragile social order. Whenever any element that undermines stability raise it head, it must be resolutely nipped bud, Jiang said. Zha maintains that such tactic are unnecessary. In it manifesto, Democracy Party espoused peaceful mean target undemocratic system, not political power Communist Party. We believe election held establishment democratic system should decide who ha power, said Zha. What many world consider democracy is legally subversive China threatening Communist Party-led system. In month, authority have arrested and convicted Xu, Qin and Wang and detained or interrogated least 29 other party member. Police took Zha his home Sunday afternoon and held him nearly 24 hour keep him Xu's trial. Until crackdown, China Democracy Party distinguished itself attempt opposition it openness. Organizers publicly announced their intention set party. They tried register authority. Statements were faxed foreign medium and human right group circumvent China's state-controlled medium. Now, party's member 500 Zha's count are being driven underground. Party member will concentrate increasing rank and will be more guarded use telephone and fax and their occasional meeting, Zha said. If Xu and other two were first round, then second is very likely and it will be bigger, Zha said. In such unbalanced contest, we are forced use more secretive mean. The arrest Xu, Wang and Qin deprive party it more influential member, Zha said. All had proven track record, Xu and Qin dissident editor Democracy Wall era movement 20 year ago, Wang student leader Tiananmen Square democracy demonstration 1989. But another aspect, this ha strengthened resolve more party member struggle on, Zha said arrest. Zha got interested politics radical youth, Mao Tse-tung's appeal go countryside 1968. When he returned Beijing 1989, he marched Tiananmen protest and continued his activism. Friends introduced him Xu Wenli 1995. Having been released prison two year before, Xu wa still not openly involved dissident politics, he held court his Beijing home discus China's future.
