Fazil since charge embassy attacks remain large. The report type computer seize last year Kenyan authorities, accord government filing last week U.S. district court Manhattan. Thus far, U.S. prosecutors charge least six members bin Laden's organization terrorist activities conspiracy. In one recent filing, say case part base testimony confidential source, suggest informant agree testify trial bin Laden associates. The arrangement appear result plea bargain source cooperate hopes receive less sentence. There indication source yet sentence seem likely sentence would take place investigation ensue trials complete. In affidavit prepare last week, source acknowledge plead guilty terrorism charges United States say stemmed attacks U.S. targets, specifically identified. The source describe take oath allegiance follow bin Laden's orders, give detailed account bin Laden's group, include history inner workings. The source tell private statements bin Laden al Qaeda members, encourage attack U.S. troops citizens station Middle East Africa. I either hear statements myself, source said, I read learn al Qaeda members. The government also say court papers source help identify bin Laden's signature 1996 document urge Muslims kill Americans. Tayyib's whereabouts unknown could reach comment. The Taliban's chief justice accuse United States Wednesday look excuse launch another missile attack war-shattered homeland.

The minister, Amir Khan Muttaqi, also dispute U.S. assertions bin Laden rich man, say Saudi dissident foreign assets frozen, claim immediately corroborated. One clear unstated objectives last August's raid Afghanistan kill Osama bin Laden many lieutenants possible, administration officials acknowledge. accord officials, White House lawyers conduct secret review months attack conclude operations legal U.S. international law. The officials say raid time 70 cruise missiles would hit bin Laden's camps moment Central Intelligence Agency believe would meet chief operatives. A 1976 executive order bars anyone work U.S. government plot carry assassinations. But officials say White House legal opinion draft Afghan strike assert president authority target infrastructure terrorist groups attack Americans. A top U.S. counterterrorism official say week infrastructure bin Laden's group mostly human. As say time Aug. 20 strike, objective disrupt training, organization infrastructure bin Laden terrorist network Khost camps, say David C. Leavy, spokesman National Security Council White House. Targeting infrastructure, officials acknowledged, also mean destroy leadership terrorist group. Command control enemy justifiable target, Leavy said. Senior administration officials say never discuss kill bin Laden planning sessions. His death, say interviews attack, would simply side benefit. U.S. intelligence officials say believe bin Laden camp day attack, appear leave unscathed missiles hit. Officials say reports least one senior lieutenants may die attack, total casualties complex 50 100. Administration spokesmen draw distinction attempt kill specific person like bin Laden attack group people command terrorist organization. Administration officials deny since August raid intend kill bin Laden, Saudi exile charge federal prosecutors lead global war U.S. interests. He link Aug. 7 bomb two U.S. embassies East Africa. But less subtle explanation offer Oct. 13 Defense Secretary William Cohen, say visit Saudi Arabia United States go bin Laden colleagues. We quite successful, Cohen continued, send message. Kenneth Bacon, Pentagon spokesman, say secretary retract statements. The Los Angeles Times recently report administration believe legal right use deadly force terrorist leaders. Bin Laden's organization significant concern Clinton administration even bomb U.S. embassies East Africa. last spring, officials said, U.S. intelligence consider dare raid Afghanistan capture Saudi exile. Officials say roughly time, White House draft legal justification military attacks terrorist leadership. That review, officials said, provided legal basis August fire cruise missiles meet believe bin Laden lieutenants would gathered. The review, National Security Council, basis say operation violate presidential order ban assassinations. That ban impose President Ford 1975, congressional investigators uncover evidence CIA plot assassinate Fidel Castro, Cuban leader, others. The order said: No person employ by, act behalf United States government shall engage in, conspire engage in, assassination. While is, face, sweep unqualified ban, subject interpretation intense debate years. In 1986, Reagan administration respond terrorist attack U.S. soldiers Germany bomb raid Libya. The targets include residence Libyan leader, Moammar Gadhafi. And Gulf War, U.S. forces use powerful bombs attempt kill Saddam Hussein, president Iraq. The legal review conduct White House would appear provide precedent future operations similar circumstances.

That would 1988, Celtics want compensate Bird $4.9 million bonus push back pain, go savior. Three years later, contract arbitration involve Knicks' Patrick Ewing, agent David Falk would contend NBA conspire Celtics circumvent salary cap, order satisfy Bird.

The process unsealing cap re-sign particular player eventually become known making use Larry Bird exception. And stand, onetime exception become expensive rule owners want play anymore. I understand sides, say Bird, safely middle, Bird, former exception, Bird, present Indiana Pacers' coach. Without get exception, I think important players stay place. Important, meant, franchise stability fan identification. You son 7 years old, go 7 17 10 years played, Bird said. A lot people Boston tell follow me, time young college. The Bird years number three Celtics championships, best player pro basketball's famous team ever had.

If Larry Magic do did, might survive we're go through, say Bill Fitch, Bird's first Celtics coach, who, Bill Walton, stand night that, said, give closure playing career. The owners, always, exaggerate misery, time, much easy root players.

He hire late Bob Woolf, one original heavy-hitting agents, get record rookie contract. then go turned 29-victory catastrophe 61-victory contender. A rare Bird, honest exception rule. Despite modest encouragement new proposal deliver players owners, National Basketball Association Tuesday cancel first two weeks regular season, first time league's 51-year history lose games labor dispute. The NBA's deputy commissioner, Russ Granik, announce cancellation nearly three half hours meetings conclude Manhattan hotel. The decision cancel 99 games Nov. 3 Nov. 16 come players association propose implementation tax system instead hard salary cap, proposal owners say would respond Friday. We try best today try possible salvage season, say Alonzo Mourning, Miami Heat center. Unfortunately, work out. After 35,001 games without blemish, NBA join National Hockey League, National Football League Major League Baseball lose games labor dispute. take account three- four-week period would need training camp free-agent signings season starts, league say would decide two weeks whether make cancellations. I'm sad disappointed, say NBA commissioner, David Stern. I consider collective failure, I honestly know else could done. I things I like think best interests game. And I believe is. The decision come sides agree substantive talks since owners impose lockout player July 1. Seventeen players, include union president Patrick Ewing vice presidents Mitch Richmond, Herb Williams, Dikemebe Mutombo Ty Corbin, attend meeting along Stern, Granik five members ownership committee Madison Square Garden president Dave Checketts owners Abe Pollin Washington, Gordon Gund Cleveland, Les Alexander Houston Jerry Colangelo Phoenix. The talks feature players association imply bevy concessions make owners felt would accommodate league's desire swing revenue pendulum back toward owners. The dispute involve distribution approximately $2 billion league-wide income. The main sticking point owners' insistence salary cap without exceptions, implementation believe would bring player salaries' line revenue growth. While players discuss elimination Larry Bird exception clause allow player secure amount money want re-signing current team address exception taxation proposal. The main points follows: A 50 percent tax would impose salary earn $18 million, clause would affect players exercise Bird rights. For example, player make $20 million, team would force put $1 million fund would likely distribute low-revenue teams. There could provisions make players, say Jeffrey Kessler, chief outside counsel union. We want anything would encourage Chicago get Michael Jordan back. And I think league feels way. The proposal similar luxury tax propose union 1995 negotiations, would nearly liberal. A salary cap credit would go effect league pay 63 percent revenues salary. Whatever figure number reduces salary cap next year. If figure $29 million salary cap, 29 teams would work salary cap $1 million less previous season. But players would assurance salary cap would go least $2 million credit go effect. Also, 63-percent threshold met, reduction annual 20 percent raises would take effect multi-year contracts. Players would either get raise 10 percent rate growth league revenues. The union say clearly addresses league's desire bring salaries line revenues. Since owners re-opened current agreement 57.1 percent revenue go toward salaries, 63-percent figure would probably come substantially owners agree proposal. Teams would get right first refusal free agents fourth year incoming rookies, meaning player would contractually obligate team first four years deal. Currently, rookie scale three years include clause enables player exercise Bird rights two seasons clause Kevin Garnett parlay astronomical $126 million deal last year Minnesota. Finally, players agree make marijuana ban substance. Details testing negotiate specific discussions take place regard test performance-enhancing drugs, provision owners include last proposal. In return concessions, players want increase minimum salary currently $272,500 creation average salary exception. This would allow every team salary cap able sign one free agent per year average salary currently $2.6 million. We're buoy fact first time they've decide submit counterproposal, union's executive director, Billy Hunter, said. I know I'm optimistic, I earnestly say look ballplayers eye say make valiant effort. ask players would finally test financially cancellation games, Hunter added: It's us blinking. We want reach agreement. We're tire rhetoric, we're tire game-playing. Our position along want accept bad deal. Granik say refunds fans would make end calendar month first refund would include monies cancel preseason games. He estimate losses hundreds millions dollars. I think serious concern whether tax system address kind need economically, added. But there's possibility. Added Stern, We owe fans go back look notion whether tax rate might begin achieve result wanted. It look promising, we're go spend next two days see give favorable response. Though decision cancel games surprising, represent major shift prior labor stalemates. Both sides reluctantly hammer deal 1995 start train camp sole notion miss games preserve NBA's perfect record. Tuesday, could come accord. I'd like think last games cancel, Granik said. But unless something else works, there's dramatic breakthrough, I think certainly season that's jeopardy. In decision almost certainly lead first work stoppage National Basketball Association history, league Monday announce cancellation 114 preseason games. Citing stall negotiations Players Association new collective bargaining agreement, league officials say would decide next week whether cancel first week regular season games. While decision expect 10 days, nonetheless send strong signal owners players probably willing cancel least part regular season order settle labor dispute. Both sides agree would take least three weeks hold abbreviated training camps sign 200 free agents new contracts. Privately, officials sides believe season start schedule Nov. 3 even December. Unlike Major League Baseball, National Football League National Hockey League, NBA never lose regular-season game labor strife. Since we're even negotiating, conclude likely we're go miss part regular season, deputy commissioner Russ Granik say Monday night. We'll try defer decisions last minute, right look good. The two sides meet Thursday first official bargaining session since Aug. 6. Commissioner David Stern group owners walk meet dismiss merits new proposal players. Neither Granik players association executive director Billy Hunter sound week's meeting would go long way toward sign new agreement precursor play again. I think choice miss games point, Hunter said. In fact, I think they've intend along. They've lock us out, they've refuse negotiate they've give us proposal that's ludicrous. not sides still await outcome arbitration decision due Oct. 18 - Fordham Law School dean John Feerick rule whether 200 players $800 million guaranteed contracts pay lockout owners players also make time win public opinion test fans' loyalties cancel games. Monday 11 cities throughout country, players hold make-shift press conferences training-camp venues, NBA arenas gymnasiums. Patrick Ewing, union president, several teammates speak SUNY-Purchase Purchase, N.Y., Knicks train season. With training camp originally schedule open Oct. 6, message players clear: owners would call end lockout, would ready play today. About 100 players expect attend, speak sign autograph fans afterward. I wish would put energies try negotiate deal rather various things they've doing, Granik said. The dispute essentially owners players judiciously divvy $2 billion income. It begin last year contention owners employees receive fair share pot. The owners allow terminate current agreement clause enable player salaries reach 53.8 percent total basketball-related income. The owners say figure currently hover around 57.1 percent. Though many economic issues need resolved, main point contention since labor agreement expire owners declare lockout July 1 clause allow teams pay free agents whatever want, regardless salary-cap rules govern NBA's 29 teams. call Larry Bird exception, create allow Hall Fame Boston Celtics forward re-sign Celtics near end career. Michael Jordan exercise clause last two years Chicago Bulls, earn $30 million per season figures $5 million team allow spend players. But exorbitant salaries pay several unproven stars last years $100 million deals sprout routinely, owners determine swing income pendulum back toward enforce restrict salary cap hard cap put ceiling much one player could earn. last year, players receive $1 billion dollars salaries benefits make proposals guaranteed increase number 20 percent next four years, Granik say prepared statement. Our proposals would result average player salary $3.1 million minimum salary 10-year veterans $750,000. Unfortunately, union leadership unwilling give serious consideration offered. Hunter label claims optimistic projections, shot number new proposals present players Sept. 25. If leave current deal place, would get much anyway, added. All we're say is, we're position accept hard cap. Monday's decision cancel preseason come less two weeks NBA indefinitely postpone training camp cancel first week exhibition games. Through tickets sales alone, Granik estimate lose exhibition season would cost league $35 million $40 million. Decisions cancellations regular season games expect make next week, added. A league official say games would cancel blocks one two weeks, depend upon circumstances regard negotiations. Thursday's bargaining session suddenly become last hope start season time. Hurdles could overcome quickly, I reason believe Thursday, Granik said. Added Hunter: Of course expect much get done. When Russ David decide negotiations go real substantive, something happen. What they're banking players go miss paychecks cave November. It's they've ingest something pass. And passes, they'll negotiate. The first substantive talks two months oppose sides National Basketball Association's labor dispute come go Thursday without hint settlement. Still, five-hour meeting describe cordial league almost like two bulls let little steam players association produce another scheduled round talks next Tuesday. Barring major compromise, enough time preserve full season prevent league lose first regular-season games labor strife November. Russ Granik, NBA's deputy commissioner, say league would wait next week's meeting decide cancel regular-season games. He also discuss possibility significantly shorten season. We make determination need exact number games order representative season, Granik said. But recognize beyond certain point can't possibly sell fans we're NBA season. Whether's 60 games, 50 games 49 53, we're yet. We months face decision. perhaps progress involve Thursday conference room midtown Manhattan hotel question-and-answer session league's late proposal players. Patrick Ewing, union president, vice presidents Herb Williams Dikembe Mutombo attend meet union's executive director, Billy Hunter, union lawyers. No owners present, Granik, Commissioner David Stern league's lawyers spend day explain intricacies two-week-old proposal players. At one point two parties break lunch, Stern Hunter raise voices accuse handle constituencies poorly, participant meeting said. But two see shake hands laugh meeting conclude shortly 3 p.m. There vent sides, Hunter said. We've placid respectful. Today, take coats inclined take gloves little bit. have do that, I think kind loosen sides. Hunter added: Did anybody blink today? They're sort look us kind nuance find course negotiations might, way another, give indication we're mouth one thing might open something else. We're look body language, too. I think they're ready make deal. The last formal meeting sides Aug. 6 end Stern owners abruptly march receive proposal players. In critical ruling north american National Basketball Association players' union, arbitrator John Feerick decide Monday whether 200 players guarantee contracts pay lockout. If players win, owners liable dlrs 800 million guarantee salaries, although vowed appeal lose. The league already sue players Feerick's jurisdiction. If win, I think emboldens spirit resolve players, union director Billy Hunter said. But I think anybody celebrate there's guarantee end lockout. It mean pay 200 players, they've indicate us intent file immediate appeal take far order avoid payment. so even rule favor, hollow victory. The players go get pay Nov. 15 circumstance, Hunter said. If owners win, remove last wild card players holding. The sides negotiate since last Tuesday, union propose superstar tax high contracts. The league make counterproposal Friday, ask tax impose much low threshold. Hunter dismiss league's late proposal Friday afternoon, say sides would best serve await Feerick's ruling. It's unlikely negotiations hold week, since union hold meet NBA players agents advisory committee Las Vegas Wednesday Friday. We've get get sense players are, consider reasonable they're willing order get season commence, Hunter said. The union file grievance Feerick lockout impose July 1 owners' announcement June 29 would honor guaranteed deals. In six-day hearing summer, union argue owners protect liable guaranteed salaries work stoppage insert lockout language standard player contract. The Sacramento Kings insert lockout clause center Olden Polynice's contract 1994, approve league. The union use existence clause argue teams protect similarly. most players due receive first paychecks Nov. 15, although dozen clauses entitle pay summer. none receive paycheck. The NBA argue tenet labor law allow employers withhold pay employees lockout. The league also call former union director Simon Gourdine testify. He say understanding negotiate old labor agreement 1995 players would pay owners choose reopen agreement impose lockout. more 220 National Basketball Association players guarantee contracts find Monday whether pay management lockout, long-awaited arbitrator's decision may affect leverage league's dispute players major ramifications american sports-labor law. But neither players owners count rule arbitrator, John Feerick, speed negotiations, especially Feerick find favor players, award could approach $800 million salaries. NBA attorneys indicate union decision go management, seek vacate appeal U.S. District Court Manhattan then, necessary, 2nd U.S. Circuit Court Appeals, process could prevent players get pay several months. The NBA already cancel first two weeks regular season labor dispute. The league litigation pending U.S. District Court Manhattan. If players win ruling, NBA intend renew motion disqualify Feerick. The motion bring last summer grounds collective bargaining agreement exist and, therefore, jurisdiction hear matter. If rules favor, I think emboldens spirit resolve players, say Billy Hunter, union executive director. But understand end lockout. It mean pay 200-some players. And still litigation alive may take resolve. At most, hollow victory. Feerick take full 30 days render decision. Whatever decides, rule watch carefully. There precedent locked-out athletes paid. During NBA summer lockout 1995, players miss paychecks file grievance. Neither National Hockey League players lock first three months 1994-95 season. The union argue owners protect insert clauses non-payment lockouts strikes individual player contracts. In support arguments, union point clauses individual player contracts contain language preclude payment lockout. The league rely basic tenets labor law, hold employees pay strikes lockouts. A ruling union would significant future negotiations players owners. The deterrent factor lockout employees subject collective bargaining agreement get pay agreement expire unable reach new agreement. If Feerick find favor players, economic incentive guarantee contracts reach agreement quickly. They would essentially pay play basketball. If Feerick find favor owners, reality pay may spur players reach agreement quickly. But Hunter dispute notion, conference call Friday talk openly entire season's cancel players would back away ultimate goals. I'm concerned, Hunter said. There's demonstration there's go change resolve. After players saw proposals league recent posturing NBA owners, well, I two players call tell me, need be, they'd willing hock everything they've got. Another significant development may thedeparture many players Europe dispute settled, accord least two player agents. I think would case-by-case basis, yes, there's already people talk that, say Bill Strickland, member union's agents advisory committee. Steve Kauffman, another member committee, say would explore possibility one client, Nets center Rony Seikaly, would sign professional team Greece. We look void deal team, Kauffman said. But would want right work temporarily could come back honor contract.' Russ Granik, NBA deputy commissioner, say league approve idea players' earn living elsewhere lockout settled. Proposals exchange last week include concept luxury-tax system player salaries appear reflect first signs progress negotiations since lockout begin July 1. But sides term figures other's proposal unacceptable, unclear whether either side willing compromise. I think get carry away possibilities yet, Granik said. When explore idea tax system, take players word want make headway. But call first proposal meaningless charitable. They propose something impact. As stands, can't solution. The owners' goal slow growth player salaries relation leaguewide revenue next three years, players want keep earn much possible. As labor battles go, current one National Basketball Association players weird even sports standards. There real possibility most, all, come season canceled. In union battle interests best paid, make union scale, dominate discussion. And workers, management, consider try make union disappear. The current arrangement produce unbalanced pay scale immense proportions. last year players ever receive union minimum, $242,000 rookies $272,000 veterans. The number players make $1 million $2 million year middle class, NBA terms fell sharply. But Michael Jordan make $33 million. This surprise. Sports entertainment business, unlike movies. Big stars get millions, get union scale. Over years, NBA efforts stem rise salaries failed. The important loophole salary cap lets team sign free agent whatever willing pay. When adopted, assume team would pay lot rival could pay. But work way. In current negotiation, league offer guarantee payroll rise 20 percent next four years, $1 billion $1.2 billion, say open proposals split money way players want, whether raise minimum salary guaranteeing raise veterans. The union say worry middle class, seem determined preserve free market. The league get broadcasters, NBC Time Warner's cable channels, agree pay year's television fees whether games broadcast. (they pay back later years, either reduced fees extra games show.) Owners hop players would think management willing wait out, come terms small part season canceled. But union act unhurried. It turn aside requests negotiations week, say players meet first. then issue union suicide, tactic reject players 1995. The idea players union, would illegal antitrust laws owners collude. The sky would limit. That tactic might fail. The courts could reject union decertification vote sham, case players may fear teams would feel free offer less old union minimum. But players go route, could long time real negotiations get going. Billy Hunter, union's executive director, warn owners week prolong lockout could destroy league's popularity. That seers say four years ago, baseball's World Series cancel labor troubles. But fan memories relatively short, baseball seem popular ever. With mind, owners players may choose battle months. In critical ruling north american National Basketball Association players' union, arbitrator John Feerick decide Monday whether 200 players guarantee contracts pay lockout. If players win, owners liable dlrs 800 million guarantee salaries, although vowed appeal lose. The league already sue players Feerick's jurisdiction. If win, I think emboldens spirit resolve players, union director Billy Hunter said. But I think anybody celebrate there's guarantee end lockout. It mean pay 200 players, they've indicate us intent file immediate appeal take far order avoid payment. so even rule favor, hollow victory. The players go get pay Nov. 15 circumstance, Hunter said. If owners win, remove last wild card players holding. The sides negotiate since last Tuesday, union propose superstar tax high contracts. The league make counterproposal Friday, ask tax impose much low threshold. Hunter dismiss league's late proposal Friday afternoon, say sides would best serve await Feerick's ruling. It's unlikely negotiations hold week, since union hold meet NBA players agents advisory committee Las Vegas Wednesday Friday. We've get get sense players are, consider reasonable they're willing order get season commence, Hunter said. The union file grievance Feerick lockout impose July 1 owners' announcement June 29 would honor guaranteed deals. In six-day hearing summer, union argue owners protect liable guaranteed salaries work stoppage insert lockout language standard player contract. The Sacramento Kings insert lockout clause center Olden Polynice's contract 1994, approve league. The union use existence clause argue teams protect similarly. most players due receive first paychecks Nov. 15, although dozen clauses entitle pay summer. none receive paycheck. The NBA argue tenet labor law allow employers withhold pay employees lockout. The league also call former union director Simon Gourdine testify, Feerick upheld union objections prohibit Gourdine say whether understand negotiate old labor agreement 1995 players would pay owners choose reopen agreement impose lockout. Patrick Ewing want sound like strike longshoreman demand health benefits. I'm go try put dollars cents. But Ewing, president National Basketball Association Players Association, play public-relations game Tuesday expound themes labor unrest: strong-willed unity short-sighted proposals. On day training camps schedule begin, players across country hold news conferences 14 NBA cities proclaim ready practice regular season. We want show public we, players, want play, say Ewing, flank five teammates. today suppose start train camp. We want practice want season start. But unfortunately, owners lock us season postponed. The owners players schedule hold first bargain session since Aug. 6 Thursday Manhattan. Neither side predict progress toward sign new collective bargaining agreement begin season schedule Nov. 3. The league cancel entire 114-game preseason Monday. Next week, consider cancel first-ever regular season games league history. With wide philosophical differences $2 billion annual income distributed, sides privately say expect play regular season game December. Billy Hunter, union's executive director, offer glimmer hope. He speak optimistically potential quick resolution. Standing feet away Ewing, said, I hope owners commissioner gotten message: we're serious deal. I'm prepare make quantum leap. I think we're far off. I think there's lot jockeying, lot rhetoric lot games played. But owners decide want deal, they'll get one. But soon after, begin lambast owners' late proposal, include eventual phasing Larry Bird exception clause enable free agents earn unlimited salaries current teams. That clause represent major rift negotiations. Owners would like implement restrictive salary cap would eventually put ceiling much one player earn. I know go come speedy resolution, Ewing said. They're entrench want, hard cap. And feel hard cap, players, cannot survive. We would stupid ignorant accept deal. Said Hunter, If go proposal, joke. It's step backwards. I cannot understand it. If intent reach agreement late stage negotiate earnest, wrong way go it. League officials respond players' comments. All want fair share feel like they're try take away us, Ewing said. `There's perception we're strike. It's way around. We've lock out. Besides Ewing, Knicks include former union president Buck Williams, former vice president Herb Williams, Allan Houston John Starks. Marcus Camby also show briefly. When media horde close in, however, third-year forward go look late-arriving teammates inside practice facility. He stop gym door, locked. They lock us out, say Rockets forward Mario Elie. Everybody's get get corrected. It's us. They're ones close us down. The stalemate elicit talks possibly bring mediator come weeks, Major League Baseball 1994 help solve labor dispute. But players convince commissioner David Stern owners set test resolve genuine headway make negotiations. That mean miss paychecks November, something Ewing say players prepare do. Both sides still await outcome arbitration decision due Oct. 18. Fordham Law School dean John Feerick rule whether 200 players $800 million guaranteed contracts pay lockout. Feerick's decision could give new leverage one side. But players lose arbitration, 400 athletes many extravagant lifestyles tremendous financial obligations allegiances instantly tested. It's like want see strong are, Ewing said. base proposals we've received, we're strong. So far, seem though NBA dug position, Buck Williams said. I think they're concerned point making deal. He added, We're far apart Grand Canyon right now. The National Basketball Association, embroil labor dispute players, Tuesday cancel first two weeks 1998-99 season. It first time league's 51-year history lose regular-season games. The NBA's deputy commissioner, Russ Granik, announce cancellation nearly three half hours meetings conclude Manhattan hotel. The decision cancel 99 games Nov. 3 Nov. 16 come players association propose implementation tax system instead hard salary cap, proposal owners say would respond Friday. We try best today try possible salvage season, say Alonzo Mourning, Miami Heat center. Unfortunately, work out. After 35,001 games without blemish, NBA join National Hockey League, National Football League Major League Baseball lose games labor dispute. take account three- four-week period would need training camp free-agent signings season starts, league say would decide two weeks whether make cancellations. I'm sad disappointed, say NBA commissioner, David Stern. I consider collective failure, I honestly know else could done. I things I like think best interests game. And I believe is. The decision come sides agree substantive talks since owners impose lockout player July 1. Seventeen players, include union president Patrick Ewing vice presidents Mitch Richmond, Herb Williams, Dikemebe Mutombo Ty Corbin, attend meeting along Stern, Granik five members ownership committee Madison Square Garden president Dave Checketts owners Abe Pollin Washington, Gordon Gund Cleveland, Les Alexander Houston Jerry Colangelo Phoenix. The talks feature players association imply bevy concessions make owners felt would accommodate league's desire swing revenue pendulum back toward owners. The dispute involve distribution approximately $2 billion league-wide income. The main sticking point owners' insistence salary cap without exceptions, implementation believe would bring player salaries' line revenue growth. While players discuss elimination Larry Bird exception clause allow player secure amount money want re-signing current team address exception taxation proposal. The main points follows: A 50 percent tax would impose salary earn $18 million, clause would affect players exercise Bird rights. For example, player make $20 million, team would force put $1 million fund would likely distribute low-revenue teams. There could provisions make players, say Jeffrey Kessler, chief outside counsel union. We want anything would encourage Chicago get Michael Jordan back. And I think league feels way. The proposal similar luxury tax propose union 1995 negotiations, would nearly liberal. A salary cap credit would go effect league pay 63 percent revenues salary. Whatever figure number reduces salary cap next year. If figure $29 million salary cap, 29 teams would work salary cap $1 million less previous season. But players would assurance salary cap would go least $2 million credit go effect. Also, 63-percent threshold met, reduction annual 20 percent raises would take effect multi-year contracts. Players would either get raise 10 percent rate growth league revenues. The union say clearly addresses league's desire bring salaries line revenues. Since owners re-opened current agreement 57.1 percent revenue go toward salaries, 63-percent figure would probably come substantially owners agree proposal. Teams would get right first refusal free agents fourth year incoming rookies, meaning player would contractually obligate team first four years deal. Currently, rookie scale three years include clause enables player exercise Bird rights two seasons clause Kevin Garnett parlay astronomical $126 million deal last year Minnesota. Finally, players agree make marijuana ban substance. Details testing negotiate specific discussions take place regard test performance-enhancing drugs, provision owners include last proposal. In return concessions, players want increase minimum salary currently $272,500 creation average salary exception. This would allow every team salary cap able sign one free agent per year average salary currently $2.6 million. We're buoy fact first time they've decide submit counterproposal, union's executive director, Billy Hunter, said. I know I'm optimistic, I earnestly say look ballplayers eye say make valiant effort. ask players would finally test financially cancellation games, Hunter added: It's us blinking. We want reach agreement. We're tire rhetoric, we're tire game-playing. Our position along want accept bad deal. Granik say refunds fans would make end calendar month first refund would include monies cancel preseason games. He estimate losses hundreds millions dollars. I think serious concern whether tax system address kind need economically, added. But there's possibility. Added Stern, We owe fans go back look notion whether tax rate might begin achieve result wanted. It look promising, we're go spend next two days see give favorable response. Though decision cancel games surprising, represent major shift prior labor stalemates. Both sides reluctantly hammer deal 1995 start train camp sole notion miss games preserve NBA's perfect record. Tuesday, could come accord. I'd like think last games cancel, Granik said. But unless something else works, there's dramatic breakthrough, I think certainly season that's jeopardy. ","The National Basketball Association joined the NHL, the NFL and baseball when it canceled first the preseason games then two weeks of regular season.In litigation that is complicated by a dispute over the distribution of nearly $2 billion in league income, the main sticking point is the owner's insistence on a salary cap without exceptions.Top players are avoiding discussion of the Larry Bird exception, which allows a player to secure any amount he wants in resigning with his current team except as it applies to their taxation proposal.Also pending is an arbiter's decision as to whether players will be paid during the lockout.","The Larry Bird exception has been used to pay some NBA players much more than the salary cap allows.Stalled labor dispute over NBA salaries cancels preseason games and threatens regular season games.NBA owners and players plan meeting, which is unsuccessful.Players submit proposal at next meeting.Owners to respond by Fri.First 2 weeks of the season, 99 games, are cancelled.An arbitrator will decide on Mon. whether or not NBA players with guaranteed salary contracts should be paid during the owners' lockout.As the NBA labor battle goes on, most, if not all, season games may be cancelled.Lesser paid players may suffer if union doesn't survive.","In a dispute over a new collective bargaining agreement the National Basketball Association owners declared a lockout on July 1, 1998.They wanted to discard a clause in the old agreement allowing teams to pay their own free agents whatever they wanted, substituting a hard salary cap.The players wanted to keep earning as much as possible.On Oct. 5 all 114 preseason games were cancelled.The players then proposed a 50% tax on salaries above $18 million that the owners rejected.On Oct. 13 the NBA cancelled the first two weeks of the regular season.By Oct. 21 the entire season seemed in jeopardy in the interests of the best paid.","In a dispute between the owners and NBA players over how to divide the $2 billion in league-wide income, all preseason and the first 99 1998-1999 regular season games were cancelled.The Larry Bird exception, a clause in the old agreement that allowed teams to pay their own free agents any amount, regardless of salary-cap rules, is the major issue.The owners want a restricted salary cap.The players have proposed a superstar tax, and the owners have presented a counter proposal, but negotiations have stalled.Meanwhile, both sides are awaiting a ruling by arbitrator Feerick on whether $800 million in guaranteed salaries will be paid during the lockout."

Now, though, Mahathir's allies marshal new economic data say indicate capital controls breathe new life country's moribund economy. Malaysia's foreign reserves rise strongly September, anecdotal evidence consumers start spend again. It's nice able say since adopt capital controls, economy improved, say Zainal Aznam Yusof, deputy director Institute Strategic International Studies, research organization help draft policies. But want see whether strongly sustainable. Critics say predictable capital controls would short-term tonic Malaysia's economy. Because country shelter vagaries capital flow currency fluctuations, said, government able ease interest rates encourage consumer spending. Still, mere fact Malaysia's experiment yield positive results guarantees issue come APEC meeting. With Mahathir lead campaign, cause capital controls fiery advocate penchant get skin Westerners. Mahathir outspoken political leader, say Chia Yew Boon, independent analyst Singapore. There way like Clinton Jiang Zemin go able muzzle him, added, refer President Jiang China. Policy-makers United States express fears Malaysia's gambit see successful, economically weaken countries region, like Indonesia, might tempt try it. so far, indonesian officials say would stick recovery plan devise International Monetary Fund, stress economic austerity open markets. But officials Japan express sympathy Mahathir's policies, Paul Krugman, economist Massachusetts Institute Technology, advocate use emergency measure. Yusof say recent events vindicate Malaysia's contention need insulate ravages global financial system. He say recent near-collapse prominent american hedge fund underscore sudden flows capital destructive consequences. The Long-Term Capital Management hedge fund, base Greenwich, Conn., nearly wreck series wrong bets Treasury securities collapse economy Russia prompt flight capital country. The LTCM fiasco really provide case study could go wrong global economy, Yusof said. With capital controls protection, Yusof say Malaysia pick pieces shatter economy. In addition grow foreign reserves, say Malaysia improve trade balance revive consumer purchases durable goods. Foreign investors also wholly abandon Malaysia, experts predict would. While foreign direct investment fell September $142 million, average monthly rate $321 million period January September dry completely. For every comforting statistic, though, critics produce alarm one. They say increase Malaysia's foreign reserves merely due new capital restrictions, stipulate malaysian currency hold outside country would worthless unless repatriate Sept. 30. The skeptics also note bank lending decline September, despite several reductions interest rates. So consumers buy new cars home appliances merely dip savings, mean buy spree end savings depleted. The argument impose capital controls, regain control monetary policy, would increase supply money lessen liquidity crunch, say K.S. Jomo, professor political economy University Malaya here. But that's happening. The big flaw Malaysia's policy, Jomo others said, timing. With asian crisis year old, much foreign capital country already gone. The critics say Mahathir spook would-be investors without even lock ones use here. There case make temporary imposition capital controls, avert crisis, respond one, Jomo said. In fact, asian currencies, like Indonesian rupiah Thai baht, actually rebound since Malaysia suspend trading currency fix exchange rate 3.8 ringgit dollar. Analysts liken situation buying insurance policy disaster come gone. more important, capital controls slow much-needed corporate banking reforms. The government's rescue Renong, major conglomerate close ties Mahathir, go ahead, though analysts predict government eventually scrap much-criticized plan. The rescue politically connected companies remain tense issue here. On Monday, trial Malaysia's former deputy prime minister, Anwar Ibrahim, charge corruption sex-related crimes, Anwar angrily deny Mahathir's claim approve bailout. Anwar's sensational trial reminder Mahathir's economic policies cannot disentangle politics. Malaysia's 72-year-old prime minister clash former protege respond Asian crisis, dismiss Anwar day impose capital controls. During boom times, Mahathir support policies wrap anti-foreigner language. In speech Monday, attack familiar target, say foreign currency traders cause currency turmoil, adding: They spread worldwide. They precipitate current recession every country. But Mahathir's treatment Anwar stir anger spark grow social unrest malaysia. With protesters chant reform usually orderly streets city, experts say Mahathir need capital controls work order soothe country's agitate population. Things heat economy improve, say Chandra Muzaffar, professor political science University Malaya. then whole question Mahathir leadership remain issue. In regard, least, leaders converge Kuala Lumpur two weeks able identify embattle host. The leaders Malaysia's rule party meet Tuesday discuss replacement oust deputy prime minister Anwar Ibrahim, face trial next month case test country's legal system.

The Philippines, Malaysia Indonesia found member countries ASEAN, also include Brunei, Laos, Myanmar, Singapore, Thailand Vietnam. Among Asia's leaders, Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad notable man bold vision: physical social transformation would push nation forefront world affairs. It almost come true. In 17 years prime minister, Mahathir, 72, medical doctor, foster economic liberalization lead world's fast rates growth. He drive Malaysians productive, embrace high technology begin major investments around world. He create national affirmative-action program allow country's ethnic Chinese, Malays Indians share improve living standards new sense malaysian identity pride. This year Mahathir's year triumph, perhaps pave way retirement, inauguration huge public work projects impressive gatherings foreign leaders sportsmen. But today, dizzy turnaround, Malaysia Asia's critical list, economy teeter edge disaster stability shake seem entirely avoidable political cat fight. last month, Mahathir dismiss arrest deputy heir apparent, Anwar Ibrahim, 51, accuse corruption illegal sex acts. The move set street demonstrations arouse international condemnation, particularly Anwar's many friends foreign governments. One region's stable prosperous nations suddenly uproar. It appear Indonesia, Thailand, Japan South Korea, pressure economic collapse spawn political crisis. In nations, result change leadership. The question is: be Mahathir next? The answer far clear. Unlike Indonesia, little evidence simmer discontent Malaysia. The ouster former President Suharto Indonesia predict many people. Almost one seem foreseen eruption here. Malaysia familiar political demonstrations. Unlike Indonesians, Malaysians rarely riot. many people puzzle disturbed encountered water cannon riot police streets recent weeks. What we're see unprecedented, say Ambassador John Malott United States. This never happen Malaysia, nobody know go go. You write lot scenarios totally uncharted waters.

The move intend effect bringing home Malaysian currency, insulate speculators Mahathir blame crisis, give adrenaline jolt self-contained economy. It move seem tune recent round question economic orthodoxy International Monetary Fund. But foreign economists expect work long.

The day make economic gamble, Mahathir set severe political crisis tenure, dismiss Anwar, man groom successor.

For first time decades, Malaysians thousands demonstrate streets mosques meet tear gas water cannon. many people beat hundreds detained, although later released. With emergence still-tentative opposition movement, fear express one western diplomat downward spiral suppression breeds discontent breeds suppression breed discontent. People whisper Mahathir's days may numbered. But venture guess number might be. Given control lever power lack focus leadership opposition, Mahathir could ride storm Anwar's trial proceeds. But strike harsh blow morale nation, sense confidence work hard build slogan Malaysia Can! In generally decorous nation, depth anger express two men call father son disturb hear. Anwar, say prime minister, despicable sodomist. Mahathir, say former deputy, senile insane. Malaysians, stolidly accept Mahathir's authoritarian rule mixture gratitude emerge pride, seem stunned. Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad say Friday choosy successor. The man need necessarily religious preoccupy virtuous deeds times, national news agency, Bernama, quote Mahathir say Friday prayers Al-Falah Mosque northern town Jitra Kedah state.

But time, acknowledge NATO look way, enjoy three-month license overwhelm Kosovo Liberation Army rebel army fight independence Kosovo ethnic Albanian majority terrorize rural civilian population supports it.

U.S. officials say expected Richard Holbrooke, U.S. envoy dealt Milosevic negotiate end war Bosnia, meet Monday discuss political plan Kosovo.

The West, fear precedent independence Kosovo would set conflicts world, try mediate middle course. In essence, diplomats say believe plan Holbrooke present Milosevic call three-year interim period lead status fairly close pre-1989 autonomy arrangement. Since Kosovo conflict flare March, critics Washington's policy toward Milosevic argue able choreograph every move suit goal: push albanian population submission impunity. The United States allies wait four months clean clock Kosovo Liberation Army, say Morton Abramowitz, head International Crisis Group, policy analysis organization, take three weeks discuss military action, result 500 albanian villages destroyed. Administration officials acknowledge NATO fail live early threat June strike Serbia, Milosevic take advantage indecision plunge ahead artillery tank offensive lightly arm guerrilla forces, whose bedrock popular support help win effective control large swaths Kosovo territory, include key roads. While that, Milosevic skillfully manage key requirement Washington: make sure war spill neighbor Albania Macedonia, fragile countries traditionally volatile area.

The Yugoslav leader also understand Washington unsure deal disorganized Albanian political leadership Kosovo unbend Kosovo Liberation Army, whose main chiefs harden emigres return Switzerland Germany.

For procedural breakthrough, Holbrooke recommend lifting ban foreign investment Serbia put place month before. After meet Rugova, Milosevic step military operations Kosovo, force Washington reverse carry investment ban. In late June, Holbrooke meet two self-styled Kosovo guerrilla commanders province's western town Junik break contact. Clinton administration officials say time concern NATO intervention would bolster separatist forces. To try put best face situation, Washington work Moscow get Milosevic accept presence international monitors would patrol Kosovo report military action. The monitors slow get organized. By August, Yugoslav army, back serbian special police, full swing rebels burn loot villages process, monitors find difficult gain access fighting. They drive roadblocks, know something go sounds smoke, could precise. In recent days tanks artillery withdrawn, access improved, monitors say. But areas central Kosovo around Likovac Gornje Obrinje monitors rule limits land mines roads. The mines believe planted guerrillas. Gornje Obrinje site massacre 18 ethnic albanian women, children elderly people Sept. 26. A british reporter walk across fields village Sunday say 10 mortar shells, apparently serbian police Yugoslav army, fire village early Sunday afternoon. The Yugoslav army police forces responsible vast majority atrocities Kosovo conflict, say report New york-based group Human Rights Watch, release Sunday. The report say rebels also violate laws war take civilian hostages carry summary executions. But violations guerrillas less scale government abuses, author report, Fred Abrahams, concluded. The report focus call watershed conflict attack police forces three ethnic albanian villages late February early March Drenica region central Kosovo. At least 83 people, include 24 women children, kill attack, involved helicopters, artillery armor personnel carriers. In Yugoslav capital, Belgrade, four-hour drive north roll countryside Kosovo's capital Pristina, Milosevic remain politically secure. That part, domestic critics say, diplomats like Holbrooke head U.N.refugee agency, Sadako Ogata, insist go see him, thus enhance stature. The American envoy Richard Holbrooke meet President Slobodan Milosevic Yugoslavia Monday night accord American diplomat tell take steps pull back military Kosovo Province face NATO attack. Milosevic also told, diplomats said, insure roughly 250,000 ethnic albanian refugees force flee homes fight last six months allow return home. most refugees reluctant return many Serb police officers destroy homes villages remain neighborhoods. After deliver stern message far Milosevic Kosovo conflict, Holbrooke say news conference NATO's military plans attack Serbia move ahead serious, intense sustain basis. Holbrooke's mission Milosevic describe american diplomats die trip, added, We're serious juncture. Shortly Holbrooke's meeting Milosevic, Yugoslav leader issue defiant statement serbian television say threats aggression outline Holbrooke represent criminal act. Milosevic, rarely comments meetings foreign diplomats whose tough words cast unusually ominous tone, also say Holbrooke's position constitute support albanian terrorists albanian people. Milosevic apparently accuse Holbrooke support ethnic albanian guerrillas Kosovo Liberation Army, fight make serbian province Kosovo independent nation. The Yugoslav leader add seven days skirmishes military action. An american diplomat familiar themes Holbrooke plan stress Milosevic say expectation american envoy would walk Monday night agreement. Rather, point underscore yugoslav leader make explicit expect him. It quite ultimatum, diplomat said, matter steps take show compliance. The essence Holbrooke's demand centered issues outline United Nations Security Council resolution two weeks ago. The resolution order Milosevic withdraw extra army police forces send Kosovo deal guerrillas send back bases military forces normally station province. so far, american diplomats said, Milosevic withdrawn troops field barracks. such move essential, american diplomats said, create conducive atmosphere possible negotiations future status province.

Hunger malnutrition Cambodia reach crisis levels comparable effects famine North Korea, U.N. World Food Program representative say Tuesday. Though North Korea suffer simple lack food, falter economy Cambodia combine weak health care education cause similar levels malnutrition children, say Ken Davies, WFP's country director. There enough rice. The problem people poor access it. The problem poverty, Davies said. The WFP currently support 1.7 million hungry Cambodians 15 percent population food-for-work direct assistance programs, Davies say fears still plenty get enough eat every day. The problem bad little bad North Korea, Davies said. The situation much bad people recognize. accord recent WFP survey, 49 percent cambodian children age 5 stunt lack food 20 percent suffer acute malnutrition. By comparison, similar survey north korean children 7 find 65 percent stunt 16 percent suffer acute malnutrition. Cambodia produce rice surplus export last two years expect another year, WFP statistics show 25 percent rice-growing areas account 75 percent surplus. The majority cambodian farmers produce enough keep families feed increasingly saddle debts incur run reserves harvest, Davies said. Money-lenders rural Cambodia typically charge 100 percent interest, must pay rice harvest time, give many farmers handicap start next crop season. Poor sanitation, lack health care ignorance modern child rear problems leave mostly unaddressed under-funded health education sectors Cambodia exacerbate food security problem, Davies said. Davies urge new government substantially increase annual expenditures health, education rural development first step long-term solution Cambodia's food crisis. The poverty get bad right situation malnutrition children crisis, Davies said. Cambodia typically earmark half annual budget defense security. In 1998 budget, education allocate 6.5 percent, health 4.4 percent rural development 0.2 percent. Actual disbursements three ministries often 60 70 percent budget amount annual revenues fall short expectations, accord aid workers. A 1999 budget draft propose reduction health ministry's allotment, cause outcry September health officials U.N. World Health Program. The draft later readjust provide unprecedented 33 percent increase health spending. North Korea enter fourth winter chronic food shortages people malnourish risk die normally curable illnesses, senior Red Cross officials say Tuesday. The officials warn international complacency hostility toward North Korea food crisis stretches isolated communist country show little willingness adopt far-reaching changes revive ruin economy. humanitarian suffering cannot routine part world, say Margareta Wahlstrom, Red Cross' undersecretary disaster relief, return Beijing Tuesday week inspect aid agency's operations North Korea. She Red Cross officials saw ravages North Korea's slow-motion famine: electricity supply half capital, Pyongyang, time; elderly look swollen, sign long-term hunger; generation children stunted, 10-year-olds look like 6-year-olds 5-year-olds like 2-year-olds. Everywhere, bakeries government ministries, people serve noodles cakes make soybeans mixed acorns, grass herbs, Red Cross president Astrid Heiberg said. Heiberg liken additives cattle food note doctors report rise stomach illnesses mixtures. This really part daily life, said. You would give children elderly mother know would get cramps stomach diarrhea unless stomach moaning. Three years floods drought start 1995 devastate North Korea's collective farming plan economy, already teeter loss soviet bloc trading partners. With goods money barter buy foreign supplies, country lack sufficient fertilizer crops, fuel parts machinery. The Red Cross inspectors saw soldiers people harvest cabbage, winter's main vegetable. The grain harvest finish U.N. estimate little improve last year's: 3 million tons, enough meet two-thirds needs North Korea's 22 million people. As long, harsh winter begins, doctors confirm official statistics show widespread malnutrition, tuberculosis rise hunger-weakened patients unable recover operations sickness, Heiberg said. Doctors worry respiratory illnesses common winter may take toll weaken population, said. One 10-bed hospital countryside keep three patients time food care more, say Heiberg.

Three years floods drought start 1995 devastate North Korea's collective farming plan economy, force country rely outside aid feed 23 million people. famine-threatened North Korea's harvest better year last could worse, senior U.N. aid official say Saturday. North Korea need minimum 4.5 million 5 million tons grain feed 23 million people, manage last year harvest 2.8 million tons, Namanga Ngongi, deputy head World Food Program said. Although hard figures yet available, prospects year harvest better, Ngongi tell reporters Beijing visit North Korea. It may worse last year. Poor harvests, economic collapse three years floods drought, produce chronic food shortages North Korea leave heavily reliant foreign aid. Fertilizer lacking, fuel power tractors farm machinery, meaning plant harvest must do hand. Every year get worse, Ngongi said. But despite need food aid, Ngongi say government month ago cut number counties WFP access 171 145, reduce number people get aid 6.7 million 5.8 million. Most receive WFP aid children age 6 months 6 years. Ngongi say government cite security concerns notably lack peace treaty rival South Korea decision. The government say ban would temporary, Ngongi added. Ngongi, spend four days inspect WFP relief efforts North Korea, say people generally look good visit last year. But also say could see large part population weak. Everybody consume low level. so may severely malnourished, well nourished all, said. U.S. officials tour hardest-hit regions North Korea summer say 2 million people may die famine. Ngongi say saw malnourish children say 10 11 years old, appear 4 5 years old. About 30 percent children one primary school visit class. A lot children weak come school, said. But Ngongi say foreign food aid save lives. A lot people alive today thanks international community's support, said. A congressman visit remote parts North Korea last week say Saturday food health situation desperate deteriorating, millions North Koreans might starve death last years. The congressman, Tony Hall, D-Ohio, longtime interest world hunger, pass Tokyo return United States show photographs take north korean children patchy hair, protrude bones, open sores signs severe malnutrition. Hall also bring back bag officials call substitute food distributed government food station: dry leaves straw, coarse even cattle would normally turn away. They grind powder make noodles, Hall said. The noodles nutrition indigestible, leave people hold ache stomachs, said. North Korea admit face serious economic difficulties, sharply diverge assessments serious are. Some visitors United Nations organizations say food situation seem bit good year two ago. Hall say divergence might arise north korean capital, Pyongyang, life seem slightly well three previous trips North Korea. But rural areas foreigners often allow visit, added, overall situation worse ever. base visits four hospitals, Hall also emphasize public health care decline sharply. In one hospital, assistants hold patient surgeons conduct stomach operation without electric lights anesthesia. ordinary North Koreans suffering, part, government's hard-line policies alienate would-be donors aid agencies. The United Nations repeatedly appeal relief aid North Korea, late appeal raise less one-third target. In September, Doctors Without Borders announce pull staff 13 North Korea fear aid go politically connect rather needy. North Korea release mortality figure health statistics, Hall say United Nations gather would soon release data indicate 30 percent north korean children age 2 acutely malnourish 67 percent children physically stunted. Hall say think overall least 1 million people die total probably closer 3 million. In indication seriousness professional demographers view situation, U.S. Bureau Census recently publish estimates suggest North Korea's population peak 1995 21.55 million since fall 21.23 million year. That would decline 320,000 three years, period North Korea's population would expect grow 925,000 people, base population growth rate early 1990s. Nicholas Eberstadt, American specialist north korean population figures, say simply enough hard information estimate death toll famine. But note one political tidbit: North Korea's constitution stipulate one delegate country's people's assembly every 30,000 citizens. This year's assembly expand previous ones did, rather 687 delegates, previous assembly hold 1990. While Eberstadt counsels caution, could mean North Korea's population, eight years expect add several million people, back 20.6 million people fewer. The United States supply grain North Korea, strain grow secret underground complex North experts worry may heart new nuclear weapons program. The United States warn last week agree framework basis relations North Korea jeopardy unless North let american experts visit underground complex resolve doubts. North Korea say show complex Washington promise complex nuclear one, pay vilify us impair prestige. Washington refuse pay, North Korea warn standoff could lead agreement fall apart. Their shameless wicked demand open infringement upon sovereignty wanton interference internal affairs, declare North Korea's lead newspaper, Rodong Sinmun. More five years severe food shortages near-total breakdown public health system lead devastate malnutrition North Korea probably leave entire generation children physically mentally impaired, new study international aid groups found. The study, first scientific nutritional survey North Korea, confirm disturb reports international aid workers, past year gain increase access population highly isolated secretive country. Among shock findings, researchers World Food Program, Unicef European Union find that, long-term food shortages, stagger 62 percent children 7 years old suffer stunt growth. They discover that, despite huge international food aid program past three years, severe malnutrition widespread among toddlers crucial stages brain development, suggest generation's physical mental abilities develop normally losses never recovered. Separately, international medical workers groups like Red Cross, begin document effects food shortages severely compound breakdown public health services. even basic water purification systems stand idle lack essential ingredients like chlorine, Red Cross workers say, leave vast numbers people severe diarrhea unable absorb completely little food have. As north korean dictatorship slowly, often grudgingly, grant increased access international aid groups last six months, increasingly clear sadden picture hunger haas emerge result large formal study informal surveys observations foreign aid agencies. Past assessments magnitude disaster country 23 million consider flawed base interviews small number north korean refugees flee China. And researchers aid workers grind North Korea see evidence cannibalism starve children die roadside descriptions surface lurid refugee reports find many ways equally disturbing: A population wither nearly decade chronic hunger, people weaken malnutrition colds stomach flus quickly turn lethal, future generation irretrievably lost. now last hard facts situation grave, say Judith Cheng-Hopkins, regional director Asia World Food Program, take part research. To famine slow motion. People cope year year, probably lot drop off. But totality hard gauge. For three weeks fall, crews lead foreign scientists finally permit fan across North Korea conduct first random sample nutritional survey children, provide far solid data crisis. They find 62 percent children 7 stunt growth, symptom long-term malnutrition. Thirty percent 1-year-olds suffer moderate severe malnutrition. This mean high likelihood impair mental physical development, nervous system mature dramatically essential first year. The researchers say available scientific data suggest 10 years ago, malnutrition rare North Korea. Even situation improves, unlikely improve degree country fully recover saw, say Judit Katona-Apte, senior program adviser World Food Program. People small well developed otherwise somewhat limited mental capacities. Likewise, Red Cross representatives year test water supply 840 hospitals clinics operate, find one water suitable human consumption, say Sten Swedlund, head Red Cross delegation North Korea. But course drink choice, say recent trip Beijing. There close relationship problems cause lack food health sector that's bad shape. Virtually children 7 malnourished also diarrhea, said. None aid groups able study issue hunger-related deaths, North Koreans release relevant figures, although experts agree probably one million perhaps many three million die prematurely since food shortages began. But public health experts say number perish might difficult tally case, deaths probably quick starvation, immune systems weaken years hunger, common colds easily give way lethal pneumonia ordinary bout infectious diarrhea prove fatal. Still, disturb clues: In one limited study conduct World Food Program groups last year 4,000 children hand-picked government, 10 percent parent dead. In fall's independent nutritional survey, 18 teams experts send eight North Korea's nine provinces look 1,800 rural urban children seven. In addition find 62 percent children stunt growth, teams find 16 percent children suffer acute malnutrition underweight height, sign severely underfed time study. That figure high country East Asia put North Korea among world's bad 10 countries terms malnutrition. While 16 percent figure quite bad India Bangladesh, worst world 18 percent malnutrition rate, experts say North Korea's number ways understate problem. In India Bangladesh, pockets severe poverty alternate pockets relative plenty, North Korea whole country degree underfed. even war-torn countries, famine pockets, Dr. Katona-Apte said. It's hard think another country that's affect way. The survey results especially sober since researchers study children 7, group receive nearly food donate abroad. After three years food donations, many foreign aid workers country remark children nurseries kindergartens look good old siblings failing. so month ago, World Food Program begin provide elementary schools high nutrition biscuits children age 7 12. We reason believe many people suffer elderly neglect age group get weak weaker, Swedlund said. There 100 Westerners live Pyongyang, capital city, many say long-term hunger readily apparent there. If walk street Pyongyang ask child old is, usually three years, Swedlund said. She may 7 look 3 4. Dr. Katona-Apte, nutrition expert work Bangladesh Sudan, say shock first visited north korean kindergarten last year. There two children sit desk obviously severely malnourish thin patchy hair, said. And sit working. This accept normal! They school, really hospitalize place nutritional rehabilitation. If saw refugee camp, would recommend immediate intervention. But severely depleted public health hospital system, option exist, others said. many korean doctors know diagnose treat malnutrition; see decade. And, case, hospitals lack food proper nutritional supplements. Swedlund say hospitals lack medicines, glass replace broken windows colder inside out, receive coal since 1994. He say even hospitals, sanitation water purification systems virtually nonexistent, country lack chlorine purification fuel run water pumps. He say next year, Red Cross would start address problems, spending $3.5 food hospital patients $1 million water treatment. With options, vast numbers North Koreans resort eat substitute food, hard cakes noodles make mix nutritional plants, like soybeans sweet potatoes, combine indigestible filler, like cornstalks straw. This constitute 40 percent food intake, Swedlund said. It's become regular part food basket. Doctors North Korea say many people suffer stomachaches eat partly indigestible material, said, added, If hungry, fills stomach. Although North Koreans date food problems series floods droughts mid-1990's, foreign researchers work North Korea say medical records childhood growth patterns indicate hunger begin several years link collapse soviet Union, long North Korea's main supplier food, fuel fertilizer. North Korea mountainous country, less 20 percent arable land. It food importer decades, mostly former Soviet Union, also China. The country come grips fact part structural problem can't blame weather anymore, Ms. Cheng-Hopkins said. Still, others praise normally rigid secretive government slowly loosen restrictions. Swedlund say three years country, international Red Cross, collaborate north korean Red Cross, find officials increasingly responsive doctors willing share medical records bring problems. Travel still restricted. There 100 counties, home 30 percent population, aid groups access therefore refuse provide food medical supplies. Still, number counties open workers increase steadily, freedom move improved. Ms. Cheng-Hopkins say half follow-up inspections unannounced, note researchers nutritional survey allow select villages visit enter homes random. Workers Red Cross World Food Program say observed extreme scenes people die acute starvation believe would occur frequently. I see acute starvation like I see Bangladesh, Dr. Katona-Apte said. But mean can't exist. We're still really limited see. Swedlund say unlikely counties still close foreigners markedly different open ones. And surmise closed counties might harbor pockets death devastation, say accepted North Korea's explanation exclude areas national security reasons. One thing I've learn important national security issues North Koreans, say Swedlund, retire admiral Swedish Navy. And I really think areas important standpoint, added, go map close areas describe western intelligence experts know military installations there. He also reject notion North Korean military stealing donate food, charge level organization Doctors Without Borders, angrily pull North Korea last summer protest many restrictions groups work there. now aid groups say start get somewhat good cooperation North Koreans, hope repeat nutrition survey every 6 12 months. And still analyze tantalize findings: Boys twice likely suffer stunted growth girls, every child whose mother dead malnourished. A generation north korean children already scar life, say Astrid Heiberg, president International Federation Red Cross Red Crescent Societies, interview Beijing trip North Korea. We need continue mobilize resources prevent even great catastrophe. The founder South Korea's large conglomerate plans visit native North Korea next week gift 501 cattle, company officials say Thursday. The visit delay month dispute 500 cattle donate Chung Ju-yung, founder Hyundai group, trip North June. North Korea claim 71 cattle die seoul government agents force-fed indigestible vinyl strips lump rope shipping North. Calling North's claim nonsense, Seoul's Ministry National Unification order Hyundai check thousands cattle raise ranch west coast. The ministry later acknowledge lumps rope find stomachs cattle ranch, say material kill animals donate North Korea. It blame deaths stress cause long shipment truck North. The south korean government say would authorize second shipment cattle unless North retract accusations. On Thursday, South Korean Unification Minister Kang In-duk say North Korea send letter Hyundai last week, say misunderstand southern authorities issue dead cattle cleared. Kang say North's letter clear stumble block Hyundai's additional cattle donation. During visit, Chung expect reach agreement details Hyundai's plan start sightsee tours scenic mountain North. The tours, originally schedule begin September, delay cost, security matters. Hyundai hop send ship 2,000 tourists week four-day tours Diamond Mountain North's east coast beginning November. Animosity distrust two Koreas run deep. The korean states separate communist North capitalist South 1945. They fight three-year war early 1950s. Years food shortages stunt growth millions north korean children, two-thirds children age seven suffer malnourishment, U.N. experts say Wednesday. Several years flood droughts couple economic downturn heavily damage North Korea's crop production capacity import food closed, communist nation. A survey carry September October also show 16 percent children North Korea acutely malnourished, body weight low height. That figure, reflect ongoing shortages, exceed Asia Bangladesh, India Sri Lanka. Eighteen teams, head foreign official World Food Program, U.N. Children's Fund European Union, carry study. They measure weight height 1,800 north korean children infants age seven homes randomly select areas aid agencies access. Those areas cover around 70 percent population. It first technically sound survey problem, UNICEF official Kirsi Madi tell reporters. The alarming findings toddlers age one two, 30 percent acutely malnourished. At age, malnutrition permanently impair physical intellectual growth, say Judy Cheng-Hopkins, WFP director region. Children North Korea's three large cities Pyongyang, Wonsan Nampo good counterparts elsewhere, 11 percent acutely malnourished. Boys almost twice badly affected girls.

24,"This Newt Gingrich suppose well. The planning. The strategy. The big picture. The vision. His vision bring GOP majority Congress 1994 make first Republican House Speaker 40 years. But admission, Gingrich's vision seem blurred time around, cost Republicans net five seats Tuesday's election leave party's narrow govern majority even narrower. The disappointing election results also leave Gingrich open fractious challenge post speaker. Members aides say Wednesday fury speaker bubble overnight members try organize slate candidates replace Gingrich leadership team House Republicans convene Nov. 18 select leaders next year. As Rep. Mark Sanford, R-S.C., put it, When company's stock price go down, usually CEO get fired. top Republican aides, speaking anonymously, even blunter. People angry last night, one aide said. Today mixture seethe dismay. It's ugly. And Newt know it. His career line. Another aide said, most people really angry Newt, one know it. But dip toe water see temperature is. A possible slate could contain names Reps. Robert L. Livingston Louisiana replace Gingrich, Steve Largent Oklahoma replace Dick Armey Texas majority leader, Jennifer Dunn Washington replace John A. Boehner Ohio conference chairman. Rep. David M. McIntosh Indiana also say consider run speaker, clear whether would part slate. Rep. Tom DeLay Texas, majority whip, say secure. Armey bluntly acknowledge scramble go wings oust leadership. Told Nightline Republicans head, Armey replied: They're welcome they're big enough take it. Publicly, Gingrich express confidence keep job speaker. But grim-faced last 24 hours closet Wednesday top strategists make calls shore support among members. He look like victim accident, say Rep. Peter King, R-N.Y., supports Gingrich. He's somber tone. The question, always Gingrich, many members prepare rebel leadership. In past, couple dozen members openly express dissatisfaction him, coup attempt last year fizzle lack support. I'm hop people understand need serious reassessment year, say Rep. Charles T. Canady, R-Fla., say hoped challenge speaker 1996 elections, Republicans also lose seats. The reality this: Our majority keep shrinking, Canady said. If shrinks more, gone. But Gingrich build support among moderates, perceive election repudiation conservatives. Rep. Sherwood L. Boehlert, R-Utah, say results show right direction party. To maintain majority, we've get moderate views, Boehlert said. Thomas Mann, Congressional scholar Brookings Institution, say moderates support Gingrich part appeal alternative emerged. They know sees broad world prepared moderate make sense, Mann said. Newt's go way support moderates. He's nurture relationship them. But Mann others say anger building Gingrich several reasons, include sign budget deal last month seem capitulate President Clinton, offering clear legislative agenda Republicans communicate clear political message. We define hate say Rep. Mark Souder, R-Ind. But voters sophisticate that, Republicans better something say we're going. The anger grow last days speaker approved $10-million anti-clinton advertising campaign allow Democrats turn election referendum Gingrich, never nearly popular public Clinton been. As slowly absorb implications loss, speaker seem unable news conference Wednesday morning pinpoint party suffer net drop five seats House. As late Tuesday afternoon, predict net pickup 10 30. Until look better, I frankly understand things happen yesterday, said, I'm sure anybody else country either. But say Republicans maniacally focus basic message cut taxes, save Social Security prevent drug abuse, campaign aggressively themes. He contrast lack focus year Contract With America prove successful 1994. People think stood something pretty big, said. But Gingrich also seem aware mount concern leadership, repeatedly cast election results victory leadership team Republicans stay majority three elections row first time 70 years. He also suggest would challenge little support. The people normally quote people would fact take party narrow base, Gingrich said, refer periodic eruptions concern among conservatives leadership. I'd like see plan confident last 60 days would successful share it. An intense struggle control House underway, Rep. Bob Livingston conduct telephone campaign replace Rep. Newt Gingrich speaker Gingrich fight counter-campaign give members pause oust him. At time, small band Republicans vow Thursday would vote re-elect Gingrich circumstances, move that, Republicans' shrunken House majority, could tie party knots months could throw speakership Democrat. Rep. Matt Salmon, R-Ariz., said: I personally make decision I cannot vote Newt Gingrich speaker January, six others tell feel way, seven people not, take six deadlock vote. Fury speaker boil since Tuesday's elections, Republicans suffered net loss five seats house. They blame Gingrich, party's chief strategist. But many already angry say failure articulate clear message party go elections messy budget process give President Clinton political edge contradict republican principles fiscal conservativism contain massive amounts pork spending. House Republicans meet Nov. 18 vote secret ballot leaders. Whoever win party's nomination speaker stand election full House January. Even Gingrich win secret ballot, could deny re-election speaker January Salmon least five others refuse vote him. Because Republicans control House 12 seats, would take six votes Gingrich deny majority allow Democrats potentially elect one speaker. With chaotic unacceptable prospect looming, Livingston tell Gingrich step aside good party, accord Republican officials. The officials say Livingston speak Gingrich shortly disastrous election returns also election, reflect Livingston's early displeasure speaker budget process. Several Republicans say Livingston, chairman Appropriations Committee one members stature stand speaker, Gingrich work phones Thursday struggle votes. Livingston say nothing publicly challenge Gingrich, several members aides say Thursday would announce intentions, possibly soon Friday, determine could win. He 'til duck row, right lot people still loyal speaker, say aide Republican who, like many others, try straddle line fealty speaker may retain power encouragement challenger offers salve embattle party. Stunned democratic resurgence mid-term elections, congressional Republicans tear Wednesday blame failure make traditional opposition party gains off-year election.

Henry Hyde tell fellow Republicans panel conference call Wednesday witness Republicans likely call would independent counsel, Kenneth Starr.

With numbers reduced, republican leadership need carry tortuous balance act unite hard-core conservative faction want aggressive social agenda bloc moderates want party return center. Any small Republican faction enormous leverage. The new arithmetic House may even lead Democrats' moderate Republicans' forming ad hoc majorities issues, take control away Republican leaders.

A week White House congressional Democrats disavow war Speaker Newt Gingrich, James Carville, President Clinton's former campaign strategist chief outside defender, put forth new battle cry Wednesday: He muzzled. not that, Carville go beyond customary denunciations Gingrich Republicans and, interview, trained fire leaders party sufficiently aggressive four weeks Election Day. My sense frustration I believe Democrats much good chance much good anyone expects, Carville said. And I think anyone's emerge try pull together. Everybody ought pushing, leadership Congress, White House, DNC. We ought hammer Gingrich every day. How take Congress back make case people run it? I never hear strategy like that. Sounding increasingly agitated, go on: The people leave activated election Democrats. The right wing, they're bounce walls. They're go vote. Rep. Dick Gephardt, minority leader, complain Erskine Bowles, White House chief staff, Carville appear NBC News program Meet Press Sept. 27 declared, Cpl. Cue Ball Carville roll battle Newt Gingrich. The concern among House Democrats, one express White House officials well, Carville's vitriol would make Democrats appear overly partisan could especially damage Democrats marginal districts want appear easy president. But Wednesday, Carville anything timid. If Gephardt people think they've quiet down, said, I'm quieted. Carville say tell officials White House, Don't waste breath call tell say this. Carville insist would rather battle Republicans fellow Democrats. If want fight me, can, said. I'm go fight Republicans. Yet could help ridicule party. Asked describe Democrats' strategy election, Carville said, If one, one's share me. Just four years ago, good bet Newt Gingrich would pivotal figure U.S. politics turn millennium. Seemingly overnight take moribund minority party turn pumped-up, issue-driven House majority. With promise balance budget, end welfare represent conservative social values, appear rearranged political map Congress Ronald Reagan do presidency. But Gingrich's leadership shaky even maintains hold speaker's office, danger marginalization. A change dramatic suggests something far profound miscalculation election tactics. What look like one major realignments U.S. political history might turn nothing temporary shift. The Gingrich revolution fuel anger, revolt white working-class Americans perceive democratic bias favor blacks minorities, middle-class rejection politics big government big deficits. They resentments Ronald Reagan exploit successfully. But old political habits moribund republican leadership allow Democrats retain control Congress throughout 1980s, turn Reagan's economic program undisciplined tax-cutting spree create prosperity along huge budget gaps. Gingrich's attention-grabbing rhetoric, energy talent political organization finally take Reagan's formula success congressional elections 1994. But power, run head Bill Clinton, whose political instincts even better. The president co-opted parts contract With America, particularly balance budget welfare reform. He adapt Republican social message call things like school uniforms television rating systems, symbolize responsibility parental control without support government intrusion private lives. The Republican right's genuine contempt Clinton base part well-known flaws president's character. But mainly reaction ease divert suppose flood tide revolution. They expect genuine successes Gingrich's first year office would lead still large victories minimal government taxes, unfettered free enterprise return conservative Christian values. But public happy lead another direction, focus concerns age baby boomers health care Social Security. The government see enemy issues budgetary look like potential ally. Back 1994, parties stun sudden change congressional fortunes may overestimate meant. In particular may realize quickly good economic times, drop crime national welfare reform could blunt power race U.S. politics. The Democrats become literally minority party white voters resentfully identify policies cities, blacks immigrants. But last week union workers Catholics return democratic fold. Without race wedge issue, solid black democratic vote become powerful advantage key states. Blacks, women Latinos angry Republican anti-immigration initiatives win coalition California, North Carolina New York. The speaker right say election expected. There may indeed Republican majority America, appear resemble Republicanism Dwight Eisenhower rather Newt Gingrich pro-business, wary debt inherent distaste bring messy social issues like abortion. The Republicans begin talk compassionate conservatism politics inclusion may peddle political mush, peddle victory Tuesday. The congressional Republican Party's long sojourn wilderness House minority may leave accustomed opposition figure for, attach politics anger make sense nation mood moderation. Gingrich suggest mistake let Republicans drift along politics impeachment almost maniacally focused things like tax cuts. But look maniacal get trouble first place. Winning control Congress many years tough Gingrich 1994. But ten times tougher forge politics depend rage. House Speaker Newt Gingrich, orchestrate Republican revolution recent years oversee impeachment inquiry President Clinton, driven office Friday party swiftly turn unexpected losses Tuesday's midterm elections. Catching virtually everyone Capitol Hill surprise, Gingrich announce Friday night two conference calls Republicans would seek re-election Speaker Nov. 18 vote would leave Congress altogether term expire January. This give us chance purge poison system, Gingrich said, accord party aide listen one calls. Gingrich's resignation stun reversal one combative personally confrontational politicians America. He make name decade ago bring one democratic speaker, Jim Wright, continue assaultive style Tuesday's elections last-minute commercials remind voters Clinton scandal. His reflexive pugilistic response evident even Friday night. In second conference call, accord several people listened, Gingrich blame House conservatives downfall. Although revolutionary zeal harness take control Congress 1994, become bitter critics last two years tumultuous speakership. Friday night call cannibals blackmail quitting. Rep. Michael P. Forbes, R-N.Y., said: Newt say marginalize Republican Party engage cannibalism. He said, `refer clips.' He's blame others. Another republican describe conference call way: He start statesmanlike, could see anger building. When someone ask leaving, said, `A handful members blackmail conference.' He said, `they're hateful.' And said, `They're cannibals.' Gingrich announce move hours Rep. Robert L. Livingston Louisiana announce run speaker, put forward pragmatist manager. After Gingrich calls, Rep. Bill Archer Texas announce consider run speaker. Livingston Archer chairmen two powerful committees house. In statement Gingrich said, The Republican conference needs unified, time move forward. He say hoped colleagues would pick successor reconcile discipline, work together communicate effectively. refer wife, tell colleagues resign Congress Marianne I tired. We need time get know again. He also acknowledge knack bring negative attention party. If I stay, told colleagues Friday night, controversial nature would overshadow successes might have, understatement recall suggestion two years ago force shutdown government miff sit back Air Force One trip President Clinton. accord another republican take notes, Gingrich say resignation: There lot bitterness amongst members. so long I around, I always target news media, would mean would never able get message out. Clinton said: Newt Gingrich worthy adversary leading Republican Party majority House join great national debate best prepare America 21st century. Despite profound differences, I appreciate times able work together national interest, especially Speaker Gingrich's strong support America's continue leadership freedom, peace prosperity world. many Republicans take opportunity portray Gingrich visionary. Rep. Sherwood Boehlert New York say first conference call, shock surprise strong expressions appreciation lead us promise Land. His supporters say Gingrich vote win election nominate speaker, conduct secret ballot. But, agreed, party's slim, six-vote majority meant every vote would battle. Kenneth Duberstein, former official Reagan administration, said, I doubt votes speaker, I'm sure votes govern. He say deep rifts party, Gingrich would able implement plans. In unusually bite reaction, Rep. Dick Gephardt Missouri, Democratic leader, say hop Gingrich's resignation would clear fierce partisan air fostered. I hope whoever succeed Newt Gingrich speaker immediately begin process repair damage work institution last four years, Gephardt said. House Republicans predict Gingrich's resignation would set wide-ranging hectic scramble replace anticipated. There lot pretenders throne test waters, say Boehlert, support Gingrich re-election speaker. There shortage candidates. The presidential campaign 2000 begin Wednesday, like not. The millennial election fight political playing field whose rough outlines, exact boundaries, drawn voters Tuesday's elections, deliver crush disappointment giddy hopes Republicans unexpected elixir recently ail Democrats. President Clinton call astonish triumph issues investigations say Democrats many major victories clear message. Republicans agreed. Of course next 18 months bring many surprises many reversals fortune. But election results offer important guidelines. Tuesday great day Vice President Al Gore, least three reasons. He work furiously successfully last ten days ballot persuade democratic loyalists stay home sulk, appear behalf few 224 candidates, accord office. A moderate within spectrum party, watch moderates win crucial elections, notably California gubernatorial race, Lt. Gov. Gray Davis, cautious pragmatist like Gore, smash victory. The returns even break Senate Democratic gain five House Representatives also make impeachment President Clinton less likely. And good shape Clinton term ends, better chance Gore, sidekick six years now, stand presidential nomination process and, ultimately, election. But California voters also complicate nominating process set Gore strategists work tactics uncomplicate it, consider state absolutely central presidential aspirations. In referendum 1996, California adopt primary system Republicans, Democrats independent voters would receive ballot, candidates parties listed. That violate rules major parties, measure ballot Tuesday, Proposition 3, would rescind 1996 change. But failed, raise possibility California's March 7 primary mere political popularity poll, convention delegate choose caucus convention nightmare. Tuesday bad day Republican right. High-profile right-wingers lose across country, Attorney General Dan Lungren California governor's race Sen. Lauch Faircloth, deny re-election North Carolina, Rep. Mark Neumann Wisconsin, fail Senate race despite huge spending advantage Sen. Russell Feingold, Ellen Sauerbrey Maryland, prove unable second try prevail unpopular democratic governor, Parris Glendening. Both conservatives moderates party say Republicans get back basics. even Speaker Newt Gingrich concede results sober every Republican call new strategic thinking. If make referendum president 67 per cent approval rating, try do, surprised election go you, say Gov. Tom Ridge Pennsylvania, moderate whose promoters mention weekly possible vice-presidential nominee. Sen. John McCain Arizona, conservative tends steer away divisive social issues, re-election 68 per cent vote. He study possibility presidential race, Republican nominee hope win, say interview Wednesday, congressional Republicans leaders need learn lessons. I hope debacle wake-up call people, said. You've get something small government, better education, something. We're see party that's everything. Polls take late year's campaign bore McCain out. They show Republicans longer identified issues electoral bread butter, low taxes law order. Tuesday also fresh demonstration, anyone need one, political utility pitch tent big enough almost everyone. Black politicians North Carolina, Maryland California report fears indifferent black turnout prove groundless. Black vote prove indispensable considerable number hard-pressed democratic candidates, especially felt interests directly threatened. The figures Hispanic voting, assemble exit polls candidates' precinct analyses, show dramatic differences. In California, outgo Republican governor, Pete Wilson, play anti-immigration card vengeance, major democratic candidates Davis Sen. Barbara Boxer, re-election trail early polls clean among hispanic voters. He take 78 percent, 72. But Bush brothers, Jeb Florida George W. Texas, take half hispanic vote highly successful gubernatorial campaigns. So McCain. Jeb Bush marry Hispanic woman, brother speak Spanish fluently frequently, Senator McCain long espouse hispanic causes. Both George W. Bush McCain draw strength, decide run, proven ability appeal Hispanic voters, well general electoral strength. George W. Bush take 69 percent vote Texas, Democrat sit governor's chair four years ago, second-largest bloc electoral votes. Florida fourth-largest. Governor Bush Texas utter rally cry moderates. A leader compassionate conservative, say victory speech, erase gender gap open Republican party new face new voices. But figures right saw things differently. James Dobson, lead religious broadcaster, say Republicans fare poorly Gingrich Sen. Trent Lott Mississippi, majority leader, cave president budget de-emphasized social issues abortion flag desecration. He call explicitly ouster Gingrich. Likewise, millionaire publisher Steve Forbes, another probable candidate 2000, say leadership lot answer for. Tuesday prove potency education issue, suggest emerge major theme 2000 campaign. Clinton, limit involvement campaign, Gore, extensive participation, stress democratic programs build schools hire teachers. Almost quarter California voters almost twice many voters California state name education press concern. Elsewhere, Democrats governorships Alabama South Carolina odds, partly emphasize rivals' opposition lotteries help pay schools. In Iowa, Democrat elect governor first time since 1969 platform feature dilapidated condition state's schools promise remedy it. Tuesday demonstrate override importance money modern American politics. Feingold, one principal backers campaign-finance reform, survive fight another day, opponents reform. And returns House races, show six 401 members seek re-election won, underlined hard is, present system, challenger raise enough money compete effectively. The difficulties raise money may doom many would-be presidential candidacies. Gore needs, Bush, Forbes former Gov. Lamar Alexander Tennessee. But many others will? Finally, Tuesday deliver indecisive message impeachment. Close two-thirds voters nationwide tell exit pollsters intend send message Clinton, make clear response questions dislike House inquiry president's allege misdeeds want see end. In two states, Kansas Nebraska, majority voters say favor even congressional censure Clinton, much milder form punishment advocate many Clinton backers. Some Republicans say privately hearings Clinton matter, Democrats begin talk deal, equivalent plea bargain would bring matter early close. Nevertheless, Republican members House Judiciary Committee say need press ahead Constitutional process House set motion. Among take view Rep. Bob Barr Georgia, fierce foe president, Rep. Mary Bono California, whose tone muted. But Rep. David Dreier California, incoming Rules Committee chairman, say election play role ensure one us desire drag out. Stunned democratic resurgence mid-term elections, congressional Republicans tear Wednesday blame failure make traditional opposition party gains off-year election. The soul-searching recriminations possibility congressional leadership challenges come election results show Republicans unable increase 55-45 hold Senate Democrats pick five seats house. The democratic surge mark first time since 1934 president's party gain seats midterm election, whittled Republican House majority mere six votes. The democratic victories even remarkable political year mark months-long scandal President Clinton's affair Monica Lewinsky. The Republicans' new 223-211 majority (assuming Democrat lead Oregon hold win), one independent, amount small congressional majority since republican-controlled Congress 1953, last time Republicans control House capture 1994. With attention shift House Judiciary Committee impeachment inquiry, Rep. Henry Hyde tell fellow Republicans panel conference call Wednesday witness Republicans likely call would independent counsel, Kenneth Starr. Hyde, chairman, tell lawmakers hop committee vote possible articles impeachment Thanksgiving, act would take issue hands put Gingrich's. Committee Democrats decline comment Wednesday could discuss Hyde's plan among themselves. Trying put best face results, Speaker Newt Gingrich say Marietta, Ga., Republicans still hold onto House three elections row first time since election 1932. But furious rank file Republicans burn phone lines other, discuss whether mount leadership challenge chambers next weeks. We've get reach southern white males run Washington Republican Party, say Rep. Joe Scarborough, conservative Florida. He say Republicans year leave without accomplishments run on. We need agenda first all, said. We go entire calendar year without agenda. Rep. Chris Shays, moderate Connecticut call election devastating loss say simply, There go major changes leadership. All segments party want see change. At White House, Clinton call election results vindication party's policies. If look results, said, clear unambiguous. The american people want business, concerns, children, families, future address here. That's message election was. One first difficult questions face Congress proceed impeachment inquiry face public resistance remove Clinton office, Republican majority slim almost certain 218 votes require impeachment cannot assembled. In public statement release Wednesday, Hyde say The Committee continue clear constitutional duty complete work fair expeditious manner. Our duty change constitution changed. But Sen. Robert Torricelli, D-N.J., say election results guarantee impeachment fail. I think serious effort remove President Clinton office effectively over, said. It simply Newt Gingrich Trent Lott decide exit strategy. From side aisle, Rep. Rick Lazio, Long Island Republican, said, The inquiry wrap expeditiously, fairly ought resolve immediate future. For past year, Republicans struggle keep control House 228 seats find consensus among party's compete factions. With numbers reduced, republican leadership need carry tortuous balance act unite hard-core conservative faction want aggressive social agenda bloc moderates want party return center. The Democrats hold 206 seats, one hold indepenndent. Any small Republican faction enormous leverage. The new arithmetic House may even lead Democrats' moderate Republicans' forming ad hoc majorities issues, take control away Republican leaders. Already see possibilities, Rep. Peter King Long Island, N.Y., say northeastern Republicans would strengthened. It give us much leverage leadership make easy protect New York, said. It's go weaken position strident conservatives anti-northeast conservatives. Just two weeks ago, Gingrich foreseen election gains range 10 seats 40. Seeming uncharacteristically uncertain Wednesday, say trouble accounting results. Things happen none us fully understand--neither party judgment, said. Taking share blame party's losses, Georgia Republican say misjudge public would recoil Clinton scandal amplify modern media world scandal would drown Republican themes. I mean I totally underestimated degree people would get sick 24-hour-a day talk television talk radio degree whole scandal become sort disgust sheer repetition, said. And result I think probably underestimated need really aggressively push much strong message cut taxes save Social Security, win war drugs, reform education national defense. Majority Leader Sen. Trent Lott Mississippi also admit mistakes, say party present clear enough message final 96 hours campaign. He also concede Congress' final scramble pas $500 billion budget bill hurt party. One lessons Republicans need listen carefully people need clear understanding concise message apply across nation, say Washington. Both Lott Gingrich say Republicans would put emphasis next year tax-cutting shore Social Security system. even two leaders spoke, angry rank-and-file lawmakers make phone calls try assess whether mount challenges republican leaders steer Congress since Republican's assume control four years ago. One senior Republican staffer say House become tinderbox intrigue. Scarborough said, The long distance charges Washington offices probably go roof today. Everybody's call everybody. everybody recognize something's terribly wrong direction Washington Republicans republican governors well New York, Massachusetts, Florida Texas. And Gingrich go way identify Republican campaign's last-minute ad blitz attack President Clinton, caucus know responsible. Gingrich face uprising before, foil coup attempt disgruntle conservatives leadership team summer 1997. Any move remove remain long-shot. But House leadership elections set mid-november, Republicans say time dissatisfaction caucus cross ideological lines moderates like Shays well. We get shellacked, say Rep. Christopher Cannon, conservative Utah. We beat agenda. Republicans discuss possible challenges Gingrich, second-in-command, Rep. Dick Armey, members senior leadership team. Some envision try run entire new ticket head Rep. Bob Livingston, Appropriations Committee chairman Louisiana include Rep. Steve Largent, Oklahoma conservative. ask whether Tuesday's election results could cost speakership, Gingrich said, I'm particularly concerned. Republicans close say expect anger dissipate. In Senate, leadership races take place early December, Republicans talk mount challenges mid-level leadership figures. several senators express particular pique toward re-election chairman, Senator Mitch McConnell Kentucky, pour party dollars much time try defeat democratic champion campaign finance overhaul, Russell Feingold Wisconsin. Feingold close race. Some lawmakers Wednesday approach Sen. Chuck Hagel Nebraska see would replace McConnell. Hagel confirm talked eight senators, consider whether challenge McConnell. Hagel lambast republican leadership election outcome. This big loss us, said. We squander historic opportunity last night. To break even loss. most incumbents coast victory Tuesday night. But returning. Five House Republicans defeated: Vince Snowbarger Kansas, Bill Redmond New Mexico, Jon Fox Pennsylvania, Mike Pappas New Jersey, Rick White Washington. One Democrat also lose re-election bid Rep. Jay Johnson Wisconsin. The new House members include 17 Republicans least 22 Democrats. David Wu, Democrat lead molly Bordonaro, Republican race one House seat Oregon, final victory announcement expect Friday absentee ballots counted. Unlike self-proclaimed revolutionaries Republican class 1994, many newly elect members career politicians rise ranks local state government. Three Democrats sons former lawmakers, Mark Udall Colorado, son Morris Udall represent Arizona; Tom Udall New Mexico, son Udall brother, Stewart, former congressman secretary Interior, Charlie Gonzalez, Texas seat father, Henry. A struggle control House way, Rep. Robert Livingston conduct telephone campaign could lead run Newt Gingrich speaker. But Gingrich's counter-campaign give members pause oust him. At time, small band Republicans vow Thursday would vote re-elect Gingrich circumstances, move that, Republicans' shrunken House majority, could tie party knots months. Rep. Matt Salmon, R-Ariz., said: I personally make decision I cannot vote Newt Gingrich speaker January, six others tell feel way, seven people not, take six deadlock vote. Fury speaker boil since Tuesday's elections, Republicans suffered net loss five seats house. They blame Gingrich, party's chief strategist. But many already angry say failure articulate clear message party go elections messy budget process give President Clinton political edge contradict republican principles fiscal conservativism contain massive amounts spend local projects. House Republicans meet Nov. 18 vote secret ballot leaders. Whoever win republican nomination speaker must stand election full House January. Even Gingrich win secret ballot, could deny re-election speaker January Salmon least five others refuse vote him. Because Republicans control House 12 seats, would take six votes Gingrich deny majority. With chaotic unacceptable prospect looming, Livingston tell Gingrich step aside good party, republican officials said. The officials say Livingston speak Gingrich shortly election returns also election, reflect Livingston's early displeasure speaker budget process. Several Republicans say Livingston, chairman Appropriations Committee one members stature stand speaker, Gingrich work phones Thursday struggle votes. Livingston say nothing publicly challenge Gingrich, several members aides say Thursday would announce intentions, possibly soon Friday, determine could win. Rep. Peter King, R-N.Y., one several members speak Livingston Thursday. He tell he's make number phone calls, he's get positive response run speaker, he'll decide within next 48 hours, King said. He till ducks row, right lot people still loyal speaker, say aide Republican who, like many others, try straddle line fealty speaker may retain power encouragement challenger offers salve embattle party. many Republicans immediately blame Gingrich party's losses Tuesday. Talk quickly emerge next day slate candidates oppose Gingrich lieutenants. The list possible candidates leadership positions include Rep.e Steve Largent Oklahoma, talk Livingston Thursday challenge Gingrich, Republican officials said, speak condition names reported. Those officials say Largent tell Livingston want run ticket would challenge Rep. Dick Armey, majority leader. But, officials say Livingston challenge Gingrich, Largent would run speaker instead. other names float Wednesday leadership posts. They include Reps. David McIntosh Indiana speaker Jennifer Dunn Washington conference chairman. Added mix Thursday name Rep. Christopher Cox, California conservative. As sign uncertainty prevail among House members Thursday, Rep. Henry Hyde, chairman Judiciary Committee one House's venerable members, rebuff chance endorse Gingrich speaker. Hyde say Gingrich bore responsibility party's losses Tuesday. Leadership take credit things go right, said. They ought take blame things go wrong. Asked Gingrich remain speaker, Hyde said: I rather think will, remain seen. The energy many vent publicly Wednesday anger toward Gingrich seem devote Thursday intense internal political calculations whether Livingston could succeed topple Gingrich whether succeed. While many support veteran understands House show shrewd political skills manage massive federal budget, others revive images Louisianan hot-head give party bad name government shutdown two years ago tend toward arm-flailing heat moments. One conservative leader say allies reservations Livingston obsess try keep social issues budget process. The budget, said, vehicle conservatives years add restrictions federal money abortion things can't get Senate past presidential veto. If Livingston challenger, I doubt cause rally real conservatives Congress. Some moderates say prepared support him. Rep. Marge Roukema, R-N.J., said, I would amenable Livingston. Still, cautioned, I'm Newt. But wrong sit seriously look options. Ken Johnson, aide Rep. W.J. (Billy) Tauzin, R-La., say boss emblematic confusion among broad base House Republicans. Billy loyal Speaker Gingrich Dick Armey, he's still loyal them, also want hear say commit next election, Johnson said. Everyone ask question: Can refocus message re-energize base without re-aligning leadership? Salmon say refusal support Gingrich matter base Gingrich's track record one fail strategy another, include impeachment process pork-laden budget. With challenge way, Gingrich try show members responsive concerns. After election night portray Republicans victorious even lose seats, next day take responsibility losses. In another move, Gingrich indicate willing cede control party's congressional campaign committee, allow whole House select members. Gingrich also make strong personal appeals Republicans. Said one top House aide: He'll get support. How much? only vote-counters know. ","Speaker of the House Newt Gingrich has announced that he will not seek re-election to the post when the vote comes up on November 18th.He also announced that he would be leaving the House when his current term as Speaker expires in January.This announcement comes on the heels of a poor Republican showing in the mid-term elections.Although the Republicans retained a majority in the House, the Margin of Republican control shrank in the face of Democratic gains.Gingrich had been seen as the man who led the Republicans our of the doldrums into control of the House and the Senate.","Most Democrats, except for former Clinton strategist James Carville, were hesitant to attack Speaker Newt Gingrich as the 1998 elections approached.Republicans were expected to add to their majority in Congress.However, Republicans lost seats in both the House and Senate.Republicans became disenchanted with the Gingrich ""vision"" and blamed him for the losses.An active campaign began to replace Gingrich as Speaker with Louisiana Congressman Robert Livingston as the main actor.After a losing struggle to maintain his position, Gingrich resigned as Speaker.House Republicans then turned their attention to impeachment proceedings of President Clinton.","The 1998 election ended the political career of Newt Gingrich, who had become Speaker in 1994, leading a conservative, issue-driven, GOP majority.In Oct Democrats were urged to go after him.Although both houses retained a narrowed GOP majority, Newt, with his combativeness and Impeachment-fixation, was blamed for the failures by both wings of his party.The 1998 winners were Gore, Clinton, and moderates.Newt's issues seemed dead in the booming economy and old Democratic loyalists ignored Clinton's morals and returned to the fold.As fellow Republicans jockeyed for his positions, Newt resigned as Speaker on Nov 6 and also decided to leave his House seat.","James Carville complained that fellow Democrats didn't join his war against Speaker Newt Gingrich leading up to the congressional elections of 1998.Gingrich had led the impeachment inquiry against President Clinton in the House.When, contrary to all predictions, the Democrats gained five seats in the House and held their own in the Senate, Republicans enlisted in Carville's cause, blaming Gingrich for the election results.Gingrich battled fiercely as Rep. Livingston rallied forces against him, but ultimately Gingrich accepted defeat agreeing to cede the speakership and his seat in the House.He blamed his defeat on blackmail by Republican cannibals."
26,"America Online verge agree purchase Netscape Communications Corp., Internet pioneer center government's antitrust suit Microsoft Corp., executives involve talks say Sunday. The propose deal complex, three-way transaction involve AOL, Netscape Sun Microsystems Inc. AOL, lead on-line service 14 million subscribers, would acquire Netscape's popular site World Wide Web software business. AOL would also enter joint marketing development partnership Sun Microsystems strengthen Netscape's business sell large corporations heavy-duty software need serve Web pages Internet technologies many thousands users time. The purchase, exchange AOL shares Netscape stock, value roughly $4 billion. A complete deal could announce soon Monday morning. But executives involve talks caution Sunday night details remain negotiated. The Netscape deal, consummated, would realign three businesses forefront modern economy on-line services, Internet software electronic commerce. It would strengthen two Microsoft's lead rivals, AOL Sun Microsystems. At time, however, would end independent existence Netscape, Internet software maker regard serious challenger Microsoft's dominance personal computer software market. Netscape, found 1994, struggle last 18 months assault Microsoft. Its Navigator runaway leader market browser software use navigate World Wide Web. But Microsoft, respond Internet revolution, enter market aggressively, quickly match quality Netscape's technology bundle Microsoft browser, Internet Explorer, industry-standard Windows operating system give away free. Eventually, Microsoft's browser technology catch Netscape's. Earlier year, Netscape announce layoffs start distribute Navigator free well, Microsoft steadily gain browser market. Since then, Netscape focus mainly two businesses advertise transaction fees Netcenter Web site sell industrial-strength software corporations build Internet sites conduct electronic commerce. AOL believe expertise increase revenues Netscape's Web site and, help Sun's programmers vast corporate sales force, accelerate Netscape's software sales well, executives involve negotiations said. Among large corporations, Sun's version Unix, Solaris, among popular operate systems powerful computers run Netscape's server software. The much small Netscape would place wing AOL Sun Microsystems. The three companies combine revenues $12.4 billion last year. Microsoft, comparison, revenues $14 billion. This deal would insure fundamental elements Netscape survive within big companies drive technologies forward, say David B. Yoffie, professor Harvard business school co-author Michael A. Cusumano Massachusetts Institute Technology recent book, compete Internet Time: Lessons Netscape Its Battle Microsoft. The impact deal, any, government's antitrust suit Microsoft uncertain. It appear support key theme Microsoft's defense namely, operate fast-moving industry corporate alliances shift time. Thus, Microsoft argues, antitrust policy tread gently. But deal, government officials insist, direct effect current case. No matter much alliances shift, affect central fact Microsoft's monopoly use abused market power protect monopoly, say David Boies, Justice Department's lead trial lawyer Microsoft case. Executives represent Netscape, AOL Sun Microsystems government witnesses Microsoft trial. And serious merger talks Netscape Chief Executive Officer James Barksdale AOL Chairman Steve Case begin month ago, start Microsoft trial, accord people close talks. Industry analysts suggest companies may embolden take strong anti-microsoft steps base partly perception antitrust case would weaken Microsoft. And representatives Kleiner Perkins Caufield &AMP; Byers, Silicon Valley venture capital firm regard power broker among Microsoft's rivals, sit boards Netscape, Sun AOL. Still, executives involve talks say time propose deal unrelated antitrust trial. Nor it, one person noted, regard single-minded attempt circle wagons Microsoft. Indeed, AOL, accord one person close talks, plans keep Microsoft's Internet Explorer browser default choice on-line service. One government's allegations antitrust suit Microsoft Netscape main browser AOL Microsoft use Windows monopoly bargaining chip. To win browser deal, Microsoft offer AOL prime real estate Windows desktop, main screen 90 percent personal computers sell today. Staying Microsoft's browser see proof AOL still regard placement Windows desktop crucial, well careful step avoid undermine one allegations government's case. For AOL, Netscape purchase would accelerate evolution toward Internet. At present, flagship on-line service hybrid proprietary service, add gateway World Wide Web. In addition, consumers subscribe AOL's dial-up service, also Web site, aol.com, attract 24 million visitors month, accord Media Metrix/Relevant Knowledge, market research firm. Its big Web site offers wide range information, entertainment, Internet chat e-mail, lead example all-in-one sit become known portals. Netscape's Netcenter traffic slip bit recent months, 16 million visitors month, it, too, major portal. Together, huge player intensify portal battle viewers result advertising revenues. Yahoo current leader among portal sites 25 million monthly visitors, Microsoft's site attract 20 million month. Though know new-media company consumers, AOL also interest boost electronic commerce business Netscape purchase. AOL recently do work Eastman Kodak, American Greetings companies, promote products on-line subscribers also build Internet infrastructure software conduct electronic commerce. AOL note projections like recent one Forrester Research Inc., predict worldwide Internet commerce could reach high $3.2 trillion 2003, 5 percent global sales. Sun Microsystems, analysts say, could strong partner AOL market Internet commerce software. Sun corporate software company sales force several thousand. As moves increasingly Internet technology, AOL prove excellent partner Sun terms develop use Sun's Java, Internet program language. And Netscape's browser longer generate revenue own, distribution channel Java technology. Having Netscape's browser safely hand friendly company strategic importance Sun, since Microsoft own alternative browser market. AOL expect pay little, any, premium Netscape's stock price Friday, executives close deal said, since Netscape shares double last month. In last week alone, Netscape's stock jump $12, nearly 45 percent, follow reports discuss possible partnership AOL. The stock close Friday $39.1875, $2.625. AOL's shares gain $1.50 Friday, closing $84.875. Envisioning thoroughly network world World Wide Web limitless marketplace information, entertainment, products services, America Online Inc. Tuesday lay details agreement buy Netscape Communications Corporation $4.2 billion. By move quickly toward companies recently come see inevitable convergence technology media, America Online hop secure solid lead battle already join giants like Microsoft Corp. International Business Machines Corp. transform great part cyberspace vast virtual mall. Part vision rest alliance Sun Microsystems America Online negotiate part deal. Sun bring cyber-savvy sales force effort but, even importantly, strong technology partner develop Netscape's industrial-strength software run Internet sites. Sun indeed technology heavyweight. It own Java program language specially design Internet applications, Solaris, among popular commercial operate systems powerful computers big corporations use serve Internet services like World Wide Web, e-mail retail transactions. It also manufacture highly respected line powerful computers base microprocessor chips. But America Online big Internet players compete real potential gold mine lie road, perhaps five years away, people venture line information shop personal computers inexpensive Internet appliances cost $200 each, maybe include free part subscription service, cellular phones now. Today, wire remain comparatively elitist activity estimate 25 percent american households access Internet last year, 5 percent households buy merchandise line. But executives America Online Netscape hope deal accelerate timetable day Net ubiquitous, people tap World Wide Web appliance-like devices, pagers, cell phones, television set-top boxes computers routinely use telephone today. A new generation Internet devices able deliver service anywhere key part deal long run, say Stephen M. Case, 40, chairman America Online. For present, however, idea make America Online, nation's lead online service, standard way get onto Internet, executives explained. Netscape, Internet pioneer, crucial part effort, said. There assurance vision technological future prove accurate or, even does, America Online-Netscape combination lead way. Still, long-range game plan help explain brought America Online Netscape together. And ability companies' executives sell vision Netscape's whiz-kid programmers particular determine whether merger succeeds. Netscape's headquarters Mountain View, Calif., likely become prime target Silicon Valley headhunters. As case software company, Netscape's key asset talented programmers, many code hackers may reluctant work America Online, still reputation middle-brow service cater online newcomers, know derisively newbies. Stock options financial incentives tailor try keep Netscape employees board. But people want change world, we've get clear joining America Online, along Sun component, really big opportunity us, say Marc Andreessen, 26-year-old cofounder Netscape lead team young programmers supercomputing center University Illinois Silicon Valley start Internet software company 1994. This ought preeminent Internet company next decade, Andreessen declared, speak cell phone streetcorner Palo Alto, Calif. For part, Andreessen, Netscape executive vice president, become Netscape's chief technology officer next three four months, merger completed. His new job America Online yet determined, likely chief technology officer combine company well, America Online executive said. Already, accord one Netscape board member, Andreessen deliver 12-page single-spaced memorandum Case, set view technological road map new company follow future, emphasize opportunities electronic commerce environment people link Internet. Netscape, populate compute sophisticates, America Online, know on-ramp Internet technologically challenged, seem corporate odd couple. But two companies, executives explained, evolve toward year. In telephone interview America Online's headquarters Dulles, Va., Case describe Netscape enterprise morph company dependent sales software use browse World Wide Web Microsoft's cross-hairs business rely advertising revenues popular Netcenter Web site selling software corporations handle electronic commerce. The Netscape transformation largely reaction Microsoft's competitive assault browser business central element government's antitrust suit Microsoft. Microsoft bundle browser industry-standard Windows operate system, give away browser free. The government allege steps part pattern anticompetitive practices, Microsoft maintain moves intend mainly benefit consumers. early year, lay workers suffer large loss last year, Netscape announce would also distribute browser free. It seem stabilized business around new model. Netscape announce Tuesday earn $2.7 million revenues $162 million fourth fiscal quarter, end September. Yet America Online also change last couple years, move well beyond reputation online service beginners. It Internet chat service run all-in-one site Web, know portal, include e-mail, Internet searching, news, entertainment online shopping. America Online really change closed online service novice users Internet media technology company diverse set brands, Andreessen said. These two companies move direction, fit good one. America Online Inc. want become next Microsoft two promise information-age fields Microsoft Corp. another company Internet media business electronic commerce. With proposed purchase Netscape Communications Corp., AOL, nation's large dial-up online service 14 million subscribers, hopes take significant step toward ambitious goal. If $4 billion deal complete companies reach final agreement Monday night AOL would acquire lead Internet brand enlarge wire audience absorb millions regularly visit Netscape's popular NetCenter site World Wide Web. Acquiring Netscape would really enhance America Online's role premier Internet media company, say James F. Moore, president Geopartners Inc., consult firm. America Online assemble kind audience numbers convince people Internet become mainstream media. In new media business, traditional media like television newspapers, eyeball translate advertising revenue. But really intrigues media executives consumer marketers new media news, entertainment services render computer code be inherently two-way medium people interact tap key click mouse button The interaction advertisers marketers want see, course, buying. And potential exploiting instant, direct connection consumers fuel recent optimism electronic commerce. Today, companies sell everything books baby clothes Internet. most companies progress beyond experimentation stage, handful encourage success stories like Amazon.com, on-line bookstore. By 2003, Forrester Research Inc., whose business analyze trends cyberspace, projects Internet commerce could reach $3.2 trillion, 5 percent sales worldwide. AOL forefront convergence media commerce converge, integration reflect lineage leaders. Steve Case, chairman, new-product manager Pepsico's Pizza Hut chain, Robert Pittman, president, former MTV executive. Microsoft also invest heavily new media electronic commerce. It online service, MSN, compete AOL, well information-and commerce Web sit focus travel, cars real estate. It also own Sidewalk, network local sites list movies, restaurants stores cities around country include Seattle New York. Its MSNBC Internet news service half joint venture NBC. Microsoft expect formidable competitor media-and-commerce business. It shortage bright people money rival. Besides deep pockets, Microsoft built-in advantage computer-based medium Windows operating system run 90 percent personal computers sell today. Its control Windows desktop give valuable piece commercial real estate information age. In theory, least, own desktop screen help Microsoft steer consumers online offerings issue key government's antitrust suit Microsoft. But far, Microsoft start slowly fields Internet media electronic commerce. Microsoft may want to, dominate new markets, say Richard Shaffer, principal Technologic Partners, research firm. America Online recognize big opportunity emerge growth businesses like electronic commerce instead try take Microsoft head-on. Still, Netscape deal completed, AOL also find software business way never past. Netscape know pioneer commercial development software use navigate World Wide Web. Microsoft saw browser software direct threat industry dominance pursue market aggressively, bundle browser Windows give away free tactics challenge government. But Netscape long generate revenues browser, also distribute free, sale heavy-duty software sell corporations. much software use technological back office electronic commerce use building Web sit process transactions. A surprising element propose deal AOL intend hold onto Netscape's corporate software business instead sell establish software company. America Online credibility market, observe Michael A. Cusumano, professor Massachusetts Institute Technology's Sloan School Management. Executives close AOL explain decision need provide full-line offerings electronic commerce, corporate Web site computer screens consumers. But AOL decide needs help preserve strengthen Netscape's corporate software business. To that, brought Sun Microsystems Inc. side deal, complicate transaction considerably. AOL, accord executives close propose deal, Netscape, joint marketing development partnership Sun. As part deal, AOL agree purchase $300 million worth Sun's computers service, Sun apparently agree purchase sizeable amounts Netscape software, Sun's sales force must sell. Still, AOL Sun longer-term objective well one promise place direct conflict Microsoft. For nearly year, William J. Raduchel, Sun's chief strategist, work closely AOL, accord Sun executives. A former Harvard economics professor teach Scott McNealy, Sun chairman, Raduchel focus Sun's Internet program technologies, call Java Jini, see potential threats Microsoft's dominance. By combine Sun's technology prowess AOL's powerful consumer brand, Sun executives say, potential kind end-run around Microsoft's grip desktop computing. In research laboratories, Sun work stripped-down network computer simple-to-use information appliance, could cost little $200 give away part subscription service. The concept AOL's Internet media electronic commerce services could deliver many homes today many people still shun expense difficulty use personal computer. The appliance would mainly receiver screen, compute power reside vast central computers serve information users request tap buttons. Sun's technological specialty kind centralized network computing. If long-term AOL-Sun vision ever materialize certainly three-to-five year bet, least could give companies boost technological independence Microsoft. Microsoft Corp. argue federal court Monday propose acquisition Netscape Communications Corp. America Online seriously undermine government's antitrust suit software giant. From legal standpoint, propose deal pull rug government, William Neukom, Microsoft's senior vice president legal affairs, say Monday morning courthouse steps. The reasoning behind assertion, Microsoft says, propose deal demonstrate Netscape large software industry healthy vibrant even illegal anti-competitive practices allege government's suit. But David Boies, government's lead attorney, say irrelevant. Whatever deal end end deal go remove obstacles Microsoft place path competition industry, said. Michael Lacovara, Microsoft lawyer question government witness, economist Frederick Warren-Boulton, suggest trial Monday propose acquisition undermine Warren-Boulton's argument, Microsoft seem head toward obtain monopoly Internet browser software match one apparently hold operate systems. After all, 22 percent Americans use Internet reach America Online. And present AOL use Microsoft's Web browser, Internet Explorer, service's default choice. In exchange that, Microsoft places AOL advertisement Internet link Windows 98. Lacovara ask witness whether, AOL's service contract expire January, would expect AOL continue distribute Microsoft software. Yes, Warren-Boulton responded. It clear AOL's incentive change propose merger Netscape. He note America Online officials say need among online services feature Windows force accept Microsoft terms establish Internet Explorer default choice. Lacovara ask Warren-Boulton question lay entire cross-examination witness Microsoft's large assertion Monday propose Netscape-AOL deal. Surely combination, asked, tell something nature competition software industry? Warren-Boulton's answer probably one Lacovara after. To extent potential merger result Microsoft's actions exclusive contracts actions, said, unfortunate see disappearance firm like Netscape, brightest, new star. warren-boulton's purpose stand government establish Microsoft monopoly operating-system software; 90 percent world's computers use Microsoft operate system. That foundation government's case since federal antitrust law forbids certain behavior monopolist would legal firm face healthy competition. Through repeated, often circumlocutious questioning, Lacovara try make case Microsoft's overwhelm market share ephemeral. The software industry vibrant fast moving, suggested, Microsoft could topple position moment point view company encourage among employees. On Friday Monday, Lacovara repeatedly point companies place operate systems market, software companies principally Microsoft's great rivals write software new systems. But Warren-Boulton argue existence fringe competitors operate system market mean way Microsoft monopoly power. On Monday afternoon, Lacovara make issue success Apple Computer Co. sell new imac computer. He enter evidence Apple news release issue last month showing, among things, 12.5 percent people buy Apple's new imac computer previously own Windows machine. Apple computers use different operate system, Mac-OS. The outcome Microsoft antitrust case may long way off, one thing already clear: This first major e-mail trial. The government's prosecution Microsoft Corp.'s defense, strike degree, legal campaigns wag electronic messages. The human testimony often pal next e-mail evidence. On stand videotape testimony, people question shrug, mumble forget. The e-mail alive ideas competitive zeal, punctuate profanity exclamation points. The second week trial end prosecutors frustrate lengthy cross-examination Microsoft's lead lawyer leave time government show several hours videotape deposition Bill Gates, Microsoft chairman. With new witness, executive Apple Computer Inc., take stand Monday, uncertain Gates tape played. The Justice Department 20 states sue Microsoft believe tape strengthen case show Gates say involved plans take government alleges illegal steps stifle competition Internet software market. The Gates videotape, say David Boies, Justice Department's trial lawyer, offers opportunity judge Gates' credibility. But Gates credibility gap, one, become issue videotape tap remarks compare contrast e-mail write received. The e-mail record, government insists, show gate waist-deep plot anti-competitive deals bully tactics deny professes never hear tap deposition. If machinations central government's case, summon Gates trial? The government need put Gates stand, e-mail memoranda, Stephen Houck, lawyer states, tell court. The Microsoft legal team months prepare e-mail defense. First, Microsoft argues, anything look damage take context. I urge honor, John Warden, Microsoft's lead lawyer, tell Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson, view considerable skepticism crazy quilt e-mail fragments seem form core government's case. But Microsoft also mount e-mail counterattack, cull millions messages obtain subpoena competitors pretrial discovery. Warden's cross-examination ritual present government witness internal e-mail company pose declaration question. These interrogations two refrains: Isn't true company exactly accuse Microsoft doing, true Microsoft prevail predatory monopolist superior technology? Microsoft accuse try prod companies stay way. so last week, example, Warden produce e-mail Stephen Case, chairman America Online, suggest partnership Netscape Communications Corp. companies would focus respective strengths. That division labor, Case wrote, would best way achieve goal Marc Andreessen, Netscape's cofounder, describe earlier e-mail beat Beast From Redmond want see us dead reference Microsoft's headquarters Redmond, Wash. Printouts e-mail another form write communication. By 1920s, typewriters become common, type memoranda start used court cases. From 1950s 1980s, legal experts say, explosion documentation fuel new technologies electric typewriters, photocopy fax machines, personal computers. And e-mail, add, play important role legal inquiries years, like Iran-contra case 1980s e-mail find Oliver North's computer prove crucial. But Microsoft case result sweeping government antitrust investigation high-technology company e-mail supplant telephone common instrument communication. E-mail revolutionize investigations kind, one senior Justice Department official said. While investigation, Microsoft hand government estimate 30 million documents, mostly e-mail. In trial, two sides submit 3,000 exhibits, mainly e-mail. And e-mail, people often communicate frankly informally write letter report tap out, punch button go cyberspace. But e-mail communication documentary evidence, legal cases provide rich, contemporaneous record people think plan time. It sharp contrast formal oral testimony, often coach lawyers craft selective memory. The e-mail record certainly make i-don't-recall line response harder sustain, say Robert Litan, former senior official Justice Department's antitrust division Brookings Institution. It also powerful ammunition point contradictions testimony. And government attack Gates' credibility videotape deposition, take three days august. The government offer glimpse strategy first day trial. It show brief clips point deposition Gates ask meet June 21, 1995, which, government alleges, Microsoft offer divide browser market Netscape make investment company, chief rival market. In taped deposition, Gates say recall ask one subordinate whether thought make sense invest Netscape. He say ask June 1995 meeting replied, I see something make sense. But e-mail May 31, 1995, Gates urge alliance Netscape. We could even pay money part deal, wrote, buy piece something. The contradiction Gates' deposition e-mail, though, speak issue whether Microsoft make illegal offer Netscape. To sure, Microsoft say e-mail communications counts most. But e-mail looks bad get record, end Microsoft's lawyers go spend much trial try explain away, say Stephen Axinn, lead antitrust litigator firm Axinn, Veltrop &AMP; Harkrider New York.

America Online verge agree purchase Netscape Communications Corp., Internet pioneer center government's antitrust suit Microsoft Corp., executives involve talks say Sunday. The propose deal complex, three-way transaction involve AOL, Netscape Sun Microsystems Inc. AOL, lead on-line service 14 million subscribers, would acquire Netscape's popular site World Wide Web software business. But part deal, AOL would also enter joint marketing development partnership Sun Microsystems strengthen Netscape's business sell large corporations heavy-duty software need serve Web pages Internet technologies many thousands users time. The purchase, exchange AOL shares Netscape stock, value roughly $4 billion. A complete deal could announce soon Monday morning. But executives involve talks caution Sunday night details remain negotiated. The Netscape deal, consummated, would realign three businesses forefront modern economy on-line services, Internet software electronic commerce. It would strengthen two Microsoft's lead rivals, AOL Sun Microsystems. At time, however, would subsume Netscape, Internet software maker regard serious challenger Microsoft's dominance personal computer software market. Netscape, found 1994, struggle last 18 months assault Microsoft. Its Navigator runaway leader market browser software use navigate World Wide Web. But Microsoft, respond Internet revolution, enter market aggressively, quickly match quality Netscape's technology bundle Microsoft browser, Internet Explorer, industry-standard Windows operating system give away free. Earlier year, Netscape announce layoffs start distribute Navigator free well, Microsoft steadily gain browser market. Since then, Netscape focus mainly two businesses advertise transaction fees Netcenter Web site sell industrial-strength software corporations build Internet sites conduct electronic commerce. AOL believe expertise increase revenues Netscape's Web site and, help Sun's programmers vast corporate sales force, accelerate Netscape's software sales well, executives involve negotiations said. Sun's version Unix, Solaris, among popular operate systems large, powerful computers run Netscape's server software. This deal would insure fundamental elements Netscape survive within big companies drive technologies forward, say David B. Yoffie, professor Harvard business school co-author Michael A. Cusumano Massachusetts Institute Technology recent book, compete Internet Time: Lessons Netscape Its Battle Microsoft. The impact deal, any, government's antitrust suit Microsoft uncertain. It appear support key theme Microsoft's defense namely, operate fast-moving industry corporate alliances shift time. Thus, Microsoft argues, antitrust policy tread gently. But deal, government officials insist, direct effect current case. No matter much alliances shift, affect central fact Microsoft's monopoly use abused market power protect monopoly, say David Boies, Justice Department's lead trial lawyer Microsoft case. Executives represent Netscape, AOL Sun Microsystems government witnesses Microsoft trial. And serious merger talks Netscape Chief Executive Officer James Barksdale AOL Chairman Steve Case begin month ago, start Microsoft trial, accord people close talks. Industry analysts suggest companies may embolden take strong anti-microsoft steps base partly perception antitrust case would weaken Microsoft. And representatives Kleiner Perkins Caufield &AMP; Byers, Silicon Valley venture capital firm regard power broker among Microsoft's rivals, sit boards Netscape, Sun AOL. Stock prices vault record levels Monday, further recovery recently two months ago seem nearly unthinkable. I think serious correction since 1990, I never think write bull market over, say Byron Wien, U.S. equity strategist Morgan Stanley Dean Witter &AMP; Co. now seem behind us. The Dow Jones industrial average rise 214.72 points, 2.34 percent, 9,374.27. The record first since July 17, Dow close 9,337.97. Since Aug. 31, Dow stand 7,539.07 steep slide, blue-chip gauge risen 24 percent. For year, Dow 18.54 percent chance rise 20 percent fourth consecutive year, something never accomplish before. Broader averages also climbed. The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock index set record, rise 24.66 points, 2.12 percent, 1,188.21. The Nasdaq composite index reach new high post big percentage gain Monday, rise 49.21 points, 2.55 percent, 1,977.42. And Russell 2000 index smaller-company issues gain 3.86 points, nearly 1 percent, 398.15. Monday's action energize daily record number mergers acquisitions value $1 billion more. The merger announcements prompt investors change estimates much companies worth also indicate come declines outstanding shares stock. This may supply-demand story, demand stocks rise supply stock reduce one company another merges, say Hugh Johnson, chief investment officer First Albany Corp. The flow money mutual funds fairly strong, pressure managers put money work. Two deals seem catalysts broad swaths stocks. News Bankers Trust may close accept $8.9 billion offer Deutsche Bank Germany heighten interest financial-services bank stocks. And word America Online may acquire Netscape Communications $4 billion stock power Internet technology stocks even lofty valuations. Among financial companies, J.P. Morgan gain 6 1/16, 115 11/16. American Express 4 3/8, 108 15/16. Merrill Lynch jump 4 3/8, 76. And Donaldson, Lufkin &AMP; Jenrette rise 3 9/16, 42}. Netscape active stock Monday, gain 2}, 41 15/16. America Online gain 4 3/8, 89\. other Internet stocks also surged, analysts say group, see meteoric gains recent weeks, ripe steep correction. Yahoo Amazon.com become $200 stocks Monday. Yahoo rise 30 7/16, 221 7/16. And Amazon.com gain 37 3/8, 218. The performance Internet stocks unsettle sign, Wien said. Still, more-established technology shares also good day. IBM rise 7, 166 5/8. Microsoft jump 5 9/16, 119 3/16. And Intel close 113 9/16, 1{. After Monday's big price moves, Wien say accord calculations, stocks 10 percent overvalued. By contrast, middle July market 20 percent overvalued, said. Nonetheless, market's recovery, buttress three cuts interest rates Federal Reserve Board, leave many longtime Wall Street hands grasp historical parallels. At point new ground, say Laszlo Birinyi, head market research firm. At begin year, I say target Dow 10,000 end 1998. If anyone ask market go looks like corrective blip, I would say new target would 9,000. I surprise 10,000 figure come back table year. The New York Times say editorial Wednesday, Nov. 25: America Online's effort acquire Netscape set partnership Sun Microsystems reminder rapidly corporate landscape change fast-moving technical fields. But lessen need Justice Department vigorously pursue antitrust suit Microsoft, dominant player software. The department present solid evidence Microsoft use monopoly operate systems muscle rivals partners head competition software realms. The Internet rise quickly information medium four years ago, book The Road Ahead, Bill Gates scarcely mention it. In addition, couple years ago America Online, world's big online service, much trouble get rid bugs system widely deride America On Hold. now Microsoft move aggressively Internet Justice Department accuse predatory behavior, America Online rocket forward make deals Internet players. In antitrust suit Microsoft, federal government charges company illegally bundle browser Windows operate system smother Netscape's chances market browser. now corridors outside antitrust trial Microsoft's lawyers maintain Netscape find new partner America Online need protection government. But could easily argue Microsoft bludgeon Netscape dissolution, force distress sale America Online. Nor clear customers America Online choose Netscape's browser vehicle buy sell Internet. even newly musclebound form, America Online remain dependent Microsoft's good favorable placement AOL icon main desktop screen. It may that, years hence, America Online, Netscape Sun put together alternative means Internet telephone lines, cables like. But day, fairness require Justice Department action insure Microsoft use current position thwart consumer choice. only companies know get products consumer incentive innovate turn Internet revolutionary medium promises be. ","As the government continued to press its anti-trust suit against Microsoft, AOL has begun negotiations to purchase Netscape.Netscape is at the heart of the antitrust suit.Netscape alleges that Microsoft marketing practices, packaging its Internet Explorer in its operating system denied market opportunities to Netscape.The AOL deal, a three-way negotiation between AOL, Sun Microsystems and Netscape, would combined three Microsoft rivals.AOL is counting on the Netscape purchase to allow it to expand its internet Market by helping business operate on the internet in an effort to join Media and technology.","In a bid to become a leader in the lucrative cyberspace economy, AOL will buy Netscape and set up a partnership with Sun.The venture will let AOL offer corporations end-to-end services, including servers, software, and accessibility to consumers.Eventually, AOL hopes to capitalize on the production of cheap devices offering Internet access to more homes.News of the deal helped push the Dow Jones to a new high.Meanwhile, Microsoft, accused by the Justice Department of using its operating system dominance to squelch competition in the browser market, claims the deal shows the software industry is healthy and that Netscape needs no government protection.","As the U.S. government pressed its antitrust case against Microsoft Corp. in November 1998, America Online (AOL) proposed an alliance with Netscape Communications and Sun Microsystems.The three-pronged deal promised to provide on-line services, Internet software and electronic commerce.AOL was to buy Netscape and forge a partnership with Sun, benefiting all three and giving technological independence from Microsoft.Microsoft lawyers argued unconvincingly that AOL's purchase of Netscape would undermine the government's antitrust case, based in large part on Netscape's complaint.It remained to be seen whether AOL could achieve a vast virtual mall.","America Online became the leading force in cyberspace for individuals to exchange e-mail and check the latest news.AOL saw a bright day ahead as a company that could provide online services, Internet software, and electronic commerce.To position itself better in this growing market, AOL sought to buy Netscape and work an alliance with Sun Microsystems.Netscape has faltered because of the ubiquity of the Microsoft Windows operating system requiring its browser.Microsoft argued that a vibrant technology market and rising stock prices undercut antitrust charges against it.At the trial the government presented thousands of e-mails supporting its case."

Kuchma elaborate comments group ukrainian economists, say changes necessary country's economic problems. Kuchma urge economists come recommendations national meeting economists November, Interfax news agency reported. Ukraine suffer economic problems since 1991 collapse Soviet Union especially hard hit financial crisis neighbor Russia, main trading partner. The russian crisis hurt bilateral trade, cause ukrainian currency fall lead withdrawal investors Ukraine. In recent months, Kuchma implement economic reforms decree, prompt International Monetary Fund release first installment long-awaited dlrs 2.2 billion loan. many reforms, however, remain stalled. National Bank chairman Viktor Yushchenko Washington week consultations IMF officials. Yushchenko warn bank would spend dwindle reserves support hryvna currency, avoid comments currency recent days.

The government's press service say focus possible ways keep hryvna 3.5 U.S. dollar end year. The hryvna trading 3.4 dollar recent days trade limited. There wide expectations Ukraine hryvna fall even further, Ukrainians stock food, clothing household goods save fast-devaluing money. When world's finance ministers central bankers gather last year Hong Kong, nervously congratulate contain least moment nasty financial brush fire Asia. In year's time, many predict hallway chatter, troubles Thailand Indonesia would look like replay Mexico 1995 rough bump road world enjoy remarkable prosperity. talk bad market calls. Twelve months later, financial mandarins clog Washington limousines glide endless receptions annual meeting International Monetary Fund World Bank, everything could go wrong world economy has: bad downturn Japan since World War II, economic meltdown Russia, depression Indonesia plunge 100 million people poverty line, deep fears happen next Latin America. What make year's IMF meeting remarkable, though, harsh criticisms direct monetary fund itself, and, extension, U.S. Treasury, view power behind IMF. This year, place confident predictions, mutual recriminations. Arguments break whether true culprits crony capitalists weaken leaders like Russian President Boris Yeltsin, huge investors pour money world's emerge markets reckless abandon mid-1990s panicked past twelve months. Whatever reason, one reality prevails: Hundreds billions dollars flee economies four continents seek safest havens possible, often United States money return anytime soon. And subtext every seminar capital flow every conclave nervous ministers painfully blunt questions: Can stopped? Or world head global recession? Fifty-three years ago IMF create Bretton Woods conference seek stabilize world economy secure peace World War II. now attack sides, charge worsen bad situation misjudge economics, politically tone-deaf volatile capitals world, Jakarta, Indonesia, Moscow. For first time, disturb questions whether institution still capable, financially politically, contain kind economic contagion catch world unaware. Once, IMF's critics largely find Africa South Asia, fund often view arrogant; today include Wall Street's big players top officials powerful economies Asia Europe. only include former Secretary State George Schultz members Congress increasingly suspicious international institutions talk scrap IMF altogether. But almost everyone talk create new financial architecture old one clearly cannot: smother financial wildfires leap around globe. President Clinton, British Prime Minister Tony Blair leaders, months silence, edge debate, cases wrest issue first time finance ministers central banks. Their fear, advisers say, 15 months financial turmoil threaten political stability. such concerns turn year's meeting tumbled mass worries grope short long-term solutions. The Japanese, French, Southeast Asians arrive Washington different diagnoses go wrong, different solutions set right. The United States set plans, mix suggestions force disclosure financial data countries around world impose american-style financial standards regulation. Meanwhile, ideological argument break whether world slow long march toward free open markets strategy press Clinton administration past six years. Others argue unwise start rebuild hospital patients still operate tables. last year standard answer us give come this: `We IMF World Bank, know best,' Indonesian Foreign Minister Ali Alatas say breakfast Washington day, reflect crisis turn 30 years astound growth country overnight depression. then say everything go wrong fault, said. But now, I think people know much problem come outside, need something better. And IMF begin fight back, awkward role institution dominate Ph.D. economists unaccustomed openly challenged. Every place turn read story, come in, make things worse, say Stanley Fischer, deputy manage director fund, born Northern Rhodesia Zambia become chairman Massachusetts Institute Technology's economics department take job put center financial storm. We frequently get blame, well-deserved, said. But politically convenient governments around world cry, `The IMF make us it,' pin mistakes us. That's fine. We'd rather loved, we'd like effective. MISCALCULATIONS, POLITICS AND SAFETY NETS On steam January day, Michel Camdessus, IMF's top official, slip Jakarta private residence President Suharto sit four-hour meeting tick off, line line, huge reforms Indonesia would implement return tens billions dollars emergency aid. Two previous deals collapse Suharto ignore fund's conditions, Camdessus insist strike deal directly Suharto, Asia's longest-serving leader. It meet men know different worlds power politics: Suharto rise general central Java, Camdessus detonate mines Algeria french army enter french Treasury way become head France's central bank. It there, senior IMF official recalled. He tell dismantle national airplane project, cleave monopoly, distribution monopolies. At one point, Camdessus look impassive Suharto said, You see means family, reference vast investments country's key industries. He said, `I call children, understand.' But within months, exchange Jakarta come symbolize IMF's twin troubles: Its inability understand reckon national politics countries need radical reform, focus economic stabilization rather social costs actions. Suharto intention fulfil agreement. It was, one former Cabinet members said, delay move obvious everyone except Camdessus. perhaps one reason IMF sometimes appear tone-deaf senior staff almost entirely composed Ph.D. economists. There officials deep experience international politics, much less complexities javanese culture work Indonesia. Historically, experts politics security gravitate United Nations, development experts World Bank, economists IMF create dangerous gaps crisis like one. As result, fund rudimentary understanding would happen demands meet Indonesia's state monopolies quickly dissolved. While system line pockets Suhartos friends, also distribute food, gasoline staples country stretch 3,000 miles thousands islands. To help balance budget, fund demand quick end expensive subsidies keep price food gasoline artificially low. But that, combine huge currency devaluation spark crisis, result high prices shortages fuel riots continue day, millions Indonesians lose jobs. The IMF unintentionally, officials insist also speed Suharto's resignation, insist elimination crony capitalism, code words remove Suharto family center economy. Ultimately, may prove Indonesia's salvation, new government contain riot ethnic chinese minority whose money desperately need save country's fast-shrinking economy. It worth noting, Fischer say week, programs Asia Indonesia, Korea Thailand take hold change government. Nonetheless, Indonesia experience revive argument IMF focus stabilize banks currencies, prevent capital flight free markets, blind social costs actions. Among tough critics sister institution, World Bank, whose main charge alleviate poverty. You've see tension almost every day, one senior World Bank official say recently. The bank go extraordinary lengths recent months differentiate role fund, announce triple aid poor countries hit economic chaos. even U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan join argument, warn speech Harvard recently globalization succeed, must succeed poor rich alike. It must deliver rights less riches. It must harness cause capital alone, development prosperity poorest world. IMF officials say change strategies see exact great social cost. It's difficult formula get exactly right, Fischer say August, Russia teeter IMF send $4.8 billion aid rapidly wasted. You need enough discipline send right message markets keep investors fleeing. But need enough leeway keep people suffer otherwise would. In recent months, noted, IMF allow spend sustain subsidies basic goods longer periods Indonesia, Korea elsewhere. There new flexibility IMF senior Indonesian official conclude recently. It lot better. A U.S. PAWN, OR A RUNAWAY AGENCY? The Clinton administration admit IMF many failings, many display year. But insist world go global financial crises without IMF century result 1930s. I doubt situation past year would much worse great devaluations, defaults, contagion, great trade dislocations without program agree IMF finance provided, Deputy Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers tell Congress last week. many Republicans Democrats unconvinced. even though Senate overwhelmingly approve $18 billion contribution fund help fight new crises, House defeat measure two weeks ago. The fund's last hope get money, free nearly $100 billion contributions nations wait United States act, come House Senate try resolve budget differences conference committee next 10 days. A rejection, Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin insists, would send message around world United States turn back one institution charge restore economic stability. Everywhere else world, though, politicians businessmen insist one big problems IMF that, contrary view Congress, act U.S. Treasury's lap dog. Ask Jakarta Moscow, response same: The IMF never ventures far without look back approve nod master. When United States weigh in, however, IMF call rescue country deep trouble. only IMF U.S. Treasury leverage extract commitments return billions aid. In theory, U.S. influence limited: It 18.5 percent vote fund. Germany, Japan, France Britain 5 percent each. But practice United States usually get way, exercise influence behind scenes, often interactions Fischer Summers. The two meet Fischer MIT faculty Summers graduate student take one classes, later become colleague MIT. Each serve chief economist World Bank. It Summers instrumental placing Fischer fund's no. 2 job, days talk constantly. It's usually warm relationship, Fischer say summer. Remember, job cannot turn outsiders advice can't call chief economist Wall Street firm, even many academic friends, many issues confidential. The Treasury's relations Camdessus often strain plays role world diplomat, travel globe try coax along political leaders. The tensions obvious start Asia crisis. The fund make little secret displeasure United States offer direct aid Thailand, major U.S. ally, sign support confidence. Mindful backlash Congress Mexico bail U.S. money, last thing Treasury plan do. Summers, turn, think fund forcing Thais implement reform commitments rigorously enough disclose true financial picture. Within U.S. government dissension: The State Defense Departments felt United States Thailand, back Treasury ask would like pony aid budgets. There conflicts. When Japan use last IMF meeting propose set $100 billion Asia Fund one would exclude United States would probably offer aid much relaxed conditions IMF does. Rubin call Camdessus breakfast one morning tell japanese proposal would undercut IMF's authority. We've dispute Michel, Rubin report aides return orange juice croissant. One shot back: And 8 a.m. Camdessus back Rubin's insistence walk away money Asia could used. Japan say back similar proposal weekend, time $30 billion fund. Camdessus also rankle U.S. officials statements amount cheerlead reassure markets sometimes face facts. In June, Russia way collapse, Camdessus declare contrary markets commentators imagine slow collapse Russia's economy, crisis. This major development. The bailouts Russia South Korea prime examples Washington muscle IMF's turf soon major U.S. strategic interests involved. last Christmas, South Korea slip within days run hard currency pay debts December, send secret envoy, Kim Kihwan, work rescue package. I bother go IMF, Kim recall recently. I call Summers' office Treasury home Seoul, fly Washington go directly there. I know would get done. Within days Treasury dispatch David Lipton, experience veteran emergency bailouts, leave post undersecretary international affairs month, shadow IMF staff's negotiations government Seoul. Fischer displeased. To make negotiation effective, clear authority negotiating, said. WHO lose RUSSIA? The pattern repeat summer, United States race put together $17 billion package Russia. The IMF's staff Moscow declare Russia need money need enact policies would restore confidence investors. The Americans Germans come different conclusion. Soon after, U.S. officials gather White House situation room consider might happen Russia ruble devalued market reforms collapse push IMF come emergency money. so fund begin assemble last-ditch program prop country resist reform plans seven years. Camdessus, though, still hesitant, question whether IMF risk scarce resources Russia. We pull Michel along, senior Treasury official recalled. As turned out, Camdessus' instincts right approach champion Rubin Summers prove disastrously wrong. The first installment payment $4.8 billion wasted, prop currency long enough, words one IMF official, let oligarchs get money country. then Yeltsin reverse commitments, let ruble devalue anyway, begin print money abandon fire virtually every reformer government result collapse IMF agreements indefinite suspension aid program. Now, inside IMF Capitol Hill, recriminations lose Russia. Publicly, Fischer argue apologies owe attempted Russia.

Ukraine's parliament Friday refuse approve President Leonid Kuchma's decree establish state fund compensate people savings lose banks.

After two weeks deliberations announce still plan rescue country economic crisis. I want repeat program, Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov said. It yet work out. In nations statement might provoke alarm. But Primakov seek calm anxious public worry Kremlin's cure could worse disease. It Russians something concerned about. Thursday Primakov convene meet top aides try hammer strategy overcome economic woes. A main item agenda plan draft Yuri Maslyukov, Communist government's senior policy maker economic issues. It take long Maslyukov's plan hit street. A newspaper, Kommersant Daily, publish full Thursday morning. not surprisingly Maslyukov's plan call great state role economy, include controls hard currency. A new State Bank Reconstruction Development would establish use nationalized assets fail commercial banks. Wages pensions would pay two months, minimum wage would index inflation. There would huge tax cuts, combination suggest government commit print additional money. The exchange rate ruble would set central bank, base changes inflation balance payments. Maslyukov's plan also imply Russians would able buy dollars exchanges country. It stipulate hard currency could enter country special authorization. Exporters would require sell hard currency reserves. That allusion currency control sent shock waves russian public. Russians come treat dollar second currency, many people squirreled away dollars hedge inflation. It obvious stupidity, Otto Latsis, commentator newspaper Noviye Izvestiya, said. People give dollars away. They go black market need to. Yegor Gaidar, former prime minister favors free markets, say plan war dollar predict would lead shortage imports. As criticism grew, Primakov rush distance talk currency controls. The rumors state's become monopolist inflow hard currency country nonsense, said, assert document publish Kommersant Daily one six possible plans. Primakov may oppose wildly unpopular currency controls. He may worry plan would would set panic buying dollars, depress ruble. Or may simply try keep distance Maslyukov's plan Russia try wrangle next disbursement, $4.3 billion, International Monetary Fund. The particulars could modified, many people follow maneuver say believe represent basic thrust government's thinking. Primakov call great state regulation expansion money supply, two themes Maslyukov's plan. The plan also many similarities plan presented government Gorbachev-era advisers. We think close final document, say United Financial Group, Russian investment business. It unclear long Primakov carry without spell detailed strategy. The oust tax chief, Boris Fyodorov, argue IMF provide aid Primakov take tough measures build free market. Primakov has, however, seek turn logic head, argue government's economic strategy depend fund's willingness provide aid. His aim appear to pressure fund imply fund's fault Russia force default loans take draconian measures home. Or Primakov put Thursday, without fund's money, Russia impose unpopular measures.

If Communist Party way plan months millions Russians take streets Wednesday big demonstrations years. But Communists politicians Communist stamp approval run country economy question marchers demonstrate against. President Boris Yeltsin economic advisers easy targets two months ago. But Yeltsin seem shadow today, advisers gone. The Communists, undergone sort resurgence playing discontent, work hard cast outsiders government help run keep focus protests Wednesday Yeltsin policies. even strategy may backfire, however, discontent Yeltsin necessarily translate support predecessors. An adviser Communist Party leader, Gennadi Zyuganov, make headlines long ago call new government bourgeois. The characterization striking, new prime minister, Yevgeny Primakov, one Zyuganov's top choices post. The deputy prime minister charge economy, Yuri Maslyukov, Communist Party figure head Gosplan, infamous central-planning program help bring Soviet Union ruin. We slogans aim government, first secretary Moscow Communist Party committee, Alexander Kuvayev, say recent interview. All slogans aim president economic course country. Only president fully blame course brought country situation. Anger Russia's fate, own, draw Russians back soviet-style slogans old-style hostility toward capitalism. The ardently pro-communist newspaper Sovietskaya Rossiya devote front page Thursday say results contest among readers protest slogans. The entries range catchy kitschy, from, Legislator, official, banker study Constitution; exam Oct. 7, to, Imperialist! Help Russia return export capital, pay debts once.

A deputy editor political analyst newsweekly, Itogi, Masha Lipman, say situation unlike 1993, Yeltsin sought, won, popular mandate referendum. He use dissolve Communist-dominated Parliament increase power. That lead autumn showdown, shell Parliament tanks total defeat, time being, Yeltsin's legislative opponents. You interpret demonstration Communist mandate, I think act like Yeltsin, Ms. Lipman said. Support Communists small level, maybe 20 percent. In survey 1,714 people release last week all-russian Public Opinion Center say nearly half population support idea demonstrations yeltsin, barely one-tenth likely participate way. Nobody interested sort struggle, Yuri Levada, heads center, say interview. This mainly general expression great wave distrust authorities, mainly president. He's great scapegoat sins.

The Communist Party Federation Independent Russian Unions, leftist organization say main sponsor protests, predict 9 million Russians participate Wednesday. The government vow keep order without resort force. But concerned enough summon 11,000 police officers patrol Moscow 6,000 military troops intervene violence erupts. Protests since 1993 generally tepid, deep-seated feeling here. Some demonstrations last week, less practice runs, hint similarly dampen marches year. President Boris Yeltsin would respond strongly effort prohibit Russians buy foreign currencies, believe move would like bring another Iron Curtain country, spokesman say Friday. The president clearly understands ban would clear violation rights ... would mean return Iron Curtain everyday life, say presidential spokesman Dmitry yakushin. The remarks come media reports government economic plan works would prohibit Russians buy U.S. dollars foreign currencies, institute strict economic controls, roll back seven years reforms. Though government officials say plan one six possibilities, Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov warn Thursday might force take unpopular measures rescue russian economy receive next installment dlrs 22.6 billion loan International Monetary Fund. Central Bank Chairman Viktor Gerashchenko Finance Minister Mikhail Zadornov fly Washington Friday negotiations IMF dlrs 4.3 billion installment. IMF officials say want russian government come sound economic program loan given, make clear currency controls boost money supply print rubles acceptable. But Primakov say country's plan would dependent IMF loan, way around. No short-term economic plan know another three weeks, long IMF set make decision, say First Deputy Prime Minister Vadim Gustov. A draft version government's fourth-quarter budget would rely heavily IMF loan, Kommersant newspaper said. Without loan, government would engage major deficit spending. Calls Soviet-style controls part plan draft First Deputy Prime Minister Yuri Maslyukov leak press apparently create rift within Cabinet. The plan draw heavy criticism Zadornov, Gerashchenko call idea ban foreign currency sales mad idea. Meanwhile, Russia's stock market drop 5 percent 38.8 Friday, trading light downward move mean little. The stock market continue fall since crisis hit Aug. 17. And tax collection September, result collapse Russia's banking system, say Alexander Pochinok, head government's finance credit department.

He say need regulate influx dollars russia, government take steps prevent call dollar drain. russian companies stash dlrs 2.5 billion outside country September alone, Interfax news agency report Friday, quote central bank figures. Primakov say foreign investors force help Russia minimize losses current economic crisis. We much interested foreign investments, especially ones go real production sector, Primakov said, accord Interfax.

Russia want IMF release second dlrs 4.3 billion installment loan approve July, month country's economy crashed government effectively default foreign loans. IMF officials say want russian government come sound economic program installment given, make clear currency controls boost money supply print rubles acceptable. In season crash banks, plunge rubles, bounce paychecks, fail cropsand rotate governments, maybe ultimate insult. But nation bore Tolstoy Chekhov, still regard well-written letter labor love, buckle little week, long wish good health Baba Anya Omsk. The Post Office broke. In 60 country's 89 statelike regions, 1,000 mail cars sidetracked, many stuff 18 tons letters, newspapers parcels. The state Railway Ministry refuse carry mail Post Office make good 210 million rubles old bills $13 million today's dollars, $35 million dollars six weeks ago. Air mail, amounts one every four five letters, also suspend one Moscow's major airports week, Post Office cough 5 million rubles old bills. A second airport still demand 3 million rubles past-due debts. so much mail back post offices Moscow elsewhere simply stop accept out-of-town mail, except areas easily reach truck. Delivery schedule fall weeks, perhaps months, behind. The situation really extraordinary, say Vladimir Sherekhov, deputy chief mail service administration government's Communications Committee. We've never anything like before. Maybe Post Office lucky. Extraordinary rule elsewhere Russia. Until Friday, low house Parliament prepare sue government failure provide soap, heat, toilet paper copy-machine paper legislature's monumental downtown offices. It turn politicians exhausted funds cut short recess return address nation's economic crisis. Earlier week, officials say Russia's Arctic shipping routes may close next month half nation's icebreakers disrepair money fix them. The old ships ancient nickname Granny. Such anecdotal evidence Russia lose wheels, like one old, ill-maintained Volga sedans, everywhere. But oddly, real signs public distress particularly common, perhaps system rarely seem shed part big postal system. If U.S. Postal Service increasingly pipeline sweepstakes notices bills, russian Post Office still hold special place national conversation. Russians still write letters other, frequently fervently, many remote regions get news mail. Millions use mail ship can goods provisions needy relatives friends faraway areas, especially vital service winter. And last years, Post Office become vehicle grow mail-order trade books, clothes catalog items readily available outside big cities. exactly rumble halt dispute. What clear Post Office Railway Ministry suffer ail every russian venture, private public alike: Nobody pay bills. The state Railway Ministry complain continually stiffed customers believe railroad honor-bound carry freight whether pay not. The government specify nearly 40 categories freight railroads must carry next nothing. Among big deadbeats power ministries military interior departments pay soviet times feel little need pay now. It's psychology form socialist period, say Tatiana Pashkova, deputy spokeswoman ministry, situation exist Post Office. We've dispute long time. Always try understand differences. But can't carry cargo free. No kidding, say Post Office: It, too, owe 200 million rubles government agencies, bar raise rates even though freight costs outstrip revenues. Moreover, Post Office also require government carry forms mail, pension checks, reduce rates. Officials state Communications Department say also suspect ulterior motive railroads' actions: struggle dominate thrive mail-order business. Here's competition us railroad delivery parcels, I think decisions make railroads mainly explain competition, Sherekhov said. They blame us carry commercial cargoes instead mail. The Railways Ministry's spokeswoman, Ms. Pashkova, say commercial cargoes indeed problem, railroads know Post Office already get cash transport packages. The railroads still wait share money, said. In meantime, situation come boil. In late September railroads cut mail service Moscow, effectively decapitate postal system force officials draft fleet trucks move letters city. Hundreds empty full rail cars clog local yards point move cars position unload become difficult. At last count, 39 loaded cars await service one yard. And customers get angry. We've gotten kinds complaints, say Viktor Salikov, deputy Communications Department's mail shipping center. People even come us, search mail send weeks ago.

It provide necessary electricity steer fledgling space station permanent control module launch next summer. Minutes Zarya's capture, Cabana call two antennas module still undeployed russian flight controllers feared. The antenna must fully deploy order Zarya's manual docking system work; system need next summer, officials said. The problem Zarya battery; astronauts take replacement part. The 36-foot, 25,000-pound Unity, first American-made component, serve connect passageway, vestibule, future modules. It crucial Zarya Unity joined; could connect robot arm, NASA would send two spacewalk astronauts manually fit together. In all, three spacewalks plan Endeavour's 12-day flight, hook electrical connections two modules install handrails tools future crews. The joined modules release Endeavour work completed. NASA estimate 43 launches 159 spacewalks need mission assemble entire orbit complex. once completed, 16-nation space station mass 1 million pounds, long football field, house seven astronauts cosmonauts. For second day row, astronauts board space shuttle Endeavour Friday liftoff NASA's first space station construction flight. Let's go this, say commander Robert Cabana. Amen, reply launch controller. Rain cloudy skies threat. But NASA confident master alarm Endeavour's cockpit would behave; go 4{ minutes go countdown Thursday, force delay. NASA five minutes less day launch Endeavour order meet first space station part, put orbit two weeks ago Russians. The shuttle contain second station component. The master alarm blare red lights flash shuttle lift early Thursday. By time controllers trace problem momentary drop hydraulic pressure decide press ahead, late miss cutoff second two. Sure, frustrating, say Bill Readdy, shuttle program director veteran shuttle commander. But things right. We things book, we're go cut corners even mean shave second two. The six astronauts crawl shuttle, two throw hands. Cabana hold thumb index finger half-inch apart: We close. The problem confine one Endeavour's three hydraulic pressure units. The pressure drop long enough trigger alarm, evidently sensitive switch, return normal. NASA engineers spend day examine problem, find nothing wrong systems confident would reoccur. Endeavour's flight already year late cash crunch Russia, one NASA's partners build international space station. The one-day delay cost NASA $600,000, mostly fuel overtime pay. Aboard Endeavour American-made connect passageway name Unity. The astronauts use shuttle robot arm capture russian space station piece attach Unity. Then, two spacewalkers hook electrical connections cables two cylinders, attach handrails tool future crews. Until alarm sounded, look though weather would problem. Rain clouds move Atlantic 1{ hours liftoff, drift away minutes spare. Secretary State Madeleine Albright dignitaries around world gather drizzle see Endeavour crew off. here 16 countries cooperate venture future, say Albright, expect back Friday's attempt. This good investment. The planet's dare construction job begin Friday shuttle Endeavour carry orbit six astronauts first u.s.-built part international space station expect cost $100 billion. After last-minute alarm shuttle force postponement early Thursday, launch go flawlessly 3:36 Friday morning, right schedule. The night sky clear, moon full. With roar, Endeavour make fiery ascent briefly turn Florida coastline night day. More five minutes 500 miles later, spaceship's main engines could still see distance, twinkle like new star. On 12-day flight, Endeavour's astronauts locate russian part already orbit, grasp shuttle's robot arm attach new U.S. module. Wielding tools hundreds miles Earth, work methodically cold void, astronauts start five-year assembly likely make construction Pyramids great cathedrals look like child's play. Construction station, research facility, require estimate 160 space walks, which, safety reasons, always do two people. When complete, international space station, dominate solar power arrays, cover area equal two football fields. Modules interconnect laboratories live quarters seven astronauts form habitat equal two 747 jetliners. The station's batteries alone, line up, would extend half-mile. The project entail high risk, technical difficulty put together unforgiving environment space, along dangers inherent fly space shuttle construction site. The work complicate international politics worries money. The Russians, whose participation partnership clinch post-cold War deal five years ago, wild card. Moscow's economic political woes leave western officials unsure ability willingness come share money technology. At time, station's costs rising, critics among scientists worry appetite money consume federal financing. The project's total cost subject debate, credible estimates put price assembly operation decade, station's estimate lifetime, $110 billion. Of that, american taxpayers spend roughly $96 billion, project's 15 foreign partners $14 billion. The station intend grand laboratory where, environment weightlessness, investigators develop new materials new drugs explore physiology's remain mysteries, part humans may someday know adapt long space flight worlds. Friday, case, little heard project praise. Great show, Endeavour, mission control Houston radio six astronauts shuttle go orbit. At Florida spaceport, Secretary State Madeleine Albright laud launch team new venture. That truly, truly fantastic, tell team liftoff. And important, added, many nations work together kinds issues 21st century go concerned with. So congratulations you, secretary said. Stupendous work. The main cargo Thursday Unity module, first u.s.-built station part. Small compare giants come three dozen shuttle flights assembly, unit 18 feet long, weighs 13 tons serve connect hub modules. Saturday, one astronauts, Lt. Col. Nancy Currie Army, shuttle's robot arm hoist Unity payload bay secure Endeavour's dock system, move unit horizontal vertical position. Then, Sunday, astronauts rendezvous module know Zarya, Sunrise, Russia launch orbit Kazakhstan Nov. 20. Financed United States build Russia, Zarya, 41 feet long, kind tugboat embryonic station, furnish power propulsion well communication rendezvous abilities. When Endeavour's payload bay within 10 feet Zarya, Colonel Currie reach robot arm pull russian module position Unity. The mechanical arm never move anything big. Zarya, completely weightless space, 21 tons mass. If mishandled, crush kill. As Col. Currie hold Zarya steady, Endeavour's commander, Col. Robert Cabana Marine Corps, veteran three space flights, nudge shuttle forward join two station pieces together. When mat special attachments, Zarya Unity form station's first element, 63 feet long 78 feet wide tips solar arrays. start Monday, pair space-walking astronauts hook electrical connections data cables units, attach antennas install tools handrails future visitors. The builders Col. Jerry Ross Air Force, 50, Dr. James Newman, 42, physicist. Their series three space walks continue Wednesday end Saturday, Dec. 12. As construction go outside, astronauts inside Endeavour busy make preparations enter new station connect tunnel dock system. Next Thursday, crew enter embryonic station first time, instal portable fans lights. Friday enter, prepare arrival 1999 next major element, first one built finance Russia. The astronauts Endeavour pilot, Maj. Frederick Sturckow Marine Corps, mission specialist, Sergei Krikalev russian Space Agency. After separate new outpost, crew bring Endeavour back Kennedy Space Center Dec. 15, mission length shy 12 days. Gretchen McClain, NASA's director Washington international space station, say interview overall costs actually small individual Americans. Over lifetime, said, annual cost equal pizza soft drink nation's 96 million taxpayers. U.S. costs construction, added, $24 billion, operations year 2012 $10.4 billion, total $34.4 billion. most experts outside agency consider figure ridiculously low ignores many billions dollars spend early development work well cost numerous shuttle flights, run $800 million apiece. Following series intricate maneuvers skillful use space shuttle Endeavour's robot arm, astronauts Sunday join first two many segments form international space station. The shuttle crew six snare Russian-made Zarya control module chase around Earth ever-closing orbits throughout day. Less hour rendezvous 240 miles earth shortly 6 p.m., Lt. Col. Nancy Currie Army deftly use 50-foot arm grab 40,000-pound cylinder craft pass Russia slowly pull toward shuttle. see Zarya close, Col. Robert Cabana Marines, shuttle commander, confirm two antennas fail deploy module follow launch Kazakhstan Nov. 20. There early indications antennas, use later station manually assist spacecraft dockings, extended. Currie take almost two hours painstakingly move Zarya American-made Unity dock port position Endeavour's cargo bay. When two pieces align within inches one another, Cabana fire small thruster rockets raise shuttle, allow modules clamp together. The two station pieces, together measure 77 feet end end combine mass 70,000 pounds, first 100 major components united space next five years form orbit outpost would weigh almost million pounds span area size two football fields. more 40 additional missions U.S. shuttle russian rockets use haul components supplies orbit, astronauts nations spend almost 1,800 hours spacewalks assemble entire structure. The spece station expect cost partnership 16 nations $40 billion construct. Bringing piece together first step mat them. A pair astronauts make three spacewalks week, first Monday, hook electrical communications cables, remove covers, attach handrails perform tasks get modules work one unit. The difficult part Sunday's mating $240 million Zarya $300 million Unity bring together shuttle caught Russian unit. Currie use Canadian-built robot arm place Zarya top unity without able see pieces joined. Unity, raise Endeavour's cargo bay Saturday, large block Currie's view mating fixtures shuttle's windows. She use views remote cameras computerize vision system build arm estimate relative positions two large segments. The computerized system examine markings modules, compute relationship one another use marks display results laptop computer. We've never do anything like before, Currie say flight, add practiced difficult maneuver 100 times last two years. The flight Endeavour, take Cape Canaveral, Fla., last Friday, go accord plan early Sunday, mission control order shuttle change orbit slightly avoid piece space debris. Air Force space debris trackers note shuttle pas within 1.6 miles spent stage american booster rocket launch last month. Although consider safe distance, shuttle controllers decide widen separation five miles extra precaution. Endeavour astronauts close Sunday capture first piece international space station, Russian-made Zarya control module connect Unity chamber aboard shuttle. stack two giant cylinders 240 miles earth consider difficult part mission. The job fell Nancy Currie, shuttle crane operator deftly hoist repositioned Unity cargo bay Saturday. The two station pieces big 77 feet tip one tip combine mass 70,000 pounds Currie crewmates go rely computerize vision system camera views, rather direct line sight. such blind dock never attempt before. Mission Control give astronauts plenty time tasks. The main thing I've try last two years work flight make sure time. We margin everything, say flight director Bob Castle. Before begin final approach Zarya Russian Sunrise shuttle's six astronauts steer clear chunk rocket launch last month California. Mission Control order pilots fire shuttle thrusters put extra three miles endeavour space junk, put Endeavour total five miles orbit debris. The small gap would probably little close comfort, Mission Control said. The big worry, far, Endeavour's pursuit capture Zarya, couple Unity. The shuttle's 50-foot robot arm never assign handle object massive 44,000-pound Zarya, power propulsion module launch Kazakhstan Nov. 20. It provide necessary electricity steer fledgling space station permanent control module launch next summer. The 36-foot, 25,000-pound Unity serve connect passageway, vestibule, future modules. In case Zarya Unity could connect robot arm, two spacewalking astronauts would manually fit together. The astronauts would go anyway Monday attach electrical connectors cable two components. In all, three spacewalks plan Endeavour's 12-day flight. NASA estimate 43 launches 159 spacewalks need mission assemble entire orbit complex. once completed, 16-nation space station mass 1 million pounds, long football field, house seven astronauts cosmonauts. Endeavour's astronauts connect first two building blocks international space station Sunday, create seven-story tower shuttle cargo bay. It first time russian-built Zarya control module made-in-america Unity chamber ever touched. It look perfect and, hopefully, long-lasting fit. We capture zarya, commander Robert Cabana announce moment two pieces come together. Congratulations crew good ship Endeavour, reply Mission Control. That's terrific. The 240-mile-high construction job begin two hours earlier Nancy Currie's capture Zarya (russian Sunrise) use shuttle robot arm. We're halfway home, Cabana said. then come hard part: stack two giant cylinders cargo bay. The two station pieces big 77 feet tip one tip combine mass 70,000 pounds Currie crewmates rely computerize vision system camera views, rather direct line sight. This first time blind dock ever attempted. Currie position solar-winged Zarya, still end shuttle robot arm, several inches directly Unity. It slow going; want need perfect alignment. Once sure it, Cabana fire Endeavour's thrusters, brief burst raise shuttle thereby Unity enough dock mechanisms two station components snap together. The historical moment occur South Pacific. It take several tries, however, Zarya Unity pull tightly together. The dock ring would retract properly; Mission Control quickly trace problem attach robot arm ask crew release hold dock Zarya. That trick. The union intend last station's 15-year lifetime set stage spacewalk two astronauts Monday attach electrical connectors cable two components. Mission Control think Sunday's work might take hours longer plan give six astronauts plenty time tasks. But everything occur less suppose to, aside piece space junk stray close. Before begin final approach Zarya, six astronauts steer clear chunk rocket launch last month California. Mission Control order pilots fire shuttle thrusters put extra three miles endeavour space junk, put Endeavour total five miles orbit debris. The small gap would probably little close comfort, Mission Control said. The big worry, far, Endeavour's pursuit capture Zarya, couple Unity.

Minutes Zarya's capture, Cabana call two antennas module still undeployed russian flight controllers feared. The antenna must fully deploy order Zarya's manual docking system work; system need next summer, officials said. The problem Zarya battery; astronauts take replacement part. The 36-foot, 25,000-pound Unity, first American-made component, serve connect passageway, vestibule, future modules. It crucial Zarya Unity joined; could connect robot arm, NASA would send two spacewalk astronauts manually fit together. In all, three spacewalks plan Endeavour's 12-day flight, hook electrical connections two modules install handrails tools future crews. The joined modules release Endeavour work completed. NASA estimate 43 launches 159 spacewalks need mission assemble entire orbit complex. once completed, 16-nation space station mass 1 million pounds, long football field, house seven astronauts cosmonauts. A last-minute alarm force NASA halt Thursday's launch space shuttle Endeavour, mission start assemble international space station. Another attempt Endeavour crew six astronauts schedule Friday 3:36 a.m. This first time three years, 19 flights, shuttle countdown stop spaceship fuel crew aboard craft ready go. The uncommon delay prompt frowns furrow brows here, although officials stress entirely warranted. We want err conservative side, Ralph Roe, launch director Kennedy Space Center, say news conference sudden halt countdown 19 seconds liftoff. Everything go smoothly rare nighttime launching, set 3:58 Thursday morning. The weather, forecast iffy, turn fine, sky alight nearly full moon. But length so-called launching window was, planned, unusually short 10 minutes. That brevity result Endeavour's rendezvous space-station part Russia put orbit last month. The show-stopper arose four minutes liftoff computer space shuttle set master alarm. Controllers study data discover momentary pressure drop one hydraulic systems control movements shuttle's engines rudder flight surfaces. Officials eventually decide pressure drop insignificant, resolve press ahead. But late: time run one procedures need keep shuttle's fuel supercold. So countdown abort 19 seconds blastoff. The six astronauts begin emerge shuttle hour later ultimately head bed rest another attempt early Friday. ","On Friday the shuttle Endeavor carried six astronauts into orbit to start building an international space station.The launch occurred after Russia and U.S. officials agreed not to delay the flight in order to orbit closer to MIR, and after a last-minute alarm forced a postponement.On Sunday astronauts joining the Russian-made Zarya control module cylinder with the American-made module to form a 70,000 pounds mass 77 feet long.NASA estimates 43 more launches and 159 more space walks are needed to assemble the complex.When completed the 16-nation space station will be longer than a football field.It will be used to study adaptation to space flight.","Russia and NASA jointly decided against a Russian cost-cutting proposal to orbit the 2nd space station, a 16-country cooperative project, closer to Mir, citing complexity, risk, and bad sun angles.After 5 years of assembly, the research station will house 7 people.A 12-day shuttle mission will attach the US Unity module to the Russian Zarya, already in orbit.Thursday's launch was delayed by a pressure drop.A 2nd attempt Friday was perfect.Unity was attached to Zarya in a blind docking using cameras and computer images.Electrical and cable connections come next.Unity will serve as a passageway for future modules.Two Zarya antennas failed to deploy.","After discarding a suggested change of orbit, the Russian Space Agency went ahead with plans to launch its Zarya module of the international space station on Nov. 20, 1998.Although delayed for a day, U.S. plans to launch the space shuttle Endeavour carrying the U.S. module Unity and six astronauts were carried out on Dec. 4.The astronauts' job was to connect Unity with the already-orbiting Zarya as the first step in assembling 100 major components of the planned space station.Using the shuttle's 50-foot robot arm, the two modules were joined setting the stage for a spacewalk by two astronauts the next day to attach electrical connectors and cables.","The International Space Station when completed will have a million pound mass and be longer than a football field.It will house up to seven space explorers.The initial assembly of space station components involves linking the US Unity, carried into space by the shuttle Endeavour, with the Russian Zarya.The Russians had asked for a different launch profile in order to be able to transfer equipment from its MIR station, but that was not possible.Endeavour astronauts successfully completed the complicated maneuvers to join the two space objects.NASA estimates that 43 more launches will be required to completely assemble the 16-nation space station."

However, interest rate levels become contentious political issue center-left governments Germany France push rate cuts help spur growth combat unemployment, stick 10.9 percent nations adopt euro. The head european Central Bank set monetary policy euro nations, Wim Duisenberg, Thursday suggest governments reform rigid labor markets create jobs, pressure cut rates. The remarks Brussels cuts make give hint rate drop imminent, make clear resistance political pressure strong ever. so strong, fact, Dutch Finance Minister Gerrit Zalm say feared bank would delay decision. What fear that, order prove independence, ECB would go analysis would wait longer, would nonsensical, Zalm said. Hans Tietmeyer, run german Bundesbank ECB modeled, hint rate cut design boost confidence new currency, dampen global economic crises Europe's worsen outlook. The coordinate rate cut could lead reduction current pessimism reduction financial market turbulence, Tietmeyer said. The cuts seem desired impact. Frankfurt's main index close 2.1 percent, France's 1.8 percent. The cuts also boost markets Spain, Belgium, Italy even Britain, among nations launch euro. The reaction is, `Oh good, they're little bit prop euro economy.' But confidence take quite hit across Europe recently, I think action ECB need next year, maybe 2.5 percent, James Mitchell, senior london-based strategist Nomura. An economist Banque Bruxelles Lambert, Liesbeth Van de Craen, say cuts timely. We clearly head slowdown, said. Until recently, Europe's economies hold relatively well damage Asia Russia's economic crises unstable financial markets.

I also happy country. Later tell news conference: The portuguese language wait 100 years this. There ways mean protecting language become museum, something alive. The writer's role protect work it. The award also celebrate Lisbon, President Jorge Sampaio describe recognition Portuguese culture, local Communist leader, Carlos Carvalho, saw credit party. As member party, note solemnly, Saramago make great contribution ideals struggle social change. The laureate's fiction, though, never overtly political. Saramago, whose body work include poetry, essays, play journal well 10 novels, unusual emerge major literary figure age 60. His novels since translate 30 languages, sell particularly well Portugal, Brazil, Spain, Italy Germany. While well know United States, novels always critically well receive there. For late blooming, though, Saramago long dream become writer. Born family rural laborers raise Lisbon, force poverty leave school teen-ager learn trade car mechanic. yet manage publish small novel age 25. Later, find work Lisbon publishing company, oppressive censorial atmosphere Salazar dictatorship discourage writing. It Portugal's April 1974 revolution Saramago felt free find voice. A member Portuguese Communist Party since 1969, serve editor Lisbon newspaper, Diario de Noticias, 18-month period leave looked likely seize power Portugal. But anti-communist backlash November 1975 force newspaper begin translate french text Portuguese make ends meet. In late 1970s, also turn novels, publishing three succession 1977, 1978 1980. But 1982, Baltasar Blimunda (Memorial Convento Portuguese), achieve international breakthrough. This rich, multifaceted polysemous text time historical, social individual perspective, Swedish Academy note Thursday.

When novel publish United States 1987, Irving Howe acclaim brilliant The New York Times Book Review. Mr. Saramago constantly present voice European skepticism, connoisseur ironies, Howe wrote. I think I hear prose echoes Enlightenment sensibility, caustic shrewd. In next novel, The Year Death Ricardo Reis, also homage great portuguese poet Fernando Pessoa, appear ghost, Saramago sets story early years Salazar dictatorship, tale follow romantic sexual misadventures poet-physician. write The New York Times, Herbert Mitgang call rare, old-fashioned novel lyrical, symbolic meditative. Saramago, whose sense literary freedom evident unconventional punctuation conflict use tenses, seek different form freedom The Stone Raft, imagine confusion unleashed Iberian peninsula suddenly break free rest Europe begin drift toward New World threaten collide Azores. To delight Britons, Gibraltar leave behind. Unsurprisingly, bitter satire, The Gospel accord Jesus Christ, prove controversial, God show use innocently human Jesus create religion spawn violence intolerance. When Lisbon jury pick book Portugal's entry 1992 european literary prize, country's conservative government veto choice blasphemous.

The announcement significant phase discoveries two Monday's winners meeting 1986 elicit avalanche research activities many different laboratories around world, say Nobel committee Karolinska Institute Stockholm, make awards. Its citation say research lead new treatments treat heart lung diseases, shock impotence. Ignarro discover principle lead use Viagra anti-impotency drug, say Dr. Sten Orrenius, professor toxicology Karolinska Institute. Nitric oxide start process blood vessels penis widen produce erection. Nitric oxide, chemical relative anesthetic gas nitrous oxide, good know common air pollutant form nitrogen burns, automobile exhaust fumes. But scientists know distribute widely body. The discoveries honor Monday make largely 1980s time scientists know bacteria produce nitric oxide think important animals humans. The award committee say first discovery gas act signal molecule organism. The discovery startle nitric oxide totally different know signal molecule unstable convert nitrate nitrite within 10 seconds. Recipients Nobel Prize, include lobby for years, often profess surprise learn award. This year's winners refreshingly candid. Furchgott say planned sleep late Monday, holiday, awaken 5:30 home Hewlett, N.Y. He say knew previous Nobel prize winners nominate award, still somewhat surprised receive it. I guess I good friends voting, Furchgott said. He say could get back sleep. Murad say ponder odds think maybe I could win prize, maybe couple years. He describe award culmination career say happens, incredible. Ignarro travel Italy. Dr. Gerald Levey, dean UCLA, say actually anticipate day four years now. The three 1998 winners never work together, talk lot shop talk meetings, Furchgott said. Dr. Valentin Fuster, president American Heart Association head cardiology Mt. Sinai Hospital Manhattan, say discovery nitric oxide function one important history cardiovascular medicine. Doctors learn prize-winning research heart disease, endothelium, inner line arteries, make less nitric oxide. Drugs like nitroglycerine, however, help replenish stores nitric oxide. Now, drug companies try develop powerful heart drugs base new knowledge nitric oxide's role signal molecule. Researchers also learn nitric oxide produce endothelium rapidly spread cell membranes underlie muscle cells arteries. then shut muscle contractions arteries, thus widen reduce blood pressure. Inhalation nitric oxide gas save lives people certain lung diseases, particularly infants develop dangerously high pulmonary blood pressure. But regulate amount nitric oxygen inhale critical much lethal. Nitric oxide play harmful role collapse circulatory system, shock, result overwhelming microbial infections. Bacteria release products cause white blood cells release enormous amounts nitric oxide. As result, blood pressure drops. scientists try develop drugs block production nitric oxide infections. White blood cells also play role attack cancerous cells. The gas also induce type program cell death know apoptosis. Scientists study nitric oxide's effects immune system stop growth cancers. They also explore nitric oxide's possible role regulate body temperature. Doctors measure production nitric oxide lungs intestines diagnose number ailments, include asthma colitis, study role menstruation. Nitric oxide form nerve cells spreads rapidly directions activate cells vicinity influence many functions, like behavior mobility intestinal tract. Nitric oxide also study role smell memory. Nitric oxide's role still unfolding; scientists write thousands scientific papers recent years start journal, Nitric Oxide. The Nobel committee cite Furchgott perform 1980 ingenious experiment show drug, acetylcholine, widen blood vessels inner layer, endothelium, intact. Furchgott conclude blood vessels widen endothelial cells produce signal molecule call EDRF, endothelium-derived relaxing factor, relaxes smooth muscle cells blood vessels. Furchgott's findings lead quest identify factor, citation said. (optional TRIM CAN BEGIN HERE) The citation refer accident Furchgott's laboratory play major role discoveries. In 1995, Annual Review Pharmacology Toxicology, Furchgott write May 5, 1978, first series plan experiments arteries rabbit, technician follow directions correctly. The technician perform one step experiment instead suppose wash drug use earlier phase experiment. Furchgott expect arteries would contract. Instead, relaxed. It first time see drugs study produce reaction, use insight plan additional experiments. Furchgott omit technician's name paper another 1996 Journal American Medical Association. On Monday, say David Davidson technician. (OPTIONAL TRIM ENDS HERE) The committee cite Ignarro conclude 1986, brilliant series analyses conduct independently Furchgott, EDRF identical nitric oxide. Furchgott say Ignarro make announcement symposium 1986 Mayo Clinic Rochester, Minn., papers publish 1998. Murad cite work conduct years work University Virginia Charlottesville, Stanford University Palo Alto, Calif., Abbott Laboratories Illinois. Murad say felt fortunate heard Furchgott report early work EDRF 1980. Murad show gas could regulate important cellular functions study nitroglycerin related heart drugs lead release nitric oxide.

Murad's trainees refer early work dump experiments could laboratory time crudely add various hormones agents slices tissue, cell cultures. It take years develop refine techniques lead understand nitric oxide's many roles body. But many years, scientific community skeptical ability free radical like nitric oxide activate enzyme, Murad say 1996 Furchgott share Albert Lasker basic medical research award.

He still bear burden role massacre hundreds Palestinians christian militiamen Lebanon 1982. An Israeli inquiry find indirectly responsible killings Sabra Shatila refugee camps. As leader conservative wing Likud party, Sharon help Netanyahu hold together shaky Cabinet potentially decisive negotiations Yasser Arafat, Palestinian leader. That fine Sharon willing play constructive role peace talks himself. But behavior likely first impulse man famously say would never shake hands Arafat. Since Netanyahu designate Sharon chief negotiator, new foreign minister soon opportunity act responsibly. The first order business two sides get together next week outside Washington wrap negotiations withdrawal israeli forces West Bank couple security guarantees Palestinians. Sharon show statesmanship help Netanyahu close deal, even though oppose israeli settlers whose cause Sharon long championed. Success talks would clear way last difficult negotiations permanent settlement, include shape status Palestinian state future Jerusalem.

45,"Whether talks Exxon Mobil lead merger business combination, America's economic history already rewritten. In energy businesses like financial services, telecommunications automobiles, global competition technology make unthinkable combinations practical, even necessary. oil companies like Exxon Corp. Mobil Corp. additional pressure, one unthinkable less two decades ago. Crude oil prices fall sharply, plunge 40 percent year levels, adjust inflation, see since first oil embargo 25 years ago. As such, oil companies, spent years cut costs, desperate savings order continue operate profitably low prices. Exxon Mobil two largest, strong competitors emerge nation's famous antitrust case, 1911 breakup John D. Rockefeller's Standard Oil Trust. now face Royal Dutch/Shell Group large either them. They also confront British Petroleum PLC make far potent United States agreement summer buy Amoco Corp. $48.2 billion. Industry executives say deals scale inevitable. Executives companies return calls Thursday comment talks, unclear Thursday night outcome might be. But Exxon Mobil agree become one, antitrust regulators likely cautious put back together much long ago break apart. even so, oil industry analysts contend improved efficiency combine giant energy companies would lower costs concentrated ownership gas stations refineries would raise them. The ultimate beneficiary consumer, say Daniel Yergin, chairman Cambridge Energy Research Associates. If Exxon Mobil ultimately combine, costs could prove heavy energy industry employees. Analysts say 80,000 global employees Exxon, base Irving, Texas, 40,000 Mobil, Fairfax, Va., thousands would likely lose jobs. Exxon, Lee R. Raymond, Mobil, Lucio a. Noto, chief executives preoccupy humble accommodations low oil prices make necessary. Oil companies everybody's favorite targets trust-busting era early century Arab oil embargo 1970s. now seem especially vulnerable demand weaken much world, especially economically troubled Asia, weigh already depress prices. They're pitiful, helpless giants, say Ronald Chernow, author Titan, biography John D. Rockefeller, Standard Oil's founder. As such, giants compel continue cut costs spread risks huge, expensive international projects need develop oil reserves need next century. Mobil, $58.4 billion sales last year, might seem large enough undertake anything. But compete rights develop huge natural gas fields Turkmenistan, former Soviet republic, Mobil unable match Shell's offer build pipeline $1 billion more. Oil companies decide cannot count rebound oil prices revive fortunes time soon. Earlier month, Energy Department predict collapse asian demand would continue depress oil prices nearly decade, much $5.50 barrel year 2000. And Thursday, Organization Petroleum Exporting Countries put March decision extend oil production cutbacks prop prices. Moreover, improve technology exploration production open new regions development add already huge supply oil hand now. In response, many energy companies already begin new wave cutbacks staffs operations. To reduce costs, companies like Mobil form partnerships stop short full mergers. Two years ago, Mobil agree combine european refining marketing operations british Petroleum's, result annual savings $500 million. Shell Texaco form refine partnership United States. In face partnerships, say Amy Jaffe, energy analysts James a. Baker III Institute Public Policy Houston, Exxon, compete? Though Mobil Exxon might high concentrations gas stations certain areas United States, analysts say far competition pump oil prices collapse 1980s. Thousands convenience stores also sell gasoline produce variety refine companies, foreign national oil companies, like Venezuela's, sell supplies acquire companies like Citgo. Under Noto, Mobil hunt ways become large lean enough survive. He take lead deal British Petroleum consider buy small companies. And make clear corporate personal pride would never block deal. In european agreement British Petroleum, Mobil's red fly horses come fronts many gas stations, green yellow BP logo go up. As major oil companies team up, say John Hervey, analyst Donaldson Lufkin &AMP; Jenrette, If price right, egos get way. In past, Mobil reportedly talk british Petroleum combinations, well talks amoco form American refining venture. The company also interested Conoco Inc. DuPont Co. begin look divest oil gas business. But deals reached. more recently, speculation Wall Street Mobil talk Chevron Corp. British Petroleum purchase Amoco put pressure Noto seek deal, Hervey said. I think whole thing would start British Petroleum pull trigger, said. The british Petroleum-Amoco deal, progress quickly since August announcement towards expect $2 billion annual savings, put even companies large Exxon spot. There, Raymond far concentrate make operations efficient find allies. Though Royal Dutch/Shell's financial resources great exxon's, analysts say Exxon still size soundness absorb company Mobil's size. only large oil companies afford take advantage today's best opportunities. find new fields deep waters coast West Africa Gulf Mexico require platforms cost $1 billion more. produce oil states former Soviet Union take time money many investors anticipated. In September, Noto among american executives invite Saudi leader visit Washington greatly step investments country, too. Noto spent 1977 1985 Saudi Arabia himself, building Mobil operations include huge refinery. But new partnerships Saudis might require Mobil's connections Exxon's capital. Back Standard Oil organize operations state, Exxon Standard Oil New Jersey, Mobil Standard Oil New York. even Standard Oil monopoly broken up, remain several years build Manhattan. Chernow, Rockefeller biographer, note two pieces Standard Oil trust already likely united. British Petroleum buy Standard Oil Ohio 1970s, Amoco Standard Oil Indiana. The break-up Standard Oil result competition often cite precedent current antitrust action Microsoft. Chernow see reason allow Exxon acquisition Mobil go suggest leniency Microsoft. Exxon would obviously large lead competitors, way Microsoft is, said. In energy business today, added, large dinosaurs stalk particular jungle. The boards Exxon Corp. Mobil Corp. expect meet Tuesday consider possible merger agreement would form world's large oil company, source close negotiations say Friday. The source, spoke condition anonymity, say prospects good complete agreement. Exxon Mobil confirm Friday discuss ways combine. They cautioned, however, agreement reach assurance would reach one. The statement send stock companies surging, suggest investors believe companies combine. Shares Exxon, big U.S. oil company, rise $1.6875, 2.3 percent, $74.375. Shares Mobil, No. 2 U.S. oil company, rise $7.625, 9.7 percent, $86. Some analysts say two giants reach agreement, likely form takeover Exxon Mobil. Exxon far large financially stronger. Analysts predict would huge cuts duplicate staff companies, employ 122,700 people. Adam Sieminski, oil analyst BT Alex. Brown, say companies would probably make cuts save $3 billion $5 billion year. Sieminski analysts say Exxon would offer premium 15 20 percent price prior Monday, serious speculation Exxon takeover Mobil first circulate sent Mobil shares sharply. They say transaction would probably exchange Mobil shares Exxon shares. base Mobil's $75.25 share price week ago, takeover company would worth $70 billion. The merger discussions come backdrop particularly severe pressure Lucio Noto, chairman, president chief executive Mobil, find new reserves oil natural gas keep big projects profitable time deep decline crude oil prices. This one intelligent chief executives business man considerable ability inherit serious structural problems company, say J. Robin West, chairman Petroleum Finance Co., consult group energy industry base Washington. He say Mobil's prime assets include Arun natural gas field Indonesia, one large world, contribute one-third Mobil's profits years begin run down. The field, production since 1977, supplies liquefy natural gas Japan Korea. Although Mobil Noto move quickly cut costs muscle way promise new areas Kazakhstan, partner joint venture develop huge Tengiz oil field, payoff ventures many years away. other companies face similar strains. The challenge replace crown jewels grow increasingly competitive environment, West said. Noto shy sit companies British Petroleum Amoco year see combination make sense. Although Exxon chairman Lee Raymond heads much strong big company Mobil, immune strains global petroleum business. Those strains intensify year Russia's economic collapse raise risks Exxon's extensive exploration venture country. Exxon also follower leader huge projects deep offshore fields, major finds make near West Africa Gulf Mexico. News Exxon Mobil, two giants energy patch, merger talks last week big sign yet corporate marriages back vogue. even combination come light, deal-making fast furious. On Monday alone, $40.4 billion corporate acquisitions either announce declare imminent. Driving resurgence mergers roar stock market, recognition major corporations get hard increase revenues internally grow confidence among market players economy plunge recession next year. There also industry-specific issues, like low crude-oil prices drive oil giants one another's arms. But investors, mega-marriages real money made. Rather, among small companies, whose still-depressed stock prices lure big acquirers stocks near peaks. If Exxon buy Mobil close current prices, deals month total value $140 billion April's peak $244 billion three times volume September, stock market falling. Which industries likely witness mergers? Tom Burnett, director Merger Insight, institutional investment advisory firm New York, say deals certainty energy, suffer low crude-oil prices. Burnett also say health care executives find tougher ever lift earnings. But small companies may better way play takeover game. Charles LaLoggia, editor Special Situation Investor newsletter Potomac, Md., said: Some premiums high-profile mergers great anymore. The values small-cap stocks. Another reason deals involve smaller-cap candidates less likely incur wrath antitrust regulators. LaLoggia reckons odds pick takeover winners increase investor focuses companies already partially own another. In energy sector, Houston Exploration qualifies, says; oil gas driller 66 percent own Keyspan Energy. He also believe deals imminent among drug chains supermarkets. Longs Drug Stores Drug Emporium, says, remain acquisition candidates, though neither control another concern. In supermarkets, LaLoggia like Great Atlantic &AMP; Pacific Tea Co., 55 percent own Tengelmann Group Germany. Another pick Smart Final, operator warehouse-style stores 55 percent own U.S. subsidiary Groupe Casino, France's large supermarket chain. Both A&AMP;P Smart Final trading book value, LaLoggia said. Takeovers typically occur book value. Finally, recommend National Presto Industries, maker housewares electrical appliances, trading near $39, close low year. The company $30 share cash balance sheet, debt dividend yield 5 percent. After last month's announce acquisition Rubbermaid Newell Co., LaLoggia think National Presto could find acquirer's cross-hairs. It new highs Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock Nasdaq composite indexes Friday anticipation new wave mergers general rush investors join equity rebound push stocks up.

Internet computer stocks also rallied, help part announcement Tuesday America Online's purchase Netscape Communications three-way deal involve Sun Microsystems.

In bond market, also close early Thanksgiving weekend, price 30-year Treasury bond rise 11/32, 101 12/32. The bond's yield, move opposite direction price, fell 5.16 percent 5.18 percent Wednesday. Long-term short-term yields slip low week despite new economic data indicate economy strong third quarter expect seem move along good pace current quarter. This small recovery face strong growth probably new inflation numbers show prices check analysts still forecast economy begin slow next year. many analysts note eight-week stock market rally, Nasdaq composite index jump 42 percent, investors buy even though major financial problems around world include slump Asia, weaken Latin America trouble Russia resolved. Johnson say think investors, inspired Federal Reserve's three interest rate cuts two months new stimulus package Japan, assume problems solved. Investors look valley like see, said. But worries financial crisis, begin Thailand July 1997 intensify effective default Russia August, go away quickly. It seem every financial crisis, everybody get impression storm passed, Johnson said. But never easy. Exxon Corp. Mobil Corp. hold discussions combine business operations, person involve talks say Wednesday. It unclear Wednesday whether talks continuing. If companies merge, would create large U.S. company terms revenue. A possible merger report separately The Financial Times London Bloomberg News. The reported talks Exxon, whose annual revenue exceed Wal-Mart General Electric, Mobil, no. 2 U.S. oil company, come oil prices sunk low almost 12 years. A combine company would big Royal Dutch/Shell Group, world's large oil company revenue. Financial terms discussions could determine Wednesday. Neither Exxon Mobil would comment. Any union would reunite two parts John D. Rockefeller's Standard Oil Trust, break Supreme Court 1911. Exxon know Standard Oil New Jersey, Mobil consist two companies: Standard Oil New York Vacuum Oil. Both Exxon, market value $176.7 billion, Mobil, market value $61.1 billion, history fiercely independence. Both already cut back staff make lean order survive long periods oil prices low. But particularly unsettling year oil industry, little prospect crude oil prices recover soon. Consequently, chief executives oil companies swallow pride look suitable partners. This summer, British Petroleum announce $48.2 billion agreement buy Amoco Corp., create world's third-largest oil company prompt analysts predict even widespread consolidation. It show megamergers doable, say Adam Sieminski, analyst BT Alex. Brown. He added, however, combination Exxon Mobil would easy match Mobil know proud company say past would want merge. Exxon, added, well run company like grow businesses. He add heads companies, Lee Raymond, chairman Exxon, base Irving, Texas, Lucio Noto, chairman, president chief executive Mobil, base Fairfax, Va., different personalities. It easy, say combine two far-flung companies, vast networks refineries gas stations overlap United States Europe. If offer enough money make anything happen, added. Both companies pressure find new fields oil help survive long term. Like oil companies, hop quickly tap vast reserves Russia. even though prepared spend billions, hold back political economic crisis Russia great reluctance russian officials oil companies give control vast fields. Thus fall back exploration areas deep waters Gulf Mexico West Africa. such exploration expensive, even large fields find often take platforms cost $1 billion bring oil production. oil prices pressure year, fall 40 percent $20-a-barrel level grow inventories petroleum decline asian demand cause economic crisis there. On Wednesday, crude oil January delivery fell 29 cents, 2.6 percent, $11.86 barrel New York Mercantile Exchange, close 12-year low $11.42 reach June 15. Members Organization Petroleum Exporting Countries oil-producing nations, notably Mexico, try stem price drops pledge cut back production. But pledges always honored, rallies oil market year proven short-lived. OPEC members Wednesday continue discussion extend production cutbacks, agreement expect early Thursday. In spring, OPEC agree reduce production 2.6 million barrels day, 3 percent daily world supply 74 million barrels. The main result agreement appear keep oil prices fall $10 barrel. Washington regulators say Wednesday notify Exxon-Mobil discussions. The Federal Trade Commission still review british Petroleum's pending purchase Amoco. An exxon-mobil deal would certain receive several months' worth scrutiny commission, would review much industry merger would control. Analysts investment bankers split logic possible merger. Some point difficulties companies could face combined. If ask Exxon need bigger, answer probably no, say Garfield Miller, president Aegis Energy Advisors Corp., small independent investment bank base New York. It hard say anything particular gain. In particular, Miller said, two companies enormous similarities domestic refining marketing businesses. They really overlap quite bit, said. You really wonder benefit redundancy. Another investment banker energy business, speak condition anonymity, also question rationale discuss merger. When look BP-Amoco deal, rationalize it, banker said. But none reasons apply exxon-mobil deal. But Amy Jaffe, energy research analyst James A. Baker III Institute Public Policy, say combination two companies would logical, part would give great influence bidding projects Middle Eastern countries. This deal make sense, Ms. Jaffe said. With combined company, project would big. In addition, Ms. Jaffe said, merger would provide company new oil gas assets areas world little influence. There lot complimentary assets redundant, said. She say Exxon, example, strong presence Angola, Mobil not. And Mobil significant assets caspian Sea Nigeria, Exxon weak. Exxon Mobil, nation's two large oil companies, confirm Friday discuss possible merger, antitrust lawyers, industry analysts government officials predict deal would require sale important large pieces new corporate behemoth. Those divestitures would reshape industry already undergoing broad transformation low price oil. But mergers corporate combinations also begin create new regulatory climate among antitrust officials, one may prove particularly challenge Exxon Mobil. Although companies confirm discuss possibility merger, person close discussions say boards Exxon Mobil expect meet Tuesday consider agreement. Shares surge New York Stock Exchange. Oil exploration drilling interests would necessarily present antitrust problems Exxon-Mobil merger competition areas brisk. But retail marketing operations, exxon-mobil combination would like Ford merge General Motors, Macy's Gimbels, say Stephen Axinn, antitrust lawyer New York represent Texaco acquisition Getty decade ago. In United States, deal would come purview Federal Trade Commission, Clinton administration examine large corporate mergers vigor see since 1970s. The agency block number propose mergers, $4 billion combination Staples Office Depot, two large office supply discounters, two deals involve four large drug wholesalers. On hand approve big mergers, Boeing's $14 billion acquisition McDonnell Douglas. The agency's analysis Exxon-Mobil combination, senior official say Friday, turn might resemble John D. Rockefeller's Standard Oil trust dismantle Supreme Court 1911. The big antitrust issue whether, merger alliance, able get competition one another backs, particularly background BP-Amoco Shell-Texaco, say Eleanor M. Fox, professor New York University School Law antitrust expert. It may look consolidation world level look like consolidation national level 100 years ago. The Federal Trade Commission recently approve significant joint venture Shell Texaco venture agree sell refinery divest retailing operations Hawaii California. It also consider propose $54 billion merger British Petroleum Amoco re-examine combination light new talks Exxon Mobil. In past, two mergers involve industry, government consider together decide deal them, say Terry Calvani, former commissioner Federal Trade Commission whose clients include Chevron. But come aftermath shell-texaco BP-Amoco deals, combination Exxon Mobil, significantly overlap retail refinery businesses United States Europe, poses questions antitrust officials confront since 1980s. It's real test case, say Frederick Leuffer, senior energy analyst Bear Stearns. If FTC let one go without major divesting, everything would fair game. Why GM merge Ford? While 1911 breakup Standard Oil view Washington officials industry executives ancient history, Exxon Mobil become dominant rivals retail refining markets, production lubricants petrochemicals. Leuffer say believe divestitures necessary case could large deal-breakers. other analysts lawyers, disagree require divestitures could kill deal, say companies would nonetheless shed significant operations expect challenges raise broad spectrum constituents, include competitors, customers state officials. These absolute obstacles, say John Hervey, analyst Donaldson Lufkin &AMP; Jenrette. In past, two big oil companies merged, aggressive attorneys general states almost always become involved raise questions high visibility local gas station. When state attorney general drives see four stations corner two Mobil Exxon, certain raise questions, Axinn said. Exxon Mobil significant concentrations retail marketing concerns Northeast, Southwest West Coast, also big refining operations. Because two companies involve everything exploration ship refine retailing, meaning deal consumers take months regulators sort out. The regulators examine transaction would dissect business, determine whether market global, national local, determine whether combine entity high concentration business areas. Experts agree regulators likely permit Exxon Mobil keep exploratory oil production businesses areas already highly competitive merger would result high prices. Hervey say markets already fragment combined market share major american european oil companies 17 percent. They downsized, cut back re-engineered. So 900 remain blue-collar workers Mobil's large domestic refinery, 1,500 decade ago, hear last week company discuss possible merger Exxon, like siren warn already suspect valve might blow. I think terrible thing, say Dick Mabry, refinery operator, emerge plant's artificial twilight main gate 12-hour shift end 4:30 Sunday morning. He stop rub eyes rim red, topic bedtime could delayed. It's revival Standard Oil Company. It's go put 20 30 thousand people work. I think Justice Department step stop it. Ernest Lewis, whose overalls bore Big E patch appropriate scale, add uh-huh's. The late evidence things head hulk right nearby, said, glance new power plant likely operate outside company without unions man refinery's generators. But Mobil Corp. sold, Lewis said, note gains company stock holdings, buyer solid large Exxon Corp. might least evils. If merge Chevron, we'd Moron, added. A grow american economy make billionaire someone unproven idea Internet marketing still slough workers old industries, petroleum much any. Those point tote board Beaumont plant's brick headquarters, say shows already handle 171 million barrels 130 million plan full year. But numbers matter even ones like 89.9, 88.9, even 81.9, nearby gas stations lowest prices, inflation, since Depression. Which Mobil Exxon consider combine world's large oil company. Some people close talks caution deal would consider boards least Tuesday, maybe Wednesday. And why, beginning last Wednesday evening, phone home Jimmy Herrington, president Oil, Chemical Atomic Workers Local 4-243 rang without stop. No, know merger talk television, say Herrington, also work full-time produce lubricants. He ask Mobil managers, meeting earlier month, rumors, say heard nothing. oil industry analysts say first targets combine company's efforts cut billions dollars annual costs would office staff professionals, like geologists engineers, field. One company's accountants could almost work two. But crews fully expect Exxon buyer would ask yet whether refinery could turn crude oil gasoline, motor oil products even few people. Union leaders raise prospect Exxon would sell refinery. Antitrust regulators, say, bound notice Exxon refineries hour's drive one direction three hours other, along Gulf Mexico crescent forms petrochemical industry's home. The Beaumont plant, steaming, hum chemistry set lining Neches River Gulf, become prime provider livelihoods since build almost spray nearby Spindletop gusher. With mount overtime stretch shift 16 hours more, workers regularly make $55,000 $65,000 year. People go retire there, Herrington said, drove around plant's fence periphery. Lewis, 17th year, third-generation employee. But nephew laboring exception. The workers stream plant dawn mostly bald go gray, sign full generation refinery concerned get rid workers attract them. The cutbacks have, far, come attrition, retirements often encourage incentives. But plywood sheets cover windows of fast food places gas stations around Herrington's union hall advertise best times long gone. His members chafe experts come Wall Street question justification every person's job. In tire dangerous tasks, question elimination relief laborers favor cover vacations sickness overtime (although like extra pay, say plant become safer years). They complain grow numbers outside contractors take formerly unionized tasks. But many workers choose invest least retirement savings Mobil stock, 1990s ethos gaining. Some share credit plant's management efficiency measures agree necessary true job security. Some take attitude every company always sale. They concern feel it, say Sam Salim, one electrical plant workers whose future uncertain. But fork $60 billion? I'd look over. With Mobil executives say little possible now, call Sunday local plant manager company spokesman elicit peep. Union leaders, however, already squawking. I believe create new monopolies way prop industry, say Robert Wages, former refinery operator union's president, telephone Saturday. Nevertheless, admirable foresight union negotiate clause last November's three-year contract extension guarantee company buyer would keep terms. Many members, typically come work high school, already mold oil companies' late exploits case studies fit rapacious MBA's. They're biggest, say Bobby Whisneant, assistant operator gasoline lubrication oil units, refer Exxon. He coming, early Sunday morning, plant gate whose white canopy seem borrow self-service station. So go buy second biggest. That's one way get rid competition. I hope something like 80s buying companies scrap them. Or something like Robber Baron era century before, say Mabry, another operator. Didn't teachers teach us school Standard Oil Company would never come back? Remember that? said, look friend, Lewis, Big E, agreement. But I better shut up. I still work Mobil. use to, Lewis said.

","Exxon and Mobil discuss combining business operations.A possible Exxon-Mobil merger would reunite 2 parts of Standard Oil broken up by the Supreme Court in 1911.Low crude oil prices and the high cost of exploration are motives for a merger that would create the world's largest oil company.As Exxon-Mobil merger talks continue, stocks of both companies surge.The merger talks show that corporate mergers are back in vogue.Antitrust lawyers, industry analysts, and government officials say a merger would require divestitures.A Mobil employee worries that a merger would put thousands out of work, but notes that his company's stock would go up.","In a move considered unthinkable a few years ago, Exxon Corp. and Mobile Corp, have entered into negotiations which could result in a merger of the two companies.Such a merger, should it occur, would form the world's largest oil company and the largest U.S. company, placing it above Wal-Mart.The merger, and talks like it among other oil companies, is being prompted By low petroleum prices and high production costs.Talks of a merger have sent the price of stocks of both companies soaring.The merger could prompt anti-trust action and the merging companies would have to divest themselves of some interests.Mobile workers fear a merger will cost them jobs.","Exxon Corp and Mobil Corp are reported to be discussing a business merger.Other oil companies have merged to compensate for low oil prices and increasing costs of oil exploration in more remote areas.The mergers are consistent with a trend in corporate marriages that is changing U.S. economic history.The mergers are pushing stocks up and the Exxon-Mobil merger could benefit consumers and lead to further savings.Some people believe the merger would require selling of large corporate pieces and put thousands out of work.If the companies merge, it would be the largest U.S. company and bigger than the world's largest oil company, Royal Dutch/Shell Group.","Exxon and Mobil consider merger.Partnerships already formed.Oil prices are lowest in 12 years and future exploration will be costly.The new company would be largest in the US and put back together pieces of Standard Oil, a monopoly broken up by courts.Experts mixed on merger's advantages.It would be an anti-trust test, since companies are involved in many facets of the business, require the sale of large units.Refinery workers, others would lose jobs.There is an upswing in corporate mergers, pushed by bull market and recognition that it's hard to increase revenue internally.Merger anticipation sent stocks higher in oil, internet and computers."

For, impeachment issue set move Senate, Livingston, whose marital indiscretions public obvious misery, choose show question political leader's resignation much play tumult-tossed city. I must set example I hope President Clinton follow, Livingston declared, flabbergast attend impeachment debate nation watch beyond.

He understand debate honor, duty, integrity truth, say DeLay argue one swift blow, Livingston demonstrate far good speaker Clinton president. With something political elan president show initiating Iraq attack impeachment loomed, House Republicans, batter public opinion polls, find rocket's red glare own. I hurt deeply beg forgiveness, Livingston tell House, nation family announce retreat. only moments before, Democrats openly hiss man Livingston firmly read judgment upon president: Sir, do great damage nation past year.

They must succeed, David Bonior, Democratic whip say Republicans give task refocus day misdeeds president, departure speaker. We debate impeachment distract that, declared. The way stop vicious cycle, Bonior cry floor, refuse give it, whether Bill Clinton Bob Livingston. But House still reel frenzied day fateful vote presidency approach notion resignation lick capital city like flame forest. reject last-minute democratic attempt soften action censure, House representatives move impeach President William Jefferson Clinton perjury Saturday call Senate try him, convict remove office. But even vote, Republicans press another line attack, demand Clinton's resignation. Rep. Robert Livingston, nominate speaker last month party, startle House announce would run speaker would resign House 21 years service. He urge president heal wound created. You, sir, may resign post. Angry Democrats boo shouted, You resign! Livingston continued, I challenge fashion I willing heed words. Apologizing extramarital affairs reveal two days ago, said, I believe I fine job. But I cannot job kind leader I would like current circumstances. then bolt House chamber, nearly knock reporters members down. (the House vote 228-206 approve first article impeachment, accuse Clinton commit perjury federal grand jury. The vote announce 1:24 p.m. EST, leave 42nd president face trial Senate whether remove office.) Clinton reject advice immediately. His spokesman, Joe Lockhart, said, The president intention resigning. By call Livingston reconsider, president argue broadly resignation fire. perhaps speak cases, Lockhart said, It would wrong give insidious politics personal destruction. Unless Clinton change course, would second impeachment president 209-year history Republic, first since Andrew Johnson acquit 1868. Sen. Trent Lott Mississippi, majority leader, insist bargaining censure prevent starting. But Senate could halt trial later part deal. Considering degree partisanship display Saturday, assemble two-thirds majority require Constitution conviction unlikely. sixty-seven votes would required, 55 Republicans Senate, along 45 Democrats. Four articles impeachment House charge Clinton perjury lie affair Monica Lewinsky federal grand jury Aug. 17.

Dick Armey Texas, majority leader, said, A nation laws cannot rule person breaks law. Rep. Nancy Johnson Connecticut said: There justice without truth. That profoundly so, perjury matters. Rep. Gerald Kleczka Wisconsin begin Democrats' arguments saying, What president wrong, personally morally, acts threaten democracy thus rise level impeachable offenses define found fathers Constitution. Rep. Charles Schumer, New York's senator-elect, said: The rule law require punishment fit crime. Allow us vote censure. Saturday's vote penultimate step serious conflict Congress president since Richard M. Nixon resign face impeachment certain conviction Aug. 9, 1974. But case spun 1972 break-in democratic headquarters Watergate complex, one begin murky land deal Arkansas 1978. Through efforts Kenneth Starr, independent counsel law enact wake Watergate, investigation spread examine Clinton's affair White House intern. All year preoccupy capital despite immense disconnect public opinion; since scandal become public January, polls show public oppose impeachment want inquiry bring end. even Friday night, 13-hour debate, CBS News Poll 548 people show 38 percent want representative vote impeachment; 58 percent want vote. The conflict enters uncharted seas, since Nixon resignation cut matter short Johnson trial occur different America, nuclear weapons cable television public opinion polls. But capital still rife confident speculation. Some guessed, hoped, results recent poll, show increases support resignation way spare nation trial Ms. Lewinsky Linda Tripp would star witnesses, would weaken Clinton's resolve. Others think Republicans, see dismal numbers polls party's stand United States, would first blink. With majority Senate, power end trial time Senate receive notice impeachment day convenes, Jan. 6, next day. But Clinton focus polls, CBS News survey show 64 percent still approve handle job president, resignation could almost immediately subject criminal prosecution. And Republicans steadfastly ignore polls year, confront directly Saturday. Representative J.C. Watts Oklahoma, newly elect chairman Republican caucus, said: What's popular always right. You say polls this. Polls measure change feelings, steadfast principle. Polls would reject Ten Commandments. Polls would embrace slavery ridiculed women's rights. You say must draw close. I say must draw line right wrong, tiny fine line executive fountain pen, big fat lead no. 2 pencil. And must every kid America see it. The point whether president prevail, whether truth prevail. last weekend, Judiciary Committee recommend four articles impeachment, Clinton's side still hop prevail help 20 30 republican moderates uncommitted. As week wear on, almost break president. One not, Rep. Christopher Shays Connecticut, say Saturday: After Judge Starr's report Congress September, presentation Judiciary Committee November, I conclude impeachable offenses proven, proven offenses impeachable. But president's continued failure come grips actions, sincerity arguments members Judiciary Committee sides aisle, change heart conviction members side aisle originally oppose impeachment support it, strong powerful opinion many constituents oppose position want president impeached cause rethink position. He added: yesterday morning, I visit president, I conclude original position correct one, me. I believe impeachable offenses proven, proven offenses impeachable. But Rep. Tom DeLay Texas, lead Republican effort force Clinton office, dismiss arguments moral relativism. He begin praise Livingston: There great american mind, least today, Bob Livingston, understood debate about. It honor decency integrity truth; everything honor country. It also debate relativism vs. absolute truth. He continued, The president's defenders say president morally reprehensible, reckless, violate trust american people, lessen esteem office president dishonor office entrust him, rise level impeachment. Rep. Jose Serrano New York said, My constituents hate Bill Clinton; love they're pray right moment. You may vote today impeach him, american people. And let tell something, I grow public housing projects South Bronx. I see bunch bullies I see them. The bullies get theirs, go get yours, too. Rep. Henry Hyde Illinois, Judiciary Committee chairman bring charges House floor, say Congress american people need distinguish private acts infidelity public act public officials. In Clinton's case, said, House deal serial violator oath chief law-enforcement officer. He say Senate could innovative creative decide best punish Clinton, House bound Constitution move ahead article impeachment. Justice important humble among us, Hyde said. Equal justice law that's we're fight for. Democrats, reading Constitution, voice diametrically opposite conclusions, attack fairness proceedings culminate Saturday. We're lose track distinction sin crimes, say Rep. Jerrold Nadler, D-N.Y. We're lowering standards impeachment. What president do great dangerous offense republic. Democrats also criticize Republicans impeach Clinton moment U.S. troop wag war Iraq. Six days Christmas troop battle, lame-duck Congress rush overthrow commander chief, say Rep. David Bonior Michigan, second-ranking House Democrat. The ghosts Watergate hung House chamber. One Republican cite parallels charges House Judiciary Committee bring Nixon 25 years ago, counts committee bring House floor affirmation Saturday. Nixon cheated. He cheat electoral system, say Rep. Lindsey Graham, South Carolina Republican Judiciary Committee. And now, Graham said, full House vote impeach Clinton believe commit crimes result cheat judicial system. But day's debate firmly root Clinton's effort conceal sexual affair Monica Lewinsky. Rep. Bob Barr, Georgia Republican Judiciary Committee one Clinton's fierce critics, hold copies U.S. Criminal Code, Judiciary Committee's report impeachment inquiry and, finally, Constitution, defend decision impeach president. Today, rely three pillars society: law itself, evidence Constitution, say Barr. There joy uphold law, Watts said. If cannot see lawlessness, children cannot recognize it. How tell children honesty best policy demand policy? But Democrats assail premise Republican majority build impeachment case Clinton. Rep. John Conyers Jr. Michigan, rank Democrat Judiciary Committee, assail four articles impeachment, count count, unfounded evidence fail rise impeachment. He save savage scorn final count, abuse power. The majority simply try dress perjury counts Watergate abuse-of-power language, Conyers said. Rep. Bob Livingston, confess colleagues Thursday night have adulterous affairs, stun House chamber Saturday morning say impeachment debate President Clinton would serve speaker would quit Congress six months. He urge president follow example quit, too. But White House, call Clinton's resignation deride Republican strategy, president send spokesman driveway urge Livingston reconsider resignation. Livingston stand well House serve two decades call Clinton resign office rather force trial Senate, draw boos colleagues cat-calls quit instead. He that. I must set example I hope President Clinton follow, Livingston announce shocked silent chamber act leave Republican Party total chaos hours vote impeach Clinton. The decision also leave party leaderless eve open 106th Congress, Republicans must govern one narrow majorities history. several Republicans, include Rep. Tom DeLay Texas, majority whip, somberly welcome news, suggest relieved excruciate embarrassment. In laud Livingston's move, DeLay said, He understood debate honor decency integrity truth, everything honor country. But Democrats say aghast, many include Clinton call Livingston reconsider decision. Mr. Livingston's resignation wrong, declare Rep. Jerrold Nadler, D-N.Y. It surrender develop sexual McCarthyism. Are go new test someone want run public office ever adulterer? He call country distinguish sins crimes. White House press secretary Joe Lockhart say Clinton disappoint news Livingston's plan wish would reconsider. Lockhart say president firmly believe politics personal destruction town country come end. He reaffirm Clinton would resign, saying: The president go what's best interest country. It would wrong give insidious politics personal destruction. Livingston's announce resignation stun disclosure process could result president's removal office. The speaker second line presidency, vice president. Newt Gingrich, outgo speaker, drive post Republicans lose five seats November election, technically remain speaker Jan. 6, Livingston's election ratify new Congress. But Gingrich remove daily operations House extraordinary session begin dismantle office. Livingston's decision say driven part anger group dozen conservatives party disillusion withheld news affairs them. They threaten withhold votes election January would formally make speaker. He also concern pain cause family disclosures, members said. They add that, lose many party, example would set president offer resign post now. DeLay, no. 3 House Republican leadership, expect fill power vacuum least temporarily, deed title, party regroups find new speaker. many members quickly rally around Rep. Dennis Hastert Illinois. Hastert, one DeLay's deputy whips well respect among colleagues, promote candidate majority leader last month, never mount campaign. Rep. Dick Armey Texas precariously hold majority-leader post last month consider likely candidate speaker. He expect manage reorganization, republican leaders set Jan. 4. Livingston meet privately close advisers Friday impeachment debate unfolded. Some colleagues believe make mistake disclosing Thursday night House move divisive debate impeachment occasion stray marriage. He tell republican leaders late Thursday afternoon Hustler magazine go expose affairs early next year. Some leaders urge keep quiet, wife, Bonnie, encourage tell colleagues immediately, despite momentous vote near floor. At point Thursday night, Roll Call, newspaper Capitol Hill, report Web site Livingston go admit affairs go offer resign. In closed-door meeting fellow Republicans, admit affairs make offer step down, receive three stand ovations instead. Thursday night, Livingston state would intimidate efforts exploit past. But Friday remove public action night draw close advisers confidence. His aides say Saturday clue be contemplating, members aware plans. ask advance word, Rep. J.C. Watts Oklahoma, newly elect member Republican leadership, said: I idea. Asked internal party pressure Livingston resign, Rep. Harold Rogers, R-Ky., said: I know was, added, There members critical it. As leaders try Saturday hold party together House floor, Republicans stuck prepared scripts floor favor impeach president. But begin express anguish. Rep. Henry Hyde, R-Ill., admit adulterous affair earlier year, say Livingston's resignation: Those us sinners must feel wretched today. something go repeatedly stopped, confusion private acts infidelity public acts. To much applause, Hyde declared: Congress business intrude private acts. Republicans, indeed Livingston himself, make distinction Clinton's sexual indiscretions Livingston's, say Clinton lie private acts therefore abuse legal system powers. As Livingston say statement Thursday: These indiscretions employees staff I never ask testify oath them. Democrats hop Livingston's seemingly drastic action would wake House poison atmosphere become might prompt Republicans reconsider impeachment Clinton. Rep. Paul Kanjorski, D-Pa., said, We start offer sacrificial lamb whatever terrible disease is. In stir speech applaud even Republicans, Rep. Dick Gephardt Missouri, Democratic leader, praise Livingston worthy, good honorable man say resignation grave mistake. It's terrible capitulation negative political forces consume political system country, Gephardt said, add events last days show life imitates farce. We need stop destroying imperfect people unattainable altar public morality, said, urge colleagues step back abyss reject resignation, impeachment vicious self-righteousness. The New York Times say editorial Sunday, Dec. 20: The Republicans' drive partisan impeachment base soley party-line voting power rather sense proportion produce unexpected sideshow resignation Rep. Bob Livingston role future speaker House. Analysts sides struggle President Clinton's future point Livingston's downfall evidence generalize breakdown legislative civility Capitol Hill. Democrats see moral symmetry, depict Livingston victim sexual puritanism wield Clinton. But one thing one fall Livingston's invitation use resignation model resolve crisis White House. Livingston's statement rock Congress, shake foundations somber constitutional process underway. By lie oath, Clinton make necessary House consider impeachment. The evidence convinced Americans president censured, remove office. Livingston allow GOP partisans block censure House. The result Saturday's expect impeachment vote, Livingston's unexpected announcement, mission Senate remain same. It must resist Republicans want short-circuit constitutional process demands resignation, must use upcoming Senate trial forum find censure commensurate president's personal dishonesty offenses law. These require stern punishment removal office. In undertake work, Senate must also reassure american people decisive wisdom core messy-looking political system melt down. In distempered times, shin opportunity Senate. Its members pride Republic's fire wall presidential excess popular partisan passions sometimes seize House Representatives. No one predict whether Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott rise define challenge career whether surrender mean streak acquire 16 grumpy years minority member House. We would like see Lott reach star role history. Lott's growl response questions censure encouraging. He may right Constitution require convene trial, nothing document prevents speedily guide Senate toward censure negotiations. Indeed, simple majority vote 45 Democrats plus 6 cooperating Republicans end Senate trial time, clear way introduction kind censure resolution suggest former Sen. Bob Dole. In intrigue report NBC, Tim Russert describe discussions among bipartisan group senators censure would involve form presidential confession, fine joint congressional request Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr prosecute Clinton courts. If Lott refuse allow bipartisan search censure, burden fall upon respected members like Joseph Lieberman democratic side Orrin Hatch Republicans. Through cooperation, guide Senate toward punishment fixes Clinton history president lie oath, avoids taint partisan vengeance associate House impeachment vote. The Senate's historic reputation prudence require find appropriate punishment personally weak president damage rule law, threaten stability government. House Speaker-elect Robert L. Livingston present fresh note shock impeachment debate President Clinton Thursday night Republican leader force admit Republican colleagues carry adulterous affairs past. It suddenly come attention individuals work together media investigate personal background effort find indiscretions may exploitable party eve upcoming historic vote impeachment, Livingston declare statement appear shock House Republican conference head disclosure surface news reports. After hear admissions close session, Livingston's colleagues give stand ovation support say question resign never arisen. My fate hands, Livingston tell Republicans, accord lawmakers present. The debate president's fate would go forward, Republicans later insisted, draw distinctions speaker-elect's revelations sex-and-mendacity scandal put Clinton brink impeachment. The president charge impeachment resolution perjury abuse power attempt hide sexual indiscretions. Democrats offer immediate comment, Republicans brace hear Livingston's admissions allude debate Friday Democrats decry investigation president basically partisan unfair rummage sex life. Livingston, say seek spiritual counseling receive forgiveness family, note several times tell reporters campaign become speaker I run speaker, sainthood. He added, There reason words. During 33-year marriage wife, Bonnie, I occasion stray marriage, nearly cost marriage family, Livingston say brief prepared statement. But attempt draw contrast allegations president, asserting: I want assure everyone indiscretions employees staff I never ask testify oath them. The disclosure speaker-elect's marital infidelities, disclose Rollcall, Capitol Hill newspaper, send new jolt uncertainty among lawmakers prepare momentous debate president's admit misbehavior office whether impeach tried Senate. Rep. Henry Hyde, Republican chairman House Judiciary Committee bring impeachment charges president, previously cite magazine extra-marital affair past. Then, Thursday night, Republicans voice suspicions democratic defenders president instigate media investigations effort embarrass Clinton's principal accusers. But proof offer Republicans leave conference, face uncertainties debate already promise bare-knuckled partisanship. Livingston leave conference surround Capitol police, take questions wait reporters. His chief leadership aides immediately rally support. Some would rather struggle constitutional question continue try twist debate unseemly investigation private lives, say Rep. Dick Armey, Republican majority leader. In report internet Thursday night, Rollcall disclose source make oblique reference Hustler, sex magazine. Larry Flint, publisher Hustler, early year advertise offer $1 million bounty information e members Congress guilty sexual indiscretions. It break heart we're subject human frailties, say Asa Hutchinson, R-Ark., leave conference. This comfortable circumstance anyone, added, insist president speaker-elect present two separate issues. We've get duty Constitution. It get point drastic action may necessary. You know movies Ebola virus outbreaks, guys sterile suits come in, seal area completely irradiate it? They may washington. Just eradicate us start scratch. In few, short days manage make terms surreal, bizarre, split-screen America, shocking, runaway train politics personal destruction useless cliches. We long govern here. We roll around gutter wonder who's next sexual auto-de-fe. On Saturday morning, surreal, shocking, bizarre, split-screen image Bob Livingston, speaker-elect, stepping marital infidelities revealed. We pawn chessboard, Livingston said, ask president resign resign himself. Livingston's rabid pursuit president, even hop hide dirty laundry, make avatar hypocrisy capital rot hypocrisy. On Thursday night, Livingston first confess sins Republicans hop keep hold post, colleagues give stand ovation. And make surprise announcement Saturday, Republicans give another ovation step deliver encomiums lose speaker. One's self-esteem get utterly crush times like this, sigh Henry Hyde, another tormenter president also admit succumbed temptation. Tom DeLay, jagged-edge exterminator may next-up speaker roundelay, choke up, praise greatness Livingston understand debate relativism versus absolute truth. What could relative Republican hidden lot affairs try impeach president lie his? Spurred Larry Flynt's bounty sinnuendo, city brace craziness. The Ship Fools reach cruise speed Friday evening, frighten scene Republicans craze hatred president railroad impeachment even though United States war Iraq, even though House chamber mostly empty, even though Republicans huddle glass house issue sex lies, even though White House still pitch tent planning sleigh rides Winter Wonderland press party Monday. (The White House keep journalists quarantine outside year, encourage bring kids. To soak cozy family atmosphere, doubt. Why Republicans obsessed, everyone right mind agree impeachment outlandishly over-the-top punishment Clinton self-destructive course country? Because genuinely hate president. They think he's dishonest, immoral, issue-stealing, selfish child '60s. They think they're go pay political price this, do, care. It might great time see lot combovers, great time see lot stature. The House debate history. It hideous version The McLaughlin Group. While Republicans try draw distinction Clinton perjure himself, ignored president lure Starr-Jones attorney team testify Monica Lewinsky. Ordinarily one would feel sorry Livingston. But Republicans bring sexual doomsday machine focus single-mindedly Clinton's sex life. The Republicans determine high-tech lynching engage wacky role reversals. many Republican hawk argue Bill Clinton bomb Saddam, claim timing suspicious, even though hammer bomb five weeks ago. In incredibly unseemly display, Trent Lott, majority leader, former Bush national security adviser Brent Scowcroft Bush Secretary State Lawrence Eagleburger chime attack. There's much hate here. And I hate it. We debate impeachment distract that, minority whip, Rep. David Bonior, Democrat Michigan, say Saturday's House debate, leap impossible goal. It would take kaleidoscopic television screen capture constantly shift images compete center stage: impeachment, Iraq, resignation Rep. Robert Livingston, response White House. The months lead impeachment President Clinton become series televise anticlimaxes, hours vote make lack drama. There hardly enough shorthand terms split screens cover activity. All networks cable channels carry moment unexpectedly set tone, Livingston, Louisiana Republican, announce debate would become House speaker. The commentators set carry congressional ratification inevitable vote, suddenly plugged-in reporters catch guard. As Tim Russert say Tom Brokaw NBC, Tom, knock us over. In echo chamber television news often becomes, share mantra weightier early morning. For second time american history president would impeached, go standard line. Yet despite pundits speculate politicians telegraph every move, one hint Livingston resignation. The announcement was, Brokaw put it, least partly political ploy, repercussions immediate. Reporters begin gather word Capitol Hill candidates speaker's job, conversation move next stage political tug war. The Republicans use Livingston's resignation say president resign, too; Democrats immediately counter idea president would stay Livingston well. That lead one less-expected split screens day, bad choice. While Congress debating, CNN show anti-aircraft fire Baghdad one box. In other, Joe Lockhart, Clinton's press secretary, stand White House driveway tell reporters president would like Livingston reconsider decision. There stateliness House television usually offers, one reason purely visual. Keep mind control picture, Dan Rather say CBS, explain television cameras Congress provide House, individual networks. There way roam zoom reaction shots, political convention. But sense history decorum last long CBS. At noon, vote, CBS go football game, become network leave news coverage. CBS' corporate decision try ways mean Rather would break updates Washington. I'll see soon, say signed complete coverage, look like trouper. But position news anchor day. He later announce impeachment votes split screen football game progress upper part screen. On networks cable channels, vote literally happen background. As tv screens tot numbers electronically-cast vote, members Congress mill around chat floor. even brief democratic walkout motion consider censure defeat thoroughly forecast. As Democrats straggle steps Congress, look curiously undramatic television, though probably make better still photograph place. And votes progress, jockey speaker's job heat up. We already presumptive leader, Gwen Ifill NBC News say midafternoon, name Rep. Dennis Hassert, R-Ill., also cite networks likely candidate. If political military action intruded, might obvious debate House floor send message vast divisions politics morality, signal deep cultural fissure crisis opened. The impeachment, say Rep. Tom DeLay, R-Texas, debate relativism vs. absolute truth. Rep. Jerrold Nadler, D-N.Y., contend Congress lose distinction sins crimes, argue sexual McCarthyism become prominent. And backdrop revelations adultery lead Livingston's resignation, Rep. Dick Gephardt, minority leader, declare politics personal destruction end. But jabber political posturing continued, reporters race cover president's statement impeachment late briefings Pentagon, little time focus profound cultural message beneath rhetorical flourishes. Bob Livingston, incoming speaker House, take public role Friday debate unfold whether impeach President Clinton. His previous 24 hours visible month since party nominated speaker perhaps excruciate public career: He spend day chaotic procedural wrangle terms Friday's debate; end telling republican colleagues have extramarital affairs 20-year tenure Congress. His disclosure follow investigation Larry Flynt, publisher Hustler, sex magazine, say Friday news conference Beverly Hills, Calif., publication learn Livingston have adulterous affairs last 10 years. Flynt say earlier year want expose hypocrisy Washington investigate Clinton October offer $1 million anyone could prove have affairs members Congress. He say Friday large investigation, publish perhaps soon January, would reveal described indiscretions several Republicans. He say connection White House hire investigative firm base Washington make former employees FBI CIA. He would confirm whether firm Terry Lenzner's Investigative Group Inc., do work president's private lawyers. Livingston unavailable reporters Friday. He spend time Friday morning sprawl chair back House chamber, listen debate whether impeach Clinton lie sexual indiscretions. several colleagues kneel Livingston's knee, whisper patted back. He spend day private office chamber, avoid gauntlet reporters lay wait House regular office across street. The word aid Navy award contracts worth millions dollars ship build Louisiana district Avondale Shipyards. During Friday's debate, handful Democrats make oblique allusions human failures. For example, Rep. John Lewis, D-Ga., said: Let sin cast first stone. Who, among us sinned? But one say Livingston's disclosure mild Democratic attempts exploit would influence votes impeachment. Rather, House floor hallway chitchat, Livingston's conduct seem last thing either Republicans Democrats want talk about. Bob Livingston first-rate human being, say Rep. David Obey, D-Wis., work closely sparred Livingston Appropriations Committee, interview. I repeat nuns taught St. James long time ago: We would hell lot better look souls rather try evaluate somebody else's. None us business even opinion it. even conservative Republicans seem ready overlook disclosure. We're go say, `Bob, can't speaker violate vows wife,' say Rep. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C. Like many, include Livingston, Graham distinguish Livingston's conduct Clinton's say president trample legal system whereas Livingston's behavior strictly private. Despite Flynt's claims, many Republicans blame Clinton administration smear Livingston, although offer evidence. This happen own, say Rep. Dana Rohrabacher, R- Calif. The thing certain uncertainty. The smart money shout President Clinton never resign, concurs. The smart money argues Senate could muster 67 votes would need remove wounded president office, would require defection 12 Democrats Republicans stand him. The smart money insist someone cut deal end this. Maybe so. But smart money whispers, Remember. Remember everyone Washington, include Rep. Henry Hyde, R-Ill., chairman Judiciary Committee, say House would never, ever, treat impeachment partisan issue. Wrong. Remember pundits predict democratic losses midterm elections, opposite happened, say impeachment dead. Twice wrong. And remember New Year nation may travel road never travel before. One president, Andrew Johnson Tennessee, try Senate, course. But happen different country one 37 states, primitive communications, simple economy base largely agriculture, minimal commitments abroad. In toxic politics century's end Washington, inconceivable become commonplace. The wholly unanticipated announcement Saturday morning Rep. Robert Livingston, R-La., would serve speaker would resign Congress, follow equally unanticipated disclosure Thursday night several extramarital affairs, deepen capital's profound sense insecurity. The deadly sweep scythe neo-puritanism appear unstoppable, least moment, Livingston's forthcoming resignation increase pressure president likewise. You've set us example, leader House Republican majority, Rep. Dick Armey Texas, tell Livingston Saturday. The example principle come power. The Democrats make opposite point, argue Livingston case show wrong savage people personal pecaddillos. One transcendently important thing remain same: Although surrounded judicial trappings preside chief justice, trials presidents political processes, power reside hands elective politicians. In addition narrow legal issues guilt innocence, weigh considerations party, nation's future, individual political well-being almost anything else care weigh reach verdict. The long took, numerous call resignation would probably be. even Saturday's epochal roll-calls, four ten Americans interview late New York Times/CBS News Poll say think president step indicted, despite fact large majority voice disapproval impeachment proceedings. What lie behind seem contradiction, course, fear Clinton, country him, would incapacitated. No one take Andrew Johnson seriously escape conviction single vote. But Clinton, man powerful whose whole life series comebacks, already embark effort show nation's business. Richard Nixon claw way back respectability leave White House one thought could; Clinton intend re-establish authority still office. He one great advantage: Two-thirds american public continue voice approval political stewardship, whatever think man. The president press hard, despite much-reduced leverage, deal censure. Indeed, fine piece political irony one could ask for, already sought enlist former Sen. Bob Dole, Republican defeat 1996, emissary Senate majority. The numbers unpromising: help six Republicans, 45 Democrats could end trial time pas censure resolution House would surely take up. There enough Republican moderates sometime party-buckers make plausible target. But republican leader Senate, Trent Lott Mississippi, make unwillingness take president's word plainly evident recent days, determine fight trial-aborting arrangement. It clear Clinton's reputation stain forever, matter Senate does. The spot out. History remember man covet glow legacy impresario economic growth, Moses point way 21st century, second president ever impeached, first ousted. That harsh word, impeachment, cling name surely Teapot Dome clings Harding's Depression Hoover's. But alone suffer grievous injury political avalanche shake loose disclosure Clinton's sexual relationship former White House intern, Monica Lewinsky. The Republicans' public support shrivel 40 percent new Times/CBS News poll, low level 14 years, could go low fact impeachment sinks in. Journalists see many jackals, indifferent whatever personal suffering national angst may cause long get story, none concern accuracy. In fact, whole political culture 1990s, criminalization political conduct seem indifference important national international issues, fall disrepute ordinary Americans. The last week seem crystallize long-term decline political civility. Republicans call Clinton liar, even commit American pilots skies Iraq, Democrats accuse rivals conduct political lynch political coup d'etat. Bipartisanship may big victim all. Party lines Saturday's rolls call held firm leg irons. Almost Republicans oppose impeachment exclusively legal principle least partly special political circumstances democratic majority Rep. Constance Morella's district Maryland suburbs Washington, example, gratitude Rep. Peter King, R-N.Y., Clinton's peacemaking Ireland. It hard see emerge reputation enhanced, except perhaps Hillary Rodham Clinton, staunch face deception. If threats dire predictions uttered House Democrats recent days take face value, nation enter upon Era Bad Feelings, polar opposite second Era Good Feelings, similar 1820s, Clinton hop preside over. Rep. Tom Sawyer, D-Ohio, compare Clinton Friday Sir Thomas More, execute treason 1535 religious beliefs. He quote More's words admonition today: What hunt actions thoughts heart. It long road opened. God help statesmen walk road. But amidst loose talk permanent damage institution that, remember: Things change startle speed modern American politics, institutions american government prove extraordinarily resilient. President Nixon, almost universally agree 1974, weakened american presidency many decades come. nobody say eight years Ronald Reagan, 15 years later. In end, people mean nothing. Bob Livingston clearer that. His mind mind followers closed. even bomb continue Iraq Americans coast coast clamor alternative impeachment, even adulterous past flush grotesque invasions privacy inevitably follow relentlessly prurient pursuit president, even country begin contemplate destructive effects lengthy bitter Senate trial, speaker-designate arrogantly stupidly proclaimed: Let us disregard outside influences. The radicals Hill would hear nothing echoes fanaticism. Impeach! Impeach! And continue even stun announcement Saturday morning Livingston would quit House. Dismayed partisan stampede, Dick Gephardt, Democratic leader, warn impeachment debate Friday: In effort uphold Constitution, trample Constitution. David Bonior, Democratic whip, said: This wrong. It unfair. It unjust. At time events world challenge home demand stand united, censure one solution bring us together. To colleagues across aisle, I say let go obsession. Listen American people. But voices reason would heard. Livingston right-wing colleagues, Tom DeLays, Henry Hydes, Bob Barrs, mission destruction would denied. Ordinary Americans could cry wanted. They could protest demonstrate, send faxes E-mails. It matter. The right march democracy run. Rep. Thomas Barrett, Democrat Wisconsin, try remind Republican colleagues Constitution allow remove president office can't stand him. He was, course, ignored. The Republicans pay huge price brazen, utterly partisan attempt drag president White House defiance of people. The party's contempt voters arrogantly quite adequately summed Alan Simpson, former senator Wyoming, said: The attention span Americans movie come next month whether quarterly report stock change. If voters dope Mr. Simpson think are, come 2000 everyone forget impeachment crisis. But Rep. Robert Menendez, D-N.J., probably closer truth said, I warn colleagues reap bitter harvest unfair partisan seeds sow today. One many strange events past couple weeks way virtually previously undecided Republicans, so-called moderates, surrender independence line like lackeys follow right wing's lead. All proclaim loudly vote principle, fact exercise mass cowardice, exemplify Rep. John McHugh upstate New York. McHugh announce Tuesday would vote impeachment. But decision base principle, odd way express it. The Washington Post say McHugh appear stomach Senate conviction removal president office. Of colleagues Senate, McHugh said, I, one, would accept, even welcome, mercy. In words, let Senate heavy constitutional lifting. McHugh may wish loud mercy, clearly frighten right-wingers House cast compassionate vote himself. The GOP longer conceal party extremists, right-wing absolutists, party step political cultural orientation Americans. Bob Livingston may leaving, arrogant comment still serve party's slogan. Let us disregard outside influences. Let us disregard people. ","During the Clinton impeachment debate in the House, Speaker-elect Bob Livingston declared that he would set an example for the president and resign from Congress over revelations of his marital infidelities.Republican demands that the president also resign were rejected by Democrats who also said that Livingston should not quit and that the Speaker-elect's resignation was, in the words of Jerrold Nadler (D-N.Y), ""a surrender to sexual McCarthyism"".With the House vote to impeach, the president will face a Senate trial, but it is unlikely that 67 members will vote for conviction.The trial could be mercifully shortened, however, by a vote of censure.","As impeachment proceedings in the House approached a climax, House members were stunned by an admission from House Speaker elect Livingston that he was guilty of an adulterous affair.The admission follows disclosures by Hustler published Larry Flynn, who had offered one million dollars to anyone who could provide such information on a House or Senate member.Livingston's admission was met with a standing ovation by House members, as was his subsequent resignation.In resigning, Livingston called on President Clinton to do the same.Political pundits see the whole process as driven by partisan politics.","House Speaker-elect Robert L. Livingston was forced to admit to his Republican colleagues his past adultery.This was forced by an investigation by Larry Flynt.When Livingston called for Clinton to quit, House Democrats yelled, ""You resign""!Stunningly, he did.TV commentators were caught off guard.Livingston put pressure on Clinton to follow his example.The House moved to impeach Clinton and called on the Senate to try him.Livingston's downfall was said to show a breakdown in legislative civility.Those who want impeachment were called radicals and fanatics.Livingston's pursuit of Clinton was characterized as ""rabid"", showing his own hypocrisy.","House Speaker-elect Robert Livingston shocked his Republican colleagues in the midst of a Clinton impeachment debate by admitting to adulterous affairs during his Congressional tenure.He later urged Clinton to follow his example and resign that increased the fury of the impeachment debate.The House moved to impeach the President for perjury and called on the Senate to try him, convict him and remove him from office.Some who believe the debate shows the fanatical, partisan, and hateful side of Republican behavior, advise the Senate only to censure Clinton and thus avoid partisan vengeance.The issue deepens a cultural fissure and a sense of uncertainty."

Russia repeatedly fail meet deadlines construct crew module, put whole project behind schedule. have lose hope get promised government funds, russian space agency sell early research time station NASA dlrs 60 million complete segment. Agency chief Yuri Koptev say take part new station hope beleaguer russian space industry, whose funding collapse since soviet collapse. The project would allow Russia keep 80,000 jobs next 15 years. Koptev assail russian space engineers continue insist money put Russia's batter 12-year old Mir space station extend lifetime instead commit funds new space outpost. The choice determine emotions. Some people glue one thing (Mir) care rest, Koptev say recent news conference. We must proceed understand would take us future, allow us preserve industry. The russian Khrunichev company earn dlrs 200 million building Zarya, whose design base earlier soviet spacecraft, include Mir's six modules. WASHINGTON NASA Russian Space Agency agree set aside last-minute russian request launch international space station orbit close Mir, officials announce Friday. While put new station closer Russia's 12-year-old Mir station would make easy transfer equipment supplies old outpost new one, request come late act on, say Randy Brinkley, NASA's space station program manager. NASA surprise last week Russia's prime station contractor propose orbital position change two-and-a-half weeks launch first part new station. Delaying Nov. 20 flight 10 hours match orbits would force similar shifts subsequent assembly flights, result potentially unfavorable sun angles solar-powered station, engineers said. We mutually conclude would prudent make changes, Brinkley say news conference hold Johnson Space Center Houston. It add technical complexity risks mission justified. The decision, follow frank candid discussions two partners, impose United States, said. The conclusions mutual, Brinkley said. Both sides conclude make sense. The Russians, struggle find money space program nation economic collapse, say wanted transfer thousands pound new equipment scientific instruments Mir economy move. However, critics question Russians' motives, wonder requested orbital change part plan delay decommission destruction Mir, Russians agree next summer. The Russians little money United States partners international station fear money spend Mir prevent Russia meeting obligations new project. The Mir compete international space station critical resources funding, Brinkley said. NASA consider ideas salvage Mir's research equipment use international space station, said, interfere assemble new station. The United States 15 nations plan begin build new station orbit next week Russians launch module supply power propulsion early stages five-year construction period. The space shuttle Endeavor follow Dec. 3 second station part, u.s.-built connect passageway attaches first module.

Daniel Goldin, administrator NASA, say news conference follow launching, now 44 launches go, 1,000 hours space walks countless problems. But partner nations trust work together, said, international space station go reality. even new space station come together, questions continue fate Russia's exist space laboratory, 12-year-old Mir. Because collapse russian economy, doubts Russia produce enough rockets equipment support projects lead Russia promise would abandon Mir destroy station next summer. However, recent weeks russian officials lobby find ways extend Mir's life. accord report news agency Reuters, President Boris Yeltsin's space adviser, Yevgeny Shaposhnikov, say Friday prepare number proposals extend Mir's life past year 2000. Support options grow recent weeks among russian space officials, astronauts nationalists, see Mir symbol russian achievements space. James Van Laak, NASA's deputy manager operations space station, say Friday agency receive formal proposals extend Mir's life. NASA would find proposal unacceptable measurable impact international space station, Van Laak say telephone interview Johnson Space Center Houston, No one objection Mir keep operational Russians find way support projects, demonstrate can. Yuri Koptev, head russian Space Agency, say launch Zarya, 42,000-pound space tugboat supply power propulsion early stages station construction, need vindication trouble russian space program.

His russian counterpart, Yuri Koptev, say launch vital vindication trouble russian space industry, proving could play major role space operations. Today make truly epoch-making step carry project. The russian space industry alive well perfectly able fulfill commitments international space station, said. The launch go smoothly, rocket soar cloudy sky central asian steppes. The huge roar rocket reverberate dozens kilometers (miles) across empty plain around base. The mood launch pad tense launch, space officials workers anxiously make last-minute checks ensure problems. Solar power panels module successfully deploy shortly reach first orbit systems work normally, officials said. The launch Russian cargo module, delay year, ushers new era cooperation among former space-race rivals. Space officials express optimism cooperation would promote world stability follow end Cold War. We still contradictions, still combat missiles aim other, predominant trend state cooperation things together, say Yuri Semyonov Russia's Energia space company. The 12.4-meter (41.2-feet) Zarya, Sunrise, launch three-stage Proton booster rocket. Zarya design serve space tugboat early stages project, provide propulsion, power communications.

For second time week, Jerry Ross James Newman float hatch shuttle Endeavour work seven-story, 35-ton station take shape open cargo bay. Their no. 1 priority attach two 100-pound antennas Unity, American-made side space station. Their job, time permitting, trickier: try open stick antenna Zarya, Russian-built control module. The plan seven-hour spacewalk nearly difficult crucial Monday night's outing, Ross Newman hook 40 electrical connections Zarya Unity. The plan call men lug two suitcase-size antennas halfway Unity install opposite sides 36-foot cylinder. Once activated, antennas provide direct, virtually uninterrupted communication link Unity NASA's Mission Control. Otherwise, U.S. flight controllers would rely sporadic coverage provide russian ground stations. The electronic computer hookups antennas make inside Unity Thursday, entire crew enters orbit station first time. other spacewalk chores Ross Newman Wednesday evening include erect sunshade computer mount outside Unity. Mission Control decide spacewalk let Newman take crack unjamming Zarya antenna. Flight controllers urge caution. The antenna roll spool, engineers worry 3-foot strip might pop open enough force hurt get close. Newman 10-foot grappling hook job. The antenna one two fail open properly follow Zarya's Nov. 20 launch Kazakstan. One spacewalk plan Endeavour's 12-day mission: On Saturday, Ross Newman conduct photo survey take sack tools use future station visitors. Newman also may try unjam Zarya antenna. This sixth spacewalk Ross 18-year NASA career, American, third Newman. ",NASA and the Russian Space Agency readied the first part of an international space station for launch from Baikonur base.They decided not to change the orbit of the Zarya module as Russia had requested.Zarya's Nov. 20 launch was a success.The Zarya module orbited Earth for 2 weeks before a rendezvous with U.S. shuttle Endeavor to join it to the Unity module.It was tweaked and working well.It will serve as a space tugboat.The first 2 building blocks of the international space station were successfully joined by Endeavor astronauts in the shuttle's open cargo bay.Endeavor astronauts made 2 of 3 planned spacewalks to work on the space station modules.,"Russia launched the first piece of the international space station into orbit a year after the originally scheduled date.The launch follows a last minute Russian request to change the orbit of the space station to put it closer to Mir.This request was set aside.Two weeks later, the U.S. carried the Unity chamber into orbit.U.S. astronauts aboard the Endeavor shuttle then joined the Unity chamber to the Russian Zarya control module.The resulting 7 story structure appeared to be a perfect fit.In a subsequent second space walk, the astronauts were to install antennas on the Unity chamber as well as to attempt to unjam a Russian antenna.","Jerry Ross and James Newman spacewalked to attach antennas to Unity, the American half of the first stage of the 16-nation space station.Unity will be a connecting passageway for other modules.The other portion of the fledgling station, the Russian- built and launched Zarya module, will provide power and propulsion to the facility.The successful launch of Zarya, which had been delayed over a year due to funding woes, was hailed by the Russian Space Agency head as proof that the Russian space industry ""is perfectly able to fulfill all of its commitments on the international space station"".Russia is scheduled to launch the crew module next year.","After a year's delay Russia launched the first unit of the international space station, then pushed it to a higher orbit.Zarya will provide propulsion, power, and comms.US shuttle Endeavour made a blind docking with Zarya.Two spacewalks made electrical connections with Unity, which will serve as a passageway, attached its antennas and attempted to open a stuck Zarya antenna.A Russian cost-cutting proposal to orbit the station closer to Mir jointly vetoed.Russia promised to destroy Mir but now wants to extend its life.Russia sold early research time on the station to NASA to pay construction costs but claims the management lead for 1st 5 years."

A joint declaration sign Sunday ancient port city Douro River northern Portugal. Diplomats say consensus form final statement. The declaration call international community, Group Seven countries particular, take necessary measures promote stability international financial markets, necessary condition sustain economic growth, say Luis Augusto Castro Neves, Brazilian Foreign Ministry. Latin America's leaders favor create kind regulatory system global financial transactions would place controls speculators, like measures slow internatioal flow money.

Brazil, continent's large economy potential bulwark creep recession, wait news dlrs 30 billion bailout package International Monetary Fund. The presidents World Bank InterAmerican Development Bank also expect talks. The move U.S. Federal Reserve cut interest rates Thursday revive Latin America's financial markets, analysts expect reprieve short-lived deep concerns continent's economic health. The recent economic troubles stem part structural weaknesses latin american economies. A strike wag state employees Colombia government austerity package offer glimpse trouble could arise tough reforms introduced. Brazil draft austerity package hit public spending, especially social security. brazilian officials end four days meetings representatives International Monetary Fund Tuesday without live public pledge announce concrete measures reduce government deficits. In Washington, Pedro Parente, executive secretary brazilian Finance Ministry, offer details Brazil's plan raise primary account surplus next three years. With five days go gubernatorial runoffs Sunday, neither President Fernando Henrique Cardoso, Brasilia, say government plan achieve savings. Important allies Cardoso lag behind three key states, despite government promises, market analysts expect announcement elections. Instead, strategy Brasilia Washington appear focus reassure markets work cut deficit go forward, without provide fodder opponents domestic elections. The discussions continue objective reaching agreement soon detail program, say joint statement IMF Brazilian Finance Ministry. Because Brazil's enormous deficits, collapse emerge markets hit nation particularly hard, drain foreign currency reserves push economy toward recession. Finance officials Washington around world fear collapse Brazil, size links economies, would worsen financial instability throughout hemisphere. With 160 million people, Brazil represent world's ninth-largest economy financial engine Latin America. Throughout day, government officials meet Cardoso Brasilia expect fine-tune three-year austerity package Cardoso discuss congressional party leaders Wednesday morning. In Brasilia, officials say among measures consider tax increase financial transactions, three-tenths percent two-tenths percent, extend Fiscal Stabilization Fund, sets aside 20 percent taxes collect presidential discretionary spending. The fund expire 1999. Speaking Washington, Parente say Brazil would aim toward surplus 2.6 percent 1999, 2.8 percent 2000 3 percent 2001. It already announced, end IMF's annual meeting Washington two weeks ago Brazil would reach primary account surplus 2.5 percent 3 percent qualify IMF aid. The primary account cover government expenses, without interest payments debt. Ernest Brown, senior economist Latin America Morgan Stanley Dean Witter, say signs brazilian government IMF move closer aid package reassuring, expect much reassurance next week. I call `we pope' scenario, Brown said. You're go hear pope, maybe see white smoke rising, said, figure pope elections. The United States prepare commit U.S. taxpayer funds part lend program least $30 billion try insulate Brazil, rest Latin America, bad effects financial turmoil circle globe, accord U.S. foreign officials assemble program. Details U.S. contribution, expect total several billion dollars direct aid loan guarantees, yet negotiated. But several congressional leaders alert likelihood administration would act Congress recess. This early warning administration reflect memories Congress erupt objections hearings 1995 President Clinton commit $20 billion U.S. funds bailout Mexico. But administration officials say last week early soundings indicate members Congress deeply concern prevent economic collapse Latin America would resound United States, thus expect objections. The timing aid package Brazil originally expect within next days complicate unexpected delays crop deal brazilian government. The government President Fernando Henrique Cardoso face politically risky gubernatorial elections Sunday, may well determine whether Brazil execute austerity program key condition loans concurrently negotiate International Monetary Fund. The big role rescue program Brazil take International Monetary Fund, say last week would contribute least $15 billion appear pressure United States even more. Another $9 billion come World Bank inter-american Development Bank, remainder United States major industrial nations. Germany Japan, though, reluctant take part, one U.S. official noted, suggest Latin America chiefly Washington's problem, own. So far, U.S. officials work behind scenes organize aid package say nothing public details plans direct contribution Brazil. Brazil important economic well-being region, United States international community, us much focus see helpful, Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin say Friday. But wide-ranging interview global economic turmoil, Rubin decline say strategy would pursue deal Brazil's problems insist decisions make United States might contribute. But discuss Brazil opportunity engage kind preventive financial diplomacy President Clinton advocate speeches IMF World Bank three weeks ago. At time, Clinton argue monetary fund provide contingent finance help countries ward global financial contagion rather wait disaster strike. Direct U.S. aid Brazil would clearly send symbolic message: year try manage financial crisis monetary fund, United States ready put limited amount capital risk prevent havoc Brazil stop chaos spread Argentina, Mexico countries major U.S. trading partners. That would change strategy. So far, United States operate almost entirely international financial institutions, chiefly IMF But would also risky move President Clinton, economically politically. even though Congress object $20 billion U.S. funds commit bailout Mexico, turn $12 billion ultimately needed, since pay back, interest. But Rubin note Friday different environment now. other administration officials say believe would objections Congress direct U.S. participation Brazil bailout. I think lot people Congress scar death what's happen markets, could happen districts, White House official say last week, say much long vote it. By act soon stabilize Latin America, administration hop capitalize two weeks relative calm late-summer panic engulfed Russia and, height, lead outflow billion dollars day Brazil, fear would next country force devalue currency. Whether calm marks begin turnaround another pause wildfires erupt since Thailand's currency crisis July 1997 matter considerable debate. But many experts cite confluence several events reassure jittery investors around world: two successive interest-rate cuts United States, Japan's long-delayed move prop banking system $500 billion taxpayer funds, steady strengthen currencies Thailand, Indonesia South Korea, first signs investors may prepare return. Always circumspect come comment publicly markets, Rubin acknowledge last several weeks number significant, positive developments. But former trader, burn 26-year career many false market rallies, warn serious issues remain take time world work way repeatedly call serious international financial disruption last 50 years. In fact, Rubin's aides clearly nervous possibility another outbreak could set new round panic, make virtually impossible many emerging-market countries borrow money world markets. Brazil Japan two obvious tinderboxes, say Jeffrey Garten, dean Yale School Management, serve undersecretary commerce international affairs Clinton's first term. In Brazil, issue whether package come together really big enough deal explode debt problem. And Japan question whether real reform go along money. But spend 18 months negotiations Japanese, Rubin clearly sense United States little leverage Tokyo; problems chiefly root political gridlock, lack resources. In Brazil, though, United States good chance buying time influence economic reform program, long appear dictating terms publicly Cardoso team. But demonstrate economic support probably require tapping Exchange Stabilization Fund, create Roosevelt administration help stabilize dollar. The money Rubin's control, presidential approval, reach circumvent congressional objections aid Mexico 1995. But reaction strong time Congress restrict tap fund international bailouts Rubin extraordinarily cautious ever since. He commit $3 billion second line defense emergency aid programs Indonesia South Korea last year, money ultimately disperse either country. U.S. officials say South Korea need extra help, collapse Suharto government Indonesia change political scene would risky offer direct U.S. aid. In bailout Russia whose economy collapse President Boris Yeltsin abandon agreement reform economy dismiss leading reformers United States offer direct help. Those events set panic exit investors emerge markets, greatly worsen Brazil's troubles. so far, brazilian officials successfully calm market constantly talk forthcoming aid program IMF, convincing speculators would dangerous bet country. But time, brazilian officials maintain pose really need cash certainly hurry get it. U.S. officials top officials imf clearly nervous, worry long negotiations drag on, great risk Brazil catch another round market turmoil. The Brazilians want everyone think control, say investment banker involve talks. But fact there's still real risk sometime next 18 months government go force devalue currency, peg dollar, adjusts 7.5 percent year carefully control fall. To prevent sudden devaluation, brazilian government raise interest rates 50 percent, choke credit companies. Meanwhile, country slip recession. The aid would buy time Brazilians, contingent Cardoso's success persuade legislature end huge deficits, chiefly unpopular cuts social spending. The first deputy manage director International Monetary Fund, Stanley Fischer, spend Friday Brazil review country's austerity plan, expect announce Sunday's elections international package, avoid appearance global lender dictate conditions Brazil. Brazil lot, Fischer say last week leave trip. In return, I expect international community make large contribution. Leaders 19 latin american nations, Spain Portugal put finish touches Saturday ibero-american summit declaration warn global recession unless action take stabilize international financial system.

One senior administration official deals economic issues, speak condition anonymity, say Tuesday internal projections suggest trade deficit 1999 could reach $300 billion, figure say certainly cut growth, could well become major political problem. Trade deficits carry good troubling signals economy. The current flood imports help contain inflation low levels decades. And sales American aircraft, computer chips goods suffering, weaken dollar world markets recent weeks may provide end-of-the-year boost american exporters. But moment global upheaval, big problem face american companies inability many nations large companies Asia Latin America simply borrow money make ordinary purchases. The result freeze economic activity empty ship containers stack American piers. And effects hurt everyone Midwest farmers longer send wheat impoverish Russia, East Coast fishermen discover Japan's appetite salmon lobster ruin banking crisis. Among surprising elements Tuesday's report third August's deficit one country far manage ward bad effects global troubles: China. Despite continued growth Chinese economy, exports China slow dramatically imports chinese-made goods exploded, country desperately seek sell goods would ordinarily sell elsewhere Asia. That increase monthly deficit Beijing $5.9 billion, levels previously see trade Japan.

Kim say Friday one new facility already operate construction operational four six years. We estimate reactor go on-line 2002 2003, enable production enough plutonium build one nuclear weapon within six 12 months, Kim said. North Korea would able make sufficient plutonium make eight 10 nuclear weapons every year that. North Korea say underground construction civilian use nuclear-related. It offer open facility U.S. inspectors, say Washington must pay compensation facility proven civilian use. President Clinton make unusual, direct appeal North Korea Saturday set aside nuclear ambitions favor strengthen ties South Korea United States.

Economics security Clinton's twin themes five-day Asia trip begin Japan. Clinton acknowledge U.S. intelligence officials yet certain underground construction project North Korea nuclear related. But say North risks close door cooperation refuse U.S. inspection site. It raise strong suspicion, Clinton say joint news conference Kim Blue House, presidential mansion overlook capital. We need access it. The foundation U.S. efforts ease North Korea's decades-long hostility toward South 1994 agree framework North halt nuclear weapons program exchange Western commitment build modern nuclear energy sources there. That deal would shatter suspect site turn clandestine nuclear project. Kim, move South Korea sunshine policy engage North Korea cultural economic fronts, firm say government supports Clinton nuclear issue. In meetings week Pyongyang, North Korean capital, U.S. officials rebuff request see suspicious site, american intelligence officials fear could secret effort revive North's nuclear weapons program. We must require full access ways ascertain nature purposes construction site, Kim said. If is, fact, proven nuclear related, demand immediate close down. He also say North must limit missile development, cite great shock Japan North Koreans test-fired missile way Aug. 31. U.S. spy satellite photos show thousands workers dig massive complex. U.S. special envoy Charles Kartman Friday retract assessment make Thursday compelling evidence North Korea building underground nuclear facility. In statement distribute U.S. embassy today, Kartman say instead, There strong information make us suspicious, lack conclusive evidence intend purpose underground site nuclear related and, so, type nuclear facility might be. Kim say government would support U.S. efforts resolve nuclear question. The North Koreans deny underground construction site nuclear purpose, propose dlrs 300 million payment allow inspections. Clinton reject idea compensation. Directing remarks North Korea, Clinton note significance new tourism deal bring South Koreans North cruise ships arrangement tout Kim sign North may open 1950s Korean War enemy. Nothing could ever put hole ground, give defense partnership here, would give North Koreans much advantage, much power, much wealth, much happiness, ships go full people here, Clinton said. In meet Korean community business leaders Seoul's National Folklore Museum, Clinton praise South Korea's progress recover financial crisis. On darker note, mention recent tensions asian steel exports United States, skyrocket year great cost domestic U.S. steelmakers. japanese steel big problem, south korean steel exports also rise. Clinton say U.S. economy could tolerate increase imports concentrate industries, result asian economies begin recover. We sensitive price basically erase entire sector U.S. economy, Clinton said. North Korea agree receive U.S. delegation next month discuss american concerns construction vast underground complex widely fear house nuclear weapons program, State Department say Wednesday. The delegation, lead Charles Kartman, press access site, american intelligence agencies believe could centerpiece effort revive frozen nuclear arms program. We've make clear North Koreans attempt North Korea pursue nuclear weapons development program would unacceptable, State Department spokesman, James Rubin, said. The talks Pyongyang, capital, added, aim completely satisfy U.S. concerns suspect construction. american intelligence agencies fear building complex could effort break four-year-old pact North Korea pledge give nuclear-weapons program exchange billions dollars aid United States, South Korea Japan. American officials say spy satellites recently photograph thousands north Koreans around huge site 25 miles northeast Yongbyon, nuclear center North Korea believe stockpile enough plutonium 1994 accords build six bombs. Although explain exactly government build complex, north korean officials deny would use develop nuclear weapons. The official north korean press agency say last week government build civilian underground structure `doubt' cannot cast suggest american officials would allow inspect complex press access. If U.S. side persist inspect underground structures, press agency said, show them. Rubin say United States receive formal assurances Kartman, American special envoy korean nuclear issues, delegation would allow inspect site trip, begin Nov. 16. We begin discussion demand access, Rubin said. The history U.S.-North Korea discussions involve usually lengthy discussion process agreement requirements. so expect walk one day able access next. The trip announce signs grow relative warming relations United States North Korea. Representatives United States, China two Koreas meet recently Geneva agree steps reduce tension Korean Peninsula. In September United States pledge provide additional 300,000 tons grain north Korea, years cripple severe food shortages. In addition White House disclose United States would provide heavy fuel oil promise North Korea 1994 agreement, despite concerns North Korea may intend revive nuclear program. american officials say activity near Yongbyon may yet technically violate accord, evidence North Korea begin pour cement new reactor reprocessing plant convert nuclear waste bomb-grade plutonium. This city always keep unwritten list foreign leaders dictators, unfriendly authoritarians consistently annoy allies thinks make enormous contribution peace, security America's agenda take early retirement, minimum. In 1950s, leftist leaders Iran Guatamala make Top 10, '60s populate Diem Sukarno Southeast Asians. President Richard M. Nixon advisers infamously agree secret meeting '70s best way deal government Salvador Allende Gossens Chile make economy scream. Diplomatic etiquette, though, usually discourage shout America's enemies list White House rooftop. After all, foreign policy personalities, right? But last week, drive frustration, anxiety, perhaps lure sound tough cameras, Clinton administration pip up, twice. In different situations, opposite corners world, United States speak loudly can't find stick. Sunday, hours call attack Iraq, Clinton finally volunteer obvious, focus U.S. policy toward Iraq removal President Saddam Hussein Clinton call support forces change Iraq. No matter covert efforts fail miserably. The big surprise come Monday, polite-to-a-fault Al Gore use visit Malaysia Asian economic summit meeting throw U.S. support behind protesters call reformasi, code word streets Kuala Lumpur dump Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamed. He long burr Washington's side, denounce America, currency traders Jews. He recently imprison western-thinking finance minister, Anwar Ibrahim, suddenly become Asia's visible jailed dissident. But Mahathir Saddam, long shot. Gore's aides insist speech call reform, demand Mahathir step down. But interpreted way. The New Zealanders call megaphone diplomacy. The malaysian government call disgust interference internal affairs. Predictably, executives several U.S. companies flock Kuala Lumpur tell Malaysians Gore rude, assure Washington utter words need said. Whatever wisdom Gore's words, raise question take days world's powerful nation begin publicly suggest time nettlesome leader go. Because official list, real criteria get it. Some leaders mysteriously escape mention, like Kim Jong Il North Korea. President Clinton spending weekend Korean Peninsula, star across demilitarize zone dangerous state everyone suspect attempt break 1994 agreement freeze nuclear weapons projects, return billions Western energy aid. Yet Washington never call starve North Koreans revolt Kim's repressive regime. His government, take page Saddam playbook, suggest last week United States really want look mountain tunnel Pentagon believe nuclear installation making, write check another $300 million. No one even call Kim's removal when, months ago, lobbed three-stage missile Japan show knew how. The rules call end regime pretty murky, say Richard Feinberg, professor University California San Diego serve Clinton administration's first term. When really want push someone out, country part large strategic concern time. But country usually great strategic weight another matter call change leadership Beijing Moscow help kind domestic opposition point to. Clinton's call Saddam's ouster last weekend create barely ripple because, all, proven murderer avid stockpiler anthrax plutonium (even Brent Scowcroft, President George Bush's national security adviser, insist last week Saddam nowadays simply irritant, annoyance, pest problem, threat region moment). Mahathir, however, far complex case. He's prime example oppose Washington's political economic agenda interconnect world move leader list authoritarians Washington tolerate list authoritarians outlive usefulness. Like asian strongmen Ferdinand Marcos Philippines Suharto Indonesia come mind useful fear Malaysia would become communist domino. But also seem eminently tolerable long Cold War over. He never accuse enormous corruption. He turn country model competitiveness, Malaysia become exemplar big emerge markets Clinton's Commerce Department tout things go sour last year. Sure, always prickly. But terrorist killer U.S. companies flock country, say want stay iron control political discourse strong neighboring Singapore. Just summer, U.S. Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin pay ostensibly friendly, strained, visit make reference human rights. That change Ibrahim arrest beaten jail. He long advocate western-style solutions economic turmoil openness, freedom protest movement Mahathir surface jail. Gore leapt opportunity particularly striking because, case Indonesia earlier year, take administration months come conclusion President Suharto go. He went.

50,"It surprising scene three months ago Dennis Rivera, one New York City's left-leaning labor leaders, sing praises Sen. Alfonse M. D'Amato. Rivera, president large union New York City, praise D'Amato persuade Trent Lott, Senate majority leader, support legislation finance health coverage hundreds thousands uninsured children. It look Rivera's politically potent union might endorse D'Amato minimum stay neutral year's U.S. Senate race New York. But Monday, Rivera's 150,000-member union, 1199, National Health Human Service Employees union, endorse Rep. Charles E. Schumer, D-N.Y., thereby risk D'Amato's wrath. The endorsement risky, labor leaders acknowledge, anger powerful senator could make far less responsive labor's needs unions turn help future re-elected. Although may seem illogical, two words go far explain Rivera's union back Schumer: Monica Lewinsky. Largely result Lewinsky scandal, Democrats say suddenly fear Republicans gain filibuster-proof, 60-seat majority Senate, Republicans 55 seats democrats' 45. For labor leaders like Rivera, notion strong Republican majority nightmare. That fear help push New York unions Schumer's column, even though D'Amato long court them. Those unions include teamsters' joint council New York City District Council 37, umbrella group represent 120,000 municipal employees. labor leaders say fear filibuster-proof Republican majority, Senate would push anti-union legislation, like recently defeat republican proposals curb labor's political spending cut finance National Labor Relations Board. We worry legislation allow labor movement survive next century, Rivera said. Alarmed Democrats lose Senate seats California, Illinois, Wisconsin, Nevada South Carolina, Rivera's union conclude worth back Schumer. The decision, Rivera emphasize repeatedly, personal base national considerations. Unfortunately, leadership Republican Party national level person Newt Gingrich Trent Lott necessarily culture Republicans Northeast, said. They're far conservative, far anti-labor, far anti-worker, far pro-business. We fear democratic Party face irrelevance United States Senate go 41 seats. Trying avoid rupture D'Amato, Rivera praise effective senator. The endorsement could boon Schumer. Rivera's union teachers' union labor's strong political operations New York. In addition, Schumer get thousands dollars local well use renowned phone banks, make 50,000 political calls day.

His labor endorsements include New York City Patrolmen's Benevolent Association New York State Building Construction Trades Council. Besides back 1199, Schumer also receive endorsement 1199's parent union, Service Employees International Union, 350,000 members New York State. Rivera support D'Amato last time run either announced endorsements found convention New York State Council service employees union. The convention pack Town Hall, new group aims make service employees power reckon bring together dozen union locals forge common political legislative strategy.

The measure, nonbinding resolution, brought floor Rep. John Shimkus, R-Ill. He lithuanian descent, pocket Lithuanians hometown Collinsville want try highlight support Baltic states' past efforts soviet repression. Shimkus' measure example members Congress spending time stand idle wait Republican leaders reach agreement spending bills White House, thus avoid government shutdown allow go home campaign November elections. With time hands, many Republicans use House floor personal stage elicit vote topics boast folks back home. most matters little chance find way law, members hope turn advantage Election Day. There plenty items whose sponsors hope attract attention. These tend special-interest matters members hope escape scrutiny rush leave town. The sponsors measure added advantage impeachment inquiry, preoccupy Congress, news media public give cover move pet cause quietly gigantic omnibus package Congress eventually present Clinton signing. These quiet measures include one propose Mississippi's two senators, Trent Lott Thad Cochran, Republicans. They want agriculture export credits buy chickens Russia, buy chickens cannot pay them. The chickens Mississippi. Democrats little influence republican-controlled Congress. But Democrats close enough Republican leaders, Republican goals, measures take seriously. These include Rep.

House leaders allow measure bring floor way appease conservative members, believe shortchanged budget process. It pass House vote 224-200 almost chance become law. The Senate plan take up, Clinton would almost certainly veto it. But Rep. Tom Coburn, R-Okla., say votes like important put sponsors' ideological foes record oppose something sounds reasonable, opposition use Nov. 3 election. It voice mail message Dr. Marilyn Rymer, neurologist Kansas City, Mo., would routinely delete, even registered Democrat. Speaker Newt Gingrich's office, said, call discuss national leadership award. Dr. Rymer acclaim director prominent stroke-treatment center, proposition seem particularly grand. When return call, say tell would also name honorary chairman elite committee advise Gingrich legislation. Too good true? Well, Dr. Rymer would pay way committee actually meet, honorary committee chairman, discovered, would member committee compose entirely honorary chairmen. And oh, speaker want donation $500 $1,000 help efforts, accord transcript similar chat another doctor, elect big republican majority House Representatives. With approach midterm elections next month, turn National Republican Congressional Committee, support candidates House, sponsor similar calls tens thousands small-business owners, include doctors. With fund-raising programs, committee say amass $62 million elections. But campaign finance watchdogs say solicitations mark new departure political fund raising, one call akin practices market companies like Publishers' Clearing House hook consumers visions million-dollar windfalls induce subscribe magazines. By cite speaker promise celebrity influence, say, call bait-and-switch scheme seize attention people might otherwise hang up. Dr. Rymer say incensed. So Dr. Stanley Turecki, child family psychiatrist New York vote independent also called. I absolutely outraged, said. anybody else would would fall category consumer fraud. Kenneth Gross, Washington lawyer specialize election law represent democratic Republican clients, said, I never hear particular device.

He right aggressively push legislation cut taxes much half, he's also interested legislation cut capital gains single rate 15 percent. To assure passage legislation, speaker want increase Republican majority, says, adding, To help us that, speaker pull together group individuals invite honorary chairman advisory council. Nancy continues: There correspondence speaker, conference calls. It's great way get input thoughts legislation concern you. Or maybe surveys questionnaires. Later, Nancy says: As member committee, would receive speaker national leadership award, really quite honor. And honest, ask chairmen could help efforts increase majority one-time contribution $500 $1,000. now would use nationwide media campaign Newt undertaken target seats really need. And someone I'm sure would also benefit this, could I tell speaker could count help? The doctor demurs. I registered, know, Republican Kansas, tell Nancy. Probably I something would go representative. then doctor tries ascertain Nancy located. Is congressman Gingrich's office I'm talk to? doctor asks. The speaker's office, say Nancy. This speaker's office. That I'm talk to, say doctor, double-checking. uh-huh, Nancy replies. The law prohibit political fund-raising call federal offices. Vice President Al Gore Justice Department investigation fund-raising call allegedly make office 1996 presidential campaign. But call make anywhere else, include campaign offices. Harris say call way related speaker's OFFICIAL office. He added: What important call get routed. People interested award speaker's good name whether call get rout Washington Ohio. Turecki disagrees. I see basic sleaze, said. The last time George Voinovich run office, re-election Ohio's governor 72 percent vote, stun even optimistic supporters set 20th-century record victory margins Ohio politics. This year, Voinovich, Republican bar seek third term, run again, time Senate seat hold John Glenn, Democrat retiring. And expect Voinovich repeat electoral benchmark four years ago, politicians parties generally acknowledge well position increase Republican majority Senate. That prevent Voinovich's Democratic opponent, Mary Boyle, undertake vigorous campaign. Ms. Boyle, former commissioner Cuyahoga County, encompass Cleveland, crisscross nation's seventh-most populous state describes grass-roots campaign that, operate comparative shoestring, nonetheless attract side nationally know Democrats President Clinton foremost among campaign trail. Glenn, former astronaut prepare return space month age 77, make endorsement Senate race. Like many candidates year, Ms. Boyle, 55, campaign hard issue education, seek portray Voinovich, 61, lackluster steward allow state's schools decline. He promise education governor, say Ms. Boyle. But seven half years fail students state. Her role campaign, said, remind people state Ohio George Voinovich make promise deliver it. Specifically, discuss decision last year Ohio Supreme Court cite wide disparities quality state's schools rule unconstitutional formula funding them. She also attack republican opponent support proposal raise state's sales tax one percent. Under plan, half additional funds would use school improvement remainder earmark reduce property taxes. That statewide ballot initiative last May prove wildly unpopular, 80 percent voters oppose it. While topics taxes education hot ones political season Ohio, clear Ms. Boyle's emphasis help campaign. Despite narrowing opinion polls, still trail Voinovich 15 percentage points polls much 20 points others. There also sharp fund-raising disparity. Ms. Boyle, run first statewide race widespread union support, raise nearly $2 million far, far less nearly $7 million Voinovich take in. Also, Voinovich, former lieutenant governor, statewide ballots five times last 20 years thus better-known candidate. The electoral dynamics Ohio also aid Voinovich. The northern half state, history industrial, unionized cities, tradition vote largely democratic candidates, southern tier state consider conservative typically lean Republican. But Voinovich Ms. Boyle share home terrain, deprive Ms. Boyle geographic advantage often accompany democratic candidates. Indeed, boy, Voinovich deliver newspapers Boyle home working-class Collinwood section Cleveland. And Voinovich, former mayor Cleveland, develop reputation moderate Republican work well Democrats. Voinovich, campaign vigorously himself, keep full schedule official duties, assume role experienced, elect official. If I get senate, I probably know domestic policy member Senate, say interview Wednesday Canton, sandwich ribbon-cutting ceremony fund-raising reception vacuum clean museum. As mayor, I nose rubbed problems urban America fairly successful deal them. And, governor, I deal problems Medicaid, welfare education. I'm person United States president National League Cities chairman National Governors Association. To opponent's charges record education, Voinovich dismissive. I'm probably Republican United States endorse Ohio Education Association National Education Association, said, add Ms. Boyle member state Legislature period cite Supreme Court ruling. Mary Boyle vice chairman Ways Means Committee member democratic leadership years, Voinovich said. They nothing fix buildings, nothing technology urban school districts. Ms. Boyle, yet begin run campaign commercials television, say status underdog allow focused, intense. pause campaign fund-raising breakfast former democratic Sen. Bill Bradley New Jersey Wednesday, Ms. Boyle said: This marathon pretty much uphill. But now, we're last three miles. It's tough race. In cocoon loyal wealthy supporters, President Clinton say Friday must live consequences mistakes, although contended Democrats take pride achievements presidency take heart possibilities. Clinton stop apologize conduct Monica Lewinsky, take make glancing, times humble, references it, move attack Republican Congress indifferent Americans' needs. He Friday series fund-raisers. In one deft sentence, acknowledge personal pain claim credit country's economic strength, make compact appeal sympathy support appearance earlier day Cleveland. After thank gathered donors kind personal things say him, president declared, If I again, every day, I would heartbeat, see America today compare six years ago. As applause die away, Clinton continued, I want understand, too, live consequences mistakes life. He add chuckle: most us live quite public way. But nobody get life free. To music saxophone hammer dulcimer, Clinton raise $200,000 lunch private home Cleveland Democratic Senate candidate Ohio, Mary Boyle. then fly Philadelphia raise half million dollars democratic Party. By midsummer, president's aides delight persuaded condense fund-raising remarks 10 minutes policy points partisan jabbing. But troubles grow mid-term elections approached, free-form remarks become longer. In Cleveland Friday, speak 26 minutes Friday even speak almost 20 minutes. These fund-raising visits fall pattern since Clinton's videotape grand jury testimony Aug. 17. He lauded, applaud embraced hosts donors. Mr. President, friends today, say Tony George, host Cleveland event, offer refrain played similar role. But Cleveland elsewhere, protesters scatter along president's motorcade route reminders call resignation impeachment, mockery heap upon presidency. At rally president outside city hall Friday night group Teamsters chanted, two years. Clinton's motorcade route line downtown hundreds people, carry supportive condemnatory signs. After impromptu shopping trip, greet shout We love you, Clinton tell donors begin impassioned reprise Cleveland speech: I even mind protesters, that's american way. But, added, prefer minority, seem case. As rode Cleveland, Clinton pass billboard local radio station, WNCX. Lovin', touchin', squeezin', read, words superimpose cartoon president arm Ms. Lewinsky's shoulders, Washington Monument beside them. The president leave aides Friday respond directly late gusher grand jury disclosures Washington. Instead, remarks, Clinton speak pride record urgency address international economic crisis needs struggle farmers schoolchildren. As typically partisan audiences, also walk political calculation mid-term elections. Clinton say Cleveland Republicans brag privately prospects.

In election years, Reps. David Price Julia Carson would little common Democrats relatively safe seats. Price centrist represent high-tech district North Carolina 2 last 12 years, political scientist taught Duke Yale. Mrs. Carson, fairly liberal, House freshman work way politics grass roots, rear poverty. But party officials open election year high hopes recapture House begin worry democratic incumbents like Price Mrs. Carson share something else: greater-than-expected peril Election Day. As many congressional races, big variable White House scandal, inject fear uncertainty campaigns around country. other democratic incumbents republican officials cite locked contests competitive expect include Reps. Corrine Brown Florida, Vic Snyder Arkansas, Lois Capps Ellen Tauscher California, Martin Frost Texas, Melvin Watt North Carolina, John LaFalce New York Sander Levin Michigan. here North Carolina's 4th Congressional District, Price, acknowledge polls show tight race, said: This swing district sensitive tide trend. It's something think lot connection president's troubles. The efforts Price Mrs. Carson contain Lewinsky debacle opponents' attempts capitalize offer important clues suggest Clinton's problems influence conduct races around country. many Democrats straddle line seem shift bit every new scandal-related disclosure: want appear close president whose conduct embarrass them, yet, sense possibility public backlash Republicans, weighing words carefully wary hop impeachment bandwagon. And publicly Democrats express confidence scandal little impact them, campaigns prepare bad place great emphasis ever behind-the-efforts prod core constituencies vote. In reflection uncertainty Clinton scandal cast even among Republicans, challengers Price Carson districts political novices seek office first time differ strategies: Tom Roberg, computer executive Raleigh take Price, broadcast television commercial exploit scandal. Tom Roberg call Bill Clinton's resignation, narrator says. This time silent, Price. Where stand? But Indianapolis, Gary Hofmeister, conservative jeweler challenge Mrs. Carson Indiana's 10th Congressional District, take subtle approach: rather mention scandal directly, notes often Julia vote Clinton almost 100 percent time. ask much raise scandal directly, Hofmeister said: Don't murder somebody they're process commit suicide. There would danger go overboard. The best evidence discomfort Price Mrs. Carson ask separate interviews whether would want Clinton campaign districts, say would impossible late date White House schedule visit. What sudden schedule change? Both paused, squirm bit mustered answers hardly affirmative. Given president's popularity, I doubt hurt me, Mrs. Carson said. And Price? I think would good idea, said. I've never president campaign here, I want start time although eagerly welcome Erskine Bowles, president's chief staff popular native son North Carolina, stump Sunday.) Making strategy stump complicate anecdotal evidence runs counter democratic fears republican hopes. In three days campaign stop North Carolina Indianapolis, scandal rarely raise voter court candidates either party. When reporter ask it, many voters say appalled Clinton's behavior, hard time relate decision way vote congressional elections five weeks. As Hofmeister walk park lot outside gun knife show Indiana National Guard Armory Indianapolis last Sunday, Billy Derringer, 57-year-old machinist retire disability, call express outrage millions dollars spent investigate Clinton. It's pathetic spend money, say Derringer, identify independent. It gotten far. Hofmeister try best make Republicans' case. There rule law, said. Mrs. Carson say hoped Democrats swing voters alike would become fed Lewinsky inquiry issue might even help her. To end, proudly informs audiences vote make public report deliver House Kenneth Starr, Whitewater independent counsel. I one 63 members Congress vote put filth Internet, said, add Starr's inquiry cruel hoax terms fiscal responsibility accountability. The Carson campaign count voters like Timothy Daly, 38-year-old real estate executive vote republican two years ago favors Mrs. Carson. I'm pull democratic ticket I'm tire it: right side Republican Party play politics, Daly said. We'd like see go people's business. Back 4th District, Price reasons worried. He first elect House 1986 but, four-term incumbent, oust republican sweep 1994 (only win seat back two years later). In addition, district redrawn last year include large Durham section voters know well. determine midterm casualty Clinton again, Price say wag vigorous get-out-the-vote ground campaign career. Rather engage Roberg Clinton scandal, Price begin broadcast television commercial emphasize central issue: education. The congressman's advisers say intentionally produce advertisement appear decidedly nonpolitical features school children play effort break television clutter scandal. But Price campaign also weapon hold reserve, event Roberg appear rid Clinton scandal advantage: incumbent's advisers say would timid run commercials underscore earn divinity degree get doctorate political science. At coffee voters wealthy enclave Raleigh night, Roberg open remarks assert Clinton lose moral authority lead. Yet none assemble ask scandal; concern state's plans build highway near neighborhood. The last time George Voinovich run office, re-election Ohio's governor 72 percent vote, stun even optimistic supporters set 20th-century record victory margins Ohio politics. This year, Voinovich, Republican bar seek third term, run again, time Senate seat hold John Glenn, Democrat retiring. And expect Voinovich repeat electoral benchmark four years ago, politicians parties generally acknowledge well position increase Republican majority Senate. That prevent Voinovich's Democratic opponent, Mary Boyle, undertake vigorous campaign. Ms. Boyle, former commissioner Cuyahoga County, encompass Cleveland, crisscross nation's seventh-most populous state describes grass-roots campaign that, operate comparative shoestring, nonetheless attract side nationally know Democrats President Clinton foremost among campaign trail. Glenn, former astronaut prepare return space month age 77, make endorsement Senate race. Like many candidates year, Ms. Boyle, 55, campaign hard issue education, seek portray Voinovich, 61, lackluster steward allow state's schools decline. He promise education governor, say Ms. Boyle. But seven half years fail students state. Her role campaign, said, remind people state Ohio George Voinovich make promise deliver it. Specifically, discuss decision last year Ohio Supreme Court cite wide disparities quality state's schools rule unconstitutional formula funding them. She also attack republican opponent support proposal raise state's sales tax one percent. Under plan, half additional funds would use school improvement remainder earmark reduce property taxes. That statewide ballot initiative last May prove wildly unpopular, 80 percent voters oppose it. While topics taxes education hot ones political season Ohio, clear Ms. Boyle's emphasis help campaign. Despite narrowing opinion polls, still trail Voinovich 10 percentage points polls much 18 points others. There also sharp fund-raising disparity. Ms. Boyle, run first statewide race widespread union support, raise nearly $2 million far, far less nearly $7 million Voinovich take in. Also, Voinovich, former lieutenant governor, statewide ballots five times last 20 years thus better-known candidate. The electoral dynamics Ohio also aid Voinovich. The northern half state, history industrial, unionized cities, tradition vote largely democratic candidates, southern tier state consider conservative typically lean Republican. But Voinovich Ms. Boyle share home terrain, deprive Ms. Boyle geographic advantage often accompany democratic candidates. Indeed, boy, Voinovich deliver newspapers Boyle home working-class Collinwood section Cleveland. And Voinovich, former mayor Cleveland, develop reputation moderate Republican work well Democrats. Voinovich, campaign vigorously himself, keep full schedule official duties, assume role experienced, elect official. If I get senate, I probably know domestic policy member Senate, say interview Wednesday Canton, sandwich ribbon-cutting ceremony fund-raising reception vacuum clean museum. As mayor, I nose rubbed problems urban America fairly successful deal them. And, governor, I deal problems Medicaid, welfare education. I'm person United States president National League Cities chairman National Governors Association. To opponent's charges record education, Voinovich dismissive. I'm probably Republican United States endorse Ohio Education Association National Education Association, said, add Ms. Boyle member state Legislature period cite Supreme Court ruling. Mary Boyle vice chairman Ways Means Committee member democratic leadership years, Voinovich said. They nothing fix buildings, nothing technology urban school districts. Ms. Boyle, yet begin run campaign commercials television, say status underdog allow focused, intense. pause campaign fund-raising breakfast former democratic Sen. Bill Bradley New Jersey Wednesday, Ms. Boyle said: This marathon pretty much uphill. But now, we're last three miles. It's tough race. Sen. Alfonse D'Amato, New York Republican run re-election, go Manhattan's Grand Central Terminal morning accept award mass-transit advocates. But reporters gather show little interest shiny train car senator's back. Instead, repeatedly ask would vote impeachment President Clinton. Look, I'm go make comment respect subject matter, D'Amato responded. I citizen. I citizen-senator may call upon make decision. But D'Amato something else well: candidate may tightest Senate race nation. And variations elliptical response heard Senate races around country, Republicans Democrats encounter similar questions. All suggest House vote Thursday authorize impeachment inquiry, year's 34 races U.S. Senate become, beyond already were, electoral equivalent jury selection. If House vote impeach Clinton, matter go Senate, must decide two-thirds majority whether convict and, thus, remove office. As result, Monica Lewinsky matter suddenly inject new disruptive force Senate contests. Voters, even support Clinton, expect political leaders, Republican Democratic, renounce Clinton's behavior, candidates that. But impeachment another matter; poll show nation it. The danger Senate candidates impeachment real possibility, debate may move beyond president's behavior little disagreement problematic issue whether remove office. For strategists involve races, little guidance handle impeachment issue. Advisers candidates parties say interviews last week perplex worried, unsure issue gain advantage guard harm. I can't tell one go go, say Mike Russell, spokesman Republican Senatorial Campaign Committee. This surreal environment. Of 34 Senate seats play, 18 hold Democrats 16 Republicans, hold 55 seats all. Republicans would win 28 34 races produce 67 votes necessary conviction, assume vote go along party lines. only electoral catastrophe Democrats, seem almost unthinkable, could produce huge loss. Jennifer Duffy, follow Senate races Cook Political Report, nonpartisan newsletter, say far, least, none Senate candidates make explicit appeal votes base would vote presidential jury. But others wonder may change. This difficult ground measure. One central questions political year Clinton's deal Ms. Lewinsky might affect turnout. For long time, politicians assume dispirited Democrats would stay home rebuke Clinton, many Republicans November 1974, three months President Richard M. Nixon resigned. But analysts wonder partisan fight Congress last week might opposite effect among Democrats. That's problem, say Stuart Rothenberg, editor independent political newsletter Washington. It's know, politicians know, general public stand impeachment. The problem know electorate stands impeachment. And ask voters think ahead impeachment proceed cast ballots Senate race is, words Stuart Stevens, Republican consultant, double bank-shot. such strategies, said, tend work small number single-minded sophisticated voters. Against complicate backdrop, prevail thinking use impeachment issue vary race race, state state week week, depend circumstances candidates composition electorate. If Democrats try turn image Clinton dock advantage, would state democratic edge sizable numbers black voters, overwhelmingly support president. In contests like those, might well prove interest democratic candidate to, one consultant put it, sit front camera tape advertisement candidate denounces president's behavior solemnly pledge vote impeachment. Strategists parties believe kind approach could prove effective. This issue huge disconnect elites public, say Fred Yang, Democratic consultant clients Wisconsin Carolinas. That kind democratic strategy might emerge California, New York, Illinois, Wisconsin, Washington perhaps Arkansas. By contrast, Democrats South Carolina, Georgia Nevada would less likely oppose Clinton's impeachment. On side, republican consultants tell candidates stress Clinton's misdeeds stay away talk impeachment. The last thing party want turn Senate elections referendum whether Clinton force office. The White House might think overall public numbers maybe would like make referendum election, say Ed Goeas, Republican pollster work Senate races year. Republicans certainly go let happen. D'Amato respond questions Clinton language republican consultants suggest candidates. When matter come Senate, I decide facts present time, D'Amato said. It would premature suggest course action without referred. Because, indeed, may call upon act jury kind. But Schumer, member House Judiciary Committee, conduct impeachment investigation, virtually embrace issue. In live telecast hearings, say president deserve lesser punishment, censure reprimand. And Schumer plan campaign New York Monday Clinton side. Schumer's media adviser, Hank Morris, seem suggest last week impeachment grow issue. Senator D'Amato claim want share opinion people New York, Morris said. And opinion, he's New Yorker opinion. ask Schumer would raise issue television commercial, Morris responded: We talk we're go do. I rule I rule out. ","Acknowledging his mistakes, Clinton supports Democrat candidates and speaks at fundraisers.He backs Mary Boyle of Ohio in her bid for U.S. Senate.Democrat candidates try to limit the effect of the Lewinsky debacle on their campaigns.A N.Y. labor union backs Democrat Schumer to keep Republicans from gaining a 60-seat majority.Sen.

MORE italian politics long enliven baroque feuds shift alliances. And time-honored tradition may embattle government Prime Minister Romano Prodi momentary reprieve. A leader Italy's hard-line Marxist faction, know Communist Refounding Party, resign Monday protest party's decision reject government's 1999 budget imperil Prodi's slender majority Parliament. Prodi must realize majority long exists, say Armando Cossuta, chairman Communist Refounding Party, fringe group break mainstream Communists overhaul party follow collapse Soviet Union 1991. Nevertheless everything possible, last minute, save government avoid crisis. Cossuta clearly unwilling join hard-line wing party withdraw support Prodi risk brand torpedoed first leftist italian government 50 years. But leader Communist Refounding Party Parliament, Fausto Bertinotti, seem compunctions. On Friday, tell journalists worry force new elections could return right power. sometimes take one step back order take two steps forward, say shrug. Until now, however, communist rank file disagree view. When Bertinotti force Prodi offer resignation last year propose budget cuts, rank file protested, force backpedal. Prodi meet Monday President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro coalition leaders devise strategy. He expect go Parliament Wednesday open debate crisis seek enough votes budget. Without it, italian central bank unlikely cut key lend rates, something Italy must get line Germany big european neighbors introduction Jan. 1 single european currency, euro. But even gathers enough votes pass budget, Prodi could still leave without majority. After two half years office, government second-longest postwar era. But fragile center-left coalition hold together mostly Italians unite last two years effort reduce spending, inflation government borrow meet requirements membership euro plan. Once goal achieve last spring, dissension quickly revived. Prodi's backers hop enough members Communist Refounding Party break ranks follow Cossutta save coalition. If not, Prodi face two unappetizing choices. He resign seek new elections, carry risk bring opposition power. Or could seek form new majority without Communists seek alliance small center-right party Francesco Cossiga. Cossiga's party come Prodi's rescue June, hard-line leftists refuse back Prodi NATO expansion. But Prodi repeatedly say govern center-left majority elect 1996.

He may get second chance form new majority, even does, negotiations end could take days even weeks, cloud decisions urgent issues crisis Kosovo. NATO military planners prepare possible air strikes Yugoslavia expect use key air bases Italy. In weakened position, Prodi difficulty persuade Parliament approve NATO strikes. He similar problems pass 1999 budget, necessary Italy cut lending rates, requirement join single european monetary unit, euro, Jan. 1. Immediately Friday's vote 313-312, tense times raucous session, Prodi meet President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro submit resignation discus options. In coming days Scalfaro consult dozens leaders ascertain whether Prodi enough linger support try form new government. If not, president expect turn another political leader. If compromise found, Italy could plunge early elections. But parties political stripes may reluctant push things far, opinion polls suggest voters enamor center-right opposition parties govern majority. Prodi, economist, admire western allies down-to-earth leader vow tame Italy's bloat economy reckless government borrow actually live pledge. By raise taxes, lowering interest rates reduce deficit, Italy meet requirements membership euro last spring, feat year consider impossible german french economists. Prodi help healthy global economy rare consensus among industrialists, labor unions taxpayers, fear exclusion euro would condemn Italy Third World status. But fiscal discipline follow reform political system inherently fragile. There 40 parties Italy, government's efforts amend constitution introduce two-party system failed. Unless Italian political system changes, Italy condemn political instability, say Sergio Romano, former diplomat political science professor. The country need stability credibility, never happen long government hang thread. In 1996 Prodi patchwork quilt center-left factions mostly make Catholic moderates leftists. He rely fringe Marxist group, Communist Refounding Party, majority low house. And alliance, fragile beginning, finally fray break point week. The hard-line leader Communist Refounding, Fausto Bertinotti, say party would vote 1999 budget would also end 28-month-old pact center-left coalition. That position drive moderate wing communist Refounding, worry vote Prodi would open doors center-right government, split away. But 20-odd deputies defy Bertinotti enough squeeze Prodi through. I bitter, Prodi say moments defeat. even today I receive lot support. In end coup de grace deliver one own, member coalition. They treachery one single person, Sergio Mattarella, deputy Prodi's coalition, angrily tell reporters, refer Silvio Liotta, member italian Renewal Party. Foreign Minister Lamberto Dini, heads party, say Liotta would expelled. Prodi often say would govern majority center-left one elect 1996. But throughout tenure, force seek temporary alliances push major policy decisions. He struggle last try keep original majority intact. On Thursday, effort woo moderate Communists side, prime minister, staunch ally United States, warn would oppose NATO strike aim stop serbian violence Kosovo unless U.N. Security Council approve attack. Washington maintain NATO need new U.N. resolution order strike. Premier Romano Prodi say Monday would appeal directly Parliament save Italy's second-longest government since World War II, threaten collapse defection Communist ally. The address Parliament expect Wednesday, follow perhaps Friday vote confidence determine whether Prodi's 2 1/2-year-old, center-left alliance stand falls. Prodi's far-left ally, Communist Refoundation Party, provoke crisis withdraw support weekend say would vote deficit-cutting 1999 budget, key Italy's participation European common currency. Prodi say would call confidence vote lose Communists' support. I've always act coherence, Prodi say morning meeting President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro crisis. I've never change strategy I want political gymnastics. The break Prodi's government divide Refoundation. Armando Cossutta, leader moderate wing, resign party president Monday. He say party's desertion Prodi wrong dangerous, time promise follow party line. We complicate political crisis could lead early elections, Cossutta tell reporters Monday. And divisions left, would mean victory right. If crisis come confidence vote Prodi loses, would offer resignation. Once that, Scalfaro decide do. He could ask Prodi someone else form new government could call elections 2 1/2 years early, something analysts think unlikely. Working Prodi's favor fact parties think would stand gain early elections, include communist Refoundation. There speculation Prodi would reopen negotiations would win back communists' grudge support, manage past.

As commission prepares hand final report end month, South Africans examine painful traumatic exploration bloody past. With power grant amnesty many tortured, bomb maimed innocent civilians, process stage anger people nearly walk life. many whites see panel favor black liberation movements, many blacks accuse soft former state officials, especially top rank ministers. However, Villa-Vicencio appeal tolerance deal commit crimes, say potential wrongdoing exist everyone. We all, entire human race, carry us capacity evil, said. many Thursday's speakers touch figure police death squad leader Eugene de Kock, give jail terms total 200 years kill spree costs dozens lives.

Dan Stein, specialist neurobiology stress disorders, say de Kock typify many killers sides conflict sheer banality evil. many people find interviews ordinary, even likeable person, say man subordinates dub Prime Evil.

We must take initiative understand others start process reconciliation heal broken land, said, voice shake emotion. The New York Times say editorial Sunday, Nov. 1: The 3,500-page report South African Truth Reconciliation Commission, release Thursday, comprehensive unsparing examination nation's ugly past commission yet produced. Drawing commission's investigations testimony hundreds applicants amnesty 20,000 victims, report detail look crimes apartheid era, blames successive white governments vast majority. It fulfil mandate tell full truth possible, one reason every political party South Africa denounce it. Besides accuse government assassinations bombings, report criticizes Inkatha Freedom Party massacres collaboration security forces, blames African National Congress murder civilians crimes. It single former President P.W. Botha, Chief Mangosuthu Buthelezi, Inkatha leader, Winnie Mandela, among others, detailed treatment roles political crimes. One major flaw report absence section accuse F.W. de Klerk, last apartheid president, know several bombings fact keep silent. It excise de Klerk sue commission. The ANC also sued, unsuccessfully, stop publication. The lawsuits disappoint sign South Africa's political parties interested honest look past, free flow information. The controversy add widespread complaints commission help process reconciliation. This wrong. True reconciliation occur society longer paralyze past people work live together cannot base silence. No society restore health paper much pain South Africans suffered. A noisy informed debate complicity crimes apartheid era necessary, uncomfortable. The report part Truth Commission's contribution heal process. The hearings themselves, allow victims human rights violations tell stories public, help country heal open eyes many whites unpleasant truth apartheid. The amnesty process, permit many important criminals escape justice, allow families know exactly happen love ones dozens cases would likely never go trial South Africa's fragile judicial system. The process help victims scholarships necessary aid go on, although enough. No commission transform society twist South Africa's was. But Truth Commission best effort world seen, South Africa better it. The deal South Africa's Truth Reconciliation Commission offer simple enough: Confess crimes, apply amnesty go free. If come forward, prosecuted. After two years hearings apartheid-era atrocities, commission last week unveil 3,500-page report name dozens people believe elbows gore never apply amnesty. So prosecutions begin soon, right? not fast. The study barely hand President Nelson Mandela talk new amnesty deals begun. It seem nearly south Africa's political parties include rule african National Congress key officials could end dock report. Suddenly, lots talk country can't withstand round politically divisive trials, many political analysts bet agreement mutual benefit offing. Already, three major political parties call kind new amnesty, ANC closing door. ANC spokesman Thabo Masebe say premature talk general amnesty, acknowledge party discuss amnesty specifically tailored violence black South Africans blacks litter KwaZulu/Natal province bodies late '80s '90s. In choose truth commission rather nuremberg-style trial close brutal past, South Africa hop idealistic reconciliation. People would come clean receive true forgiveness. Society would able move on, wounds cleanse healed. It model watch closely around world societies wonder disentangle grudges brutal past. But give chance, hundreds South Africa's perpetrators come forward. Commission officials say frustrated lack cooperation, however exhaustive report may seem. It perhaps late, however, press more. Today's South Africa urgent new problems deal unemployment, crime, white flight, schools hospitals. so may wind settle pragmatic reconciliation one give amnesty unrepentant simply practical concern move on. In recent years, truth commissions gain popularity many places, notably Chile, Argentina El Salvador. But South Africa's big powerful, able grant amnesty subpoena witnesses suppose real test. Certainly commission force nation see gruesome details past, sob survivors stone-faced torturers tell smash genitals near suffocations. And commission's work add much knowledge happen South Africa 1960 1994. But years effect commission truly judged. Has anyone really forgiven anyone else? Will vendettas persist? No one answer. One thing seem clear, however: Four years South Africa hold first non-racial elections, grow number South Africans want do past. Raymond Louw, publisher respect weekly newsletter, Southern Africa Report, say new amnesty proposal could come February session Parliament, time remove issue next year's election campaigns. You simply can't country torn apart prosecutions, says. everybody go howl amnesty. They already are. even Archbishop Desmond Tutu, commission's chairman, deliver report, seem anticipate push new amnesty argue it. He say move would highly unfair come forward. He suggest instead two-year time limit, anyone indict would effect get amnesty. To sure, opposition proposals limit prosecutions. more dozen human rights victims advocacy groups already band together condemn proposals unconscionable. The idea Truth Commission emerge compromise long negotiations bring South Africa's peaceful transition white supremacist state non-racial democracy. During talks, white National Party government push blanket amnesty, ANC refused. In end, 250 former police officers come forward, foot soldiers. And two high National Party officials, former Law Order Minister Adriaan Vlok Police Commissioner Johan van der Merwe, confess roles order bombings. In report, commission call apartheid state primary perpetrator gross human rights violations hold high ranking former officials former President P.W. Botha, former army chief, Georg Meiring, former intelligence chief, Niel Barnard, responsible. These men, others low rank, apply amnesty For ANC, embarrass prospect possible prosecution Mandela's former wife, Winnie Madikizela-Mandela, accuse report take part number assaults abductions. lesser-known officials could face charges too. The ANC hold responsible least 76 deaths KwaZulu/Natal. The ANC's problems complicate efforts make peace largely zulu-based Inkatha Freedom Party. Virtually one party come forward ask amnesty. Yet report find Inkatha, work white government, responsible widespread slaughter KwaZulu/Natal townships around Johannesburg. Inkatha's leader, Chief Mangosuthu Buthelezi, many key party officials stand accuse foment wide range abuses. But prosecute Chief Buthelezi could lead new warfare KwaZulu. Part reluctance go forward prosecutions may result still another factor: The judicial system already overwhelm rise crime evidence apartheid era old. So spend time money? At moment, one political party oppose form new amnesty tiny influential democratic Party, liberal group involve violence. Its head, Tony Leon, say new amnesty would prove thuglike behavior, get away with. But concede lonely voice. At point, says, little enthusiasm anything close book past. A panel probe apartheid-era abuses accuse African National Congress human rights violations, include torture bomb attacks, state broadcaster say Monday. The ANC, lead struggle white rule power, previously acknowledge told expect implication right violations. The Truth Reconciliation Commission release final report 2 1-2 years investigation Thursday. The report expect place overwhelm blame era's abuse white governments brutal security services. President Nelson Mandela's office receive advance copy Monday ahead handover ceremony, retire Archbishop Desmond Tutu, chair comission, present Mandela report. South African Broadcasting Corp. radio say leaked preliminary document condemns ANC politically morally responsible gross human rights violations fall apartheid. An ANC spokesman, Thabo Masebe, say believe news report refer commission letter send advance inform us intention implicate ANC gross human rights violations. Commission officials could immediately reach comment. Justice Minister Dullah Omar tell journalists Pretoria hear news report, would comment. Former President F.W. de Klerk, meanwhile, plans ask court prevent Truth Commission report implicate cover state-sponsored terror. Obviously comply rule court, Omar said, add would regret court-ordered delay. The ANC nervous enough report request meeting commissioners earlier month. The panel refused, avoid appear embarrassed. The party say accusations likely would center plant land mines border farms, abuses military camps Angola bombings. Omar say expect report's conclusions set debate add would lay basis reconciliation. President Nelson Mandela acknowledge Saturday African National Congress violate human rights apartheid, set odds deputy president report divide much South Africa. The disagreement stem Thursday's release report Truth Reconciliation Commission horrors commit apartheid. Rather act salve aid reconciliation, report cause divisiveness, even among former comrades-in-arms fought apartheid. As expected, report call apartheid crime humanity. But also blame ANC gross human rights violations anti-apartheid struggle, say group torture suspected spies dissidents kill innocent civilians land mines bombs. Some suspected traitors kill ANC's camps abroad.

It's difficult here; I depend God, said, pray several moments decide whether talk reporter. The bombings, fiery rhetoric abortion opponents posters bloody fetuses may capture attention news media, people like Mrs. Lotempio foot soldiers abortion battle. They call street counselors come clinic whenever believe abortions performed. They pray talk women, hop change minds. Some scream profanities.

And several say cried heard Slepian's death. most protesters, include Mrs. Lotempio, among thousands people arrest 1992, height anti-abortion activity Buffalo. But Operation Rescue returns, planned, Spring Life reunion April, Mrs. Lotempio said, there. Instead, plan stay church pray, avoid militancy say find uncomfortable. Glenn Murray, lawyer Womenservices clinic, said: When people town show up, feel danger. The local people know quantity. We know local people name. Buffalo among handful hot spots abortion protesters last decade. It heavily Catholic city thousands protesters around country demonstrate two weeks 1992. They fail close abortion clinics, 500 people arrested rallies snarl traffic draw national headlines. Those rallies, well earlier protests continue sidewalk vigils, impact, people sides abortion issue say. The number clinics perform abortions Buffalo area drop one three. And Slepian's death retirement week another doctor, two doctors area abortions form significant part practices. The daily demonstrators count progress. But perch outside clinic means witness far believe murders call rescues. About 30 women day might go clinic. After eight years, Mrs. Lotempio count eight women change minds get abortions clinic. Inside clinic, protests make hard job harder, many clinic workers say. While demonstrators simply repeat rosary, protesters call patients drive parking lot behind building, walk fortresslike front. They ask questions like Do know baby looks like? be boy girl? Sometimes accuse people murder torture sin, threaten damnation. Federal law bars protesters come within 15 feet clinic entrances, lean signs walls. Some push limits, frustrate clinic workers guards. The rules protect people physical harassment, distance, turn could quiet conversations catcalls taunts.

She begin protest 1990, attend abortion protest march Albany. While veterans civic leaders devote Wednesday's national holiday honor fall soldiers, Remembrance Day become chill vigil Canadians front lines abortion-rights movement. There immediate fear, anti-abortion gunman believe large. And long-term anxiety, even country abortions legal publicly funded, women may find access diminishing. There speculation sniper's timing link Remembrance Day anti-abortion activists use day commemorate abort fetuses. Three times since 1994, sniper use time year fire home Canadian doctor performs abortion, time wound target. The attacks spread across Canada Ontario, Manitoba British Columbia. U.S. canadian investigators believe attacks link two shootings abortion-providing doctors upstate New York, include Oct. 23 slay Dr. Barnett Slepian home near Buffalo. An american anti-abortion activist, James Kopp, want question shootings. Police say know side border on, fuel uneasiness clinics hospitals throughout Canada. You must realize Canada large undefended border world, say Keith McCaskill, police inspector Winnipeg, Manitoba, spokesman investigation. many women's clinics tighten security, doctors provide abortions urge take precautions. I would suggest extremely aware day-to-day goings on, whether business day hours, say Toronto Detective Rick Stubbings. Across Canada, report obstetrician-gynecologists modify practices decide stop performing abortions. Some wear bulletproof vests hang sheets windows homes. Abortion-rights groups say doctors back down. There's great deal sadness, say Susan Fox, director clinic Edmonton, Alberta, provide abortions. But there's also feel determination deter scared actions. Marilyn Wilson, executive director canadian Abortion Rights Action League, see long-term threat fear violence may intimidate young doctors enter field. There almost doctors stop perform procedures, even current reign terror, said. But young doctors families necessarily want this. They may willing put lives risk. The abortion debate one several factors contribute shortage obstetrician-gynecologists Canada. The national society oversees speciality say 1,400 doctors field, shortfall 600, 50s 60s. The society say long hours limits fees pay public health-care system cause burnout deter medical school graduates choose specialty. Another problem Canadian medical schools offer train abortion. Women Canada's big cities generally adequate access abortions. Those rural areas often face long journeys, province Prince Edward Island prohibit abortions six hospitals, force women travel New Brunswick Nova Scotia. Abortion-rights groups say situation would improve RU-486 abortion pill available Canada. No drug company apply permission market pill, either fear boycott doubt profitability. The government urge make public appeal drug companies, health department say can't done. It would conflict interest, say Bonnie Fox-McIntyre, department spokeswoman. As regulator stay arm's length, judge application impartially. Abortion illegal Canada 1988. now abortion law sort, 100,000 abortions perform annually, polls indicate roughly three-quarters Canadians favor pro-choice policies. Yet public support spare doctors fear. Dr. Henry Morgentaler, lead efforts overturn old abortion law whose Toronto clinic bomb 1993, say colleagues sacrifice personal freedom reluctantly increase security measures. Unfortunately, doctors commit provide services accept certain diminishment enjoyment life, said. In aftermath last month's deadly sniper attack obstetrician upstate New York, Attorney General Janet Reno announce last week set new investigative unit examine possibility doctor victim broad anti-abortion plot. The unit, National Clinic Violence Task Force, include dozen Justice Department lawyers involve several law-enforcement agencies. But main work look shoot Dr. Barnett Slepian suburban Buffalo home fits large pattern organize violence do FBI, jurisdiction domestic terrorism. For many FBI, that's problem. In contrast old image gung-ho FBI agents turn surveillance machinery political groups, number senior FBI agents privately express misgivings attorney general's late task force, second order begin broad investigation conspiracy involve anti-abortion violence. FBI officials fear expand investigation could drive agency ill-defined boundary separates inquiries criminal activity political causes unpopular ideas. Today's agents eager disassociate old J. Edgar Hoover days trample civil rights political dissidents guise serious investigations. They want agency drawn middle bitter ideological war anti-abortion groups abortion rights advocates, long assert existence organize campaign clinics doctors. many call government help subject fbi interest anti-war civil rights activists. Senior agency officials, include Director Louis Freeh, start careers early 1970s watch dismay FBI shake revelations Cointelpro, counterintelligence program allow agents spy on, burgle, wiretap infiltrate anti-war civil rights groups like Students democratic Society Student Nonviolence Coordinating Committee. Some officials dubious conspiracy exists kill doctors perform abortions. They come empty hand Reno order first federal inquiry 1994 kill Florida doctor bodyguard. The Justice Department conduct two-year grand jury investigation; agents pursue anti-abortion activists use surveillance teams. But investigators never find specific plot abortion clinics staff members. Violence abortion clinics part problem. The FBI recent years find thrown minefield politically tinged cases involve volatile worlds anti-government militias, environmental Christian extremists, white separatists, animal rights activists Islamic fundamentalists. The FBI quick jump investigate crime investigate political association, say David Cole, law professor Georgetown University. When move investigate crimes investigate groups, all-important nexus criminal conduct get lost, focus get broad broad start sweep kinds lawful political activity. In response terrorist attacks like bombings World Trade Center 1993, Oklahoma City federal building 1995 Olympic park Atlanta 1996, agency increase efforts deter incidents major prevention program. In cases, Justice Department, FBI law enforcement agencies say operate domestic security guidelines require investigators find reasonable indication group plan break law open inquiry organization. Before authorities use intrusive tactics wiretapping property searches, must specific evidence. Yet FBI agents throughout country quietly evaluate threat pose variety extremist groups link local authorities informal interviews leaders groups. Their conclusion groups pose little real danger. much difficult investigate lone terrorists inflame oratory extremist ideology belong group, drift along society's fray margins, grid, agents describe it, without usual ties family, friends work. The profile fit Eric Robert Rudolph, fugitive want bombings Atlanta Olympics, gay nightclub two abortion clinics. He keep beliefs mostly himself, although acquaintances hint familiar religious extremism hate groups. In contrast, James Charles Kopp, seek material witness kill Slepian, leave trail clues motives. He early follower Randall Terry, leader Operation Rescue. Later, Kopp associate Lambs Christ, another militant anti-abortion group. One law-enforcement official say government best. We investigate violations, said. We investigate groups. Everyone know Dr. Barnett Slepian know slight, gray physician endure measure stress would exhaust, even break, people. There strangers paw garbage cans home growl murderer pass grocery store aisle. Demonstrators assail pregnant patients arrive office checkups, call baby killer. Outside clinic perform abortions two days week, pickets shout epithets like pig face. Slepian, obstetrician gynecologist train abortion doctor principle, rarely acknowledge strain. He might crack occasional joke expense protesters shadow work weekends. then would something unexpected, like invite anti-abortion leader breakfast stop chat familiar demonstrator outside clinic. so kill Oct. 23 sniper's bullet fire kitchen window home Buffalo, N.Y., suburbs, furtive execution fit pattern four early attacks abortion providers western New York state Canada, friends relatives wonder much Slepian's work could arouse murderous violence. He predict much himself. Instead, wondered, again, persist work, long Buffalo doctors surrender pressure abortion opponents. He incredibly fatalistic person think number's up, up, nothing it, say H. Amanda Robb, doctor's 32-year-old niece. And incredibly stubborn. He say women right comprehensive health care since women's doctor, go provide them. slepian third doctor kill last five years bombings shootings kill 7 people wound 17 abortion clinics around nation. To tormentors, simply abortion doctor. To members abortion rights movement, martyr cause. But Slepian far either. In interviews friends family members, emerge one-dimensional abstract conservative advocate old-fashioned values like self-reliance, shy man rare flashes anger, doctor perform abortions patience women multiple abortions women multiple children want could support. He kill perform medical procedure become emotional politicized. Yet nothing life suggest crusader either politics medicine. Rather, obstinate, unassuming man remarkable thing. Out contrariness conscience, say knew him, refuse allow anyone dictate kind doctor be, that, pay life. The clues Slepian's flinty brand commitment lie, part, upbringing. His family take success grant even teeter edge poverty. To earn money medical school, shovel muck ranch drove taxi. He make friends, friends life. When wives sick, call repeatedly. When lonely, fly side. Slepian, know Bart, use tell people choose obstetrics specialty expose doctor least suffering, perform abortions legal alternatives much worse. slepian often express exasperation women come abortion abortion. Don't get it? clinic staff recall say once. He impatience women like remembered residency inner-city Buffalo, child child mean support. He contempt somebody pull bootstraps make world, Ms. Robb said. He believe ban abortions or, shameful view, stop teaching young doctors perform them, would correct human imperfections find irritating. There 1.5 million abortions perform country, niece said, felt we're equip handle 1.5 million unwanted children. When killed, age 52, Bart Slepian own impose red brick home quiet suburb Amherst, complete swim pool piped-in music assortment time-saving gadgets adored. Slepian's trajectory comfortable doctor's life unconventional. His grandfather, russian Jewish immigrant start sell shoelaces pushcart Boston, propel five sons Harvard time Jews meet university's blue-blood standards. His father, turn, decree three sons would doctor earn Ph.D's. We grow home tremendous, tremendous, tremendous respect education, say Serena Robb, Slepian's sister, four years old him. If get A, OK If get B, get yell at. The family's mean match expectations. Slepian's father, Philip, join father's business manufacture leather soles shoes. Soon Bart born 1946 Boston, company failed, save money, father move family six in-laws' apartment McKeesport, Pa., Rochester, N.Y. Once settled, Slepian's father set freelance writer, crisscross country old Studebaker, researching origins prominent citizens Library Congress write stories small-town newspapers. He sell articles hundreds, still write death nine years ago age 93. The success expect Bart Slepian come easily. As child, shy cry anyone look him, sister recalled. An unexceptional student, go local community college transfer University Denver, major zoology. Rejected medical schools United States fate two three applicants late 1960s study one year Belgium enrol Autonomous University Medicine Guadalajara, Mexico. His friends remember funny obstinate, thin young man glass recede hairline beat comers arm-wrestling pool. Bart certain beliefs, strongly held, say Richard Schwarz, old classmate internist Long Island. He always say sit around whine things, Schwarz said. He would say, `Go what's what's right.' Bart Slepian's determination surface quirky ways. He insist go top World Trade Center, despite cripple fear heights. To get window, crawled, inch inch. I said, `you this,' recall Schwarz, time. And said, `I want it.' Bart make count. He felt alive. Forced drop school every semesters work, live Reno sister Serena, widow struggle take care two young daughters. She work waitress blackjack dealer, share tips drive cab, clean barns ranch work laboratory assistant local Veterans Administration hospital. After graduation, move Buffalo medical residency. There married Lynne Breitbart, register nurse 10 years junior, scrap together money buy obstetrics practice doctor retire. He soothing, unhurried manner. When patient his, Patti Durlak, diagnose diabetes, slepian refer specialist call every days months help overcome fear needles use insulin injections. The doctor said, `just deal it,' Mrs. Durlak recalled. not Dr. Slepian. In ways, typical suburban family man, work six days week spending free time Little League games county fairs four sons. But late 1980s, abortion doctors Buffalo siege. In one notorious 1991 incident record videotape, Rev. Paul Schenck, one fieriest Buffalo's anti-abortion leaders, throw front doctor's car pull clinic driveway. Slepian park street. As pushed way crowd chant demonstrators, Schenck cup hands around mouth lunged, shouting, Slepian, pig! Slepian's attempt separate abortion conflict private life futile. The protests follow home man bashful boy find himself, uncomfortably, center controversy attention. Once, show anger. In 1988, demonstrators jeer sidewalk front home open Hanukkah presents children, doctor come brandish baseball bat. He deny hurt anyone, town judge order repair one protester's smash van window pay portion another's medical bills. The outburst surprise family friends. It Slepian's style make public fuss, much less acknowledge stress taunt protesters. Stress? old brother Paul respond gruffly ask doctor's mood. I never hear word use family, except engineering term. He say nuisance. Mrs. Slepian respond requests interview. She express rage The Buffalo News shortly shooting. She say whoever kill husband deserve death penalty would happy administer lethal injection herself. She also speak Schenck's brother, Robert, another anti-abortion leader frequently confront Slepian, send bouquet flowers. Mrs. Slepian denounce hypocrite. After confrontation 1988, slepian turn civil harassment lawsuits, letters levity deal protesters. In 1993, man active anti-abortion effort arrest rifle doctor's garbage cans home, slepian tried treat incident lightly. They hopefully get bags full dirty diapers, joked. He try engage critics local newspaper. He tell The Buffalo News abortion protesters turn energies help women avoid unwanted pregnancies birth control counseling. In letter editor warn repeatedly call murderer, critics incite violence. Slepian accept opponents abortion act moral conviction, friends said, resent personal attacks. He think tended demonize dehumanize increase danger, say lawyer, Glenn Edward Murray. So slepian take step nation's beleaguer abortion clinic doctors dared. He insist tried hard enough, might cut venom. To dismay staff members fear safety, Slepian begin year ago stop chat protesters recognize outside Womenservices abortion clinic Buffalo, work two days week. He surprise gather protesters prepare euphemistically call house call, demonstration doctor's home, invite protest's organizer, Rev. Robert Behn, breakfast. Their hourlong conversation next morning inconclusive, Behn said, dismiss Slepian's gesture attempt get people like him. He ask slepian performing abortions affect spiritually. In response, recalled, doctor said, I'm fine spiritually. Slepian, meanwhile, focus time away home family. He plan take cruise next spring. He buy time-share apartment near Disney World Florida. He many plans, say Ellen Fink, close friend couple 15 years. He done. He do live yet. Still, sometimes casual conversations, shadow would appear. When wife give gray african parrot birthday gift, Slepian joke bird would probably outlive would teach eulogy. He would talk funeral wanted, Mrs. Fink said. He say lot friends want come separate cars, one car, he'd long procession. In week death, slepian reasons preoccupy thoughts mortality. A medical checkup reveal blockage heart, Mrs. Fink said, recount conversation Mrs. Slepian day slaying. A blockage sign probable coronary artery disease. He test follow week. I said, `lynne, relax, go OK,' Mrs. Fink recalled. That day, National Abortion Federation send fax Womenservices clinic warn pattern sniper attacks abortion doctors occur early November. Marilynne Buckham, clinic director, send Slepian. He definitely take seriously, recalled. Typically, doctor share concerns might felt. It normal day, say Tammi Latini, office assistant. We horse around.' That evening, Slepians go synagogue mark ninth anniversary death Slepian's father. shortly return home, sniper's bullet smash kitchen window, kill slepian chat wife sons. The protesters return clinic five days later, first day reopened. Mrs. Buckham, director, say Slepian would surprised. They routine. so he. He never want day end bad note, said. At end day, I would always say, `Thank coming.' And would always turn stupid grin say, `Thanks me.' The slaying Dr. Barnett Slepian home last week eliminate mainstay abortion clinic here, eliminate women's access abortion. That availability abortion Buffalo area, much United States, complex reality, one affected class education, medical training personal convictions individual doctors. Knowledgeable middle-class affluent women find unwanted pregnancy usually obtain abortion private gynecologists, gynecologist personal objection procedure, referral colleague. Women poor, young uneducated regular relationships doctors rely specialized clinics like one slepian work in, hospitals. It group unplanned pregnancies far common prosperous women face shrink universe possibilities result fear set Slepian's kill slayings five doctors clinic workers since 1993, medical experts said. If well well connected, get abortion, say Dr. Stephen Wear, co-director center clinical ethics University Buffalo, train doctors Buffalo area's hospitals. For everybody else, less less available. The number abortions United States decline steadily since first years Supreme Court's Roe vs. Wade decision legalize abortion 1973, accord Alan Guttmacher Institute, studies reproductive issues. They number roughly 1.5 million year, accord reports Guttmacher, 1.4 million, accord National Right Life Committee, nation's large anti-abortion group, calculates estimate partly Guttmacher figures. The number providers identify perform abortions part practice diminish well. A 1994 Guttmacher study, last one published, find number decrease 18 percent 1982 1992, 2,380 2,908. Moreover, study said, 12 percent nation's residency programs routinely offer train abortions first trimester, though many offer elective courses. Laura Echevarria, director media relations National Right Life Committee, contends, however, teach hospitals train gynecologists procedures treat miscarriages similar use perform abortions. only cosmopolitan comparatively liberal cities like New York availability abortions continue steady level, experts say, though even locales concern decrease number young doctors emerge residencies fully train perform abortions. The Guttmacher Institute, keep nation's precise statistics, say 1992, last year figures, 142,410 abortions New York do 151 providers, include 61 hospitals 44 clinics. Still, provider figure greatly understate number private doctors perform offices, medical experts say. many obstetricians gynecologists Manhattan provide abortions part palette services, many years, say Dr. Richard Hausknecht, medical director plan Parenthood. Rich middle-class women always access abortions, always will. The major threat availability city less result anti-abortion violence medical training. The bottom line we're face impending shortage physicians adequately train willing procedures, say Dr. John Choate, chairman New York State division American College Obstetricians Gynecologists. But lack train programs also result political pressures hospitals universities antagonists abortion climate fear. Physicians tend lie low, Choate said. They publicize fact them. If them, quietly fear practice lives. One development horizon expect change outlook abortions substantially final federal approval, expect next year, RU-486 pill, drug end early pregnancy without need surgery.

As devote opponent abortion, 43-year-old mother nine regularly play host series travel speakers, priests protesters many come Rochester intent upon spread word abortion shut clinics provide it. She one thousands people across country loosely associate anti-abortion groups like Lambs Christ open homes Lambs' founder, Rev. Norman Weslin, itinerant demonstrators. While many include Mrs. Hayes disavow violent tactics, supporters abortion rights say people like bear responsibility protesters help blockade clinics threaten doctors. These people provide Father Weslin food shelter come town close clinics innocent, say Ann Glazier, director clinic defense plan Parenthood Federation. It's credible say part extremist activity take place clinics. They still guilty interfere women's access. But Mary Quinn, local organizer Lambs Christ also offer home protesters, see matters differ light. take people like act Christian charity, Mrs. Quinn said. `people travel around country work take us want lose stupid houses. We take people willing make sacrifice. Members Lambs Christ persistent figures protests Buffalo women's clinic Dr. Barnett Slepian work shot death last month. Although suspect identify shoot several similar attacks New York Canada past several years, officials look question Vermont man whose car see near Dr. Slepian's home. That man, James Charles Kopp, participate abortion protests decade, often house guest members Lambs Christ. While Mrs. Hayes say would never much obstruct clinic's door, give refuge qualms so. weslin, leader Lambs Christ, one benefit Mrs. Hayes' hospitality, modern version generosity Christ Apostles know well. He pride arrest 60 times protests front medical clinics. And throughout 1980s early '90s, active clinic rescues, protesters try physically restrain patients try enter clinics.

And horrible tragedy doctor's death become face movement. We're save lives, said. The FBI talk Mrs. Hayes, Kenny say agents speak him. The Justice Department say Federal task force set week investigate kill slepian look evidence connect anti-abortion violence various clinics.

","Dr. Barnett Slepian, the mainstay of Buffalo's only abortion clinic, was slain as he stood at his kitchen window.Slepian has been described as a fatalist who stubbornly adhered to doing what he thought right.The FBI is looking for James Kopp for questioning as a material witness in the slaying.Kopp has long been identified as a major voice in the anti-abortion movement.Attorney General Reno will investigate if the slaying is part of a nation-wide plot.In Canada, authorities are worried that new violence could erupt as Remembrance Day approaches.Anti-abortion pamphlets have been delivered to a Canadian newspaper, possibly by Kopp.","On Oct. 23, 1998, a sniper killed Dr. Barnet Slepian, a mainstay in the last abortion clinic in the Buffalo area and one of only a few doctors performing the procedure in the face of protesters and threats.Many of the protesters are itinerants like Rev. Norman Weslin, founder of the anti-abortion group Lambs of Christ, who travel about spreading their message and shutting down clinics.Another itinerant demonstrator, James Charles Kopp, is wanted by the FBI as a material witness in the Slepian murder.In addition to anti-abortion violence, a shortage of doctors who are trained and willing to do the procedures imperil their widespread availability.","The primary doctor at the last abortion clinic in Buffalo, NY, was shot and killed.Dr. Slepian, a stubborn man, dedicated to women's care, and an unlikely martyr.It's the 7th such death, and the 4th similar attack.James Kopp is sought as a material witness.The anti-abortion movement has local and itinerate members.Their activities go from prayers and talking to confrontations, threats and violence.After this killing, the FBI resumed a search for an anti-abortion conspiracy.Since the first few years after Roe v Wade, the number of abortions has declined, as has the number of clinics and doctors providing the procedure, especially for poorer women.","Abortion clinics continue to be targeted by anti-abortion groups such as Operation Rescue, Lambs of Christ, and Army of God.Opposition ranges from silent vigils to vocal and physical intimidation, and even murder.Dr. Bart Shepian of Buffalo's only abortion clinic was murdered in his home.Police in the US and Canada are looking for James Kopp, a known abortion opponent, as a material witness in that murder.The clinics serve poor, young, and uneducated women since the well-to-do use their established providers.AG Janet Reno has named a task force to find out if the Slepian murder, the third in five years, is part of an organized campaign of violence."

The best thing making World Series know go anywhere else that. You've make point go best do. That's about. As Bernie Williams starts could final series Yankees Game 1 World Series Yankee Stadium Saturday night, want free mind. free worry extremely uncertain future undisclosed personal matter make post-season perplexing pleasing. But easy keep mind uncluttered. Williams know sign Yankees return center field next season, want test free agency. There good chance Yankees offer lavish contract, Williams might force decide fat paycheck new situation baseball city choice pretty fat paycheck familiar situation Bronx. Scott Boras, Williams' agent, compare client players $10 million-a-year bracket last season, price tag surely escalate williams American League bat title .339 average drilling 26 homers knock 97 runs. Williams ask agreed theory teams outbid Yankees. I know, say Williams, aloof post-season, decline discuss why. And I'm think little I would like to. I would like keep focus series. It issue Williams Yankees want study Saturday come days, team four victories away championship. Still, issue hovers yankees ominously owner George Steinbrenner hover general manager Brian Cashman. It's tough thing, Cashman say balance excitement World Series reality try re-sign Williams. You know ugliness future right front you. Although Williams adamant discuss future, relent slightly Friday. When reporter ask reasons would stay Yankees, Williams' answer include escape clause. Just fact I've whole career, Williams said. That lot it. The relationships I've come know years, I think would hard, impossible, start scratch somewhere else. Williams continued: But I think reality game day age things happen. You can't really write things stone they're go happen. People get traded. People become free agents go teams. I make decision really think people I'm accountable for. When Williams ask good situation could player center fielder Yankees, win bat crown World Series, 30-year-old stumped. Wow, that's pretty good right there, Williams said. It's funny mention that, I really think that. I think, point season, I go sit think, wow, bad year all. While Cashman would discuss financial matters, another Yankee official say team offer Williams much $12 million year unless Steinbrenner get generous possible championship. It likely Yanks would offer Williams $10 million-a-year range. I'd hate speculate something point, Cashman said. We'll give best effort sign level we're comfortable with. Hopefully, enough. then we'll marriage. If not, we'll divorce. While Williams earn right become free agent pursue contract want city wants, interesting choices make. When reporter ask Williams would respond someone suggest accept less yankees remain city popular, like teammates manager, team post-season four straight years, hesitate answer. My response would time right start think that, Williams said. If I start think that, it'll distract I need World Series. Williams talk Yankees end remarkable season want situation disrupt that. But, Williams' status uncertain, ask next four seven games would bittersweet, since could end 13-year association Yankees. I want talk that, Williams said. I'm go lot fun there. I'm go go out. then Williams walk away interview. The New York Times say editorial Saturday, Oct. 17: It fit memorable baseball seasons conclude World Series open Saturday night Yankee Stadium, age still grand cathedral sport. bedeck bunt banners, revere ballpark always elevate game aura history accomplishment. That make perfect venue part championship series determine whether 1998 yankees one great teams modern era, talented squad own regular season fold World Series. New Yorkers boisterous, boastful bunch, patter city week loud arrogant, must seem anyone venture San Diego root Padres. The word sidewalks subways Padres measure Yankees. Sure, lethal start pitchers Kevin Brown Andy Ashby, one game's best closers Trevor Hoffman, mention prolific hitters like Tony Gwynn Greg Vaughn, hobble still dangerous. But match Yankees' World Series start rotation David Wells, Orlando Hernandez, David Cone Andy Pettitte, bullpen flamethrower Mariano Rivera, plus deep batting order baseball? Yet truth Yankees fans terrify team crumple. Baseball fans, even Yankee fans, spend lifetime wait see home team historic caliber, Yankee team reach sanctify status unless end record-setting season win World Series. The doubts keep creep up. The team pitiful plate playoffs. Tino Martinez, top run producer, numb slump. Bernie Williams, American League bat champ, hit well pennant series Cleveland Indians, seem distracted personal matters. Shane Spencer, rookie slug sensation September, turn new Mr. October. Pettitte struggle since August. The curious thing team, games regular season team American League history, quiet unobtrusive be. It sports dominant superstar, swaggering clubhouse leader, one seem belong New York. So Yankees start drift field, fans tend fear team might simply fade away. Until Indians surge temporarily ahead playoffs, Yankees face serious test resiliency season. New Yorkers already taste ticker-tape parade Broadway. But behind every mighty cheer stadium Saturday night lurk fear curtain fall season, unheralded unlegendary team San Diego one remembered. The last time see field Yankee Stadium, inadvertently influence outcome game send Cleveland Indians home Yankees World Series. That's say umpires mess World Series, show eminently capable interfere natural progression postseason games. All right, Ted Hendry World Series; umpires' collective bargaining agreement league allow umpire work league championship series World Series. Joe Brinkman either, even though agreement allow umpire work division series World Series. The three American League umpire six-man World Series crew work first round playoffs. One them, Richie Garcia, crew chief behind plate Saturday night's opener Yankee Stadium. Gene Budig, AL president, Friday call Garcia, 24-year veteran, one league's respect umpires. But Saturday night, Garcia move right field Sunday night Game 2. now combination sound familiar, Richie Garcia right field? Ah yes, last time Garcia work post-season series Yankee Stadium, umpire Game 1 league championship series two years ago young fan New Jersey name, please; over-glorified enough reached fence catch Derek Jeter's fly ball Tony Tarasco, Baltimore's right fielder, prepare catch it. Garcia rule interference, home run, say oops watch television replay clearly show interference. Too late. The call help Yankees win first game set tone series. even though make mistake, know best there, baseball official, speak condition anonymity, said. That knowledge come small consolation Orioles. Budig, too, acknowledge umpires, like players managers, perfect. Major league umpires skilled do, human, say telephone interview. Day day good job Major League Baseball. Rounds one two difficult, happens time time. The umpires human American League playoffs happen time time time time. The Cleveland Indians suffer brunt fallibility umpires. We highlight reel umpires get knock baseballs, general manager John Hart say Indians' final game Yankees. The umpires lose game us, share controversies two playoff series umpires. In division series Boston, Brinkman, plate umpire, bad calls pitches plays plate immediately provoke disputes lead eject Mike Hargrove, Indians' manager, three pitches game 2, Dwight Gooden, start pitcher, 19 pitches later. Hendry right wrong, depend one's point view, noncall interference Travis Fryman 12th inning Game 2 ALCS. That rule go favor Indians. Little else did. In Game 4, Jeter steal second fifth inning on-target throw Sandy Alomar Jr. hit Jim McKean, jump try get way instead kick ball right field. A bat ball, Omar Vizquel's line drive, strike Hendry Game 6. But bad call Game 6 Hendry's force play second base. Hendry call Bernie Williams safe, rule Vizquel's foot come base caught ball. Members Yankees indicate Friday they, too, think call wrong. I know, Williams say ask thought, I'll take it. It big play. But think out? I'd rather comment that, said. It stir lot controversy. I want get that. When player believe safe, say worry subsequent controversy. If Williams imply think out, another member Yankees say doubt Williams out. I sure first, uniformed member team said, I saw Hendry, I say uh-oh. I also think Omar smooth think come bag. then I saw replay. He out. The game today faster use be, observer said. The umpires sharper. maybe Garcia, Dale Scott Tim Tschida American League, Jerry Crawford, Dana DeMuth Mark Hirschbeck National League, sharp 18th century French guillotine four seven games. Leonard Coleman, NL president, say thought umpires first-rate division league series add three splendid umpires work World Series. Budig said: The World Series crew proven first-rate. We total confidence them. The umpires let players make errors managers bad decisions. then everyone talk players managers umpires. A strong sign city go bonkers Padres come Friday morning 680 fans agree shave heads radio promotion raffle return 1-in-680 chance skybox tickets post-season play. This show support team one ticket, say Tommy Sablan, producer Jeff Jer show. It symbolic efforts bald padres Tony Gwynn, Wally Joyner, Greg Vaughn, Jim Leyritz. About thousand people show men, women children. We 10 barbers 20 hairdressers take six hours lines either get buzzed straight-razored. We shock turnout. But bandwagon town. `buy ticket day concert' type public. You'll see even big bandwagon Monday they've hopefully play Yankees real World Series. After Padres beat Braves, 3-0, Game 2 National League Championship Series Thursday night Atlanta take two-game lead four-of-seven-game series, San Diego fans begin gear shot World Series traditional ways. It would team's first World Series appearance since 1984, downtown business district Friday, marquees banners read Go Padres lunch-hour rally attend several hundred fans. The Padres set attendance record 2,555,901 season, half-million last year nearly million half three years ago. It stem part effort John Moores, Padres owner, Larry Lucchino, team's president, put family entertainment park buy team December 1994. This diversified group fans I saw Atlanta, Lucchino said. Their crowd seem yuppified. We're proud three generations families come games. Donna McMahon, 63-year-old homemaker La Jolla, fan since 10 Pacific Coast League Padres play Lane Field near harbor. She would take streetcar school meet father, would buy bleacher seats. Later, bring four children Jack Murphy Stadium National League padres 2,500 people crowd. Now, bring grandchildren sold-out Qualcomm Stadium. There different groups stands, said, upper class, middle class, business person, beer-drinking fan, children, Mexican fans across border. We true fans us. San Diego Mayor Susan Golding agrees, also give credit balmy weather. Padre fans cross-section county, said. Downtown, suburban, rural, east, north, ranchers farmers high-tech engineers, yuppies new kids x generation. A lot across border. The Padres extremely popular Tijuana. We perfect weather long baseball season. Playing World Series October get well New York. Carlos Carrion, bear San Diego baseball fan 25 years, brings 10- 8-year-old sons stadium. This great chance let children see players work, Carrion said. They look guys understand character work ethic. The Padres ticket office estimate average, 15,000 fans 65,000-seat stadium Latin Americans San Diego, Baja California state sonora. The Padres first major league baseball souvenir store Tijuana. A new shipment bats arrive Tino Martinez Friday, massage handles make sure thin enough, knock barrels listen certain sound swing slowly again. Martinez excite fresh bats, react like Little Leaguer wield aluminum bat first time. You save World Series trees now, right? Martinez say representative bat company. These World Series trees, they? Martinez could joke bats specially design World Series Yankees begin quest second title past three years play host San Diego Padres Game 1 Yankee Stadium Saturday night. Major leaguer players watch television could imitate David Letterman joke World Series wood. Even though Martinez struggle numerous bats post-season, could joke Yankees still alive title. Martinez still alive. For now, Martinez, power hitter mostly miss action, could joke around. For now. You always get fresh start post-season game game, say Martinez. If win, get another game next day forget bad at-bats. It's easy post-season next at-bat could big at-bat season. Normally, Martinez plate big at-bat season would please sight Yankees. But calendar flips October. Martinez experience another frustrating post-season. He 5 30 10 strikeouts, homers 1 run bat hitting-starved team bat .229 still win 7 9 post-season games superior pitching. Can Yankees continue win Martinez, valuable run producer, sometime single hitter? We've gotten two good series, say Paul O'Neill. The Yankees series. You focus one guy. You focus winning. The whole team won. As much Joe Torre talk Martinez need one line-drive hit get groove, 30-year-old first baseman career drought post-season. Since join Yankees, Martinez 20 107 (.187) one homer 4 RBI 29 post-season games. Those puny statistics, especially player driven 381 runs 455 regular season games last three years. I would guess Tino would great series, O'Neill said. Baseball way even things out. You bad series, come back great series. In season, that's easy do. In post-season, get tougher. It cannot get much tough Martinez, drop fifth sixth order American League Championship Series Cleveland Indians remain spot notice. Martinez blame paucity production impatience try much. He sometimes flail poor pitches hitter's counts 3-1 2-0, instead work count, admit previous failures post-season caused pursue obviously unattainable five-run homer. Actually, Martinez already make alterations, reach base 7 times last 10 plates appearances double, single, hit-by-pitch 4 walks. It enough pacify George Steinbrenner, something cling to. Until last night, anyway, Martinez face Kevin Brown, nasty right-hander retire 30 34 career at-bats. If I get good pitches miss them, I'd say I bad swing working, say Martinez. But I've swing bad pitches. Right now, I've get patient wait. The Yankees wait him. They to. In 1996 World Series, Torre start Cecil Fielder Martinez first game 3, 4 5. It difficult decision Martinez pace team RBI Fielder join Yankees July 31. But Yankees grab three games worked. Torre attractive replacement season Luis Sojo. So Yankees stay Martinez, good worse, tries stay positive finally produce. It's World Series, say Martinez. You get go fun it. Big games big games. You want go enjoy game try best win game. You think might lose day. Chuck Knoblauch Tino Martinez popular squeegee men week ago, speculation rampant one might exile Yankees' historic year crumble post-season. Two big hits midst big inning change Saturday night Game 1 World Series. The Yankees trail San Diego, 5-2, seventh inning, Knoblauch hit three-run home run tie score, five batters later, Martinez smash grand slam. The seven-run explosion rocket Yankees 9-6 victory opener four-of-seven-game series, 56,712 Yankee Stadium. Orlando Hernandez pitch Andy Ashby Game 2 Sunday night Stadium. Beyond seize advantage series, Yankees able neutralize Padres' ace, Kevin Brown, drive mound seventh. Brown, see many San Diego's best hope World Series upset, pitch Game 4, earliest. Brown pitch three-run lead top fifth, Tony Gwynn Greg Vaughn bang back-to-back homers. One seventh, however, Jorge Posada hit single, Brown walk Ricky Ledee. Brown, thrown whop 64 pitches first three innings, go out, reliever Donne Wall come face Knoblauch. This yankees do season, force starter game middle innings, exploit middle reliever. Knoblauch, course, earn notoriety gaffe Game 2 American League Championship Series Cleveland, stand wait interference call ball roll stop behind decisive run scored. The Yankees come back win series, however; Knoblauch get reprieve talk much experience help him. face Wall one-ball, no-strike count, Knoblauch duck runaway fastball. Two balls, strikes. Wall throw strike, Knoblauch swung hard lift high fly left-field line. Off bat, look like much. But keep carrying, Vaughn drift back leave look up, see ball disappear stands. Tie game. Yankee Stadium shook. Knoblauch round bases, cross home plate thrust arms air, yell crowd, like hype Olympic weightlifter successfully hoist half-ton. He stomp around dugout, helmet on, teammates bang happily. When Derek Jeter singled, nobody really noticed. Wall leave game, Mark Langston take over. Paul O'Neill flied out, Jeter advance wild pitch, Bernie Williams intentionally walked. Chili Davis draw walk. Bases loaded, more, Martinez come plate, exactly one run bat in first 76 career at-bats league championship World Series games. With count two balls two strikes, Langston throw pitch near outside corner think strike. Instead, Garcia call ball. Langston glared, snap return throw. Langston Martinez everyone field understood bases load 3-2 count, Langston would throw players refer cookie tasty pitch middle. Martinez ate cookie. The ball soar upper deck right field, lift three years post-season misery back Yankees' first baseman, grand slam. The crowd call Martinez dugout again. Like Knoblauch, Martinez pump arms, later crowd would chant name, Martinez would wave cap. San Diego's lead long gone. The Yankees take 2-0 lead Brown second inning, force throw 32 pitches second. They load bases single two walks, Ledee, rookie leave fielder play none Torre's leave fielders hitting, pull sink fastball right field line two outs. The fans along foul line stood, wave push ball fair body English, ball land line, skip wall two runners scored. The Yankees early edge, jumped Brown, best pitcher mound. San Diego's Chris Gomez lead second inning blooper shortstop, ball fall single. Quilvio Veras flied right, Gwynn ground Gomez take second, bring Vaughn plate. David Wells get ahead count, balls two strikes, change-up fastball, try run fastball inside Vaughn, hit 50 home runs regular season. Vaughn attack pitch: line drive land second deck, foul way, frighten mistake. Jorge Posada, Yankees' catcher, jog mound re-think strategy, perhaps remind Wells conventional wisdom: must pitch Vaughn outer edge plate. Posada return plate, call outside fastball, Wells threw. Vaughn's swing short quick, ball make click sound bat, like well-struck golf ball, carry wall right-center field. Tie game. Wells retire first two batters fifth inning, jamming Veras inside fastball. Veras' bat snap contact, enough send looper short center field, single. Gwynn step in, hit single first two at-bats, look sign third base coach Tim Flannery. With runner first, likes try pull ball right side infield. Wells fire fastball, Gwynn turn pitch rip it, line drive crash face upper deck right field. The Padres jump dugout, celebrating, Wells turn away, disgusted, ask new baseball. He get one, deliver another fastball, Vaughn slug deep left field stands. Two pitches, two home runs, first back-to-back home runs allow Wells since April 30. San Diego led, 5-2, Yankee Stadium silent. It would stay way. The moment truth Chuck Knoblauch come bottom first inning name announce Yankee Stadium first time since neglect chase memorable loose ball last Wednesday. There boos. It warm ovation. They like him. They really like him. Knoblauch exhaled. Knoblauch emphasize game concerned win rumble World Series, fans. But surely make Knoblauch feel home realize fans forgiven him. Victories, time, heal malice toward Knoblauch could play second base without earplugs. When Yankees defeat Indians, 9-5, Game 6 Tuesday night advance second World Series three years, Knoblauch easily relieve player field. The awful mistake make Game 2 would forgotten. The Yankees pennant, Knoblauch celebrate much anyone. To act like toward tremendous, say Knoblauch, response received. It great feeling, really help out. Knoblauch wear cap declare Yankees champions American League 1998; Champagne drip brim spoke. He look up, continued talk learn lot vilify make mistake little Leaguers expect make. Just face things take like man answer questions, although they're tough, Knoblauch said. You see make bounce back something like that. That's basically I learned. If Yankees lose ALCS, even Knoblauch's teammates say would brand villain failing pursue ball glance Travis Fryman's back run outside baseline. Knoblauch argue umpire go ahead run score first Indians won, 4-1. now Knoblauch watch television read newspapers without get queasy. That's huge him, David Cone said. That's huge me. I let back game, would tough one would come back beat us. And Knobbie, I'm sure he's feeling lot better now. Knoblauch, two hits five at-bats, work second bottle Champagne five minutes reporters allow clubhouse. He flash sort smile show much recently and, Yankees World Series, Knoblauch expect tease often mistake. maybe go way, we'll that, Derek Jeter said. I know I'll say, I'll think something good. YANKEES pitch The start pitching enable Yankees advance past Cleveland American League Championship Series. David Wells 7-1 career postseason additional edge Padres' lineup generally less effective left-handed pitching. Orlando Hernandez four terrific pitches, pitch seven shutout innings pivotal Game 4 ALCS earn start Game 2 series. David Cone benefit six days' worth rest start Game 3, well able pitch warm Southern California. Mariano Rivera's stuff might good year, Mike Stanton continue dominant postseason pitcher. Reasons concern: erratic Andy Pettitte, need home-plate umpire call strikes pitches low away, Jeff Nelson, lose command last brief outing. Offense There signs ALCS offense come collective slump Chuck Knoblauch get base consistently, Derek Jeter back drive ball right field middle, Bernie Williams three hits Game 6, Scott Brosius consistent force bottom lineup. But Yankees holes: Chili Davis hard-pressed catch fastballs Kevin Brown Andy Ashby, Tino Martinez's postseason funk problem. The Yankees could use contribution Jorge Posada, start Games 1 2 may get chance drive pitches low strike zone, hit power. Defense The Yankees best defense baseball, excellent middle Jeter Knoblauch, third Brosius. Nobody's really take advantage fact Williams poor arm center field, rest assure Ken Caminiti, Steve Finley Greg Vaughn try. The Indians expose fact Yankees' pitchers trouble prevent baserunners steal second third base. baserunning The Yankees run well take extra bases, particularly Paul O'Neill, Brosius, Jeter Knoblauch go first-to-third; Williams make mistakes. The Yankees probably able steal Kevin Brown, effective slide step, could aggressive Andy Ashby, combination Sterling Hitchcock Jim Leyritz. PADRES Hitting Except Jim Leyritz, one San Diego lineup particularly hot particularly frighten moment. Tony Gwynn consistent usually is, Ken Caminiti Greg Vaughn streaky. But Padres veteran team capable put ball play, get runners base move along, long get exceptional pitching, that's really need. Quilvio Veras, leadoff hitter, adept draw walks Steve Finley, become pull conscious last two years, could try take aim right field stand Yankee Stadium. Vaughn's power could factor Yankees' pitchers jam enough keep lean plate. Pitching Kevin Brown best pitcher series, capable win three games necessary, Padres manager Bruce Bochy choose start game 1, 4 7. But point, San Diego need big outing either Andy Ashby Sterling Hitchcock. When Ashby's right, he's hit corners sink fastball slider, command suspect, get pounded. Hitchcock use split-fingered fastball great effectiveness right-handed batters first two rounds playoffs, Yankees' left-handed hitters may cause concern. San Diego's middle relief weak aspect team, Randy Myers Mark Langston leave side (the stuff waned). But lead deliver hands closer Trevor Hoffman, he'll keep it. Defense They mostly catch ball avoid mistakes, though unspectacular. Shortstop Chris Gomez second baseman Veras adept turn double plays, Caminiti Gold Glove third base last year; Wally Joyner good hands first; center fielder Steve Finley extremely quick track base hits return ball infield. Tony Gwynn's range well toward right field line, nearly good balls hit gaps. The Yankees able run arm Vaughn leave field. Baserunning Veras steal bases (24) year, Finley tight spot, well. In general, however, Padres slow, plod team, though Caminiti Vaughn good go first-to-third, Gwynn make mistakes bases. pitching TO THE PADRES Quilvio Veras: A switch-hitter power right-handed; try pitch down-and-in break balls he's hit right-handed, jam fastballs he's bat left-handed. Steve Finley: A left-handed hitter likes pull ball. Left-handers like David Wells beat break balls low outside. Tony Gwynn: When he's hot, he's impossible. When he's hit well, anxious early count, fed break balls strike zone. Greg Vaughn: Big-time power anything high plate. Because likes pull ball, must pitch outer edge, occasionally jam keep honest. Ken Caminiti: more power right-handed, better hitter left-handed. These days, he's good lowball hitter beat fastballs zone. Wally Joyner: With runners base, he'll try jump fastball early count. be strong hitter jammed. Chris Gomez: Like Derek Jeter, like hit pitches inside out, right field middle. He hit power make mistake breaking ball. Ruben Rivera: An impatient hitter chase pitches strike zone. Carlos Hernandez: Looks first-pitch fastball upper half strike zone. Can struggle break balls. Jim Leyritz: No apparent holes right now, hit fastballs away. Best bet get ahead count try get chase break balls. pitching TO THE YANKEES Chuck Knoblauch: Hard throwers like jam fastballs stand top plate, get hit often. Derek Jeter: Sometimes tendency chase pitches feet, get ball far enough, hammer ball wall right. Paul O'Neill: The Yankees' best pure hitter, sometimes chase fastballs away, particularly one strike. Bernie Williams: A switch-hitter trouble resist chest-high fastballs. When lay them, much good hitter, last game Cleveland series. Chili Davis: Has great eye work pitcher deep count, overpower fastballs belt. Cheats get bat started, make vulnerable off-speed pitches. Tino Martinez: Nothing seem right moment. be anxious chases pitches strike zone fall behind count, take advantage mistakes they're made. Scott Brosius: A great break ball hitter, also drive fastball long way anticipates, Cleveland's Charles Nagy knows. Jorge Posada: When bat left-handed, fares poorly splitters, curveballs sliders. Ricky Ledee: Like young hitters, tendency expand strike zone chase pitches strike zone fall behind count. Kevin Brown likely attack aggressively. SATURDAY'S PITCHERS Kevin Brown: Best sink fastball game (91-93) mph, four-seam fastball 95-97 mph throw high strike zone, slider break away right-handed batters, forkball dive 88-89 mph. Holds runners well. David Wells: Aggressive, aggressive, aggressive, challenge hitters fastballs. His curveball exceptional, changeup improved. Throw strikes: Allowed many home runs (29) walks (29), allow three-run homer grand slam year. Talk high expectations. It's man Tampa anymore. know baseball well do, everybody Joe Torre family pass tickets divisional series league championship series much parsley plate life. The pressure get World Series, I see people, Torre, Yankees' manager, say New York go play here-we-are, let's-go-for-it San Diego Padres Stadium Saturday night. now yankees Series, florida-based owner fans see nothing appropriate four victories. Anything less 125 would feel like emptiness. But Yankees different six teams already fell bus World Series? The gloom doom six cities compare letdown would grip New York owner's insatiable little heart yank come short. The three-tiered playoff system practically turn baseball football, survival-of-the-fittest mentality produce one exalt Super Bowl champion league full chumps losers, condemn nether world parcells-like demons kick sore spots eternity. The World Series use short sweet reward excellence, eight teams per league, winners meet daylight early October. Even Yankees club poor Brooklyn Dodgers submission again, well, always next year. But 1969, baseball begin league championship series, 1995 begin two-layered playoff system. The World Series still different, resist babble post-season records fling us hyperactive computers hyperactive broadcasters dozens different networks carry baseball. The World Series still competition one league encourage pitchers athletes another league relatively devoid strategy. Somehow playoffs leave everybody feel inadequate. Think it. The Houston Astros go around feel cannot perform post-season. The Texas Rangers sulk best hit league could hardly touch Yankee pitch counted. In Chicago, glory win special playoff wild-card spot Sammy Sosa's 66 home runs pre-empted.

A sticking point White House congressional budget negotiators issue 2000 census conducted, White House find negotiate issue much House Democrats House Republican leaders. On Monday, White House negotiators, lead chief staff Erskine Bowles, try determine whether Democrats would accept deal finance six months departments State, Justice Commerce, oversee Census Bureau. The deal would put next March contentious issue whether next census would use statistical sample supplement traditional methods count people. Bowles tell group Democrats House Republicans willing give number outstanding issues stall final agreement budget, digging heels come finance census six months. The Democrats meet office Minority Leader Dick Gephardt. The rationale half-year financing next March Supreme Court expect rule whether use sample legal constitutional. The Supreme Court already agree review two low court rulings say sample would violate federal law. Oral arguments cases set November. But House Democrats balk idea six months' finance census, argue even Supreme Court allow sampling, Republicans would obligation approve money census include sampling. The general feeling among many Democrats even case, would lot less leverage March, especially issue leave debated, say House Democratic official insist anonymity. Democrats contend time press Republicans, want complete work budget go home campaign. Rep. Lucille Roybal-Allard, D-Calif., attend meeting Monday, said, It was, sort of, are. We've able accomplish great things, think? We make clear unless census included, along issues, like school construction, deal acceptable. Statistical sample would allow Census Bureau estimate populations difficult count, would large effect count african-americans cities blacks Hispanics rural areas, groups traditionally undercounted standard means. Republicans fear, Democrats hope, method would raise count people live traditionally democratic areas, give party advantage new boundaries election districts draw follow 2000 census. At Monday's meeting, Democrats remind administration officials Clinton promise would veto legislation restrict Census Bureau's ability conduct accurate census. I can't think way restrict census fully fund it, say Rep. Carolyn Maloney, D-N.Y. The willingness House Democrats, include Gephardt, press president issue represent realization leverage Clinton, need support come impeachment inquiry. Gephardt major player now, irony help make that, say Rep. Christopher Shays, R-Conn., supports use sample census. The Democrats' position also indicate little trust many White House issue. The proposal finance departments Commerce, Justice State six months similar one reach last November Bowles House Speaker Newt Gingrich. The idea hold three departments hostage census fight would place maximum pressure sides work differences sampling. But House Democrats consult agreement struck later grumble it. At meet democratic caucus Tuesday, Ms. Maloney brief lawmakers dealings White House declare Clinton promise would hold firm census believe him, participant said. The statement greet laughter. There certain level suspicion times cut out,said House democratic official. But I say, much evidence that, time. struggle meet fourth deadline federal budget, congressional Republicans White House officials wrestle Tuesday differences education, politically high-stakes element budget battle.

But compromise still elude question building road wilderness refuge connect two communities Alaska. House Senate negotiators agree Thursday require federal health plans cover prescription contraceptives women, give unusual victory Capitol Hill advocate abortion rights. But future measure doubt attach spending bill include controversial provision regard Federal Election Commission. That provision could scuttle spending bill, would finance Treasury Department Postal Service still must approve House Senate. The contraceptive measure would require federal health plans, affect 1.2 million female federal employees child-bearing age, cover five methods contraception approve Food Drug Administration use country birth control pills, diaphragms, inter-uterine devices, Norplant Depo-Provera. Currently, 19 percent federal health plans cover methods. The House Senate approve contraceptive measure earlier year. But opponents abortion furious approval persuade republican leaders negotiators reopen discussion matter. The cost contraceptives drive out-of-pocket cost health care women. And many male members Congress seem persuaded support coverage contraceptives women, since almost 285 federal health plans cover Viagra, male impotency drug. Thursday, pressure build resolve spending bills Oct. 9, temporary financing government expires, negotiators agree include contraceptive measure conference report $13.4 billion bill Treasury Department Postal service. Rep. Nita Lowey, D-N.Y., push contraceptive measure House, hail Thursday's agreement first major accomplishment abortion rights advocate since Republicans take control Congress 1994. She say negotiators agree include measure election year want perceive oppose contraception see reject measure pass House Senate. But many Democrats say upset bill contain provision see interfere independence Federal Election Commission. That provision would require four-vote majority among seven federal election commissioners every four years retain general counsel staff director. The provision aim get rid Lawrence Noble, current general counsel, investigate campaign finance practices groups like Christian Coalition. The contraceptive measure one four related matters help stall four spending bills. The three bills stall part abortion-related matters include agriculture bill, dispute whether federal Food Drug Administration use taxpayer money approve drugs like RU-486, induce abortions. The foreign operations bill also stall whether finance international family plan programs may also promote abortion, labor health bill delay provision would block access minors contraception. Addressing measure insurance coverage contraceptives, Helen Alvarez, spokeswoman National Conference Catholic Bishops, say bill bad policy. She say contraception fail stem number abortions, teen-age pregnancies out-of-wedlock births. Public-relations-wise, good tactic them, conceded, terms social policy, failure. For first time decades, Congress White House negotiate tax spending legislation year budget surplus. The result chaos. The lawmakers never able agree budget resolution framework tax spending bills suppose fit. This happen since congressional budget procedures establish 1974. Then, without discipline overall plan, Senate House could pass eight 13 spending bills need keep government running. So lawmakers stay session week longer hoped. Finally, lump eight bills together week announce agreement. But way could get far resort gimmicks. One designate $20 billion emergency expenditures programs cut elsewhere offset new spending. This use one-quarter anticipated budget surplus current fiscal year. Another gimmick extend tax break Individual Retirement Accounts couple incomes $100,000 $150,000. This actually raise small amount revenue next five years period cover budget accounting make picture considerably worse later years. As hard negotiate budget bad old days budget deficits, say politicians involved, exponentially difficult year. At least years past, common goal. As much disagreed policy principle, aim reduction deficit. This year, members Congress want use surplus big tax cut. Others want pay national debt. Others want spend part medical research, schools weapons Pentagon. Others want spend large sums highways. still others want continue cut government spending. And among Republicans. The Democrats ideas budget, President Clinton lay marker save surplus way find shore Social Security system. In budget terms, say Robert Reischauer, former director congressional budget office, like end Cold War. There differences well way things negotiate budget surplus. In 1990, 1993 1995, politicians stake careers strike budget deal low deficit, fundamental question divide bitter medicine taxes less spending. Republicans, part, oppose tax increases favor cut spending social programs. Democrats want raise taxes, especially rich, protect social spending. In end, balances carefully drawn. But plenty politicians President George Bush, name one lost jobs process. This year, Democrats Republicans alike claim victory, burn issue parcel candy. Democrats get money education farm assistance. Republicans get money military extension popular tax breaks businesses. Some $20 billion eat surplus really go emergencies, like relief victims Hurricane Georges. But much money, like $90 million pay six new helicopters national police Colombia use drug interdiction, designate emergency spending simply way get budget. For politicians, new way fun. It hard imagine anyone vote office year's budget. But make easy reach agreement. The big difference principal fights year money all. They involve delicate policy issues like needle exchanges, contraception, global warming, immigration census. In Congress, consensus matters. So way policy could set wrap giant spending bill. It may pleasant debate policy money. But probably harder find way split difference. As long surplus lasts, lack discipline characterize budget-writing year likely continue. This distressing devote controlling government spending. The temptation, say L. Ari Fleischer, spokesman House ways Means Committee, grab loot spend it. Some conservatives sound notes discord Friday federal spending agreement, also say would probably vote $500 billion package boost defense spending provide aid farmers. However, one vote package yet, finished. The deal President Clinton Republican leaders hail Thursday broad outline areas agreement final portion $1.7 trillion budget, write document. That craft chairmen spend committees aides, say Friday still dispute need resolve final document could run 3,000 pages. For example, still unresolved dispute whether airlines create peanut-free zone protect passengers allergic peanuts. House Speaker Newt Gingrich members Georgia, major peanut-producing state, fight proposal, would force airlines ban peanuts within three rows someone allergy. Congress give midnight Tuesday vote final bill, agree President Clinton fifth extension temporary financing keep government open. The budget due Oct. 1, start new fiscal year. The vote initially expect Friday, bill nowhere near written. only handful top-level bargainers include Gingrich, Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott White House chief staff Erskine Bowles room final deal. Excluded committee chairmen heads appropriation committees, must write language put deal law. Almost everyone Capitol Hill expect budget pas eventually, big defections come conservatives object $20 billion take surplus address so-called emergencies package's failure offer voters serious tax cut. The lag time bill officially close make conservatives nervous members try add provisions expand bill already consider overly bloated. And worry hometown pork stuffed bill publicly revealed, voters could put pressure members support it. The elections Nov. 3. But several conservatives say despite problems, expect support bill anyway. Rep. Mark Souder, R-Ind., said: `Most friends, predominantly activist conservatives, split 50-50. If tax cuts primary thing, unhappy, many conservatives mixed agenda. My position is, hold nose vote yes. We tax cuts far much spending I oppose, that's nature compromise. Every member little different focus. Souder say like extra money defense spending, like price supports farmers. Hog farmers district, whose big customers Japan China, hit hard collapse Asian markets. several Republicans say bill seem skewed favor Democrats. They cite two reasons: Clinton need curry favor Democrats shore support House vote impeach him, Republican leaders fear stand Clinton, might force government shutdown Republicans would blamed. Clinton buy votes, say Rep. David Hobson, R-Ohio. He suck liberal Democrats would support impeachment. Rep. W.J. (Billy) Tauzin, R-La., say leaders seem motivated desire avoid political damage incur partial government shutdowns 1995 1996. He also cite president's need placate leave add costly domestic programs. The combination lessons learn three years ago scandal president's side yield inevitable result, budget lean way left, Tauzin said. Still, say would probably support bill. It enthusiastically, said. It hold nose either. I would prefer spend money tax cut. I think would get tax cut, scandal. If president catch scandal, probably would follow Dick Morris strategy move towards center. Gingrich say recognize conservatives wary agreement. But sought reassure package serve interests. He cite $9 billion increase defense spending. And note Republicans block several items, include needle-exchange programs District Columbia, national education test U.S. contributions United Nations program pays family plan China, many Congress object China policy coerce abortions force sterilization. Gingrich say agreement best could achieve conservative Republican Congress liberal Democratic president. Some conservatives especially critical understanding Thursday. Rep. David McIntosh, r-ind., leader conservatives House, denounce bill earlier Great Society type big-spending program. Friday, meeting Republicans, said, Our leadership find bad situation good job. A remain outright hostile bill, much hasty way cobble together contained. Rep. Joe Barton, R-Texas, said: `I'm voting `no' unless something revolutionary happen tuesday. I think process give president ability stonewall end hold us ransom. The republican leadership House Senate good job limit highway robbery, still go far beyond spending caps. also angry rush endgame Rep. Gene Taylor, D-Miss., take House floor say could support final bill. I'm go urge colleagues vote `no,' Taylor said. We stay long. We stay little bit longer. And I go encourage colleagues continue vote give adequate time study measure bring us. Voting mainly party lines question become touchstone debate development preservation wilderness, Senate Thursday approve gravel road remote wildlife habitat Alaska. The road, barely 30 miles long, would slice across edge wildlife refuge wilderness area aleutian Peninsula, would connect isolated village call King Cove long-range air strip town Cold Bay. Without road, backers say, 700 residents king Cove must continue use unreliable air boat service emergencies, often risk dangerous winds seas seek medical evacuation Anchorage. Opponents road call project unjustifiable precedent threaten seasonal breed grounds protected migratory birds, say improve air sea service would better alternative. The vote Thursday, 59-38, victory state's congressional delegation. But President Clinton likely veto measure, final outcome may depend whether sponsors insert road proposal huge spending bill likely emerge Congress heads home Nov. 3 elections. Three Republicans vote bill, six Democrats vote it. The Clinton administration repeatedly warn veto big spending bill contain array anti-environmental provisions consideration. Indeed, White House seem itch partisan fight environmental priorities. But many Republicans Congress still appear reluctant engage broad fight, willing Thursday cast lot Senate's two powerful Alaskans, Ted Stevens Frank Murkowski, Republicans. A companion bill House, sponsor Rep. Don Young Alaska, also Republican, come floor. even Sen. John Chafee Rhode Island, leader Republican environmentalists, vote road. last February Chafee's staff assemble score environmental lobbyists office plan strategy oppose road, environmental advocates say Thursday. They speculate senator change position deference power Stevens, chairman Appropriations Committee exert tremendous influence time dozen spending bills final stages. A Chafee aide say Chafee vote reluctantly road Alaska's senators convince merits. Stevens say angry tones Thursday two-thirds Alaska's land limits development vital health services deny state's residents. We can't use without permission bureaucrat compel extreme environmentalists, said. They extreme say 330,000-acre Izembek refuge, small wilderness Alaska, sacrosanct can't move border 60 feet. But Sen. Dale Bumpers, D-Ark., call road project dangerous precedent. Building road wilderness Alaska, matter short long, would first time nation vote deliberately authorize road wilderness area, Bumpers said. And go road, nobody know go end. struggle meet fourth deadline federal budget, congressional Republicans White House officials wrestle Tuesday differences education, stag events demonstrate support become public politically high-stakes element budget battle.

","Whether to use the 1st surplus in decades for a tax cut, to pay off the national debt, or for new initiatives made the 1998 federal budget negotiations chaotic.The Oct 1 start of the fiscal year was extended 5 times.Major issues were census statistical sampling, federal health plan coverage of contraceptives regardless of religious affiliation, and school aid decisions by the federal gov't or local jurisdictions.Other issues included a Federal Election Commission provision, a road through an Alaskan wildlife refuge, and an airline peanut ban.Committees crafted the budget document after broad agreement was reached when 8 bills were lumped together.","In 1998, for the first time in decades, the US budget negotiators faced a surplus.Both sides said this was harder than a deficit situation, but they finally spent $1.7 trillion.The last seven spending bills were the most difficult and finally were merged into one package.Controversial issues included health insurance paying for contraception, control of new education allocations, an Alaskan wilderness road, whether the 2000 census would include statistical sampling, and establishing an emergency fund.Conservatives felt the results favored the liberals, but both sides were satisfied and glad to finish before Election Day and avoid a government shutdown.","Budget negotiations between the White House and House Republicans were delayed on several issues.At issue were provisions that included requiring Federal Health Insurance providers to provide contraceptives to women as Well as a provision to build a road across a wildlife preserve in Alaska.The contraceptive issue faced an uncertain future while Clinton likely will veto the road.There is disagreement also on how to spend the funding on education.This year's budget discussions also have been hampered because it is the first time since budget procedures were established in 1974 that there has been a surplus, preventing agreement on a budget resolution.","After several deadline extensions, Congressional leaders and the White House agreed on an omnibus spending package, the final portion of the $1.7 trillion budget.It includes more money for education and defense, business tax breaks, and farm aid, as well as funds for Colombia to use in drug interdiction.To offset the new spending, the surplus will be tapped for $20 billion, to the ire of conservatives.This year, without the common goal of reducing the deficit, reaching agreement was very difficult.Policy provisions involving the 2000 census, contraception, and the Alaskan wilderness were also tied to the spending package and were hotly debated."

1033,"Microsoft Corp. say material unpublished book two business school professors crucial part defense antitrust trial schedule begin next week. But judge advance copy manuscript, Justice Department 20 states sue software giant find support arguments book well. To cite one example, Microsoft contend industry-standard Windows operating system Internet Explorer browser single integrate product. In suit, government asserts two separate products Microsoft bundle together get unfair edge rival, Netscape Communications Corp., market software use browse Internet's World Wide Web. In compete Internet Time: Lessons Netscape Its Battle Microsoft, authors, Michael A. Cusumano Massachusetts Institute Technology's Sloan School Management David B. Yoffie Harvard business school, quote Microsoft executive say third version Microsoft's browser integrate Windows. Microsoft hurry first browser offerings market, book says, race catch Netscape, take ambitious approach Internet Explorer 3.0, introduce August 1996. In version change software design use program modules, components, could put together rearragned like build blocks. In book, Ben Slivka, Microsoft general manager, quote saying, IE 3.0 key thing componentized browser, He added, We really make Internet Explorer part Windows platform. The timing could legally significant suit government cite evidence requests August 1996 personal computer makers want load Netscape's browser machines instead Microsoft's browser. Microsoft deny requests, insist browers Windows single, integrate product. Microsoft's legal team obtain early manuscript new book last month, issue subpoena Netscape executive give confidential copy authors review. Microsoft also seek transcripts 44 current former netscape employees interview authors. A federal judge Boston last week deny Microsoft access research materials, company may appeal ruling. The new book, publish Free Press imprint Simon &AMP; Schuster, hurry print ship within days start Microsoft trial Oct. 19. But already, quotes Netscape executives leak out. The authors decide send complete manuscript The New York Times three news organizations Monday, material could read context. Microsoft intend use material book evidence Netscape's troubles result largely missteps rather alleged predatory practices Microsoft. The book detail Netscape stumbled, shift strategy often run obstacles software development efforts. In private antitrust suits, argument competitor bad enemy establish defense. But legal experts say defense may well far less effective federal case government seek court-mandated changes Microsoft's business practices rather monetary damages goal plaintiffs private cases. It seem debate Netscape's mistakes total sideshow, say Robert Litan, former senior official Justice Department's antitrust division, Brookings Institution. But Microsoft big legal team, seem work every defense find. The book quote former Netscape executive, Ram Shriram, say company bungle chance win sizable share browser business America Online Inc. But second-chance deal America Online, lead online service. The government's case focus early deal March 1996, America Online choose Internet Explorer prefer browser; bargain Microsoft agree place startup icon online service main Windows desktop screen prime real estate computing. For book entitle Competing Internet Time, intrigue one central themes Netcape get wedded notion Internet revolution would change everything quickly. Microsoft, contrast, stuck three-year planning horizon enable company, authors write, mesh short-run tactical plans broader strategic view win war. The book quote Steve Ballmer, Microsoft's president, saying, The fact matter customers can't take cataclysmic change every three months. The organization also can't. You ship products quickly. But can't say, `Oh, radically new strategy' every three months. The government's antitrust scrutiny Microsoft, world's large independent software company, span Republican Democratic administrations involve hundreds government lawyers investigators. But mean example consistent, coordinate public policy. Nor, accounts, politics. Instead, like software industry itself, government's pursuit Microsoft take leaps, hit dead ends evolve ways one could control predict back start 1989. It November year, hot afternoon computer-industry convention Las Vegas, Nev., Bill Gates, Microsoft's chairman, look like he'd drag news conference senior executive IBM time dominate Microsoft entire computer industry. The two companies IBM, lead maker personal computers Microsoft, leader pc operate system software collaborate design market new operating system call OS/2. But Microsoft also begin sell compete product, Windows. The industry trade press full worry articles: system go become new standard? With Gates stand uncomfortably side, James Cannavino, IBM divisional president, say two companies want clear air. OS/2 future, said. As Windows, added, would remain niche product under-equipped computers. Windows, asserted, would never receive advanced features os/2. gate certainly look happy. But disagree. The news conference get little attention, articles deep inside newspapers trade publications. But weeks later, Norris Washington, senior antitrust lawyer Federal Trade Commission, happen read one articles, Byte magazine. IBM Microsoft define unified vision graphical operating environments, article said, look sort like U.S. economic model, divide lower-, middle- upper-class products. As Washington saw it, IBM Microsoft collude divide operating-system market potential violation antitrust law. Soon FTC staff open investigation Microsoft IBM And since small first step, Microsoft unrelenting scrutiny federal antitrust investigators constantly evolve series allegations charges, month month, year year, last nine years. now come antitrust trial schedule begin Monday, multiplicity charges weave threads draw dozen different investigative inquiries nine-year span. Microsoft, today fear company software business carry stock-market value nearly $234 billion, presents huge highly visible antitrust target. Yet, company's allies ask, What Clinton administration's political agenda go Microsoft? answer seem none. In interviews, dozen current former senior antitrust officials whether friends government Microsoft say Justice Department's antitrust suit natural outgrowth previous investigations. As politics, officials agree antitrust division operate independent administration's political considerations. Charles Rule assistant attorney general head antitrust division Bush administration, Washington lawyer serve adviser advocate Microsoft. When I there, Rule say Justice days, White House punctilious terms never get involve whatever decide do. There communication antitrust branches government. ask believed policy change Clinton administration, said: not really. I've see nothing suggest it. Joel Klein head antitrust division now, interview deal division's role Clinton administration's technology policy, specifically relate Microsoft case, said: There statutory restriction, practical matter, civil criminal prosecutions invariably carry without political contact. Klein said, way examples, might discuss merger cases involve military aviation industries Defense Department Transportation Department. But never White House, said. For significant case, might call White House say `an hour go hold press conference.' The last time interference, added, Dita Beard-ITT case. Mrs. Beard, lobbyist ITT Corp., accuse 1972 write memo say $400,000 donation Republican National Convention go long way toward settle antitrust suits bring company Nixon administration's Justice Department. The authenticity memo never proved, Mrs. Beard always deny write it. In case, Klein says, since Watergate, immaculate. In case Microsoft, neither President Clinton Vice President Al Gore ever volunteer comment. In answer question news conference May, suit filed, Clinton said: I take view I comment matters within Justice Department. At time, I think I depart policy case, even though obviously big impact important sector economy. But I say, base I know date, I confidence way antitrust division Justice Department handle matter. Since then, Clinton say nothing else case, publicly least. And Gore, generally represent administration technology issues, never comment all. In Rule's opinion, administration would foolish involve itself, even politically acceptable so. It would little odd administration push Justice Department suit, said. It would policy mistake political mistake. I would hard pressed explain would that. Taking sides highly charge technology world dangerous, particularly since Democrats rely Silicon Valley companies political donations support. In fact, present former government officials say suit simply natural extension inquiries conduct last nine years. They begin FTC. Soon Washington read article Byte, FTC staff open investigation Windows-OS/2 question. But happen often follow years, turn market make initial inquiry irrelevant. Microsoft abandon agreement IBM, Windows quickly grow industry standard, OS/2 remain cipher. But issue faded, government investigators begin look Microsoft find things troubled them. In 1991 Washington, still work FTC, inform Microsoft investigation expanded. The agency, letter said, try determine whether Microsoft use dominant position operating-systems software stifle competition areas. That general idea lie heart present suit. One former senior FTC official say commission staff confidence case realize Reagan-era commissioners, approve suit, might different view. We know commission might difficulty monopolization case, former official said. They bring case years. And fact, 1993 commission vote 2-2 question whether file formal charges. The deadlock serve dismissal. Then, months later, Justice Department decide pick case. It farther along cases got, recall Robert Litan, former senior official Justice Department's antitrust division Brookings Institution. Usually case would two three people complain documents, said. But fully research record. They give us file brief us done. The Justice Department lawyers pick thread. The general idea behind inquiry, Litan said, allow use monopoly operate systems cement monopoly areas. In 1995, microsoft government reach consent agreement company promise stop forcing pc makers buy one copy Microsoft operating system every computer sell instead one every computer operate system, MS-DOS Windows, installed. The company also agree stop tying sale one software product sale another. The charges present suit similar many ways. even agreement, government investigations continued. That year, Justice Department investigators show offices Netscape Communications Corp. first time ask questions next line inquiry. America Online complaining, senior Netscape executive recalled, Microsoft bundling Microsoft Network, compete online service, Windows. once more, market forces overtake investigation. The Microsoft Network never grow particularly popular America Online prosper grew. But, surprisingly, new complaints fill void. In May 1995, Anne Bingaman, assistant attorney general head antitrust division, remarked: We get complaints Microsoft time. We become kind microsoft complaints center. And take seriously. In 1996, Netscape's first complaint arrived. In letter Justice Department, Netscape say Microsoft use dominance personal-computer operate systems force persuade computer makers favor Microsoft's browser, use explore World Wide Web, one market Netscape. The next year Justice Department formally charge Microsoft violate consent agreement tie sales Windows installation company's Web browser new computers. It seem like slam-dunk violation consent decree, natural extension case, recall Litan, leave department then. A Federal District Court judge agreed, Appeals Court panel overturn rule summer. In meantime, last May Justice Department 20 state attorneys general file new suit Microsoft, schedule trial Monday. It contend Microsoft engage bundling, tie predatory behavior similar many ways numerous previous allegations investigations last nine years. A good part case Round II case deal Round I, early 1990s, Litan said. Or, former senior FTC official put it, there's certainly common thread run way here. But years thread twisted, pull spun hundreds different hands. The case United States vs. Microsoft Corp., government's aggressive move monopolist almost 25 years, play century antitrust laws broadly word court rulings ambiguous sides cite rulings support oppose arguments. Whatever outcome trial, schedule begin Monday U.S. District Court Washington, almost certain appeal leave Supreme Court task bring legal order 100 years clash antitrust doctrines. The case focus Microsoft's Windows, operate system control 90 percent personal computers sell today. The government say objective curb illegal monopolistic business practices threaten render large parts economy vulnerable vicissitudes single company. Microsoft assert case intend give government control feature add Windows. however grand economic stakes, legal dispute narrow. The government say Microsoft's contracts computer manufacturers companies provide access Internet illegally stifle competition. The contracts prohibit manufacturers substitute Netscape Communications Corp.'s Navigator browser Microsoft's Internet Explorer. They also prohibit remove Windows main screen, desktop, links sit World Wide Web run Microsoft partners. Microsoft's contracts companies connect people Internet businesses sell goods services Web require favored treatment Internet Explorer Navigator exchange links Windows desktop. In wake lawsuit, Microsoft voluntarily drop requirements, though could reinstate will. Microsoft say contracts legal produce tangible benefits customers, include easy Internet access. The Justice Department say bundle Explorer Windows 95 inclusion browser part windows 98 amount tying, illegal practice forces customers one product purchase another. The contracts manufacturers Internet services illegal, government says, intend create monopoly browser market protect Microsoft's exist monopoly operate systems. The latter threat key, accord Justice Department. Browsers potential, like operating system, act software platform programs run. so contracts intend drive browsers market would also insulate Windows monopoly. Many antitrust experts say problem facing Justice Department courts provide clear definition tie clear guidelines determine contracts illegally exclusionary. Professor Lawrence White New York University, chief economist Justice Department's antitrust division early 1980s, say courts treat tie unusual practice fact ubiquitous. No one, said, would challenge right manufacturers tie erasers tip pencils, tires automobile buttons shirts. His point, share widely among economists, tie benefits consumers if, example, results products easy use enables company recover development costs. But tie bad locks monopoly power. The courts, White says, offer enough guidance distinguish good tying bad, nub legal dispute. Microsoft say need show bundling Windows Explorer passes might call gross consumer benefits test offers immediate benefit, whether causes long-term damage competition and, therefore, ultimately consumers. The Justice Department say Microsoft's practices must clear high hurdle: yield net consumer benefits immediate large enough balance possible long-term harm competition. So test consumer benefits satisfies antitrust laws? The simple answer one know sure, sides reasonably cite cases without fear embarrassment. Consider 1985 case, Aspen Skiing Co. vs. Aspen Highlands Skiing Corp., 1951 case, Lorain Journal Co. vs. United States. In first, Aspen Skiing, owner three major ski run Aspen, Colo. monopolist years sell ticket cooperation Aspen Highlands, competitor, give skiers access companies' runs. When Aspen Skiing unilaterally cancel agreement, rival's revenues shrivel rival sued. The Supreme Court rule Aspen Skiing violate antitrust laws evidence action help consumers. In Lorain Journal case, local newspaper Lorain, Ohio, refuse sell advertising companies advertise new radio station. Here, too, Supreme Court rule exclusionary practice nothing benefit consumers. Indeed, Aspen Skiing, court even force monopolist business rival, precedent augurs well Justice Department, seek force Microsoft install Netscape's browser alongside own. But Charles Rule, legal consultant Microsoft, say cases courts throw exclusionary practices offer consumer benefit. The courts, argues, never pounce practices result low prices better products service. Nor courts either case call balance immediate benefits hypothetical long-term harm. Rule argue Microsoft's practices produce demonstrable consumer benefits. Besides, says, unlike actions take The Lorain Journal Aspen Skiing, Microsoft's contracts prevent consumers instal Netscape's browser use Web sites Microsoft's rivals. In truth, though, neither case answer consumer benefit test apply product design. In Jefferson Parish Hospital District no. 2 et al. vs. Hyde, another case cite sides, Supreme Court 1984 recognize surgeons anesthesiologists provide integrate service. Yet, court said, hospital monopoly power would still allow force surgical patients use panel anesthesiologists consumers want purchase two services separately. That principle could undercut Microsoft's defense functional interdependence Windows Explorer require bundling. But Microsoft point strong concurring opinion call tougher standard government meet alleges tying. Microsoft also draw support several court rulings allow IBM change design computers ways make hard vendors attach peripheral equipment. But perhaps Microsoft's best argument nowhere government identify single case courts explicitly call throw tie product basis balance test. The courts, Microsoft emphasize, steer clear redesign technically sophisticated products. The Justice Department's rejoinder note sole purpose antitrust law protect consumers, make sense bless practices provide dollar's worth benefits today but, stamp competition, drive prices $1,000 tomorrow. The Justice Department ask court least insist monopolists use least exclusionary means possible achieve whatever services provide customers. Experts agree courts subject Microsoft's restrictive contracts Internet companies balance test. But exactly court decide whether consumers help hurt grabs. A balance test would court weigh immediate benefits consumers one-click access Internet sit features bundle windows-explorer package versus harm time diminish competition markets browsers operate systems. But test make good sense theory prove fiendishly difficult use practice. Balancing test impossibly difficult arbitrary, say Rep. Thomas Campbell, R-Calif., former law professor Stanford University. The practical effect balance hand defendants like Microsoft almost certain victory. Microsoft argue many antitrust experts agree courts fact gravitate away balance test toward simple predation test exclusionary contracts. Under standard, contract illegal intend drive competition thus pave way monopolist raise prices later. Microsoft easy time defend charge predation, amounts victimize customers, would defend charge bundled product consumers slightly harm good. The antitrust record, say William Baxter, head antitrust division President Reagan, litter contradictory, ambiguous sometimes nonsensical verdicts. He legal experts agree nothing else, record leave plenty legal leeway Supreme Court, hear Microsoft case, stiffen spine antitrust law. The legal tool government use assault Microsoft Corp. Sherman Antitrust Act 1890 brief, vague malleable. The combination mean bedrock statute antitrust policy turn toothless powerful years, depend politics economics day interpret courts. Sponsored Sen. John Sherman, Ohio Republican young brother Civil War general William Tecumseh Sherman, act pass nod popular backlash rise industrial trusts oil, steel railroads. Farmers, laborers small-business owners sizable vote groups resent trusts vehicles concentrate power. But trusts, large national hold corporations, view many others engines modernization industrialization. Economists time oppose Sherman Act, law Congress pass vaguely word compromise. No one know impact would have, one senator, quote Matthew Josephson's The Robber Barons, explain nearly everyone agree something must fling appease restive masses. The act's two key provisions, Sections 1 2, mention conspiracy, restraint trade attempt monopolize. Yet Sherman Act interpret Magna Carta competition, never use term. After passed, critics trusts deride impenetrable language Sherman Act call swiss Cheese Act. But early 1900s, political climate changed. The grow antagonism trusts, especially income gaps widened, tap avow trustbuster, Theodore Roosevelt, become president 1901. The Sherman Act always elastic piece social legislation, use attack perceived exploitation aggregation power, say Eleanor Fox, professor New York University Law School. The model trust principal target trustbusters Standard Oil. Shrewdly, Roosevelt make distinction good trusts, thrive superior efficiency, bad trusts, grow result inevitable economic forces unfair business practices. Throughout 1880s '90s, Standard Oil's rivals complain company business practices founder, John D. Rockefeller. But years, price kerosene burn light nation's homes decline steadily. so Standard Oil, could could reasonably argued, enterprising monopoly. In early 1900s, though, Standard Oil raise prices United States prop profits time engage price war Royal Dutch/Shell Europe, Standard Oil face genuine competition. When consumers hurt Standard Oil monopoly, popular support antitrust action company swelled, encouraged Roosevelt successor, William Howard Taft. The federal suit Standard Oil file 1906, Supreme Court approve breakup company 1911. Standard Oil Microsoft case, historians observe, common themes. Both dominant companies day, Bill Gates, Microsoft chairman, call modern Rockefeller. But presidential involvement real consumer dissatisfaction Microsoft case, say Ron Chernow, author Titan, best-selling biography Rockefeller. And Rockefeller, Chernow added, never go kind honeymoon period widespread public adulation favorable press coverage Bill Gates had. In summer 1995, whiff revolution air Silicon Valley. The Internet offer new deal computing, fresh opportunity entrepreneurs try break Microsoft Corp.'s firm grip personal computer software business. lead challenge Netscape Communications Corp., whose software browse World Wide Web ignite Internet boom. Netscape chairman James Clark speak boldly attack Microsoft head-on. He borrow imagery movie Star Wars, refer Microsoft Death Star Netscape leader rebel alliance. Microsoft answer vengeance. It dispatch hundreds programmers work compete browser pour many millions dollars market it. It prod computer makers others distribute browser, fold browser industry-dominant Windows operate system give browser away free campaign intend cut air supply, senior Microsoft executive describe it. But competitors like Netscape encounter Microsoft's force. Microsoft's partners, corporate customers professional investors finance new ventures collide it. A close look Microsoft's no-holds-barred push Internet software business offers window ways company use market muscle influence behavior virtually every player industry. Some cases recount figure prominently suit bring Justice Department 20 states, schedule go trial month, charge Microsoft times go far violate antitrust laws. Regardless legal outcome, previously unreported details incidents suit examples provide complete picture Microsoft action. When Compaq Computer Corp. consider load Netscape's browser instead Microsoft's personal computers, Microsoft threaten stop selling Windows operate system Compaq. The company quickly change mind. After Spyglass Inc. begin supply Microsoft early browser technology, Microsoft announce would give away browser free. The timing come rude surprise partner spyglass. The company lose revenues almost overnight, technology, also license companies besides Microsoft, suddenly become available free. When America Online Inc., compete fiercely Microsoft's online service electronic commerce divisions, go shop browser technology, Microsoft make offer good pas up: If America Online use Microsoft's browser main one millions subscribers, Microsoft would give America Online prime placement desktop screen personal computers use Windows. When Intel Corp. begin develop Internet software, Microsoft complained. Intel, lead maker microprocessors serve electronic brains personal computers run Windows, pull back. The chip maker decide lucrative hand-in-glove partnership Microsoft take priority. Microsoft's reach compute become pervasive nearly every year now, Silicon Valley's top venture capitalists meet privately team top Microsoft executives learn company's plans. The goal, one venture investor observed, stay way steamroller. Microsoft adamantly deny break laws similar situations. The company play game business hard, executives acknowledge without apology. Yes, Microsoft says, rivals may suffer partners may irritate occasionally. But company insist actions guide main corporate goal bring new technology inexpensively conveniently millions people use software. most people computer industry say live Microsoft's world mean routinely make accommodations it. Microsoft's power emanate near-monopoly market personal computer operate systems, master control programs run computers. Because own operate system, Microsoft essential utility information age, say James Moore, president Geopartners Research Inc., technology consult firm. It act kind gatekeeper pipeline compute innovation, sit decide whether help innovation slow down. For months, Microsoft Netscape talk off, circle warily. But event would define unflinching rivals meet June 21, 1995, second-floor conference room Netscape's headquarters Mountain View, Calif. That meeting, accord Justice Department 20 states sue Microsoft, high-tech equivalent storied gatherings smoke-filled railroad cars inspire passage nation's antitrust laws century ago. On day, say, Microsoft make Netscape illegal offer divvy market Internet browse software, collusion pact Netscape rejected. Microsoft reply prosecutors misinterpret routine meeting software business company never try divide browser market. Bill Gates, Microsoft's chairman principal strategist, attend Mountain View gathering, consult telephone Microsoft team. Two people attend June meeting name witness trial schedule begin next week: Netscape president James Barksdale Daniel Rosen, Microsoft's general manager new technology. In trial, government contend Microsoft present Netscape all-or-nothing offer, accord people questioned federal investigation. rely heavily notes take meeting Netscape executive vice president Marc Andreessen testimony Barksdale, prosecutors expect assert Microsoft proposal several elements, incentives requirements. Microsoft, accord people questioned government, would invest Netscape, take 15 20 percent stake, give Netscape technical information fine-tune Microsoft's operate systems Netscape's software would run good Windows. In return, people say, Netscape would give Microsoft seat board, license technology Microsoft, give Microsoft advance knowledge product-development efforts make browser next generation Microsoft operate system, windows 95, ship two months June 1995 meeting. And Microsoft, people added, always deny used access technology powerful lever business negotiations, offering Netscape preferential access Windows application program interfaces, APIs, link enable companies' programs run smoothly Windows operate system. By turn deal, Netscape, say, would prefer access Microsoft technology threat Microsoft fiercely deny making. Barksdale, Netscape's 55-year-old chief executive, tell colleague encounter Microsoft June 1995 damned meeting I've ever attend 35 years business. have Netscape accept Microsoft's offer, would microsoft's money endorsement. Netscape would also free sell browser use earlier versions Windows use operate systems like Apple's Macintosh Unix, powerful system use mainly corporations research labs. But license technology Microsoft step aside, best could hop become company sales $100 million hop buy Microsoft, say Clark, former computer scientist Stanford University found Silicon Graphics Inc., computer graphics pioneer, start Netscape. We start Netscape that. For company, meeting Microsoft often charge affair. Every computing device keyboards disk drives, every software program games browsers, must mesh smoothly Microsoft's Windows operate system. This necessary make computers reliable easy use, also give Microsoft role industry's gatekeeper. And since Microsoft make manner software products beyond operating system, companies put uneasy position require Microsoft's cooperation able compete it. And software industry, every program render digital code 1's 0's, lines divide competition cooperation often blurred. The talk line Microsoft-Netscape meeting focus division operate system platform, computer terms application programs, sometimes call solutions, run top operating system. The government suit state swear testimony, Chris Jones, Microsoft manager attend meeting, admit Microsoft `absolutely' intend persuade Netscape compete. Microsoft read Jones' testimony differently, evidence mainly company's clarify position. If Netscape stay applications solutions side operate system, two companies could partners, Microsoft said. But Netscape try become player platform space, would compete. Microsoft release portions Jones deposition September evidence government quote Microsoft manager context. Q. Do recall discussion desire anybody part Microsoft participate able persuade influence Netscape compete? A. Absolutely. But again, persuade sense force persuade sense of, hey, think great business relationship together. Later deposition, Justice Department lawyer ask Jones whether Microsoft executives intend suggest would consequences Netscape business Netscape choose go platform direction describe earlier opposed solutions direction. Jones replied: The conversation something like following: `We're platform business. We're go invest heavily part platform feel critical technologies. That's do deal.' And we're ask them: `What business? be business platforms solutions? If platforms, we're platforms business. We're competing.' Microsoft portray comments innocuous statements fact. But Netscape, remarks could take warning, threat. This Internet browsing software potential become alternative platform Windows operate system. The browser, sit top operating system, could supplant Windows main desktop screen users' machines main layer program start software applications. In addition, Netscape's browser could serve powerful platform distribute run Java, Internet program language develop Sun Microsystems Inc., Microsoft rival. In technical terms, Netscape's upstart platform could replace Microsoft's APIs essential utility computing. Indeed, Andreessen boast public Netscape's ambition relegate Microsoft's Windows much software plumb underneath browser. By June meeting, Microsoft certainly view Netscape serious potential challenger Windows, corporate crown jewel. On May 26, 1995, internal memo, The Internet Tidal Wave, Gates wrote: A new competitor `born' Internet Netscape. Their browser dominant 70 percent usage share, allow determine network extensions catch on. Netscape's strategy, Gates wrote, move key API browser commoditize underlie operate system. THE BROADER INQUIRY: GOVERNMENT SEES arm-twisting The federal government states recently broaden allegations Microsoft add evidence try bully Intel, Apple Computer Inc. companies squelch competition. They say like Netscape meet new evidence fits pattern behavior Microsoft, repeatedly try limit competition strong-arming competitors partners. One episode fit pattern, prosecutors contend, effort Microsoft pressure Intel shelve development multimedia Internet software limit cooperation Netscape. Intel's main business make microprocessor chips act electronic brains of computers run Windows operate system. Indeed, fortunes Intel Microsoft closely align two companies sometimes refer single, powerful entity, Wintel. But Intel also employ hundreds software engineers, mainly Intel Architecture Labs Hillsboro, Ore. And Intel Microsoft partners, also conflicts, typically direction pace certain innovations introduce personal computer industry, dominate together. Federal state investigators focus Microsoft's strong reaction work do Intel's software engineers sentiment express uncertain terms meet Intel's Santa Clara, Calif., headquarters Aug. 2, 1995. The contentious session attend several executives Intel Microsoft, include Gates Intel chairman Andrew Grove. An internal Intel memo state Gates make vague threats support Intel's competitors livid Intel's investments Internet want stopped. Later, Intel pull back multimedia Internet software development. Steven McGeady, Intel vice president attend August 1995 meeting, schedule appear witness government. Microsoft replies government's accounts meetings like Netscape Intel fanciful distortions, create use bias selection documents witnesses. The government's case, Microsoft asserts, betrays utter failure accept computer-industry reality Microsoft routinely meet companies make sure software equipment work well Windows. Sometimes talks, Microsoft says, go include levels cooperation like license technology Microsoft investment, company discuss Netscape. In trial, Microsoft expect argue advance browser market result business acumen Netscape's missteps. To document Netscape's errors, Microsoft issue subpoena last month obtain unpublished manuscript new book, compete Internet Time: Lessons From Netscape Its Battle With Microsoft, base hundreds interviews current former Netscape executives. The book chronicle mistakes make Netscape. But authors, Michael Cusumano Massachusetts Institute Technology's Sloan School Management David Yoffie Harvard Business School, think Microsoft hardly blameless. Microsoft's take-no-prisoners strategy backfired, invite retaliation competitors, government even customers, Yoffie said. emphasize offer legal judgment, Yoffie added, I think Microsoft could achieve 90 percent without cross line much did. THE SPYGLASS LINK: REWARDS AND PERILS OF A PARTNERSHIP On April 6, 1994, Gates 20 Microsoft executives gather daylong retreat far company's headquarters Redmond, Wash. The subject Internet might revolutionize computer software business. Few concrete plans make day, Microsoft executives insist direction set. Our vision outset unite two worlds Windows desktop Internet, say Steven Sinofsky, Microsoft executive attend meeting. Yet Microsoft badly trail Netscape browser field. To hasten entry, Microsoft license early browsing software Spyglass Inc. Naperville, Ill. The first meeting two companies initiate Spyglass April 1994. At time, tiny company eager deal Microsoft. Spyglass select commercial licensee browser technology develop National Center Supercomputing University Illinois. In summer 1994, Douglas Colbeth, president Spyglass, meet Clark Netscape O'Hare International Airport Chicago. The two men talk United Airlines Red Carpet Room, reserve business-class passengers, Colbeth recall Clark tell him, We're go take Microsoft head-on. At time, Colbeth recall think himself, Great, Microsoft really want license me. Today, noted: Remember, company couple dozen people almost money bank. Netscape Jim Clark, money reputation, big-time venture capital back Silicon Valley. Netscape different agenda. By July 1994, Microsoft become quite interested Spyglass technology, Colbeth says, two companies sign first license agreement follow December. Microsoft, Colbeth recalls, always tell would eventually fold browser technology operate system, timing accelerate Netscape's rapid rise. Microsoft initially hop charge browser, Colbeth said. But Dec. 7, 1995, Gates declare Microsoft would deeply integrate browser Windows would give away. The announcement catch industry, even Colbeth, surprise. At time, Spyglass license technology 82 companies, include IBM Digital Equipment, use software products license revenue stream $20 million year. As result Microsoft's move, Spyglass saw revenues vanish within year, small Internet software companies go business big customers shift Microsoft's free browser. Spyglass slash payroll scramble new niches software industry replace lose sales, succeed eventually. Whenever license technology Microsoft, understand someday build itself, drop operate system put business, Colbeth said. THE NONOPTION COMPAQ: SUDDENLY SEES THE LIGHT Well 1996, Netscape's share browser market continue rise, Microsoft make little headway, even though browser free. industry analysts trade magazines agree Netscape's browser clear technical leader. In April 1996, Netscape's Navigator use 87 percent people browse Web, compare 4 percent use Microsoft's Internet Explorer, accord Zona Research. So big personal computer maker, Compaq, think make sense give customers Netscape's browser instead Microsoft's. But Microsoft would stand Compaq choice give in. In June 1996, Compaq want load popular Netscape browser machines also remove icon Microsoft's Internet Explorer, deliver computer maker windows 95. Microsoft inform Compaq remove Internet Explorer, computer maker would lose license Windows, say Stephen Decker, Compaq's director software procurement, testimony federal investigators. The ultimatum Microsoft deliver bluntly letter headed, Notice Intent Terminate License Agreement. Faced deny essential operating system, Compaq quickly reverse course keep Internet Explorer icon. Microsoft assert Windows Internet Explorer single product Microsoft alone define product. Nothing contracts, Microsoft adds, prohibit computer makers include compete technologies. While cutoff letter Microsoft send Compaq seem unnecessarily hardball tactic deal large corporate customer, Microsoft chief operate officer Bob Herbold insists take one letter one snippet e-mail try portray Microsoft arrogant company unfair. Noting Compaq executive witness Microsoft, Herbold said, We totally dependent tremendous relationships key companies like Compaq. At Netscape, however, Compaq episode watershed. That singular act get go Justice Department, Barksdale recalled. Barksdale say regard Microsoft's tactic forcing Compaq buy browser condition obtain essential product, Windows operate system, illegal act absolute proof Microsoft monopolist. After investigate incident, Justice Department states agree Barksdale Microsoft illegally tie sale one product another. Microsoft replies long history add new features operate system. And outset, Microsoft says, intend Windows Internet Explorer browser would seamlessly integrated, Windows 98. Thus, Microsoft insists, product-tying violation antitrust laws. In separate case, federal appeals court side Microsoft, uphold principle company could put whatever want operating system declare single product. But June 1996, Compaq want offer Netscape product instead Microsoft's browser, industry experts view browser operating system two different software programs. It take long time integration strategy play out, say former senior Microsoft researcher. Back then, integration basically bolt browser onto Windows. THE `BALANCING ACT': AMERICA ONLINE TOSSES IN TOWEL America Online chairman Stephen Case refer deal Microsoft delicate balance act. That balance swing sharply fall 1995 spring 1996, Microsoft use lure give America Online feature place Windows desktop ultimate bargaining chip. To gain access computing's covet real estate, America Online agree make Microsoft's Internet Explorer main browser online subscribers, number 13 million. Yet throughout 1995, Microsoft prepare introduce Windows 95, significant improvement ever operate system, Case knock door Justice Department. His complaint Microsoft go place new online service, Microsoft Network, direct competitor America Online, prominently desktop screen Windows 95, introduce August. This bundling tactic use industry-dominant operate system market Microsoft Network, MSN, Case argued, give Microsoft unfair advantage young fast-growing online business. The Justice Department listen investigated. But ultimately, government decide take action. At America Online's headquarters Vienna, Va., Microsoft fear loathed time. America Online designate Microsoft watcher, young M.B.A. track adversary's every move. Above desk small, windowless office picture Gates. Beneath picture, large block letters, words THE ENEMY. Though America Online clear leader online services business, ample reason worry all-out assault rival rich aggressive Microsoft. When visit Microsoft headquarters couple years earlier, Case recalled, Gates bluntly assess Microsoft's options say could buy 20 percent America Online, enter online business bury you. A threat merely statement facts? A bit both, Case say recently. But mainly articulate everybody meeting kind intuitively understood. Yet 1996, Microsoft America Online find reason cooperate. With explode popularity Internet's World Wide Web, conventional online companies, like America Online Compuserve, provide customers Internet access well services. America Online browser, keep pace rapidly advance technology make sense deal Netscape Microsoft. For software companies, deal America Online, 5 million subscribers time, could mean big surge browser use market share. Netscape seem natural partner America Online, since companies Microsoft rivals. On March 11, America Online announce would buy Netscape technology, standard license deal base payment-for-use formula. The next day, America Online announce significant deal Microsoft make browser default technology browser America Online subscribers would use unless specifically ask Netscape's Navigator. To win deal, Microsoft offer give America Online start-up icon Windows desktop precisely kind equal treatment main Windows screen Case ask Justice Department require Microsoft. After agree Internet Explorer browser, Microsoft allow us bundle Windows desktop, Case said. It example Microsoft's pragmatic side. The pragmatic decision paramount corporate goal increase browser market share protect mainstay software business. As result, new online service, MSN, would sacrifice important marketing advantage main rival, America Online. It Bill's decision, say former MSN general manager Russell Siegelman, refer Gates. He send e-mail it. He say think would hurt MSN much. I disagree him. To Microsoft executives, Gates express different view likely impact MSN. He tell senior vice president Brad Silverberg put America Online Windows desktop would amount put bullet MSN's head, accord deposition take Justice Department. In antitrust suit, government asserts America Online deal show Microsoft use power Windows monopoly give edge browser war Netscape. David Colburn, senior vice president America Online take part browser negotiations Microsoft, witness government. Today, Microsoft overhaul Internet strategy focus mainly build popular special-interest Web sit fields like travel, personal finance, automobile retail news. And put sites, along e-mail search features, all-in-one site uses name MSN.com. I still regard Microsoft primary threat, Case observed. Microsoft history get right long run, there's reason think business well. We always Microsoft's cross hairs. THE LESSON: DON'T CONFRONT A STEAMROLLER At Netscape's headquarters Silicon Valley, strategy today one avoid head-to-head competition Microsoft whenever possible. Don't something Microsoft's path that's lesson learned, observe Clark, Netscape chairman. Silicon Valley's venture capitalists, investors finance many nation's high-tech startups, generally follow Netscape formula days. Yet still leave ample room prosper. For compete directly Microsoft dangerous, software industry whole engine wealth creation, job generation technical innovation. And ambivalent side venture community's relationship Microsoft. For start-up cannot steer clear Microsoft entirely, favor option buy Microsoft, scoop many fledgling companies way acquire promise technology people. Microsoft understand start-up innovation co-opt start-up innovation better high-tech company, say James Breyer, manage partner Accel Partners, venture capital firm. As Microsoft grown, come see merely competitor force nature shape business environment, like weather front. Microsoft incredibly pervasive, say Stewart Alsop, partner New Enterprise Associates, venture capital firm Menlo Park, Calif. At board meetings companies firm invested, two issues always come up, said: One price company's stock, Microsoft go do. In last years, Microsoft offer guidance almost yearly meetings senior Microsoft executives lead venture capitalists. The meetings part Microsoft's effort improve sometimes prickly relations Silicon Valley. We work hard provide clarity we're go we're going, say Greg Maffei, Microsoft's chief financial officer. last year's conference take place October Quadrus office building Sand Hill Road Menlo Park, Wall Street high-tech venture investing. Maffei lead team five Microsoft executives appear group 40 venture capitalists, one stood ask question seem minds many peers: How I invest company stay way steamroller? Maffei, recall one person attend meeting, stand delivered brief lecture businesses Microsoft likely avoid. His list include specialized software manufacturing, human resources management, computer-aided design others. But, person noted, broad swaths industry appear designated limits include new software platforms might compete Microsoft's personal computer operate system. At one point, Ruthann Quindlen, partner Institutional Venture Partners, lean Vinod Khosla, co-founder Sun Microsystems partner venture capital firm Kleiner Perkins Caufield &AMP; Byers, say quietly, I guess leave us wash machines toasters. follow text first two sections Sherman Act, pass Congress 1890. As foundation federal antitrust law built, act amend several times elevate crime felony, increase fines prison terms individuals set fines corporations convict violate it. In case Microsoft, government invoke Sherman Act file civil suit seek change company's business practices, criminal suit seek financial penalties. An Act Protect Trade And Commerce Against Unlawful Restraints Monopolies: Section 1. Every contract, combination form trust otherwise, conspiracy, restraint trade commerce among several States, foreign nations, hereby declare illegal. Every person shall make contract engage combination conspiracy, shall deem guilty misdemeanor, and, conviction thereof, shall punish fine exceed five thousand dollars, imprisonment exceed one year, say punishments, discretion court. section 2. Every person shall monopolize, attempt monopolize, combine conspire person persons, monopolize part trade commerce among several States, foreign nations, shall deem guilty misdemeanor, and, conviction thereof, shall punish fine exceed five thousand dollars, imprisonment exceed one year, say punishments, discretion court. Will matter consumers Bill Gates nice guy? Until last week, Americans think Gates, chairman Microsoft Corp., genius innovator. A nerd perhaps also self-styled visionary almost single-handedly unlocked power personal computer. Monday, however, Washington courtroom, Justice Department begin paint different, darker portrait Gates. In antitrust suit bring department 20 states, man whose company command 97 percent share market personal computer operate systems depict nixonian schemer go almost length crush competition. Product innovation, suit argues, sufficient weapon Gates. Flashing back forth snippets Gates' videotape deposition e-mail messages send contradict testimony, government seek establish pattern threats offer payments Microsoft chairman. It also seek cast Gates obsess man fear tiny Netscape Communications Corp. potential threat domination market Internet browsers, software use navigate World Wide Web. Gates portray Justice Department litigator David Boies schoolyard bully rid roughshod computer industry crudeness stark contrast popular image benevolent dictator high-technology guru. accord document present Boies, example, Gates ask America Online executives 1996: How much need pay damage Netscape? This lucky day. The implication, Boies said, amount irrelevant, Microsoft, deep pockets market dominance, make many offers can't refuse need achieve goals. Microsoft officials closely watch market surveys hint new image bare-knuckled Gates might detract company's world-famous brand name, insist public continue draw distinction allegations anticompetitive business tactics company's software. Despite read press, people judge us products, say Mich Matthews, head Microsoft's corporate public-relations office. Our experience people vote pocketbooks. So far, consumers cast positive votes. last week Microsoft report quarterly profits $1.52 billion, stun 58 percent increase level year earlier. Despite record profits, marketing experts say public come view gate rockefeller-style robber baron, company brand name may suffer. When company visible chief executive, CEO really driver brand, say David Aaker, brand marketing expert Haas School Business University California Berkeley. There question go affect Microsoft's brand recognition. Already early warn signals, political cartoons newspapers across country bash Gates last week. One show hold globe saying, If play way, I'll take ball go home; another portray Microsoft chairman stand next henchman dangle someone window Microsoft secretary say caller, I'm sorry, Mr. Gates busy teach competitor Windows. But industry analysts believe new view Bill Gates know play hardball may bad thing company. The he-said, she-said round e-mail messages drag court cases Washington Silicon Valley, Microsoft lock legal battle archrival, Sun Microsystems Inc., view little different exaggerated trash talk go professional sports. It's like take Charles Barkley Michael Jordan say ball court turn something sinister really is, say Paul Andrews, co-author Stephen Manes Gates (doubleday, 1993). Indeed, evidence darker view Gates company far take root District Columbia Silicon Valley, computer industry long felt impact Gates' tactics, bitterness distrust Microsoft deep. In rest country, Gates continue enjoy great popularity. Two weeks ago, speak crowd almost 7,000 students Indiana University, questioner ask Justice Department's suit roundly booed. BILL GATES, WHIPPING BOY c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service Is Bill Gates high-tech Machiavelli, Public Enemy no. 1 threat know universe? All three, judge numerous political cartoons pop newspapers across country last week. From Chattanooga Boston, cartoonists take delight demonize Gates, face unexpected public relations challenge Microsoft's antitrust trial unfolds Washington. other cartoons run gamut predictable (a worker, point aquarium large fish gobble small ones, say visitors, Welcome Microsoft's research development department) weird (a dweebish man hunch front computer screen star words: Our beloved leader, Mr. Gates, attack. Leave possessions. Go desert. Await spaceship). And Week One trial. Stay tuned. A federal judge Friday push back start date antitrust trial Microsoft Corp. four days, Oct. 19, also order company comply Justice Department's request examine Microsoft's financial records. Microsoft argue allow army government attorneys come make demands make difficult us remain business. But win assurances government lawyers would make narrow, target searches records, Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson U.S. District Court District Columbia order Microsoft open database perusal. Microsoft ask trial delay several months prepare defense say last minute broaden case Justice Department, add new evidence. last month, government say process prepare trial discover Microsoft try persuade Apple Computer market Quicktime multimedia software Windows customers. On Thursday, Justice Department 20 states add two new people witness list testify Microsoft dealings Apple Sun Microsystems. Avi Tevanian, former Apple executive, add witness list part describe Microsoft's proposal, Microsoft deny ever made. The new witness James Gosling, Sun executive lead development Java, Internet program language Microsoft see potential threat company's dominance software market. The government charge Microsoft take illegal steps prevent Java gain wide acceptance. To counter that, Microsoft name two new witnesses Friday, Robert Muglia, senior Microsoft executive work Sun, Chris Engstrom, executive handle Microsoft's dealings Apple. At time, John Warden, Microsoft's lawyer, argue new allegations place case. The Justice Department, Warden tell judge, try turn something approximate plenary monopoly case like IBM case. It become clear clear clear new file try turn broad case, said. You can't bait-and-switch file complaint allege A, B, C, talk whole alphabet three times over. As result, Warden said, Microsoft wanted, minimum, another two-week delay, even though normal schedule would trial start next year. The judge respond. instead enter order set Oct. 19 trial date. Late Friday, Microsoft enter formal motion ask another two-week delay. A response expect next week. The case United States vs. Microsoft Corp., government's aggressive move monopolist almost 25 years, play century antitrust laws broadly word court rulings ambiguous sides cite rulings support oppose arguments. Whatever outcome trial, schedule begin Monday U.S. District Court Washington, almost certain appeal leave Supreme Court task bring legal order 100 years clash antitrust doctrines. The case focus Microsoft's Windows, operate system control 90 percent personal computers sell today. The government say objective curb illegal monopolistic business practices threaten render large parts economy vulnerable vicissitudes single company. Microsoft assert case intend give government control feature add Windows. however grand economic stakes, legal dispute narrow. The government say Microsoft's contracts computer manufacturers companies provide access Internet illegally stifle competition. The contracts prohibit manufacturers substitute Netscape Communications Corp.'s Navigator browser Microsoft's Internet Explorer. They also prohibit remove Windows main screen, desktop, links sit World Wide Web run Microsoft partners. Microsoft's contracts companies connect people Internet businesses sell goods services Web require favored treatment Internet Explorer Navigator exchange links Windows desktop. In wake lawsuit, Microsoft voluntarily drop requirements, though could reinstate will. Microsoft say contracts legal produce tangible benefits customers, include easy Internet access. The Justice Department say bundle Explorer Windows 95 inclusion browser part windows 98 amount tying, illegal practice forces customers one product purchase another. The contracts manufacturers Internet services illegal, government says, intend create monopoly browser market protect Microsoft's exist monopoly operate systems. The latter threat key, accord Justice Department. Browsers potential, like operating system, act software platform programs run. so contracts intend drive browsers market would also insulate Windows monopoly. Many antitrust experts say problem facing Justice Department courts provide clear definition tie clear guidelines determine contracts illegally exclusionary. Professor Lawrence White New York University, chief economist Justice Department's antitrust division early 1980s, say courts treat tie unusual practice fact ubiquitous. No one, said, would challenge right manufacturers tie erasers tip pencils, tires automobile buttons shirts. His point, share widely among economists, tie benefits consumers if, example, results products easy use enables company recover development costs. But tie bad locks monopoly power. The courts, White says, offer enough guidance distinguish good tying bad, nub legal dispute. Microsoft say need show bundling Windows Explorer passes might call gross consumer benefits test offers immediate benefit, whether causes long-term damage competition and, therefore, ultimately consumers. The Justice Department say Microsoft's practices must clear high hurdle: yield net consumer benefits immediate large enough balance possible long-term harm competition. So test consumer benefits satisfies antitrust laws? The simple answer one know sure, sides reasonably cite cases without fear embarrassment. Consider 1985 case, Aspen Skiing Co. vs. Aspen Highlands Skiing Corp., 1951 case, Lorain Journal Co. vs. United States. In first, Aspen Skiing, owner three major ski run Aspen, Colo. monopolist years sell ticket cooperation Aspen Highlands, competitor, give skiers access companies' runs. When Aspen Skiing unilaterally cancel agreement, rival's revenues shrivel rival sued. The Supreme Court rule Aspen Skiing violate antitrust laws evidence action help consumers. In Lorain Journal case, local newspaper Lorain, Ohio, refuse sell advertising companies advertise new radio station. Here, too, Supreme Court rule exclusionary practice nothing benefit consumers. Indeed, Aspen Skiing, court even force monopolist business rival, precedent augurs well Justice Department, seek force Microsoft install Netscape's browser alongside own. But Charles Rule, legal consultant Microsoft, say cases courts throw exclusionary practices offer consumer benefit. The courts, argues, never pounce practices result low prices better products service. Nor courts either case call balance immediate benefits hypothetical long-term harm. Rule argue Microsoft's practices produce demonstrable consumer benefits. Besides, says, unlike actions take The Lorain Journal Aspen Skiing, Microsoft's contracts prevent consumers instal Netscape's browser use Web sites Microsoft's rivals. In truth, though, neither case answer consumer benefit test apply product design. In Jefferson Parish Hospital District no. 2 et al. vs. Hyde, another case cite sides, Supreme Court 1984 recognize surgeons anesthesiologists provide integrate service. Yet, court said, hospital monopoly power would still allow force surgical patients use panel anesthesiologists consumers want purchase two services separately. That principle could undercut Microsoft's defense functional interdependence Windows Explorer require bundling. But Microsoft point strong concurring opinion call tougher standard government meet alleges tying. Microsoft also draw support several court rulings allow IBM change design computers ways make hard vendors attach peripheral equipment. But perhaps Microsoft's best argument nowhere government identify single case courts explicitly call throw tie product basis balance test. The courts, Microsoft emphasize, steer clear redesign technically sophisticated products. The Justice Department's rejoinder note sole purpose antitrust law protect consumers, make sense bless practices provide dollar's worth benefits today but, stamp competition, drive prices $1,000 tomorrow. The Justice Department ask court least insist monopolists use least exclusionary means possible achieve whatever services provide customers. Experts agree courts subject Microsoft's restrictive contracts Internet companies balance test. But exactly court decide whether consumers help hurt grabs. A balance test would court weigh immediate benefits consumers one-click access Internet sit features bundle windows-explorer package versus harm time diminish competition markets browsers operate systems. But test make good sense theory prove fiendishly difficult use practice. Balancing test impossibly difficult arbitrary, say Rep. Thomas Campbell, R-Calif., former law professor Stanford University. The practical effect balance hand defendants like Microsoft almost certain victory. Microsoft argue many antitrust experts agree courts fact gravitate away balance test toward simple predation test exclusionary contracts. Under standard, contract illegal intend drive competition thus pave way monopolist raise prices later. Microsoft easy time defend charge predation, amounts victimize customers, would defend charge bundled product consumers slightly harm good. The antitrust record, say William Baxter, head antitrust division President Reagan, litter contradictory, ambiguous sometimes nonsensical verdicts. He legal experts agree nothing else, record leave plenty legal leeway Supreme Court, hear Microsoft case, stiffen spine antitrust law. Shortly government file antitrust suit Microsoft Corp. May, Joel Klein, assistant attorney general charge Justice Department's antitrust division, meet Silicon Valley executive. The executive recall tell Klein unless case go beyond Internet browser market, would little effect Microsoft's power stifle competition across computer industry. Klein reply understood computer executive's concerns. But say time run short strong evidence hand involve Microsoft's battle Netscape Communications Corp. market so-called browser software use navigate Internet. This Netscape case, executive recall Klein saying. But five months later, case government bring trial Monday extend well beyond Netscape browser war embrace describe recent court file broad pattern anti-competitive conduct Microsoft. Netscape, government insists, still prime example pattern one several examples. The 12-person witness list Justice Department 20 states sue Microsoft reflect new evidence add case since May. James Barksdale, Netscape's president chief executive, appear first, follow executives represent cross section nation's high-technology companies include Intel, IBM, Sun Microsystems, Apple Computer, America Online Intuit. In bring ambitious, complicate case trial one file may, government choose high-risk strategy. The law state new evidence add suit filed, new charges. And so, federal courtroom Washington, U.S.District Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson could decide rule new evidence range far afield original suit. But government wins broaden case, court-ordered remedies would doubt far tough Microsoft. In May, government's suggest steps amount equal treatment Netscape's browser Microsoft's browser. But government recently ask judge hold separate hearing remedies, win case. The remedies consideration include basic changes Microsoft's business practices perhaps even breakup company intend loosen Microsoft's grip computing. That would precisely kind sweeping reform Microsoft's foes would applaud. The government double bet double stakes, say David Yoffie, professor Harvard business school co-author book, Competing Internet Time: Lessons From Netscape Its Battle With Microsoft. Meanwhile, Microsoft camp, government's strategy dismiss desperate act take court rule June threaten undermine antitrust suit. That rule come separate case, involve interpretation consent decree Microsoft sign Justice Department 1995. In June ruling, federal appeals court say Microsoft could bundle browser industry-standard Windows operating system call one product. The appeals-court ruling would seem undercut assertion government's current antitrust case browser operate system two separate products, bundle together give away effort thwart competition browser market. With appeals-court ruling June, government lose heart case, say Charles Rule, former senior official Justice Department, consultant Microsoft. So take blunderbuss approach scramble throw everything find even evidence Justice Department years gun barrel see hits. The June appellate rule shake prosecution team. But mostly strengthen hand within Justice Department urge case broadened, accord people work investigation. At time, say, new evidence come investigation move ahead prosecutors race meet accelerated trial schedule approve court. Speed priority outset, say. The Justice Department states file suit May move Microsoft's new operate system, windows 98, introduce June. While seek block release Windows 98, government lawyers want get the courtroom early possible pc makers computer users adopt late version Microsoft's Windows operate system, functions central nervous system 90 percent personal computers sold. The key allegations, government lawyers note, change since May namely, Microsoft illegally use market power operate systems defend monopoly position try extend new markets. But thing wrap bow time May filing browser, say one person work case. The real game plan always get broad case. What more, one person noted, prosecution team full strength shortly suit filed. David Boies, renowned courtroom litigator former partner Cravath, Swaine &AMP; Moore successfully defend IBM 13-year confrontation government, name special counsel Justice Department last December. But Boies, leave Cravath last year, start work full-time Justice Department mid-april, still finish private cases firm, Boies &AMP; Schiller. The antitrust suit file May lean heavily Netscape story, mention Microsoft's main rival browser market 130 times complaint support memorandum. But also prominently mention Microsoft's tactics Sun Microsystems, creator Java, Internet program language, cite example Microsoft's behavior. It craft template could add without much stretching, one person involve case said. And so, new evidence pile seemed fit pattern, Klein step step approve widen case, person said. And explains, person continued, evidence hands Justice Department years add case since May; gather new evidence become apparent old material fit pattern current case. For example, government add contention Microsoft pressure Intel Corp., big microchip maker close partner Microsoft, curb development efforts multimedia Internet software might conflict Microsoft's plans. The government contend arm-twisting occurred meetings two companies three years ago, especially one Aug. 2, 1995, attend Andrew Grove, Intel chairman, Bill Gates, Microsoft chairman. Part government's evidence Intel-Microsoft episode copies handwritten notes take Steven McGeady, Intel vice president attend meetings, memo write Aug. 28, 1995. The memo, still court seal, say Gates make vague threats livid Intel's investments Internet want stopped. A handwritten note, also court seal, quote Paul Maritz, Microsoft executive, say Netscape common enemy Intel's role fill stuff around Microsoft's strategy. These documents send Intel Justice Department's office San Francisco November 1995, response Civil Investigative Demand civil subpoena serve Intel Nov. 10, 1995. On own, Intel material intriguing, become part antitrust suit evidence surfaced, one person close case said. The government contend Microsoft also try urge Apple stop selling Quicktime multimedia software Windows market try convince Real Networks Inc. pull back market so-called stream software. The government case also broadened, people involve case say, witnesses industry increasingly willing testify. In beginning, people industry believe government would lose Microsoft would retaliate come forward, one person said. But strength case perceive improve, people willing come forward, things snowballed. You get Intel, easy get Apple on. ","Business rivals are seeking to break Microsoft Corp.'s monopoly on computer operating systems.The Government and 20 states have filed an anti-trust suit against Microsoft, invoking the Sherman Anti-trust Act of 1890.The suit began with a Microsoft vs Netscape battle over browser software but now extends far beyond that aiming at Microsoft's overall aggressive anti-competitive conduct.The effort is extensive but inconsistent because of the ambiguity of anti-trust laws, especially the Sherman Act.The Government is examining Microsoft's financial records and painting a dark image of its Chairman Bill Gates.An unpublished book may be crucial to the trial.","In 1998 the Justice Department filed a civil suit against Microsoft to change its 9-year pattern of anti-competitive conduct.Bill Gates appears a schemer ready to crush competitors by any means.He uses Microsoft's clout to squelch internet competition.A 1996 Netscape complaint over browsers was central to the case, which grew to include Intel, IBM, Sun, Apple, AOL, and Intuit.Microsoft was ordered to let Justice examine its records and sought a trial delay.An unpublished book provided evidence.The 1890 Sherman Anti-Trust Act centered on Standard Oil and was intended to protect consumers, but its wording is broad and rulings have been ambiguous.","The Justice Department and 20 states filed a suit against Microsoft for violation of the Sherman Act, charging it illegally tried to use its dominance as the provider of Windows, the industry standard operating system, to stifle competition in other areas.At the heart of the case are Microsoft's contracts with computer manufacturers that prohibit them from substituting Netscape's Navigator browser for Microsoft's Internet Explorer, but Justice also alleges Microsoft exhibited a broad pattern of anti-competitive conduct with numerous other software companies.Microsoft says that Windows and its browser is one tool that offers immediate consumer benefit.","The government suit against Microsoft is the most aggressive antitrust case in a quarter century.The heart of the case is the Internet browser battle between Microsoft and Netscape.Microsoft says that its Internet Explorer is an integral part of its Windows system, the industry dominant operating system.Microsoft, it is argued, has told computer manufacturers that if they want Windows, they must forgo Netscape.The Justice Department and 20 states are joined in the action brought under the Sherman Antitrust Act.Microsoft's chairman, Bill Gates, usually seen as a visionary is portrayed in much darker tones in the trial."
