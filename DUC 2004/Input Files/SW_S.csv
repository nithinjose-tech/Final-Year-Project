player win rule, nba intend renew it motion disqualifi feerick. the motion wa brought last summer ground that no collect bargain agreement exist and, therefor, he had no jurisdict hear matter. if he rule our favor, i think it embolden spirit and resolv player, said billi hunter, union execut director. but we understand that won't end lockout. it just mean they have pay 200-some player. and there is still other litig aliv that may take while resolv. at most, it' hollow victori. feerick will have taken full 30 day render hi decis. whatev he decid, hi rule will be watch care. there is no preced

argu that owner should have protect themselv insert claus non-pay lockout and strike individu player contract. in support it argument, union point claus few individu player contract that contain languag preclud payment lockout. the leagu is reli basic tenet labor law, which hold that employe not be paid strike or lockout. a rule union would be signific all futur negoti player and owner. the deterr factor lockout is that employe subject collect bargain agreement do not get paid onc agreement expir and they are unabl reach new agreement. if feerick find favor player, there will be no econom incent those guarante contract reach agreement quickli. they would essenti be paid not play basketbal. if feerick find favor owner, realiti not be paid may spur player reach agreement more quickli. but hunter disput thi notion, and confer call friday talk openli entir season' be cancel player would back away their ultim goal. i'm not all concern, hunter said. there' been no demonstr that there' go be chang our resolv. after player saw these propos leagu and recent postur nba owner, well, i had two player call me and tell me, if need be, they'd be will hock everyth they'v got. anoth signific develop may be thedepartur mani player europ disput is settl, accord least two player agent. i think it would be case-by-cas basi, ye, there' alreadi some peopl talk that, said bill strickland, member union' agent advisori committe. steve kauffman, anoth member committe, said he would explor possibl that one client, net center roni seikali, would sign profession team greec. we wouldn't look void hi deal team, kauffman said. but we would want him have right him work temporarili he could come back and honor hi contract.' russ granik, nba deputi commission, said leagu ha approv idea players' earn live elsewher lockout is settl. propos exchang last week that includ concept luxury-tax system player salari appear reflect first sign progress negoti lockout began juli 1. but side have term figur each other' propos unaccept, and it wa unclear whether either side wa will compromis. i don't think we should get too carri away possibl just yet, granik said. when they explor idea tax system, we were take player their word that they want make some headway. but call their first propos meaningless is charit. they propos someth that ha no impact. as it stand, that can't be solut. the owners' goal is slow growth player salari relat leaguewid revenu next three year, while player want keep earn much possibl. as labor battl go, current one nation basketbal associ and it player is weird sport standard. there is real possibl that most, if not all, come season will be cancel. in thi union battl it is interest best paid, not those who make union scale, that are domin discuss. and here it is some worker, not manag, who are tri make union disappear. the current arrang ha produc unbalanc pay scale immens proport. last year more player ever receiv union minimum, then $242,000 rooki or $272,000 veteran. the number player make $1 million $2 million year middl class, nba term fell sharpli. but michael jordan made $33 million. thi should not be surpris. sport is entertain busi, not movi. big star get million, while most get union scale. over year, nba effort stem rise salari have fail. the most import loophol it salari cap let team sign it free agent it is will pay. when that wa adopt, it wa assum that no team would pay lot more rival could pay. but it ha not work out that way. in current negoti, leagu ha offer guarante that it payrol will rise 20 percent next four year, $1 billion $1.2 billion, and say it is open propos split that money ani way player want, whether rais minimum salari or guarante rais veteran. the union say it is worri that middl class, seem determin preserv free market. the leagu got it broadcast, nbc and time warner' cabl channel, agre pay thi year' televis fee whether or not there are ani game broadcast. (they will be paid back later year, either reduc fee or extra game show.) owner hope player would think manag wa will wait them out, and come term onli small part season cancel. but union is act unhurri. it turn asid request negoti thi week, say player had meet first. then there is issu union suicid, tactic that wa reject player 1995. the idea is that if player had no union, it would be illeg antitrust law owner collud. the sky would be limit. that tactic might fail. the court could reject union decertif vote sham, and ani case some player may fear that team would feel free offer less old union minimum. but if player go that rout, it could be long time real negoti get go. billi hunter, union' execut director, warn owner thi week that prolong lockout could destroy league' popular. that wa what all seer said four year ago, when baseball' world seri wa cancel labor troubl. but fan memori are rel short, and now basebal seem more popular ever. with that mind, owner and player may choos

for exampl, if player made $20 million, team would be forc put $1 million fund that would most like be distribut low-revenu team. there could be provis made some player, said jeffrey kessler, chief

accept normal! they are school, and they should realli be hospit or place nutrit rehabilit. if you saw them refuge camp, you would recommend immedi intervent. but sever deplet public health and hospit system, that option doe not exist, she and said. mani korean doctor do not know how diagnos or treat malnutrition; few had seen it thi decad. and, ani case, hospit lack food and proper nutrit supplement. swedlund said most hospit lack medicin, had no glass replac broken window and were colder out, have receiv no coal 1994. he said that hospit, sanit and water purif system were virtual nonexist, becaus countri lack chlorin purif and fuel run water pump. he said that next year, red cross would start address those problem, spend $3.5 food hospit patient and $1 million water treatment. with few other option, vast number north korean have resort eat substitut food, hard cake and noodl made mix nutrit plant, soybean and sweet potato, combin indigest filler, cornstalk and straw. thi

and she note that research nutrit survey were allow select villag visit and enter home random. worker red cross and world food program said they had not observ extrem scene peopl die acut starvat and believ that they would have if they were occur frequent. i have not seen acut starvat i have seen bangladesh, dr. katona-apt said. but that doesn't mean it can't exist. we'r still realli limit what we can see. swedlund said it wa unlik that counti still close foreign were markedli differ open one. and while some have surmis that close counti might harbor pocket death and devast, he said he accept north korea' explan that they had been exclud some area nation secur reason. one thing i'v learn is how import nation secur issu are north korean, said swedlund, retir admir swedish navi. and i realli

","Despite economic problems and threats from the Asian Olympic Committee that it would move the games, Thailand was able to meet construction deadlines and open the 13th annual Asian Games to participants from 43 countries.The games have not been without controversy.In a surprise move, Saudi Arabia pulled its athletes from the games, probably in reprisal for a jewel theft and the murder of three of its diplomats.There was speculation that the Saudis would send a ceremonial delegation.National rivalries also were Apparent in a snooker game between India and Pakistan when an argument Arose following a disputed call.","Bangkok prepared for the 6000 athletes from 41 nations to compete in the Asian Games.Thai police detained more than 300 beggars to make the city's streets safer, but its notorious night life concerned some team managers.China considered recalling overseas soccer players to bolster chances at the Games.Saudi Arabia abruptly withdrew its 105-man team citing the approach of Ramadan but more likely for past grievances with the Thais.Later, they considered sending a ""small team"".The Iranian equestrian team's horses failed the vet's exam.The Thai King opened the Games with an elaborate ceremony.Rivals India and Pakistan argued during a snooker match.","Despite concern that corruption, incompetence and financial failure would delay or prevent Thailand's ability to host the Asian Games, Bangkok was ready for the December 6 deadline.After an extravagant opening ceremony, the games went well despite a brief soccer brawl, a snooker game incident, the banning of Iran's equestrian team horses for not being disease free, and the withdrawal of Saudi Arabia over strained relations with Thailand.Thai police cleared the streets of beggars and criminals, and athletes were disciplined to avoid Bangkok's night life.China's recall of four soccer players from Europe is testimony of the importance of the games.","The Asian Games scheduled for Bangkok Dec. 6-20, 1998 were never a sure thing.Thailand was in economic doldrums and there was question whether the sports complex for the games would be completed in time.By late October, however, it was clear the games could take place.Thai police rounded up beggars who might intimidate spectators, but then in late November Saudi Arabia withdrew its teams and there was concern that athletes might be tempted by Bangkok's nightlife and the availability of Viagra.But on Dec. 6 the games opened as scheduled as 6,000 athletes from 41 nations competed, including a heated snooker match between India and Pakistan."

","China arrested an activist on the eve of signing an international human rights agreement.It arrested an activist against official corruption and refused a monitoring group permission to operate.The China Democracy Party was founded during Clinton's visit to China.Founders were arrested for harming national security, sparking protests.One activist fled to NY.The arrests and speedy trials showed China's resolve to prevent opposition to the Communist Party.Defendents were prevented from getting lawyers so defended themselves.Their trials lasted only two hours each.The judge cut off one defendent's arguments and a US official was barred from a trial.","Although China was expected to sign a key U.N. human rights treaty, it continues to question and arrest political dissidents.Qin Yongmin was arrested following his attempt to form a human rights monitoring group.Fellow dissident Xu Wenli was arrested for trying to form an opposition party.Another dissident flew China for the U.S. to avoid arrest.In making the arrests, China has charged that the dissidents have threatened national security.Facing trial, Xu Wenli and Qin Yongmin were unable to obtain legal counsel.Qin Youngmin, attempting to defend himself, was cut off several times by the judge in a trial lasting just over two hours.","China continues to arrest dissidents even as it prepares to sign a UN human rights treaty and to host the first visit by a British PM in seven years.The dissident China Democracy Party believes it is legal to challenge the communists' power monopoly, but the PRC cites a ""grab-bag"" section of the criminal code making almost any political activity illegal.The US has protested the arrests.Two dissidents, Qin Yongmin and Wang Youcai must defend themselves at trail since lawyers have been dissuaded from assisting them.Other dissidents continue to be harassed and arrested.One dissident, Yao Zhenxian, was released from a labor camp and fled to New York.","On the eve of China's signing the International Covenant of Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR) in October 1998, police detained Chinese human rights advocate Qin Yongmin for questioning.Eight weeks after signing the ICCPR, Chinese police arrested Qin and an associate in the China Democracy Party (CDP), Xu Wenli, without stating charges.Another CDP leader already in custody, Wang Youcai, was accused of ""inciting the overthrow of the government"".Qin and Wang went to trial in December for inciting subversion.Police pressure on potential defense attorneys forced the accused to mount their own defenses.Xu Wenli had not yet been charged."

Livingston rallied forces against him, but ultimately Gingrich accepted defeat agreeing to cede the speakership and his seat in the House.He blamed his defeat on blackmail by Republican cannibals."

serious undermin government' antitrust suit softwar giant. from legal standpoint, thi propos deal pull rug out govern, william neukom, microsoft' senior vice presid legal affair, said monday morn courthous step. the reason thi assert, microsoft say, is that propos deal demonstr that netscap and larger softwar industri are healthi and vibrant all illeg and anti-competit practic alleg government' suit. but david boi, government' lead attorney, said all that wa irrelev. whatev deal end be if there end be deal is not go remov ani obstacl that microsoft ha place path competit thi industri, he said. michael lacovara, microsoft lawyer who wa question govern wit, economist frederick warren-boulton, suggest him trial monday that propos acquisit undermin warren-boulton' argument, that microsoft seem head obtain monopoli internet browser softwar match one it appar hold oper system. after all, 22 percent american who use internet reach it america onlin. and present aol use microsoft' web browser, internet explor, service' default choic. in exchang that, microsoft place aol advertis and internet link window 98. lacovara ask wit whether, onc aol' servic contract expir januari, he would expect aol continu distribut microsoft softwar. ye, warren-boulton respond. it is not all clear me that aol' incent do thi is chang thi propos merger netscap. he note that america onlin offici had said their need be onlin servic featur window forc them accept microsoft term establish internet explor default choic. lacovara then ask warren-boulton question that lay hi entir cross-examin wit and microsoft' larger assert monday propos netscape-aol deal. sure thi combin, he ask, tell you someth natur competit softwar industri? warren-boulton' answer wa probabl not one lacovara had been after. to extent that thi potenti merger is result microsoft' action these exclus contract and other action, he said, it is unfortun see disappear firm netscap, brightest, newest star. warren-boulton' purpos stand govern is establish that microsoft doe have monopoli operating-system software; more 90 percent world' comput use microsoft oper system. that is foundat most government' case feder antitrust law forbid certain behavior monopolist that would be legal firm that face healthi competit. through repeat, circumlocuti question, lacovara tri make case that microsoft' overwhelm market share wa ephemer. the softwar industri is so vibrant and fast move, he suggest, that microsoft could be toppl it posit ani moment point view compani encourag it employe. on friday and monday, lacovara repeatedli point out that other compani are place other oper system market, and some softwar compani princip microsoft' greatest rival are write softwar these new system. but warren-boulton argu that exist these fring competitor oper system market doe not mean ani way that microsoft doe not have monopoli power. on monday afternoon, lacovara made issu success appl

is aliv idea and competit zeal, punctuat profan and exclam point. the second week trial end prosecutor be frustrat becaus lengthi cross-examin microsoft' lead lawyer left no time govern show sever hour videotap deposit bill gate, microsoft chairman. with new wit, execut appl comput inc., take stand monday, it is uncertain when gate tape will be play. the justic depart and 20 state su microsoft believ that tape will strengthen their case becaus it show gate say he wa not involv plan take what govern alleg were illeg step stifl competit internet softwar market. the gate videotap, said david boi, justic department' trial lawyer, offer opportun judg gates' credibl. but gate credibl gap, if there is one, becom issu not becaus videotap becaus hi tape remark can be compar and contrast e-mail he wrote and receiv. the e-mail record, govern insist, show gate waist-deep plot anti-competit deal and bulli tactic that he deni or profess have never heard hi tape deposit. if hi machin are central government' case, whi not summon gate trial? the govern doe not need put gate stand, becaus we have hi e-mail and memoranda, stephen houck, lawyer state, told court. the microsoft legal team ha month been prepar it e-mail defens. first, microsoft argu, anyth that look damag is taken out context. i urg your honor, john warden, microsoft' lead lawyer, told judg thoma penfield jackson, view consider skeptic crazi quilt e-mail fragment that seem form core government' case. but microsoft ha also mount e-mail counterattack, cull million messag it obtain subpoena competitor pretrial discoveri. warden' cross-examin ritual is present govern wit intern e-mail hi compani and then pose declar question. these interrog have two refrains: isn't it true your compani doe exactli what you are accus microsoft do, and isn't it true that microsoft prevail not becaus it is predatori monopolist becaus it superior technolog? microsoft is accus tri prod compani stay out it way. so last week, exampl, warden produc e-mail stephen case, chairman america onlin, suggest partnership netscap commun corp. which compani would focu their respect strength. that divis labor, case wrote, would be best way achiev goal that marc andreessen, netscape' cofound, describ earlier e-mail beat beast from redmond that want see us dead refer microsoft' headquart redmond, wash. printout e-mail are just anoth form

sweep govern antitrust investig high-technolog compani where e-mail ha supplant telephon most common instrument commun. e-mail ha just revolution investig thi kind, one senior justic depart offici

former senior offici justic department' antitrust divis who is now brook institut. it can also be power ammunit point contradict testimoni. and that is what govern will do attack gates' credibl hi videotap deposit, taken three day august. the govern offer glimps that strategi first day trial. it show few brief clip point deposit when gate wa ask meet june 21, 1995, which, govern alleg, microsoft offer divid browser market netscap and make invest compani, which is it chief rival that market. in tape deposit, gate say he recal be ask one hi subordin whether he thought it made sens

wrote, buy piec them or someth. the contradict gates' deposit and hi e-mail, though, doe not itself speak issu whether microsoft made illeg offer netscap. to be sure, it is what microsoft not what it

","In October 1998 amid worldwide financial crises, particular concern focused on Russia where economic meltdown was exacerbated by conflicted politics.President Yeltsin's latest Prime Minister, Primakov, was supported by Communists and when word leaked out that a Communist economic program was under consideration, Yeltsin denounced it.Primakov then assured the public that ""there is no program,"" suggesting that there would not be until the International Monetary Fund (IMF) came forth with a massive loan.IMF demanded a sound economic program before approving loan payment.Meanwhile neighboring Ukraine felt economic effects of the IMF-Primakov standoff.","Early October was fraught with economic woes as the International Monetary Fund prepared for its annual meeting.The IMF faces criticism for ignoring the social costs of its actions and being a pawn to Western demands.A small cut in US interest rates lowered markets worldwide.Russia, whose economy collapsed in August, was looking for a cure--possibly instituting Soviet-style measures.Key issues were stopping dollars from leaving the country and getting foreign investment end IMF loans.The postal service was in chaos, owing everyone.Demonstrations were expected.The Ukraine also struggled, especially to keep banks working.An IMF loan was on the way.","As world finance an banking representatives met in Washington, the economic news continued to be bleak.IMF officials had predicted had predicted a banner year, but stocks continued to slide worldwide and the DOW probably would record its worst third quarter loss in eight years.Russia and Ukraine have been especially hard hit by the crisis.In Russia, Prime Minister Primakov had no plan to solve the problem as the economy continued to Suffer.Postal service was threatened as the Post Office could not pay its bills.President Kuchma of Ukraine called for changes in market reform even as the Parliament turned down a bill to restore lost savings.","Fifteen months of world economic turmoil are threatening political stability.Lowering Federal Reserve interest rates is not countering the crisis.IMF is worried about the turndown in Japan, economic meltdown in Russia, depression in Indonesia, and anxiety about Latin America where investors are pulling out.IMF critics say it needs to understand national politics better and focus on social issues.Russia's economic confusion is upsetting the US.Russia is considering hard currency controls, demanding IMF loans and will not end government privatization.Ukraine, affected by Russia, is trying to save its fast-developing money system and keep investors."

","In early October 1998 Turkey moved 10,000 troops to the Syrian border accusing its neighbor of harboring Kurdish rebels and their leader Abdullah Ocalan.Syria denied the charges and blamed Turkey's belligerence on its military alliance with Israel.As the dispute threatened to ignite the whole volatile region, Egypt's President Mubarak launched a mediation effort soon joined by Iran and Jordan.Saudi Arabia, Yemen, Sudan, Lebanon and Greece voiced support for Syria, but all called for a diplomatic solution.Israel did not take sides urging diplomatic talks and insisting that Israeli-Turkish military cooperation played no role in the crisis.","Tensions rose between Syria and Turkey over claims that Syria harbored Kurdish rebels, Turkey's growing ties with Israel, and Turkish dams on the Euphrates.Turkey sent 10,000 troops to the Syrian border.Israel declared non-involvement and limited border exercises.Egypt's President traveled to Syria and Turkey to mediate.Jordan urged the interests of the region and offered to mediate, as did Iran.Lebanon denied harboring Kurds, sided with Syria and blamed Israel for tensions, but urged peace.Greece said Turkey undermined stability but urged neighbors to get along.The Saudis, Yemen and Sudan supported Syria but urged peace.Assad was to visit Turkey.","Tensions between Syria and Turkey increased as Turkey sent 10,000 troops to its border with Syria.The dispute comes amid accusations by Turkey that Syria helping Kurdish rebels based in Syria.Kurdish rebels have been conducting cross border raids into Turkey in an effort to gain Kurdish autonomy in the region.Egyptian President Mubarek has been involved in shuttle diplomacy to the two states in an effort to defuse the situation and Iraq also has offered to mediate the dispute between the two countries.Although Israel has tried to demonstrate its neutrality, Lebanon has charged That Israel is the cause of the tensions between Syria and Turkey.","On October 1, Turkey moved 10,000 troops toward the Syrian border, and later sent jets along--possibly across--the border.Turkey warned Syria it could no longer tolerate Syria's sheltering Kurdish rebels in Syria and Lebanon's Bekaa Valley.Fighting with Kurdish rebels began in 1984.The Syrian denial included claims that Turkey was taking water and had a strategic alliance with Israel.Egypt, then Iran and Jordan, sought to defuse the situation and find a diplomatic solution for the two Muslim nations.Greece, predictably, chided Turkey, while Israel denied involvement and limited its military activities along the Syrian border."

","On Friday the shuttle Endeavor carried six astronauts into orbit to start building an international space station.The launch occurred after Russia and U.S. officials agreed not to delay the flight in order to orbit closer to MIR, and after a last-minute alarm forced a postponement.On Sunday astronauts joining the Russian-made Zarya control module cylinder with the American-made module to form a 70,000 pounds mass 77 feet long.NASA estimates 43 more launches and 159 more space walks are needed to assemble the complex.When completed the 16-nation space station will be longer than a football field.It will be used to study adaptation to space flight.","Russia and NASA jointly decided against a Russian cost-cutting proposal to orbit the 2nd space station, a 16-country cooperative project, closer to Mir, citing complexity, risk, and bad sun angles.After 5 years of assembly, the research station will house 7 people.A 12-day shuttle mission will attach the US Unity module to the Russian Zarya, already in orbit.Thursday's launch was delayed by a pressure drop.A 2nd attempt Friday was perfect.Unity was attached to Zarya in a blind docking using cameras and computer images.Electrical and cable connections come next.Unity will serve as a passageway for future modules.Two Zarya antennas failed to deploy.","After discarding a suggested change of orbit, the Russian Space Agency went ahead with plans to launch its Zarya module of the international space station on Nov. 20, 1998.Although delayed for a day, U.S. plans to launch the space shuttle Endeavour carrying the U.S. module Unity and six astronauts were carried out on Dec. 4.The astronauts' job was to connect Unity with the already-orbiting Zarya as the first step in assembling 100 major components of the planned space station.Using the shuttle's 50-foot robot arm, the two modules were joined setting the stage for a spacewalk by two astronauts the next day to attach electrical connectors and cables.","The International Space Station when completed will have a million pound mass and be longer than a football field.It will house up to seven space explorers.The initial assembly of space station components involves linking the US Unity, carried into space by the shuttle Endeavour, with the Russian Zarya.The Russians had asked for a different launch profile in order to be able to transfer equipment from its MIR station, but that was not possible.Endeavour astronauts successfully completed the complicated maneuvers to join the two space objects.NASA estimates that 43 more launches will be required to completely assemble the 16-nation space station."

regul examin such transact would dissect each busi, determin whether it market is global, nation or more local, and determin whether combin entiti ha too high concentr busi those area. expert agre that regul are most like permit exxon and mobil keep their exploratori and oil product busi becaus those area are alreadi highli competit and merger would not result higher price. hervey said those market are alreadi so fragment that combin market share major american and european oil compani is onli 17 percent. they have been downsiz, cut back and re-engin. so when 900 or so remain blue-collar

trust, which wa broken suprem court 1911. exxon wa then known standard oil new jersey, and mobil consist two companies: standard oil new york and vacuum oil. as oil price have plummet level last seen mid-1980, oil compani have been pressur cut cost. exxon, which ha market valu $176.7 billion, and mobil, which ha market valu $61.1 billion, have histori be fierc independ, and have alreadi cut back

which would review how much industri combin compani would control. analyst and invest banker were split logic potenti deal. some point difficulti that compani could face if they were combin. if you ask me if exxon need be bigger, answer is probabl no, said garfield miller, presid aegi energi advisor corp., small independ invest bank base new york. it is hard say that there is anyth particular gain. in particular, miller said, two compani have enorm similar their domest refin and market busi. they realli do overlap quit bit, he said. you realli do wonder what is benefit all that redund. anoth invest banker energi busi, speak condit anonym, also question rational discuss merger. when you look bp-amoco deal, you can ration it, banker said. but none those reason appli exxon-mobil deal. but ami jaff, energi research analyst jame a. baker iii institut public polici, said combin two compani would be logic, part becaus it would give them greater influenc bid develop project middl east. thi is deal that make sens, ms. jaff said. with thi combin compani, there is no project that would be too big. ms. jaff said propos deal would provid each compani asset area where it had littl

","Exxon and Mobil discuss combining business operations.A possible Exxon-Mobil merger would reunite 2 parts of Standard Oil broken up by the Supreme Court in 1911.Low crude oil prices and the high cost of exploration are motives for a merger that would create the world's largest oil company.As Exxon-Mobil merger talks continue, stocks of both companies surge.The merger talks show that corporate mergers are back in vogue.Antitrust lawyers, industry analysts, and government officials say a merger would require divestitures.A Mobil employee worries that a merger would put thousands out of work, but notes that his company's stock would go up.","In a move considered unthinkable a few years ago, Exxon Corp. and Mobile Corp, have entered into negotiations which could result in a merger of the two companies.Such a merger, should it occur, would form the world's largest oil company and the largest U.S. company, placing it above Wal-Mart.The merger, and talks like it among other oil companies, is being prompted By low petroleum prices and high production costs.Talks of a merger have sent the price of stocks of both companies soaring.The merger could prompt anti-trust action and the merging companies would have to divest themselves of some interests.Mobile workers fear a merger will cost them jobs.","Exxon Corp and Mobil Corp are reported to be discussing a business merger.Other oil companies have merged to compensate for low oil prices and increasing costs of oil exploration in more remote areas.The mergers are consistent with a trend in corporate marriages that is changing U.S. economic history.The mergers are pushing stocks up and the Exxon-Mobil merger could benefit consumers and lead to further savings.Some people believe the merger would require selling of large corporate pieces and put thousands out of work.If the companies merge, it would be the largest U.S. company and bigger than the world's largest oil company, Royal Dutch/Shell Group.","Exxon and Mobil consider merger.Partnerships already formed.Oil prices are lowest in 12 years and future exploration will be costly.The new company would be largest in the US and put back together pieces of Standard Oil, a monopoly broken up by courts.Experts mixed on merger's advantages.It would be an anti-trust test, since companies are involved in many facets of the business, require the sale of large units.Refinery workers, others would lose jobs.There is an upswing in corporate mergers, pushed by bull market and recognition that it's hard to increase revenue internally.Merger anticipation sent stocks higher in oil, internet and computers."

","During the Clinton impeachment debate in the House, Speaker-elect Bob Livingston declared that he would set an example for the president and resign from Congress over revelations of his marital infidelities.Republican demands that the president also resign were rejected by Democrats who also said that Livingston should not quit and that the Speaker-elect's resignation was, in the words of Jerrold Nadler (D-N.Y), ""a surrender to sexual McCarthyism"".With the House vote to impeach, the president will face a Senate trial, but it is unlikely that 67 members will vote for conviction.The trial could be mercifully shortened, however, by a vote of censure.","As impeachment proceedings in the House approached a climax, House members were stunned by an admission from House Speaker elect Livingston that he was guilty of an adulterous affair.The admission follows disclosures by Hustler published Larry Flynn, who had offered one million dollars to anyone who could provide such information on a House or Senate member.Livingston's admission was met with a standing ovation by House members, as was his subsequent resignation.In resigning, Livingston called on President Clinton to do the same.Political pundits see the whole process as driven by partisan politics.","House Speaker-elect Robert L. Livingston was forced to admit to his Republican colleagues his past adultery.This was forced by an investigation by Larry Flynt.When Livingston called for Clinton to quit, House Democrats yelled, ""You resign""!Stunningly, he did.TV commentators were caught off guard.Livingston put pressure on Clinton to follow his example.The House moved to impeach Clinton and called on the Senate to try him.Livingston's downfall was said to show a breakdown in legislative civility.Those who want impeachment were called radicals and fanatics.Livingston's pursuit of Clinton was characterized as ""rabid"", showing his own hypocrisy.","House Speaker-elect Robert Livingston shocked his Republican colleagues in the midst of a Clinton impeachment debate by admitting to adulterous affairs during his Congressional tenure.He later urged Clinton to follow his example and resign that increased the fury of the impeachment debate.The House moved to impeach the President for perjury and called on the Senate to try him, convict him and remove him from office.Some who believe the debate shows the fanatical, partisan, and hateful side of Republican behavior, advise the Senate only to censure Clinton and thus avoid partisan vengeance.The issue deepens a cultural fissure and a sense of uncertainty."

",NASA and the Russian Space Agency readied the first part of an international space station for launch from Baikonur base.They decided not to change the orbit of the Zarya module as Russia had requested.Zarya's Nov. 20 launch was a success.The Zarya module orbited Earth for 2 weeks before a rendezvous with U.S. shuttle Endeavor to join it to the Unity module.It was tweaked and working well.It will serve as a space tugboat.The first 2 building blocks of the international space station were successfully joined by Endeavor astronauts in the shuttle's open cargo bay.Endeavor astronauts made 2 of 3 planned spacewalks to work on the space station modules.,"Russia launched the first piece of the international space station into orbit a year after the originally scheduled date.The launch follows a last minute Russian request to change the orbit of the space station to put it closer to Mir.This request was set aside.Two weeks later, the U.S. carried the Unity chamber into orbit.U.S. astronauts aboard the Endeavor shuttle then joined the Unity chamber to the Russian Zarya control module.The resulting 7 story structure appeared to be a perfect fit.In a subsequent second space walk, the astronauts were to install antennas on the Unity chamber as well as to attempt to unjam a Russian antenna.","Jerry Ross and James Newman spacewalked to attach antennas to Unity, the American half of the first stage of the 16-nation space station.Unity will be a connecting passageway for other modules.The other portion of the fledgling station, the Russian- built and launched Zarya module, will provide power and propulsion to the facility.The successful launch of Zarya, which had been delayed over a year due to funding woes, was hailed by the Russian Space Agency head as proof that the Russian space industry ""is perfectly able to fulfill all of its commitments on the international space station"".Russia is scheduled to launch the crew module next year.","After a year's delay Russia launched the first unit of the international space station, then pushed it to a higher orbit.Zarya will provide propulsion, power, and comms.US shuttle Endeavour made a blind docking with Zarya.Two spacewalks made electrical connections with Unity, which will serve as a passageway, attached its antennas and attempted to open a stuck Zarya antenna.A Russian cost-cutting proposal to orbit the station closer to Mir jointly vetoed.Russia promised to destroy Mir but now wants to extend its life.Russia sold early research time on the station to NASA to pay construction costs but claims the management lead for 1st 5 years."

","North Korea agreed to receive a U.S. delegation to discuss concerns about an underground site feared to house a nuclear weapons program.South Korea supports the U.S. and calls for full access to the site by U.S. inspectors.North Korea denies the concerns and proposes a $300 mil payment to visit the site.President Clinton in Seoul cautioned North Korea to focus on diplomacy, not nuclear ambitions.North Korea has threatened war against U.S. if the dispute comes to blows.The issue threatens to jeopardize North and South Korean peace talks to improve relations.A recent U.S. official's visit toi North Korea revealed serious economic problems.","In August, US intelligence found a underground construction site near North Korea's nuclear complex.North Korea, suffering a devastating famine, claims the site is civilian and offered an inspection for a $300 million payment.This follows their August missile launch and suggests they are reneging on the 1994 agreement to end nuclear development in exchange for US aid.Clinton discussed these developments with allies during his November trip to Asia.He warned US troops in South Korea of increased danger, but has not directly attacked Kim Chong-il.North Korea has begun its militant posturing as the date to discuss this construction with the US nears.","The meeting of the US, China, and the two Koreas in Geneva appeared to ease tension on that Asian peninsula.However, indications of a revived North Korean nuclear program clouded President Clinton's ""economics and security"" Asian trip.North Korea's economy is bad, malnutrition widespread, yet the country maintains a 1.1 million military force.Past US food and fuel aid to that country has been based on it not promoting a nuclear program.The US policy on Iraq is the removal of Saddam Hussein.Now, apparently the US supports dumping PM Mahathir Mohamed in Malaysia.President Clinton visited US troops at Osan Air Base in South Korea on his Asian trip.","S. Korea says N. Korea may be producing plutonium in at least one underground site.Satellite photos show a possible nuclear complex.If it is, it will strain U.S.-N.Korean relations and stop aid.The U.S. wants a delegation to check the site.N. Korea wants huge payment for inspection.A recent missile test firing over Japan, N. Korean incursions into the south, and the suspicious site are major causes for concern.The U.S. demands full access to the site and warns N. Korea not to waste a chance for lasting peace on the peninsula.N. Korea says the U.S. is pushing it to the brink of war over demands for inspections and talks."

instead, they repeatedli ask him how he would vote impeach presid clinton. look, i'm not go make ani comment respect that subject matter, d'amato respond. i am not just citizen. i am citizen-sen who may be call make decis. but d'amato is someth els well: candid what may be tightest senat race nation. and variat hi ellipt respons can be heard senat race countri, where republican and democrat are encount similar question. all which suggest that hous vote thursday author impeach inquiri, thi year' 34 race us. senat have becom, what they alreadi were, elector equival juri select. if hous vote impeach clinton, matter goe senat, which must decid two-third major whether convict him and, thu, remov him offic. as result, monica lewinski matter ha suddenli inject new disrupt forc senat contest. voter, those who support clinton, expect their polit leader, republican or democrat, renounc clinton' behavior, and candid have been do that. but impeach is anoth matter; most poll show nation is it. the danger senat candid is that impeach now real possibl, debat may move president' behavior which there is littl disagr more problemat issu whether he should be remov offic. for most strategist involv race, there is littl guidanc how handl impeach issu. advis candid parti said interview last week that they were perplex and worri, unsur what they can or should do issu gain advantag or guard harm. i can't tell how thi one is go go, said mike russel, spokesman republican senatori campaign committe. thi is veri surreal environ. of 34 senat seat play, 18 are held democrat and 16 republican, who now hold 55 seat all. republican would have win 28 34 race produc 67 vote necessari convict, assum such vote were go parti line. onli elector catastroph democrat, which seem almost unthink, could produc such huge loss. jennif duffi, who follow senat race cook polit report, nonpartisan newslett, said that so far, least, none senat candid ha made explicit appeal vote base how they would vote presidenti juri. but she and are wonder if thi may be chang. thi is difficult ground measur. one central question thi polit year ha been how clinton' deal ms. lewinski might affect turnout. for long time, politician assum that dispirit democrat would stay home rebuk clinton, just mani republican novemb 1974, three month presid richard m. nixon resign. but now some analyst wonder if partisan fight congress last week might have effect some democrat. that' problem, said stuart rothenberg, editor independ polit newslett washington. it' not that we don't know, and that politician don't know, where gener public stand impeach. the problem is that we don't know where elector stand impeach. and ask voter think ahead impeach proceed they cast their ballot senat race is, word stuart steven, republican consult, doubl bank-shot. such strategi, he said, tend work onli small number single-mind or sophist voter. against that complic backdrop, prevail think is that use impeach issu will vari race race, state state and week week, depend circumst candid and composit elector. if democrat tri turn imag clinton dock their advantag, it would be state democrat edg or sizabl number black voter, who overwhelmingli support presid. in contest those, it might well prove be interest democrat candid to, one consult put it, sit front camera and tape advertis which candid denounc president' behavior solemnli pledg vote impeach. strategist parti believ that kind approach could prove effect. thi is issu where there is huge disconnect elit and public, said fred yang, democrat consult client wisconsin and carolina. that kind democrat strategi might emerg california, new york, illinoi, wisconsin, washington and perhap arkansa. by contrast, democrat south carolina, georgia and nevada would be less like oppos clinton' impeach. on other side, republican consult are tell their candid stress clinton' misde and stay away talk impeach. the last thing parti want is turn senat elect referendum whether clinton should be forc offic. the white hous might think overal public number that mayb they would make thi referendum elect, said ed goea, republican pollster who is work senat race thi year. republican certainli aren't go let that happen. d'amato respond question clinton languag that republican consult have been suggest their candid. when and if that matter come senat, i will decid fact that are present me that time, d'amato said. it would be veri prematur me suggest ani cours action it be refer. becaus, inde, we may be call act juri some kind. but schumer, member hous judiciari committe, which is conduct impeach investig, virtual embrac issu. in live telecast hear, he said presid deserv lesser punish, such censur or reprimand. and schumer plan campaign new york monday clinton hi side. schumer' media advis, hank morri, seem suggest last week that impeach will grow issu. senat d'amato claim he doe not want share hi opinion peopl new york, morri said. and if he doesn't have opinion, he' onli new yorker who doesn't have opinion. ask if schumer would rais issu televis commerci, morri responded: we don't talk what we'r go do. i wouldn't rule it and i wouldn't rule it out. ","Acknowledging his mistakes, Clinton supports Democrat candidates and speaks at fundraisers.He backs Mary Boyle of Ohio in her bid for U.S. Senate.Democrat candidates try to limit the effect of the Lewinsky debacle on their campaigns.A N.Y. labor union backs Democrat Schumer to keep Republicans from gaining a 60-seat majority.Sen. D'Amato sidesteps queries about Clinton's impeachment on the campaign trail.A gay group may back D'Amato, the prospect of which is upsetting Democrats.House Republicans are using idle time to get votes on issues to help their campaigns.The National Republican Congressional Committee sponsors deceptive fundraising calls.","In addition to the usual factors that prevail in Congressional elections, this year's is complicated by the uncertain effect of the impending impeachment of President Clinton.The president has admitted mistakes, but remains a popular campaigner for House Democrats.In the New York race between D'Amato and Schumer, both are seeking union and gay/lesbian endorsement.Republican Voinovich hopes to take the seat of retiring John Glenn in Ohio.A budget agreement between Republican congressional leaders and the White House is needed soon to avoid a government shutdown.A leadership award from Speaker Gingrich's office is merely a pitch for contributions.","President Clinton's impeachment woes are causing problems for the approaching mid-term elections.The President stopped apologizing, saying he must ""live with the consequences"" of his mistakes, and urging democrats to take pride in his achievements.Democratic candidates hope to contain the Lewinsky debacle while trying to prevent a Republican majority in the Senate.In New York, the Human Rights Campaign may endorse both candidates.In Ohio, Republican Voinovich is in a crucial face-off with Democrat Mary Boyles.Republicans are using a bait-and-switch routine to earn funds from small business.Their House votes are on topics to boast about back home.","In tight congressional and Senate races leading up to the Nov. 1998 elections, strategists and candidates were unsure how to deal with the Clinton/Lewinsky scandal.Though the President pointed to his record while stumping, many Democrats, embarrassed by his behavior, distanced themselves from him.With impeachment a possibility, the Senate races assumed even greater importance.While it was unlikely the Republicans would win enough Senate seats to remove the President, Democrats feared their opponents could gain a filibuster-proof, 60-seat majority.The NY senate race between Republican D'Amato and Schumer was one of the tightest in the nation."

","South Africa's Truth and Reconciliation Commission, appointed to reconcile the sides involved in the crimes of the apartheid era, is releasing its final 2.5- year report.Its purpose is to identify those who committed gross violations of human rights.The report is to lay most of the blame for the violations on the State, but the ANC also shares blame.The program offers amnesty to the accused if they confess but execution if they refuse.The process has angered many people of all walks of life.De Klerk, Apartheid's last president, is not being implicated but he is suing to stop publication.Criminal cases are nonetheless expected to go on for six years.","South Africa's Truth and Reconciliation Commission headed by Desmond Tutu proposes amnesty to heal the wounds of the apartheid era.If those accused of atrocities confess, they will be given amnesty, if not, they will be prosecuted.The Commission's report said most human rights violations were by the former state through security and law enforcement agencies.The African National Congress, Inkatha Freedom Party, and Winnie Mandela's United Football Club also shared guilt.Former president de Klerk, who shared the Nobel Peace Prize with Nelson Mandela, was not named as an accessory after the fact, since his threatened lawsuit would delay the report.","South Africa Truth and Reconciliation Commission's 3,500-page report on apartheid-era atrocities was issued on Oct 30.This report was intended to clear the air, grant amnesty to those who confessed, and begin the healing process.Those named for prosecution were warned before the release.Ex-prime minister de Klerk's name was removed.The ruling African National Congress remained.While the white government bore the brunt of the blame, several black movements were included.After the release many talked of a new amnesty period or a limited time to prosecute.Prosecutions could take 6 years; diverting judges, threatening elections, and slowing recovery.","The Truth and Reconciliation Commission, which was established to look into the human rights violations committed during the long struggle against white rule, released its final report.In what has been described as one of the most complete reports of its kind, the commission blames most of the atrocities on the former South African government.The ANC also came under fire for committing some atrocities during the struggle.Nelson Mandella's ex-wife, Winnie could be prosecuted for the part she played in such violations.Missing from the report was De Klerk, who threatened to sue if he was mentioned in connection with the atrocities."

","Dr. Barnett Slepian, the mainstay of Buffalo's only abortion clinic, was slain as he stood at his kitchen window.Slepian has been described as a fatalist who stubbornly adhered to doing what he thought right.The FBI is looking for James Kopp for questioning as a material witness in the slaying.Kopp has long been identified as a major voice in the anti-abortion movement.Attorney General Reno will investigate if the slaying is part of a nation-wide plot.In Canada, authorities are worried that new violence could erupt as Remembrance Day approaches.Anti-abortion pamphlets have been delivered to a Canadian newspaper, possibly by Kopp.","On Oct. 23, 1998, a sniper killed Dr. Barnet Slepian, a mainstay in the last abortion clinic in the Buffalo area and one of only a few doctors performing the procedure in the face of protesters and threats.Many of the protesters are itinerants like Rev. Norman Weslin, founder of the anti-abortion group Lambs of Christ, who travel about spreading their message and shutting down clinics.Another itinerant demonstrator, James Charles Kopp, is wanted by the FBI as a material witness in the Slepian murder.In addition to anti-abortion violence, a shortage of doctors who are trained and willing to do the procedures imperil their widespread availability.","The primary doctor at the last abortion clinic in Buffalo, NY, was shot and killed.Dr. Slepian, a stubborn man, dedicated to women's care, and an unlikely martyr.It's the 7th such death, and the 4th similar attack.James Kopp is sought as a material witness.The anti-abortion movement has local and itinerate members.Their activities go from prayers and talking to confrontations, threats and violence.After this killing, the FBI resumed a search for an anti-abortion conspiracy.Since the first few years after Roe v Wade, the number of abortions has declined, as has the number of clinics and doctors providing the procedure, especially for poorer women.","Abortion clinics continue to be targeted by anti-abortion groups such as Operation Rescue, Lambs of Christ, and Army of God.Opposition ranges from silent vigils to vocal and physical intimidation, and even murder.Dr. Bart Shepian of Buffalo's only abortion clinic was murdered in his home.Police in the US and Canada are looking for James Kopp, a known abortion opponent, as a material witness in that murder.The clinics serve poor, young, and uneducated women since the well-to-do use their established providers.AG Janet Reno has named a task force to find out if the Slepian murder, the third in five years, is part of an organized campaign of violence."

","A fire at an overcrowded dance hall in Goteborg, Sweden killed 60 and injured 180.Most victims were 13-18, immigrants covering 19 nationalities.The 2-story brick building was rated for 150 but held 400.Owned by the Macedonian Association, it had been rented out to 8 party arrangers for a Halloween dance, held on the 2nd floor.One of two exit stairways was blocked by fire.A panicky phone call in poor Swedish to authorities took 3 minutes to understand.Fire trucks were on the scene 6 minutes later.The explosive, fast-spreading fire reached 600C.It may have burned undetected for some time.Arson was a possibility but the cause remains undetermined.","Sweden's deadliest fire occurred on Halloween when a dance hall in Goteborg, filled with teenagers, burst into flames.The cause is not known, but the hall, approved for 150, contained as many as 400 and one of the two exits was blocked.Sixty were killed and between 150 and 173 injured.Most were immigrants or their children and represented 19 nationalities.Many felt the rescue was late.Rescuers said they had trouble understanding the first call, but were there in 6 minutes.Condolences came from Swedish authorities.A memorial service was held and a memory wall was growing.Although identifications are difficult, 40 of the dead have been identified.","At least 60 teenagers were killed and another 160 were injured in a dance hall fire in Goteborg, Sweden, Sweden's second largest city.The fire was the worst in Sweden's modern history.At least 400 teenagers, attending a Halloween dance, were crammed into a facility meant to hold 150.The dance attendees were mostly immigrant children from representing 19 nationalities, including Somalia, Ethiopia, Iraq, Iran and former Yugoslavia.The cause of the fire, which quickly engulfed the two-story brick building is unknown as investigators continue to probe the ruins.Emergency help was delayed by about three minutes because of language difficulties.","A fire rapidly destroyed a Goteborg, Sweden dance hall as some 400 teenaged Halloween revelers jammed up while trying to evacuate.At least 60 died, mostly from smoke inhalation, and about 150 were injured.The actual capacity of the 2nd floor dance hall was 150.Forensic experts are having success identifying the burned bodies but the question of how the fire began is still unanswered.The blaze gutted the entire building owned by the Macedonian Association.Mostly immigrants attended the dance.The fire squads say they lost about six minutes while trying to respond to a call in poor Swedish.It is doubtful a quicker response would have made a difference."

bat compani. these are world seri tree, aren't they? martinez could joke bat be special design world seri becaus yanke began their quest second titl three year when they play host san diego padr game 1 yanke stadium saturday night. major leaguer player who were watch televis could not imit david letterman and joke world seri wood. even though martinez ha struggl numer bat post-season, he could joke becaus yanke are still aliv titl. martinez is still aliv. for now, martinez, power hitter who ha mostli been miss action, could joke around. for now. you alway get fresh start post-season becaus it' game game, said martinez. if you win, you'v got anoth game next day so you forget bad at-bat. it' easier do that post-season becaus your next at-bat could be biggest at-bat season. normal, have martinez plate biggest at-bat season would be pleas sight yanke. but not when calendar flip octob. martinez ha experienc anoth frustrat post-season. he is 5 30 10 strikeout, no homer and onli 1 run bat hitting-starv team that ha bat .229 while still win 7 9 post-season game becaus superior pitch. can yanke continu win if martinez, their most valuabl run produc, is sometim singl hitter? we'v just gotten two good seri, said paul o'neil. the yanke won those seri. you don't focu one guy. you focu win. the whole team won. as much joe torr talk martinez need one line-dr hit get him groov, 30-year-old first baseman is career drought post-season. sinc join yanke, martinez is 20 107 (.187) one homer and 4 rbi 29 post-season game. those are puni statist, especi player who ha driven 381 run 455 regular season game last three year. i would guess that tino would have great seri, o'neil said. basebal ha way even thing out. you have bad seri, you come back and have great seri. in season, that' easier do. in post-season, it get tougher. it cannot get much tougher martinez, who wa drop fifth sixth order american leagu championship seri cleveland indian and will remain that spot further notic. martinez ha blame hi pauciti product impati and tri do too much. he ha sometim flail poor pitch hitter' count 3-1 and 2-0, instead work count, and he ha admit that hi previou failur post-season have caus him pursu obvious unattain five-run homer. actual, martinez ha alreadi made some alter, and he ha reach base 7 time hi last 10 plate appear doubl, singl, hit-by-pitch and 4 walk. it is not enough pacifi georg steinbrenn, it is someth him cling to. until last night, anyway, when martinez had face kevin brown, nasti right-hand who had retir him 30 34 career at-bat. if i wa get good pitch and miss them, then i'd say i have bad swing work, said martinez. but i'v been swing bad pitch. right now, i'v just got be patient and wait. the yanke will wait him. they have to. in 1996 world seri, torr start cecil fielder martinez first game 3, 4 and 5. it wa difficult decis becaus martinez had pace team rbi while fielder not join yanke juli 31. but yanke grab all three game so it work. torr doe not have such attract replac thi season lui sojo. so yanke will stay martinez, better or wors, while he tri stay posit and final produc. it' world seri, said martinez. you got go out there and have fun it. big game are all big game. you want go out there and enjoy that game and tri do your best win that game. you don't think that you might lose that day. chuck knoblauch and tino martinez were popular squeege men week ago, specul rampant that one or other or might be exil if yankees' histor year crumbl post-season. two big hit midst big inning chang all that saturday night game 1 world

yanke have done all season, forc starter game middl inning, exploit middl reliev. knoblauch, cours, had earn notorieti hi gaff game 2 american leagu championship seri cleveland, stand and wait interfer call ball roll stop him and decis run score. the yanke came back win seri, however; knoblauch got repriev and talk how much experi had help him. face wall one-bal, no-strik count, knoblauch

william wa intent walk. chili davi drew walk. base load, onc more, martinez come plate, exactli one run bat in hi first 76 career at-bat leagu championship and world seri game. with count two ball and two strike, langston threw pitch corner that he thought should have been strike. instead, garcia call it ball. langston glare, snap return throw. langston and martinez and everyon field now understood that base load and 3-2 count, langston would have throw what player refer cooki tasti pitch middl. martinez ate thi cooki. the ball soar upper deck right field, lift three year post-season miseri back yankees' first baseman, grand slam. the crowd call out martinez dugout again. like knoblauch, martinez pump arm, and later crowd would chant hi name, and martinez would wave hi cap. san diego' lead wa

have been hit, pull sink fastbal right field line two out. the fan foul line stood, some wave push ball fair bodi english, and ball land line, skip wall two runner score. the yanke had earli edg, they

wa silent. it would not stay that way. the moment truth chuck knoblauch came bottom first inning when hi name wa announc yanke stadium first time he neglect chase that memor loos ball last wednesday. there were no boo. it wa veri warm ovat. they like him. they realli like him. knoblauch exhal. knoblauch had emphas game that he wa concern win and rumbl world seri, not fan. but it sure made knoblauch feel home when he realiz that fan had forgiven him. victori, more time, had heal malic knoblauch and he could play second base earplug. when yanke defeat indian, 9-5, game 6 tuesday night advanc their second world seri three year, knoblauch wa easili most reliev player field. the aw mistak that he had made game 2 would be forgotten. the yanke had won pennant, and knoblauch wa celebr much anyon. to have them act that me wa tremend, said knoblauch, respons that he receiv. it wa great feel, and it realli help me out. knoblauch wa wear cap that declar yanke champion american leagu 1998; champagn drip brim he spoke. he not look up, continu talk how he had learn lot be vilifi make mistak that littl leaguer are expect not make. just face thing and take it man and answer all question, although they'r tough, knoblauch said. you see what you'r made when you have bounc back someth that. that' basic what i learn. if yanke had lost alc, some knoblauch' teammat had said that he would be brand villain fail pursu ball that glanc travi fryman' back while he wa run baselin. knoblauch had argu umpir while go ahead run score first and indian won, 4-1. now knoblauch can watch televis and read newspap again get queasi. that' huge him, david cone said. that' huge me. i let them back game, and that would have been tough one if they would have come back and beat us. and knobbi, i'm sure he' feel lot better now. knoblauch, who had two hit five at-bat, wa work hi second bottl champagn five minut report were allow clubhous. he flash sort smile that he had not shown too much recent and, now that yanke are world seri, knoblauch should expect be teas hi mistak. mayb if we go all way, we'll do that, derek jeter said. i don't know what i'll say, i'll think someth good. yanke pitch the start pitch enabl yanke advanc cleveland american leagu championship seri. david well is 7-1 hi career postseason and he should have addit edg padres' lineup that is gener less effect left-hand pitch. orlando hernandez ha four terrif pitch, pitch seven shutout inning pivot game 4 alc and earn start game 2 thi seri. david cone should benefit six days' worth rest when he start game 3, well be abl pitch warm southern california. mariano rivera' stuff might be good it ha been all year, and mike stanton continu be domin postseason pitcher. reason concern: errat andi pettitt, who need home-pl umpir call strike pitch low and away, and jeff nelson, who lost hi command hi last brief outing. offens there were sign alc that offens is come out it collect slump chuck knoblauch is get base consist, derek jeter is back drive ball right field and middl, berni william had three hit game 6, and scott brosiu ha been consist forc bottom lineup. but yanke do have holes: chili davi will be hard-press catch fastbal kevin brown and andi ashbi, and tino martinez' postseason funk is problem. the yanke could use contribut jorg posada, who will start game 1 and 2 and may get chanc drive pitch low strike zone, where he can hit power. defens the yanke have best defens basebal, excel middl jeter and knoblauch, and third brosiu. nobody' realli taken advantag fact that william ha poor arm center field, rest assur that ken camin, steve finley and greg vaughn will tri. the indian expos fact that yankees' pitcher have troubl prevent baserunn steal second third base. baserun the yanke run well they take extra base, particularli paul o'neil, brosiu, jeter and knoblauch go first-to-third; william can make mistak. the yanke probabl won't be abl steal kevin brown, who ha effect slide step, they could be aggress andi ashbi, or combin sterl hitchcock and jim leyritz. padr hit except jim leyritz, no one san diego lineup is particularli hot or particularli frighten moment. toni gwynn hasn't been consist he is, ken camin and greg vaughn have been streaki. but padr are veteran team capabl put ball play, get runner base and then move them along, and so long they are get except pitch, that' all they realli need. quilvio vera, leadoff hitter, is adept draw walk and steve finley, who ha becom more pull consciou last two year, could tri take aim right field stand yanke stadium. vaughn' power could be factor if yankees' pitcher don't jam him enough keep him lean plate. pitch kevin brown is best pitcher thi seri, capabl win three game if necessari, should padr manag bruce bochi choos start him game 1, 4 and 7. but some point, san diego will need big outing either andi ashbi or sterl hitchcock. when ashby' right, he' hit corner hi sink fastbal and hi slider, and when hi command is suspect, he get pound. hitchcock use hi split-fing fastbal great effect right-hand batter first two round playoff, yankees' left-hand hitter may caus him some concern. san diego' middl relief is weakest aspect team, randi myer and mark langston left side (the stuff each ha waned). but if lead can be deliv hand closer trevor hoffman, he'll keep it. defens they mostli catch ball and avoid mistak, though they are unspectacular. shortstop chri gomez and second baseman vera are adept turn doubl play, and camin won gold glove third base last year; walli joyner ha good hand first; center fielder steve finley is extrem quick track base hit and return ball infield. toni gwynn' rang is better right field line, not nearli good ball hit gap. the yanke will be abl run arm vaughn left field. baserun vera can steal base (24) thi year, and finley can tight spot, well. in gener, howev, padr are slow, plod team, though camin and vaughn are good go first-to-third, and gwynn won't make mistak base. pitch to the padr quilvio veras: a switch-hitt who ha more power right-handed; should tri pitch him down-and-in break ball when he' hit right-hand, jam him fastbal when he' bat left-hand. steve finley: a left-hand hitter who like pull ball. left-hand david well can beat him break ball low and outsid. toni gwynn: when he' hot, he' imposs. when he' not hit well, he can be anxiou earli count, and he should be fed break ball out strike zone. greg vaughn: big-tim power anyth high and plate. becaus he like pull ball, you must pitch him outer edg, occasion jam him keep him honest. ken caminiti: more power right-hand, better hitter left-hand. these day, he' good lowbal hitter and can be beat fastbal zone. walli joyner: with runner base, he'll tri jump fastbal earli count. is not strong hitter and can be jam. chri gomez: like derek jeter, like hit pitch out, right field and middl. he can hit power if you make mistak break ball. ruben rivera: an impati hitter who will chase pitch out strike zone. carlo hernandez: look first-pitch fastbal upper half strike zone. can struggl break ball. jim leyritz: no appar hole right now, can hit fastbal and away. best bet is get ahead count and tri get him chase break ball. pitch to the yanke chuck knoblauch: hard thrower jam him fastbal becaus he stand top plate, which is whi he get hit so often. derek jeter: sometim he ha tendenc chase pitch hi feet, if you don't get ball far enough, he can hammer ball wall right. paul o'neill: the yankees' best pure hitter, he sometim will chase fastbal and away, particularli there is one strike. berni williams: a switch-hitt who ha troubl resist chest-high fastbal. when he lay them, he is much better hitter, and he thi last game cleveland seri. chili davis: ha great eye and will work pitcher deep count, he can be overpow fastbal hi belt. cheat some now get hi bat start, make him vulner off-spe pitch. tino martinez: noth seem right moment. is anxiou and chase pitch out strike zone when he fall count, and isn't take advantag mistak when they'r made. scott brosius: a great break ball hitter, he can also drive fastbal long way when he anticip, cleveland' charl nagi now know. jorg posada: when bat left-hand, he fare veri poorli splitter, curvebal and slider. ricki ledee: like all young hitter, he ha tendenc expand strike zone and chase pitch out strike zone fall count. kevin brown like will attack him aggress. saturday' pitcher kevin brown: best sink fastbal game (91-93) mph, four-seam fastbal 95-97 mph throw high strike zone, slider that break and away right-hand batter, and forkbal that dive 88-89 mph. hold runner well. david wells: aggress, aggress, aggress, challeng hitter fastbal. hi curvebal can be except, and hi changeup ha improv. throw strikes: allow mani home run (29) walk (29), ha not allow three-run homer or grand slam all year. talk high expect. it' not just man tampa who ha them anymor. know their basebal well they do, everybodi joe torr famili pass

","Whether to use the 1st surplus in decades for a tax cut, to pay off the national debt, or for new initiatives made the 1998 federal budget negotiations chaotic.The Oct 1 start of the fiscal year was extended 5 times.Major issues were census statistical sampling, federal health plan coverage of contraceptives regardless of religious affiliation, and school aid decisions by the federal gov't or local jurisdictions.Other issues included a Federal Election Commission provision, a road through an Alaskan wildlife refuge, and an airline peanut ban.Committees crafted the budget document after broad agreement was reached when 8 bills were lumped together.","In 1998, for the first time in decades, the US budget negotiators faced a surplus.Both sides said this was harder than a deficit situation, but they finally spent $1.7 trillion.The last seven spending bills were the most difficult and finally were merged into one package.Controversial issues included health insurance paying for contraception, control of new education allocations, an Alaskan wilderness road, whether the 2000 census would include statistical sampling, and establishing an emergency fund.Conservatives felt the results favored the liberals, but both sides were satisfied and glad to finish before Election Day and avoid a government shutdown.","Budget negotiations between the White House and House Republicans were delayed on several issues.At issue were provisions that included requiring Federal Health Insurance providers to provide contraceptives to women as Well as a provision to build a road across a wildlife preserve in Alaska.The contraceptive issue faced an uncertain future while Clinton likely will veto the road.There is disagreement also on how to spend the funding on education.This year's budget discussions also have been hampered because it is the first time since budget procedures were established in 1974 that there has been a surplus, preventing agreement on a budget resolution.","After several deadline extensions, Congressional leaders and the White House agreed on an omnibus spending package, the final portion of the $1.7 trillion budget.It includes more money for education and defense, business tax breaks, and farm aid, as well as funds for Colombia to use in drug interdiction.To offset the new spending, the surplus will be tapped for $20 billion, to the ire of conservatives.This year, without the common goal of reducing the deficit, reaching agreement was very difficult.Policy provisions involving the 2000 census, contraception, and the Alaskan wilderness were also tied to the spending package and were hotly debated."

","Russian President Yeltsin's health was a hot topic in October.First he burned his hand.Next, in Central Asia, he cancelled public appearances and appeared disoriented.The trip was shortened due to a ""respiratory infection"".He was ordered to rest and take antibiotics.He then cancelled his trip to the Asian Summit.Although stoutly defended by his family, many Russians, including former supporters, suspect he is sicker, question his ability to do his job, and want him to resign.He has a history of health problems including heart bypass surgery.The court was to judge on whether he could serve a third term, but he already has said he will not run.","Concern over the health of President Boris Yeltsin has led many Russians to question his ability to govern.He has had multiple bypass surgery and is susceptible to respiratory ailments.Periods of illness have caused him to cancel foreign trips and on some travels, he was unable to attend all official functions.He is politically weakened, leaving others to grapple with Russia's economic crisis.Russia's constitutional court was to hold hearings on whether Yeltsin could seek a third term under their two term limitations since part of his first term was under the Soviet constitution.That appears to be moot point since he has said he will not run again.","President Boris Yeltsin's health has become a matter of great concern to the Russian leadership.The concern began in 1996 when he had a heart attack followed by bypass surgery.Illness has often sidelined him during his seven years in power.He recently cut short a trip to Central Asia because of a respiratory infection and he later canceled two out-of-country summits.This revived questions about his ability to lead Russia through any crisis.Yeltsin refuses to admit he is seriously ill and his condition is kept secret, even the cause for burns on his hands.Russia's leaders are calling for his resignation and question his legal right to seek reelection.","President Boris Yeltsin had a heart attack in 1996, followed by multiple bypass surgery.Doctors say his health is more or less normal but secrecy increases conjecture.The cause of minor burns on his hand were not disclosed.On a trip to Uzbekistan he walked stiffly, stumbled, rambled and seemed confused.Ceremonies were canceled and the trip ended a day early because of his bronchitis and a 99.3F fever.He was treated with antibiotics and ordered to bed but went to the office anyway.Calls that he turn over power were revived.He says he will not run again.He canceled an upcoming trip to Austria and sent PM Primakov in his place to an Asian summit."

and fact, 1993 commiss vote 2-2 question whether file formal charg. the deadlock serv dismiss. then, few month later, justic depart decid pick case. it wa farther most case we got, recal robert litan, former senior offici justic department' antitrust divis who is now brook institut. usual case would be two or three peopl complain and few document, he said. but thi wa fulli research record. they gave us file and brief us what they had done. the justic depart lawyer pick same thread. the gener idea our inquiri, litan said, wa that they should not be allow use their monopoli oper system cement

surprisingli, new complaint fill void. in may 1995, ann bingaman, assist attorney gener who head antitrust divis, remarked: we get complaint microsoft all time. we have becom kind microsoft complaint

in meantim, last may justic depart and 20 state attorney gener file their new suit microsoft, which is schedul trial monday. it contend that microsoft ha engag bundl, tie and other predatori behavior similar mani way numer previou alleg and investig last nine year. a good part thi case is just round ii case we dealt round i, earli 1990, litan said. or, former senior ftc offici put it, there' certainli common thread that run all way here. but year that thread ha been twist, pull and spun hundr differ hand. the case unit state vs. microsoft corp., government' most aggress move monopolist almost 25 year, is play out centuri antitrust law so broadli word and court rule so ambigu that side are cite same rule support their oppos argument. whatev outcom trial, schedul begin monday us. district court washington, almost certain appeal will leav suprem court task bring legal order 100 year clash antitrust doctrin. the case focus microsoft' window, oper system that control 90 percent all person comput sold today. the govern say it object is curb illeg monopolist busi practic that threaten render larg part economi vulner vicissitud singl compani. microsoft assert that case is intend give govern control which featur can be ad window. howev grand econom stake, legal disput is narrow. the govern say that microsoft' contract comput manufactur and compani that provid access internet illeg stifl competit. the contract prohibit manufactur substitut netscap commun corp.' navig browser microsoft' internet explor. they also prohibit them remov window main screen, or desktop, link site world wide web run microsoft or it partner. microsoft' contract compani that connect peopl internet and busi that sell good and servic web requir favor treatment internet explor navig exchang link window desktop. in wake lawsuit, microsoft ha voluntarili drop some these requir, though it could reinstat them will. microsoft say that it contract are legal becaus they produc tangibl benefit custom, includ easier internet access. the justic depart say that bundl explor window 95 and inclus browser part window 98 amount tie, illeg practic that forc custom one product purchas anoth. the contract manufactur and internet servic are illeg, govern say, becaus they are intend not onli creat monopoli browser market protect microsoft' exist monopoli oper system. the latter threat is key, accord justic depart. browser have potenti, oper system, act softwar platform which other program run. so contract intend drive browser out market would also insul window monopoli. mani antitrust expert say problem face justic depart is that court have provid no clear definit tie and no clear guidelin determin when contract are illeg exclusionari. professor lawrenc white new york univers, who wa chief economist justic department' antitrust divis earli 1980, say that court treat tie unusu practic when fact it is ubiquit. no one, he said, would challeng right manufactur tie eras tip pencil, tire automobil or button shirt. hi point, share wide economist, is that some tie benefit consum if, exampl, it result product that are easier use or enabl compani recov develop cost. but tie can be bad if it lock monopoli power. the court, white say, have not offer enough guidanc distinguish good tie bad, which is nub legal disput. microsoft say it need onli show that bundl window and explor pass what might be call gross consum benefit test that it offer immedi benefit, whether or not it caus long-term damag competit and, therefor, ultim consum. the justic depart say that microsoft' practic must clear higher hurdle: yield net consum benefit that are immedi and larg enough balanc possibl long-term harm competit. so which test consum benefit satisfi antitrust law? the simpl answer is that no one know sure, which is whi side can reason cite same case fear embarrass. consid 1985 case, aspen ski co. vs. aspen highland ski corp., and 1951 case, lorain journal co. vs. unit state. in first, aspen ski, owner three major ski run aspen, colo. monopolist had year sold ticket cooper aspen highland, competitor, that gave skier access companies' run. when aspen ski unilater cancel agreement, it rival' revenu shrivel and rival su. the suprem court rule that aspen ski had violat antitrust law becaus there wa no evid it action help consum. in lorain journal case, onli local newspap lorain, ohio, refus sell advertis compani that advertis new radio station. here, too, suprem court rule that exclusionari practic noth benefit consum. inde, aspen ski, court forc monopolist do busi it rival, preced that augur well justic depart, which seek forc microsoft instal netscape' browser alongsid it own. but charl rule, legal consult microsoft, say that case court threw out exclusionari practic onli becaus they offer no consum benefit. the court, he argu, never pounc practic that result lower price or better product or servic. nor court either case call balanc immedi benefit hypothet long-term harm. rule argu that microsoft' practic produc demonstr consum benefit. besid, he say, action taken the lorain journal or aspen ski, microsoft' contract do not prevent consum instal netscape' browser or use web site microsoft' rival. in truth, though, neither case answer what consum benefit test should appli product design. in jefferson parish hospit district no. 2 et al. vs. hyde, anoth case cite side, suprem court 1984 recogn that surgeon and anesthesiologist provid integr servic. yet, court said, hospit monopoli power would still not be allow forc surgic patient use it panel anesthesiologist if consum want purchas two servic separ. that principl could undercut microsoft' defens that function interdepend window and explor requir bundl. but microsoft will point strong concur opinion that call tougher standard govern meet when it alleg tie. microsoft will also draw support sever court rule that allow ibm chang design it comput way that made it hard vendor attach peripher equip. but perhap microsoft' best argument is that nowher ha govern identifi singl case which court explicitli call throw out tie product basi balanc test. the court, microsoft will emphas, steer clear redesign technic sophist product. the justic department' rejoind is note that sole purpos antitrust law is protect consum, so it make no sens bless practic that provid dollar' worth benefit today but, stamp out competit, drive price $1,000 tomorrow. the justic depart will ask court least insist that monopolist use least exclusionari mean possibl achiev servic they provid custom. expert agre that court will subject microsoft' restrict contract internet compani balanc test. but exactli how court will decid whether consum are help or hurt is grab. a balanc test would have court weigh immedi benefit consum one-click access internet site and featur bundl windows-explor packag harm time diminish competit market browser and oper system. but test that make good sens theori can prove fiendishli difficult use practic. balanc test are imposs difficult and arbitrari, said rep. thoma campbel, r-calif., who is former law professor stanford univers. the practic effect

clearer each new file that they are tri turn thi broader case, he said. you can't have thi bait-and-switch which they file complaint alleg a, b, c, and then talk whole alphabet three time over. as result, warden said, microsoft want, minimum, anoth two-week delay, though more normal schedul would have trial start next year. the judg not respond. instead he enter order set oct. 19 trial date. late friday, microsoft enter formal motion ask anoth two-week delay. a respons is expect next week. the case unit state vs. microsoft corp., government' most aggress move monopolist almost 25 year, is play out centuri antitrust law so broadli word and court rule so ambigu that side are cite same rule support their oppos argument. whatev outcom trial, schedul begin monday us. district court washington, almost certain appeal will leav suprem court task bring legal order 100 year clash antitrust doctrin. the case focus microsoft' window, oper system that control 90 percent all person comput sold today. the govern say it object is curb illeg monopolist busi practic that threaten render larg part economi vulner vicissitud singl compani. microsoft assert that case is intend give govern control which featur can be ad window. howev grand econom stake, legal disput is narrow. the govern say that microsoft' contract comput manufactur and compani that provid access internet illeg stifl competit. the contract prohibit manufactur substitut netscap commun corp.' navig browser microsoft' internet explor. they also prohibit them remov window main screen, or desktop, link site world wide web run microsoft or it partner. microsoft' contract compani that connect peopl internet and busi that sell good and servic web requir favor treatment internet explor navig exchang link window desktop. in wake lawsuit, microsoft ha voluntarili drop some these requir, though it could reinstat them will. microsoft say that it contract are legal becaus they produc tangibl benefit custom, includ easier internet access. the justic depart say that bundl explor window 95 and inclus browser part window 98 amount tie, illeg practic that forc custom one product purchas anoth. the contract manufactur and internet servic are illeg, govern say, becaus they are intend not onli creat monopoli browser market protect microsoft' exist monopoli oper system. the latter threat is key, accord justic depart. browser have potenti, oper system, act softwar platform which other program run. so contract intend drive browser out market would also insul window monopoli. mani antitrust expert say problem face justic depart is that court have provid no clear definit tie and no clear guidelin determin when contract are illeg exclusionari. professor lawrenc white new york univers, who wa chief economist justic department' antitrust divis earli 1980, say that court treat tie unusu practic when fact it is ubiquit. no one, he said, would challeng right manufactur tie eras tip pencil, tire automobil or button shirt. hi point, share wide economist, is that some tie benefit consum if, exampl, it result product that are easier use or enabl compani recov develop cost. but tie can be bad if it lock monopoli power. the court, white say, have not offer enough guidanc distinguish good tie bad, which is nub legal disput. microsoft say it need onli show that bundl window and explor pass what might be call gross consum benefit test that it offer immedi benefit, whether or not it caus long-term damag competit and, therefor, ultim consum. the justic depart say that microsoft' practic must clear higher hurdle: yield net consum benefit that are immedi and larg enough balanc possibl long-term harm competit. so which test consum benefit satisfi antitrust law? the simpl answer is that no one know sure, which is whi side can reason cite same case fear embarrass. consid 1985 case, aspen ski co. vs. aspen highland ski corp., and 1951 case, lorain journal co. vs. unit state. in first, aspen ski, owner three major ski run aspen, colo. monopolist had year sold ticket cooper aspen highland, competitor, that gave skier access companies' run. when aspen ski unilater cancel agreement, it rival' revenu shrivel and rival su. the suprem court rule that aspen ski had violat antitrust law becaus there wa no evid it action help consum. in lorain journal case, onli local newspap lorain, ohio, refus sell advertis compani that advertis new radio station. here, too, suprem court rule that exclusionari practic noth benefit consum. inde, aspen ski, court forc monopolist do busi it rival, preced that augur well justic depart, which seek forc microsoft instal netscape' browser alongsid it own. but charl rule, legal consult microsoft, say that case court threw out exclusionari practic onli becaus they offer no consum benefit. the court, he argu, never pounc practic that result lower price or better product or servic. nor court either case call balanc immedi benefit hypothet long-term harm. rule argu that microsoft' practic produc demonstr consum benefit. besid, he say, action taken the lorain journal or aspen ski, microsoft' contract do not prevent consum instal netscape' browser or use web site microsoft' rival. in truth, though, neither case answer what consum benefit test should appli product design. in jefferson parish hospit district no. 2 et al. vs. hyde, anoth case cite side, suprem court 1984 recogn that surgeon and anesthesiologist provid integr servic. yet, court said, hospit monopoli power would still not be allow forc surgic patient use it panel anesthesiologist if consum want purchas two servic separ. that principl could undercut microsoft' defens that function interdepend window and explor requir bundl. but microsoft will point strong concur opinion that call tougher standard govern meet when it alleg tie. microsoft will also draw support sever court rule that allow ibm chang design it comput way that made it hard vendor attach peripher equip. but perhap microsoft' best argument is that nowher ha govern identifi singl case which court explicitli call throw out tie product basi balanc test. the court, microsoft will emphas, steer clear redesign technic sophist product. the justic department' rejoind is note that sole purpos antitrust law is protect consum, so it make no sens bless practic that provid dollar' worth benefit today but, stamp out competit, drive price $1,000 tomorrow. the justic depart will ask court least insist that monopolist use least exclusionari mean possibl achiev servic they provid custom. expert agre that court will subject microsoft' restrict contract internet compani balanc test. but exactli how court will decid whether consum are help or hurt is grab. a balanc test would have court weigh immedi benefit consum one-click access internet site and featur bundl windows-explor packag harm time diminish competit market browser and oper system. but test that make good sens theori can prove fiendishli difficult use practic. balanc test are imposs difficult and arbitrari, said rep. thoma campbel, r-calif., who is former law professor stanford univers. the practic effect balanc is hand defend microsoft almost certain victori. microsoft argu and mani antitrust expert agre that court have fact gravit away balanc test simpler predat test exclusionari contract. under thi standard, contract is illeg onli if it is intend drive out competit and thu pave way monopolist rais price later. microsoft will have easier time defend itself charg predat, which amount victim it custom, it would defend itself charg that it bundl product doe consum slightli more harm good. the antitrust record, say william baxter, who head antitrust divis presid reagan, is litter contradictori, ambigu and sometim nonsens verdict. he and other legal expert agre that if noth els, that record leav plenti legal leeway suprem court, should it hear microsoft case, stiffen spine antitrust law. shortli govern file it antitrust suit microsoft corp. may, joel klein, assist attorney gener charg justic department' antitrust divis, met silicon valley execut. the execut recal tell klein that unless case

strongest evid hand involv microsoft' battl netscap commun corp. market so-cal browser softwar use navig internet. thi is netscap case, execut recal klein say. but five month later, case that govern is bring trial monday extend well netscap and browser war embrac what it describ recent court file broad pattern anti-competit conduct microsoft. netscap, govern insist, is still prime exampl pattern

follow execut repres cross section nation' high-technolog compani includ intel, ibm, sun microsystem, appl comput, america onlin and intuit. in bring more ambiti, complic case trial one it file may, govern ha chosen high-risk strategi. the law state that new evid can be ad suit it is file, not new charg. and so, hi feder courtroom washington, u.s.district judg thoma penfield jackson could decid rule out some new evid rang too far afield origin suit. but if govern win it broaden case, court-ord remedi would no doubt be far tougher microsoft. in may, government' suggest step amount equal

perhap breakup compani intend loosen microsoft' grip comput. that would be precis kind sweep reform that microsoft' foe would applaud. the govern ha doubl bet and doubl stake, said david yoffi, professor harvard busi school who is co-author book, compet internet time: lesson from netscap and it battl with microsoft. meanwhil, microsoft camp, government' strategi is dismiss desper act taken court rule june that threaten undermin antitrust suit. that rule came separ case, involv interpret consent decre that microsoft sign justic depart 1995. in june rule, feder appeal court said that microsoft could bundl it browser it industry-standard window oper system and call them one product. the appeals-court rule would seem undercut assert government' current antitrust case that browser and oper system were two separ product, bundl togeth and given away effort thwart competit browser market. with appeals-court rule june, govern lost heart it case, said charl rule, former senior

","Business rivals are seeking to break Microsoft Corp.'s monopoly on computer operating systems.The Government and 20 states have filed an anti-trust suit against Microsoft, invoking the Sherman Anti-trust Act of 1890.The suit began with a Microsoft vs Netscape battle over browser software but now extends far beyond that aiming at Microsoft's overall aggressive anti-competitive conduct.The effort is extensive but inconsistent because of the ambiguity of anti-trust laws, especially the Sherman Act.The Government is examining Microsoft's financial records and painting a dark image of its Chairman Bill Gates.An unpublished book may be crucial to the trial.","In 1998 the Justice Department filed a civil suit against Microsoft to change its 9-year pattern of anti-competitive conduct.Bill Gates appears a schemer ready to crush competitors by any means.He uses Microsoft's clout to squelch internet competition.A 1996 Netscape complaint over browsers was central to the case, which grew to include Intel, IBM, Sun, Apple, AOL, and Intuit.Microsoft was ordered to let Justice examine its records and sought a trial delay.An unpublished book provided evidence.The 1890 Sherman Anti-Trust Act centered on Standard Oil and was intended to protect consumers, but its wording is broad and rulings have been ambiguous.","The Justice Department and 20 states filed a suit against Microsoft for violation of the Sherman Act, charging it illegally tried to use its dominance as the provider of Windows, the industry standard operating system, to stifle competition in other areas.At the heart of the case are Microsoft's contracts with computer manufacturers that prohibit them from substituting Netscape's Navigator browser for Microsoft's Internet Explorer, but Justice also alleges Microsoft exhibited a broad pattern of anti-competitive conduct with numerous other software companies.Microsoft says that Windows and its browser is one tool that offers immediate consumer benefit.","The government suit against Microsoft is the most aggressive antitrust case in a quarter century.The heart of the case is the Internet browser battle between Microsoft and Netscape.Microsoft says that its Internet Explorer is an integral part of its Windows system, the industry dominant operating system.Microsoft, it is argued, has told computer manufacturers that if they want Windows, they must forgo Netscape.The Justice Department and 20 states are joined in the action brought under the Sherman Antitrust Act.Microsoft's chairman, Bill Gates, usually seen as a visionary is portrayed in much darker tones in the trial."

","Lebanon's leadership changed in Nov 1998.Army commander Emile Lahoud was elected to a 6-year term as President by the Parliament and took office on Nov 24.He had the backing of Syrian President Assad, the powerbroker in Lebanon, and a special constitutional amendment in Oct cleared his way.He did not immediately ask Prime Minister Rafik Hariri to form a new government.Hariri, the nation's top businessman, had served three terms and rebuilt the nation, but some accused him of corruption.His support in the Parliament had also slipped, but many believed Lahoud was trying to assert his authority.When finally asked to form a government, Hariri refused.","Power in Lebanon is shared equally by a Maronite Christian president, a Sunni Muslim prime minister, and a Shiite Parliament speaker, an arrangement made to prevent a recurrence of the 1975-90 civil war.Syria, with 30,000 troops in Lebanon is the main power broker there.The Lebanese parliament amended the constitution to permit popular army general Emile Lahoud to become president.Prime minister Rafik Hariri, the architect of Lebanon's postwar reconstruction, expected to get a fourth term but a conflict with the new president led him to bow out as premier.Lebanon's economic stability has been threatened by the conflict.","Lebanon's Parliament voted the country's top military man, Gen. Emile Lahoud, president.Lahoud, who promises to clean up a graft-riddled government, is popular and is backed by powerful Syria.It is unclear, though, whether Prime Minister Hariri, in office since 1992 and credited with the country's economic recovery, will continue to head the cabinet.31 of 128 legislators chose not to support him, leaving it to the president to name the next prime minister.Consequently, Hariri withdrew his candidacy, claiming the president acted unconstitutionally when he accepted the mandate to name a prime minister.Hariri's administration was plagued by nepotism.","Army Commander and Maronite Catholic Emile Lahoud was named Lebanon's president for the next 6 years, chosen by outgoing President Hrawi and Syria's Hafez Assad.Traditionally the president is a Maronite, the PM a Sunni, and Speaker of Parliament a Shiite.Election by Parliament is a formality.The constitution was amended to permit senior public servants to be president.Lahoud rebuilt the army and ended militia reign.Walid Jumblatt opposed a military president, fearing a return of surveillance on civilians.PM Rafik Hariri, a businessman who rebuilt the country and economy, refused his delayed re-appointment by Lahoud, who vowed to fight corruption."

","After 2 years of wooing the West by signing international accords, apparently relaxing controls on free speech, and releasing and exiling three dissenters, China cracked down against political dissent in Dec 1998.Leaders of the China Democracy Party (CDP) were arrested and three were sentenced to jail terms of 11 to 13 years.The West, including the US, UK and Germany, reacted strongly.Clinton's China policy of engagement was questioned.China's Jiang Zemin stated economic reform is not a prelude to democracy and vowed to crush any challenges to the Communist Party or ""social stability"".The CDP vowed to keep working, as more leaders awaited arrest.","While China plans to sign the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights at the U.N., it is still harassing and arresting human rights campaigners.Three prominent leaders of the China Democratic Party were put to trial and sentenced to 11-, 12- and 13-year prison terms.Germany and the U.S. condemned the arrests.A labor rights activist was released and exiled to the U.S. to blunt any opposition to Communist rule.U.S. policy to encourage trade and diplomacy in hope of democratic reforms evidences failure, but the U.S. is continuing its policy of encouragement.Friends of jailed dissidents state that they will continue to campaign for change.","The US trade-driven policy of expanded ties encouraging Chinese democracy is questioned.China signed rights treaties and dissidents used new laws to set up China Democracy Party, but China violates the new laws by persecuting dissidents.It regularly frees activists from prison then exiles them so they lose local influence.It arrested an activist trying to register a rights monitoring group.CP leader Jiang's hard-line speech and publicity for activists sentenced to long prison terms signals a renewed Chinese crackdown.A rights activist expected to be sacrificed in the cause of democracy.Germany called China's sentencing of dissidents unacceptable.","Xu Wenli, Wang Youchai, and Qin Yongmin, leading dissidents and prominent members of the China Democracy Party, were found guilty of subversion and sentenced to 13, 11, and 12 years in prison, respectively.Soon after the sentencing, China's president, Jiang Zemin, delivered speeches in which he asserted that Western political system must not be adopted and vowed to crush challenges to Communist Party rule.The harsh sentences and speeches signal a crackdown on dissent, but Zha Jianguo, another Democracy Party leader, says he will continue to push for change.Western nations condemned the sentences as violations of U.N. rights treaties signed by China."
