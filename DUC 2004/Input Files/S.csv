6,"he wa the classic small-town prodigi, with the creativ of a big-citi profit. when there wa no shot to take, he invent a new one. when there wa no one to pass to, he reconfigur the play until a teammat wa open. larri bird, in the indiana countrysid or insid boston garden, wa a lumin except to the govern rule. that is whi, six year after hi retir from the nation basketbal associ, hi name is again basketball' most promin, begin with hi induct to the hall of fame befor 7,000 bird watcher at the civic center here on friday night. deservedli enshrin as forev except, he again becom bird, the except, the case studi for a contenti and potenti disastr labor war. no, not realli, bird said, when i ask whether he is troubl by the likelihood of hi legendari name soon repres a symbol of greed to unsympathet million. there' alway a player' name attach to these thing. i know at the time i wa veri happi about it. that would have been 1988, when the celtic want to compens bird with a $4.9 million bonu to push through hi back pain, go on as their savior. three year later, in a contract arbitr involv the knicks' patrick ewe, the agent david falk would contend that the nba conspir with the celtic to circumv the salari cap, in order to satisfi bird. alan greenspan, i am sure, would agre that thi salari cap is convolut enough to give anyon a headach, so let' just say it is a cap that doe not exist when a team is negoti with one of it own. the process of unseal the cap to re-sign a particular player eventu becam known as make use of the larri bird except. and that is where we stand, as thi onetim except ha becom the veri expens rule the owner don't want to play by anymor. i can understand both side, said bird, safe in the middl, between bird, the former except, and bird, the present indiana pacers' coach. without get into the except, i think it' veri import for player to stay in the same place. import, he meant, for franchis stabil and fan identif. you have a son who is 7 year old, he goe from 7 to 17 in the 10 year you'v play, bird said. a lot of peopl in boston told me that they had follow me, from the time they were veri young to when they were in colleg. the bird year

lake citi and spread worldwid, like an infecti smile. they stood for the pass, for team play, but now their decad of selfless ha given way to one of selfish. the nba of michael jordan reach greater height than anyon imagin it could, but it is a leagu that now suffer from a sick of the soul. if larri and magic hadn't done what they did, we might not surviv what we'r about to go through, said bill fitch, bird' first celtic coach, who, with bill walton, stood with him on the night that, he said, gave closur to hi play career. the owner, as alway, are exagger their miseri, but thi time, it is much easier to not root for the player. the presid of the union is ewe, who one day command player to boycott the world championship becaus the nba' corpor fingerprint are on them, then the next day help himself to some televis commentari work for david stern' women' annex. ewe lead the fight to protect the $100 million contract for 21-year-old who have achiev not a singl playoff victori, link to the big payoff for agent like hi friend falk. the battl is wage in the name of a salari cap that make except of the unexcept, reward everyon as if they were bird. i believ that in ani field there ha to be an allow for the truli special one, walton said. but that group is veri small. when i wa grow up in thi sport, the onli player who got the recognit were the champion, the one who alway made you feel good about the game, about sport. that' how larri and magic play, alway dream of the special team. it wasn't about hype, about money. that is not quit the case, nor should it have been. bird wa a businessman' ball player from the day he arriv, with hi flannel shirt and blue-collar ethic. he hire the late bob woolf, one of the origin heavy-hit agent, and got himself a record rooki contract. then he went out and turn a 29-victori catastroph into a 61-victori contend. a rare bird, an honest except to the rule. despit modest encourag over a new propos deliv by the player to the owner, the nation basketbal associ tuesday cancel the first two week of the regular season, the first time in the league' 51-year histori that it will lose game to a labor disput. the nba' deputi commission, russ granik, announc the cancel after nearli three and a half hour of meet conclud at a manhattan hotel. the decis to cancel 99 game between nov. 3 and nov. 16 came after the player associ propos the implement of a tax system instead of a hard salari cap, a propos the owner said they would respond to by friday. we tri our best today to tri to do what wa possibl to salvag the season, said alonzo mourn, the miami heat center. unfortun, it didn't work out. after 35,001 game without a blemish, the nba now join the nation hockey leagu, the nation footbal leagu and major leagu basebal in have lost game to a labor disput. take into account that a three- to four-week period would be need for train camp and free-ag sign befor the season start, the leagu said it would decid in two week whether to make further cancel. i'm veri sad and disappoint, said the nba commission, david stern. i consid it to be a collect failur, but i honestli don't know what els we could have done. i do thing that i like to think are in the best interest of the game. and i believ thi is. the decis came after what both side agre were the most substant talk sinc the owner impos a lockout on the player juli 1. seventeen player, includ union presid patrick ewe and vice presid mitch richmond, herb william, dikemeb mutombo and ty corbin, attend the meet along with stern, granik and five member of the ownership committe madison squar garden presid dave checkett and owner abe pollin of washington, gordon gund of cleveland, le alexand of houston and jerri colangelo of phoenix. the talk featur what the player associ impli were a bevi concess made to the owner that they felt would accommod the league' desir to swing the revenu pendulum back toward the owner. the disput involv the distribut of approxim $2 billion in league-wid incom. the main stick point ha been the owners' insist on a salari cap without except, the implement of which they believ would bring player salaries' in line with revenu growth. while the player did not discuss the elimin of the larri bird except a claus that allow a player to secur ani amount of money he want in re-sign with hi current team they did address the except in their taxat propos. the main point were as follows: a 50 percent tax would be impos on salari earn abov $18 million, a claus that would affect onli a few player who exercis their bird right. for exampl, if a player made $20 million, the team would be forc to put $1 million into a fund that would most like be distribut to low-revenu team. there could be provis made for some player, said jeffrey kessler, the chief outsid counsel for the union. we don't want to do anyth that would encourag chicago from get michael jordan back. and i think the leagu feel the same way. the propos is similar to the luxuri tax propos by the union in 1995 dure negoti, but it would not be nearli as liber. a salari cap credit would go into effect if the leagu pay out more than 63 percent of revenu in salari. whatev figur over that number reduc the salari cap the next year. if the figur wa $29 million over the salari cap, then the 29 team would work with a salari cap $1 million less than the previou season. but the player would have an assur that the salari cap would go up at least $2 million befor the credit goe into effect. also, if the 63-percent threshold is met, a reduct of annual 20 percent rais would take effect for multi-year contract. player would either get rais of 10 percent or the rate of growth in leagu revenu. the union said thi clearli address the league' desir to bring salari in line with revenu. sinc the owner re-open the current agreement becaus 57.1 percent of revenu wa go toward salari, the 63-percent figur would probabl have to come down substanti for the owner to agre to such a propos. team would get a right of first refus on free agent after the fourth year for incom rooki, mean a player would be contractu oblig to the same team for the first four year of hi deal. current, the rooki scale is three year and includ a claus that enabl a player to exercis hi bird right after two season a claus kevin garnett parlay into an astronom $126 million deal last year with minnesota. final, the player agre to make marijuana a ban substanc. detail of test have not been negoti and no specif discuss took place regard test for performance-enhanc drug, a provis the owner includ in their last propos. in return for the concess, the player want an increas in the minimum salari current $272,500 and creation of an averag salari except. thi would allow everi team abov the salari cap be abl to sign one free agent per year for the averag salari current $2.6 million. we'r buoy by the fact for the first time they'v decid to submit a counterpropos, the union' execut director, billi hunter, said. i don't know if i'm more optimist, but i can earnestli say we can look our ballplay in the eye and say we made a valiant effort. ask if the player would final be test financi with the cancel of game, hunter added: it' not about us blink. we want to reach an agreement. we'r tire of the rhetor, we'r tire of the game-play. our posit all along ha been we don't want to accept a bad deal. granik said refund to fan would be made at end of the calendar month and that the first refund would includ moni for cancel preseason game. he estim the loss into the hundr of million of dollar. i think we have seriou concern whether a tax system can address the kind of need we have econom, he ad. but there' some possibl. ad stern, we owe it to the fan to go back and look at the notion whether a tax rate might begin to achiev the result we want. it doesn't look promis, but we'r go to spend the next two day to see if we can give a favor respons. though the decis to cancel game wa not surpris, it did repres a major shift in prior labor stalem. both side reluctantli hammer out a deal in 1995 befor the start of train camp with the sole notion of not miss game and preserv the nba' perfect record. tuesday, they could not come to such an accord. i'd like to think these our the last game we have to cancel, granik said. but unless thi or someth els work, or there' some dramat breakthrough, i think that is certainli not all of the season that' in jeopardi. in a decis that will almost certainli lead to the first work stoppag in nation basketbal associ histori, the leagu monday announc the cancel of all 114 preseason game. cite stall negoti with the player associ over a new collect bargain agreement, leagu offici said they would decid next week whether to cancel the first week of regular season game. while the decis had been expect for 10 day, it nonetheless sent a strong signal that the owner and player will probabl be will to cancel at least part of the regular season in order to settl their labor disput. both side agre that it would take at least three week to hold abbrevi train camp and sign over 200 free agent to new contract. privat, offici on both side do not believ the season will start as schedul on nov. 3 or even befor decemb. unlik major leagu basebal, the nation footbal leagu and the nation hockey leagu, the nba ha never lost a regular-season game to labor strife. sinc we'r not even negoti, you have to conclud it' veri like that we'r go miss some part of the regular season, deputi commission russ granik said monday night. we'll tri and defer ani decis until the last minut, but right now it doe not look good. the two side will meet on thursday their first offici bargain session sinc aug. 6. commission david stern and a group of owner walk out of a meet after dismiss the merit of a new propos from the player. neither granik nor player associ execut director billi hunter sound as if thi week' meet would go a long way toward the sign of a new agreement the precursor to play again. i don't think you have ani choic but to miss game at thi point, hunter said. in fact, i think the they'v intend it all along. they'v lock us out, they'v refus to negoti and they'v given us a propos that' ludicr. not onli are both side still await the outcom of an arbitr decis that is due befor oct. 18 - the fordham law school dean john feerick will rule whether or not more than 200 player with $800 million in guarante contract should be paid dure the lockout but the owner and player also are make time to win public opinion befor they test their fans' loyalti by cancel game. monday in 11 citi throughout the countri, the player are hold make-shift press confer at training-camp venu, nba arena and gymnasium. patrick ewe, the union presid, and sever teammat will speak at suny-purchas in purchas, n.y., where the knick train dure the season. with train camp origin schedul to open on oct. 6, the messag from the player is clear: if the owner would call an end to the lockout, we would be readi to play today. about 100 player are expect to attend, speak and sign autograph for fan afterward. i wish they would put their energi into tri to negoti a deal rather than the variou other thing that they'v been do, granik said. the disput is essenti over how the owner and player will judici divvi up $2 billion in incom. it began last year with the content by the owner that their employe were receiv more than their fair share of the pot. the owner were allow to termin the current agreement becaus of a claus that enabl them to do so after player salari reach 53.8 percent of total basketball-rel incom. the owner say that figur is current hover around 57.1 percent. though mani econom issu need to be resolv, the main point of content sinc the labor agreement expir and the owner declar a lockout on juli 1 ha been a claus which allow team to pay their own free agent whatev they want, regardless of salary-cap rule govern the nba' 29 team. call the larri bird except, it wa creat to allow the hall of fame boston celtic forward to re-sign with the celtic near the end of hi career. michael jordan exercis the claus the last two year with the chicago bull, earn more than $30 million per season figur more than $5 million more what a team is allow to spend on all it player. but with exorbit salari paid to sever unproven star over the last few year and $100 million deal sprout up routin, the owner are determin to swing the incom pendulum back toward themselv by enforc a restrict salari cap a hard cap and put a ceil on how much one player could earn. last year, the player receiv about $1 billion dollar in salari and benefit and we have made propos that are guarante to increas that number by 20 percent over the next four year, granik said in a prepar statement. our propos would result in an averag player salari of more than $3.1 million and a minimum salari for 10-year veteran of $750,000. unfortun, the union leadership ha been unwil to give ani seriou consider to what we have offer. hunter label those claim as optimist project, and shot down a number of new propos present to the player on sept. 25. if they had left the current deal in place, we would have gotten much of that anyway, he ad. all we'r say is, we'r not in posit to accept a hard cap. monday' decis to cancel the preseason came less than two week after the nba indefinit postpon train camp and cancel the first week of exhibit game. through ticket sale alon, granik estim that lose the exhibit season would cost the leagu between $35 million and $40 million. decis about the cancel of regular season game are expect to be made next week, he ad. a leagu offici said the game would be cancel in block of one or two week, depend upon circumst regard negoti. thursday' bargain session ha suddenli becom the last hope at start the season on time. hurdl could be overcom veri quickli, but i have no reason to believ they will on thursday, granik said. ad hunter: of cours they don't expect much to get done. when russ and david decid the negoti are go to be real and substant, then someth will happen. what they'r bank on now is that the player are go to miss paycheck and cave in novemb. it' as if they'v ingest someth that ha to pass. and onc it pass, then they'll negoti. the first substant talk in more than two month between oppos side of the nation basketbal association' labor disput came and went thursday without a hint of a settlement. still, a five-hour meet that wa describ as cordial by the leagu and almost like two bull let off a littl steam by the player associ produc anoth schedul round of talk next tuesday. bar a major compromis, that will not be enough time to preserv a full season and prevent the leagu from lose it first regular-season game to labor strife in novemb. russ granik, the nba' deputi commission, said the leagu would wait until after next week' meet befor decid to cancel regular-season game. he also discuss the possibl of a significantli shorten season. we haven't made a determin that you need thi exact number of game in order to have a repres season, granik said. but we recogn that beyond a certain point we can't possibl sell to our fan that we'r have an nba season. whether' that 60 game, 50 game or 49 or 53, we'r not there yet. we have a few month befor we have to face that decis. perhap the onli progress involv thursday in the confer room of a midtown manhattan hotel wa a question-and-answ session over the league' latest propos to the player. patrick ewe, the union presid, and vice presid herb william and dikemb mutombo attend the meet with the union' execut director, billi hunter, and union lawyer. no owner were present, but granik, commission david stern and the league' lawyer spent most of the day explain the intricaci of a two-week-old propos to the player. at one point befor the two parti broke for lunch, stern and hunter rais their voic and accus each other of handl their constitu poorli, a particip in the meet said. but the two were seen shake hand and laugh after the meet conclud shortli after 3 pm. there wa some vent from both side, hunter said. we'v been placid and veri respect. today, we took the coat off and we were inclin to take the glove off a littl bit. have done that, i think it kind of loosen up both side. hunter added: did anybodi blink today? they'r sort of look at us for ani kind of nuanc they can find dure the cours of negoti that might, in some way or anoth, give some indic that while we'r mouth one thing we might be open to someth els. we'r look at their bodi languag, too. i don't think that they'r readi to make a deal. the last formal meet between both side on aug. 6 end when stern and the owner abruptli march out after they had receiv a propos from the player. in a critic rule for the north american nation basketbal associ and the players' union, arbitr john feerick decid monday whether more than 200 player with guarante contract should be paid dure the lockout. if the player win, the owner will be liabl for about dlr 800 million in guarante salari, although they have vow to appeal if they lose. the leagu alreadi ha su the player over feerick' jurisdict. if we win, i think it just embolden the spirit and resolv of the player, union director billi hunter said. but i don't think there will be anybodi celebr becaus there' no guarante that it will end the lockout. it onli mean they have to pay some 200 player, and they'v indic to us their intent to file an immedi appeal and take it as far as they have to in order to avoid payment. so even if he doe rule in our favor, at most it' a hollow victori. the player aren't go to get paid nov. 15 in ani circumst, hunter said. if the owner win, it will remov the last wild card the player had been hold. the side have not negoti sinc last tuesday, when the union propos a superstar tax on the highest contract. the leagu made a counterpropos friday, ask that the tax be impos with a much lower threshold. hunter dismiss the league' latest propos on friday afternoon, then said both side would be best serv by await feerick' rule. it' unlik ani negoti will be held thi week, sinc the union is hold a meet for all nba player and the agent advisori committe in la vega from wednesday through friday. we'v got to get a sens of where the player are, what they consid to be reason and what they'r will to do in order to get the season to commenc, hunter said. the union file a grievanc with feerick befor the lockout wa impos juli 1 over the owners' announc june 29 that they would not honor guarante deal. in a six-day hear over the summer, the union argu that owner should have protect themselv from be liabl for guarante salari dure a work stoppag by insert lockout languag into the standard player contract. the sacramento king insert a lockout claus into center olden polynice' contract in 1994, and it wa approv by the leagu. the union use the exist of that claus to argu that all the other team should have protect themselv similarli. most player are due to receiv their first paycheck nov. 15, although a dozen or so had claus entitl them to be paid over the summer. none ha receiv a paycheck. the nba argu that a tenet of labor law allow employ to withhold pay from employe dure a lockout. the leagu also call former union director simon gourdin to testifi. he said it wa hi understand when he negoti the old labor agreement in 1995 that player would not be paid if the owner chose to reopen the agreement and impos a lockout. more than 220 nation basketbal associ player with guarante contract will find out monday whether they are to be paid dure the manag lockout, a long-await arbitrator' decis that may affect leverag in the league' disput with the player and have major ramif on american sports-labor law. but neither the player nor the owner are count on the rule by the arbitr, john feerick, to speed up negoti, especi if feerick find in favor of the player, an award that could approach $800 million in salari. nba attorney have indic to the union that if the decis goe against manag, they will seek to have it vacat by appeal to the us. district court in manhattan and then, if necessari, to the 2nd us. circuit court of appeal, a process that could prevent the player from get paid for sever month. the nba ha alreadi cancel the first two week of the regular season becaus of the labor disput. the leagu ha other litig pend in us. district court in manhattan. if the player win the rule, the nba intend to renew it motion to disqualifi feerick. the motion wa brought last summer on the ground that no collect bargain agreement exist and, therefor, he had no jurisdict to hear the matter. if he rule in our favor, i think it embolden the spirit and the resolv of the player, said billi hunter, union execut director. but we understand that won't end the lockout. it just mean they have to pay 200-some player. and there is still other litig aliv that may take a while to resolv. at most, it' a hollow victori. feerick will have taken the full 30 day to render hi decis. whatev he decid, hi rule will be watch care. there is no preced for locked-out athlet be paid. dure the nba summer lockout of 1995, player who miss paycheck did not file a grievanc. neither did nation hockey leagu player who were lock out for the first three month of the 1994-95 season. the union argu that owner should have protect themselv by insert claus about non-pay for lockout and strike into individu player contract. in support of it argument, the union point to claus in a few individu player contract that contain languag preclud payment dure a lockout. the leagu is reli on the basic tenet of labor law, which hold that employe not be paid dure strike or lockout. a rule for the union would be signific for all futur negoti between player and owner. the deterr factor of a lockout is that employe subject to a collect bargain agreement do not get paid onc the agreement expir and they are unabl to reach a new agreement. if feerick find in favor of the player, there will be no econom incent for those with guarante contract to reach an agreement quickli. they would essenti be paid for not play basketbal. if feerick find in favor of the owner, the realiti of not be paid may spur the player to reach an agreement more quickli. but hunter disput thi notion, and in a confer call friday talk openli about the entir season' be cancel befor the player would back away from their ultim goal. i'm not at all concern, hunter said. there' been no demonstr that there' go to be a chang in our resolv. after the player saw these propos from the leagu and the recent postur by nba owner, well, i had two player call me up and tell me, if need be, they'd be will to hock everyth they'v got. anoth signific develop may be thedepartur of mani player to europ until the disput is settl, accord to at least two player agent. i think it would be a case-by-cas basi, but ye, there' alreadi some peopl talk about that, said bill strickland, a member of the union' agent advisori committe. steve kauffman, anoth member of the committe, said he would explor the possibl that one client, net center roni seikali, would sign with a profession team in greec. we wouldn't look to void hi deal with the team, kauffman said. but we would want him to have the right for him to work temporarili until he could come back and honor hi contract.' russ granik, nba deputi commission, said the leagu ha approv the idea of players' earn a live elsewher until the lockout is settl. propos exchang last week that includ the concept of a luxury-tax system on player salari appear to reflect the first sign of progress in negoti sinc the lockout began juli 1. but both side have term the figur in each other' propos as unaccept, and it wa unclear whether either side wa will compromis. i don't think we should get too carri away about the possibl just yet, granik said. when they explor the idea of a tax system, we were take the player at their word that they want to make some headway. but to call their first propos meaningless is charit. they propos someth that ha no impact. as it stand, that can't be the solut. the owners' goal is to slow the growth of player salari in relat to leaguewid revenu over the next three year, while the player want to keep earn as much as possibl. as labor battl go, the current one between the nation basketbal associ and it player is weird even by sport standard. there is a real possibl that most, if not all, of the come season will be cancel. in thi union battl it is the interest of the best paid, not those who make union scale, that are domin the discuss. and here it is some of the worker, not the manag, who are consid tri to make the union disappear. the current arrang ha produc an unbalanc pay scale of immens proport. last year more player than ever befor receiv the union minimum, then $242,000 for rooki or $272,000 for veteran. the number of player make $1 million to $2 million a year the middl class, in nba term fell sharpli. but michael jordan made $33 million. thi should not be a surpris. sport is an entertain busi, not unlik movi. big star get million, while most get union scale. over the year, nba effort to stem the rise of salari have fail. the most import loophol in it salari cap let a team sign it own free agent for whatev it is will to pay. when that wa adopt, it wa assum that no team would pay a lot more than a rival could pay. but it ha not work out that way. in the current negoti, the leagu ha offer to guarante that it payrol will rise 20 percent over the next four year, from $1 billion to $1.2 billion, and say it is open to propos to split that money ani way the player want, whether by rais the minimum salari or guarante rais for veteran. the union say it is worri about that middl class, but seem determin to preserv the free market. the leagu got it broadcast, nbc and time warner' cabl channel, to agre to pay thi year' televis fee whether or not there are ani game to broadcast. (they will be paid back in later year, either through reduc fee or extra game to show.) owner hope the player would think manag wa will to wait them out, and come to term with onli a small part of the season cancel. but the union is act unhurri. it turn asid request for negoti thi week, say the player had to meet first. then there is the issu of union suicid, a tactic that wa reject by the player in 1995. the idea is that if the player had no union, it would be illeg under antitrust law for the owner to collud. the sky would be the limit. that tactic might fail. the court could reject a union decertif vote as a sham, and in ani case some player may fear that team would feel free to offer less than the old union minimum. but if the player go that rout, it could be a long time befor real negoti get go. billi hunter, the union' execut director, warn the owner thi week that a prolong lockout could destroy the league' popular. that wa what all the seer said four year ago, when baseball' world seri wa cancel by labor troubl. but fan memori are rel short, and now basebal seem more popular than ever. with that in mind, both owner and player may choos to battl on for month. in a critic rule for the north american nation basketbal associ and the players' union, arbitr john feerick decid monday whether more than 200 player with guarante contract should be paid dure the lockout. if the player win, the owner will be liabl for about dlr 800 million in guarante salari, although they have vow to appeal if they lose. the leagu alreadi ha su the player over feerick' jurisdict. if we win, i think it just embolden the spirit and resolv of the player, union director billi hunter said. but i don't think there will be anybodi celebr becaus there' no guarante that it will end the lockout. it onli mean they have to pay some 200 player, and they'v indic to us their intent to file an immedi appeal and take it as far as they have to in order to avoid payment. so even if he doe rule in our favor, at most it' a hollow victori. the player aren't go to get paid nov. 15 in ani circumst, hunter said. if the owner win, it will remov the last wild card the player had been hold. the side have not negoti sinc last tuesday, when the union propos a superstar tax on the highest contract. the leagu made a counterpropos friday, ask that the tax be impos with a much lower threshold. hunter dismiss the league' latest propos on friday afternoon, then said both side would be best serv by await feerick' rule. it' unlik ani negoti will be held thi week, sinc the union is hold a meet for all nba player and the agent advisori committe in la vega from wednesday through friday. we'v got to get a sens of where the player are, what they consid to be reason and what they'r will to do in order to get the season to commenc, hunter said. the union file a grievanc with feerick befor the lockout wa impos juli 1 over the owners' announc june 29 that they would not honor guarante deal. in a six-day hear over the summer, the union argu that owner should have protect themselv from be liabl for guarante salari dure a work stoppag by insert lockout languag into the standard player contract. the sacramento king insert a lockout claus into center olden polynice' contract in 1994, and it wa approv by the leagu. the union use the exist of that claus to argu that all the other team should have protect themselv similarli. most player are due to receiv their first paycheck nov. 15, although a dozen or so had claus entitl them to be paid over the summer. none ha receiv a paycheck. the nba argu that a tenet of labor law allow employ to withhold pay from employe dure a lockout. the leagu also call former union director simon gourdin to testifi, but feerick upheld union object and prohibit gourdin from say whether it wa hi understand when he negoti the old labor agreement in 1995 that player would not be paid if the owner chose to reopen the agreement and impos a lockout. patrick ewe did not want to sound like a strike longshoreman demand health benefit. i'm not go to tri and put it in dollar and cent. but ewe, presid of the nation basketbal associ player associ, play the public-rel game tuesday by expound on the theme of labor unrest: strong-wil uniti and short-sight propos. on the day when train camp were schedul to begin, player from across the countri held news confer in 14 nba citi to proclaim themselv readi to practic for the regular season. we want to show the public that we, as player, want to play, said ewe, who wa flank by five teammat. today is suppos to be the start of train camp. we want to practic and we want the season to start. but unfortun, the owner have lock us out and the season ha been postpon. the owner and player are schedul hold their first bargain session sinc aug. 6 on thursday in manhattan. neither side is predict progress toward sign a new collect bargain agreement and begin the season as schedul on nov. 3. the leagu cancel the entir 114-game preseason on monday. next week, it will consid cancel the first-ev regular season game in leagu histori. with wide philosoph differ on how $2 billion annual incom should be distribut, both side have privat said they don't expect to play a regular season game befor decemb. billi hunter, the union' execut director, offer a glimmer of hope. he spoke optimist about the potenti for a quick resolut. stand a few feet away from ewe, he said, i hope the owner and commission have gotten the message: that we'r seriou about a deal. i'm prepar to make a quantum leap. i don't think we'r that far off. i think there' a lot jockey, a lot of rhetor and a lot of game be play. but if and when the owner decid they want a deal, then they'll get one. but soon after, he began lambast the owners' latest propos, which includ the eventu phase out of the larri bird except the claus that enabl free agent to earn unlimit salari from their current team. that claus repres the major rift in negoti. owner would like to implement a restrict salari cap that would eventu put a ceil on how much one player can earn. i don't know if thi is go to come to a speedi resolut, ewe said. they'r entrench with what they want, which is a hard cap. and we feel with a hard cap, we as player, cannot surviv. we would have to be stupid and ignor to accept that deal. said hunter, if you go for their propos, it' just a joke. it' a step backward. i cannot understand it. if the intent wa to reach an agreement at thi late stage or to negoti in earnest, thi wa the wrong way to go about it. leagu offici did not respond to the players' comment. all we want is our fair share and we feel like they'r tri to take that away from us, ewe said. `there' a percept that we'r on strike. it' the other way around. we'v been lock out. besid ewe, the other knick includ former union presid buck william, former vice presid herb william, allan houston and john stark. marcu cambi also show up briefli. when the media hord close in, howev, the third-year forward went to look for hi late-arriv teammat insid the practic facil. he wa stop at the gym door, which wa lock. they lock us out, said rocket forward mario eli. everybody' got to get that correct. it' not on us. they'r the one that close us down. the stalem ha elicit talk of possibl bring in a mediat in the come week, as major leagu basebal did in 1994 to help solv it labor disput. but the player are convinc commission david stern and the owner are set on test their resolv befor ani genuin headway can be made in negoti. that mean miss paycheck in novemb, someth ewe said the player are prepar to do. both side are still await the outcom of an arbitr decis that is due befor oct. 18. fordham law school dean john feerick will rule whether or not more than 200 player with $800 million in guarante contract should be paid dure the lockout. feerick' decis could give new leverag to one side. but if the player lose the arbitr, more than 400 athlet mani with extravag lifestyl and tremend financi oblig will have their allegi instantli test. it' like they want to see how strong we are, ewe said. base on the propos we'v receiv, we'r veri strong. so far, it seem as though the nba is dug in on their posit, buck william said. i don't think they'r too concern at thi point about make a deal. he ad, we'r about as far apart as the grand canyon right now. the nation basketbal associ, embroil in a labor disput with it player, tuesday cancel the first two week of the 1998-99 season. it is the first time in the league' 51-year histori that it will lose regular-season game. the nba' deputi commission, russ granik, announc the cancel after nearli three and a half hour of meet conclud at a manhattan hotel. the decis to cancel 99 game between nov. 3 and nov. 16 came after the player associ propos the implement of a tax system instead of a hard salari cap, a propos the owner said they would respond to by friday. we tri our best today to tri to do what wa possibl to salvag the season, said alonzo mourn, the miami heat center. unfortun, it didn't work out. after 35,001 game without a blemish, the nba now join the nation hockey leagu, the nation footbal leagu and major leagu basebal in have lost game to a labor disput. take into account that a three- to four-week period would be need for train camp and free-ag sign befor the season start, the leagu said it would decid in two week whether to make further cancel. i'm veri sad and disappoint, said the nba commission, david stern. i consid it to be a collect failur, but i honestli don't know what els we could have done. i do thing that i like to think are in the best interest of the game. and i believ thi is. the decis came after what both side agre were the most substant talk sinc the owner impos a lockout on the player juli 1. seventeen player, includ union presid patrick ewe and vice presid mitch richmond, herb william, dikemeb mutombo and ty corbin, attend the meet along with stern, granik and five member of the ownership committe madison squar garden presid dave checkett and owner abe pollin of washington, gordon gund of cleveland, le alexand of houston and jerri colangelo of phoenix. the talk featur what the player associ impli were a bevi concess made to the owner that they felt would accommod the league' desir to swing the revenu pendulum back toward the owner. the disput involv the distribut of approxim $2 billion in league-wid incom. the main stick point ha been the owners' insist on a salari cap without except, the implement of which they believ would bring player salaries' in line with revenu growth. while the player did not discuss the elimin of the larri bird except a claus that allow a player to secur ani amount of money he want in re-sign with hi current team they did address the except in their taxat propos. the main point were as follows: a 50 percent tax would be impos on salari earn abov $18 million, a claus that would affect onli a few player who exercis their bird right. for exampl, if a player made $20 million, the team would be forc to put $1 million into a fund that would most like be distribut to low-revenu team. there could be provis made for some player, said jeffrey kessler, the chief outsid counsel for the union. we don't want to do anyth that would encourag chicago from get michael jordan back. and i think the leagu feel the same way. the propos is similar to the luxuri tax propos by the union in 1995 dure negoti, but it would not be nearli as liber. a salari cap credit would go into effect if the leagu pay out more than 63 percent of revenu in salari. whatev figur over that number reduc the salari cap the next year. if the figur wa $29 million over the salari cap, then the 29 team would work with a salari cap $1 million less than the previou season. but the player would have an assur that the salari cap would go up at least $2 million befor the credit goe into effect. also, if the 63-percent threshold is met, a reduct of annual 20 percent rais would take effect for multi-year contract. player would either get rais of 10 percent or the rate of growth in leagu revenu. the union said thi clearli address the league' desir to bring salari in line with revenu. sinc the owner re-open the current agreement becaus 57.1 percent of revenu wa go toward salari, the 63-percent figur would probabl have to come down substanti for the owner to agre to such a propos. team would get a right of first refus on free agent after the fourth year for incom rooki, mean a player would be contractu oblig to the same team for the first four year of hi deal. current, the rooki scale is three year and includ a claus that enabl a player to exercis hi bird right after two season a claus kevin garnett parlay into an astronom $126 million deal last year with minnesota. final, the player agre to make marijuana a ban substanc. detail of test have not been negoti and no specif discuss took place regard test for performance-enhanc drug, a provis the owner includ in their last propos. in return for the concess, the player want an increas in the minimum salari current $272,500 and creation of an averag salari except. thi would allow everi team abov the salari cap be abl to sign one free agent per year for the averag salari current $2.6 million. we'r buoy by the fact for the first time they'v decid to submit a counterpropos, the union' execut director, billi hunter, said. i don't know if i'm more optimist, but i can earnestli say we can look our ballplay in the eye and say we made a valiant effort. ask if the player would final be test financi with the cancel of game, hunter added: it' not about us blink. we want to reach an agreement. we'r tire of the rhetor, we'r tire of the game-play. our posit all along ha been we don't want to accept a bad deal. granik said refund to fan would be made at end of the calendar month and that the first refund would includ moni for cancel preseason game. he estim the loss into the hundr of million of dollar. i think we have seriou concern whether a tax system can address the kind of need we have econom, he ad. but there' some possibl. ad stern, we owe it to the fan to go back and look at the notion whether a tax rate might begin to achiev the result we want. it doesn't look promis, but we'r go to spend the next two day to see if we can give a favor respons. though the decis to cancel game wa not surpris, it did repres a major shift in prior labor stalem. both side reluctantli hammer out a deal in 1995 befor the start of train camp with the sole notion of not miss game and preserv the nba' perfect record. tuesday, they could not come to such an accord. i'd like to think these our the last game we have to cancel, granik said. but unless thi or someth els work, or there' some dramat breakthrough, i think that is certainli not all of the season that' in jeopardi.

strongli in septemb, and there is anecdot evid that consum are start to spend again. it' nice to be abl to say that sinc we adopt capit control, the economi ha improv, said zainal aznam yusof, the deputi director of the institut of strateg and intern studi, a research organ here that help draft the polici. but we want to see whether thi is strongli sustain. critic said it wa predict that capit

encourag consum spend. still, the mere fact that malaysia' experi ha yield some posit result guarante that the issu will come up dure the apec meet. with mahathir lead the campaign, the caus of capit control will have a fieri advoc who ha a penchant for get under the skin of western. mahathir is a veri outspoken polit leader, said chia yew boon, an independ analyst in singapor. there is no way the like of clinton or jiang zemin are go to be abl to muzzl him, he ad, refer to presid jiang of china. policy-mak in the unit state have express fear that if malaysia' gambit is seen as success, other

as protect, yusof said malaysia wa pick up the piec of it shatter economi. in addit to grow foreign reserv, he said malaysia had improv it trade balanc and reviv consum purchas of durabl good. foreign investor have also not wholli abandon malaysia, as expert had predict they would. while foreign direct invest fell in septemb to $142 million, from an averag monthli rate of $321 million for the period from januari through septemb it did not dri up complet. for everi comfort statist, though, the critic produc an alarm one. they said the increas in malaysia' foreign reserv wa mere due to the new capit restrict, which stipul that malaysian currenc held outsid the countri would be worthless unless repatri by sept. 30. the skeptic also note that bank lend declin in septemb, despit sever reduct in interest rate. so the consum who are buy new car and home applianc are mere dip into their save, which mean the buy spree will end when their save are deplet. the argument wa that by impos capit control, you'd regain control over monetari polici, which would increas the suppli of money and lessen the liquid crunch, said ks. jomo, a professor of polit economi at the univers of malaya here. but that' not happen. the biggest flaw in malaysia' polici, jomo and other said, is it time. with the asian crisi more than a year old, much of the foreign capit that wa in the countri ha alreadi gone. the critic said mahathir had spook would-b investor without even lock in the one who use to be here. there is a case to be made for the temporari imposit of capit control, but to avert a crisi, not to respond to one, jomo said. in fact, other asian currenc, like the indonesian rupiah and the thai baht, have actual rebound sinc malaysia suspend trade in it currenc and fix the exchang rate at 3.8 ringgit to the dollar. analyst liken the situat to buy an insur polici for a disast that ha come and gone. more import, the capit control are slow down much-need corpor and bank reform. the government' rescu of renong, a major conglomer with close tie to mahathir, is go ahead, though some analyst predict the govern will eventu scrap the much-critic plan. the rescu of polit connect compani remain a tens issu here. on monday, dure the trial of malaysia' former deputi prime minist, anwar ibrahim, on charg of corrupt and sex-rel crime, anwar angrili deni mahathir' claim that he had approv the bailout. anwar' sensat trial is a remind that mahathir' econom polici cannot be disentangl from polit. malaysia' 72-year-old prime minist clash with hi former proteg over how to respond to the asian crisi, and he dismiss anwar the day after impos capit control. dure boom time, mahathir won support for hi polici by wrap them in anti-foreign languag. in a speech on monday, he attack a familiar target, say foreign currenc trader are the caus of the currenc turmoil, adding: they spread it worldwid. they precipit the current recess in everi countri. but mahathir' treatment of anwar ha stir anger and spark grow social unrest in malaysia. with protest chant for reform on the usual orderli street of thi citi, expert said mahathir need capit control to work in order to sooth the country' agit popul. thing will heat up if the economi doe not improv, said chandra muzaffar, a professor of polit scienc at the univers of malaya. then the whole question of mahathir and hi leadership will remain an issu. in that regard, at least, the leader who converg on kuala lumpur in two week will be abl to identifi with their embattl host. the leader of malaysia' rule parti met tuesday to discuss a replac for oust deputi prime minist anwar ibrahim, who face trial next month in a case that will test the country' legal system. prime minist mahathir mohamad, 72, said last week

ngongi said he saw malnourish children who were said to be 10 or 11 year old, but appear to be onli 4 or 5 year old. about 30 percent of children in one primari school he visit were not in class. a lot of the children were too weak to come to school, he said. but ngongi said foreign food aid ha save live. a lot of peopl are aliv today thank to the intern community' support, he said. a congressman who visit remot part of north korea last week said saturday that the food and health situat there wa desper and deterior, and that million of north korean might have starv to death in the

children with patchi hair, protrud bone, open sore and other sign of sever malnutrit. hall also brought back a bag of what offici call substitut food be distribut by a govern food station: dri leav and straw, so coars that even cattl would normal turn away. they grind it into powder and make it into noodl, hall said. the noodl have no nutrit and are indigest, leav peopl hold their ach stomach, he said. north korea ha admit that it is face seriou econom difficulti, but there have been sharpli diverg assess of how seriou these are. some visitor with the unit nation and other organ have said that the food situat seem to be a bit better now than a year or two ago. hall said that the diverg might have arisen becaus in the north korean capit, pyongyang, life did seem to be slightli better than dure hi three previou trip to north korea. but in rural area where foreign are not often allow to visit, he ad, the overal situat is wors than ever. base on visit to four hospit, hall also emphas that public health care had declin sharpli. in one hospit, assist were hold down a patient while surgeon conduct a stomach oper without electr light or anesthesia. ordinari north korean are suffer, in part, becaus their government' hard-lin polici have alien would-b donor and aid agenc. the unit nation ha repeatedli appeal for relief aid for north korea, but the latest appeal ha rais less than one-third of the target. in septemb, doctor without border announc that it wa pull it staff of 13 from north korea becaus it fear that it aid wa go to the polit connect rather than to the most needi. north korea doe not releas mortal figur or health statist, but hall said that the unit nation had gather and would soon releas data indic that 30 percent of north korean children under age 2 are acut malnourish and that 67 percent of all children are physic stunt. hall said he thought that overal at least 1 million peopl had die and that the total wa probabl closer to 3 million. in an indic of the serious with which profession demograph view the situat, the us. bureau of the censu recent publish estim suggest that north korea' popul peak in 1995 at 21.55 million and ha sinc fallen to 21.23 million thi year. that would be a declin of 320,000 over three year, a period when north korea' popul would have been expect to grow by about 925,000 peopl, base on the popul growth rate of the earli 1990. nichola eberstadt, an american specialist on north korean popul figur, say that there simpli is not enough hard inform for him to estim the death toll from the famin. but he note one polit tidbit: north korea' constitut stipul that there should be one deleg to the country' people' assembl for everi 30,000 citizen. thi year' assembl did not expand as previou one did, but rather had just 687 deleg, the same as the previou assembl held in 1990. while eberstadt counsel caution, that could mean that north korea' popul, after eight year in which it had been expect to add sever million peopl, is now back to 20.6 million peopl or fewer. the unit state ha been suppli grain to north korea, but strain are grow over a secret underground complex in the north that some expert worri may be the heart of a new nuclear weapon program. the unit state warn last week that the agre framework that is the basi for it relat with north korea will be in jeopardi unless the north let american expert visit the underground complex and resolv their doubt. north korea ha said that it will show off the complex onli if washington promis that if the complex is not a nuclear one, it will pay for vilifi us and impair our prestig. washington refus to pay, and north korea is warn that the standoff could lead the agreement to fall apart. their shameless and wick demand is an open infring upon our sovereignti and wanton interfer in our intern affair, declar north korea' lead newspap, rodong sinmun. more than five year of sever food shortag and a near-tot breakdown in the public health system have led to devast malnutrit in north korea and probabl left an entir gener of children physic and mental impair, a new studi by intern aid group ha found. the studi, the first scientif nutrit survey in north korea, confirm the disturb report by intern aid worker, who over the past year have gain increas access to the popul of thi highli isol and secret countri. among other shock find, research from the world food program, unicef and the european union found that, becaus of long-term food shortag, a stagger 62 percent of children under 7 year old suffer from stunt growth. they have discov that, despit a huge intern food aid program over the past three year, sever malnutrit is widespread among toddler at crucial stage of brain develop, suggest that thi generation' physic and mental abil will not develop normal and that the loss can never be recov. separ, intern medic worker from group like the red cross, have begun to document how the effect of food shortag are be sever compound by a breakdown in public health servic. even basic water purif system stand idl for lack of essenti ingredi like chlorin, red cross worker say, leav vast number of peopl with such sever diarrhea that they are unabl to absorb complet what littl food they have. as the north korean dictatorship ha slowli, often grudgingli, grant increas access to intern aid group in the last six month, an increasingli clear and sadden pictur of the hunger haa emerg as a result of the larg formal studi and inform survey and observ by foreign aid agenc. past assess of the magnitud of the disast in the countri of 23 million are consid flaw becaus they were base on interview with a small number of north korean refuge who had fled into china. and while the research and aid worker on the ground in north korea have not seen evid of cannib or starv children die by the roadsid descript that have surfac in the more lurid refuge report what they did find wa in mani way equal disturbing: a popul wither after nearli a decad of chronic hunger, peopl so weaken by malnutrit that cold and stomach flu quickli turn lethal, the futur of a gener irretriev lost. now at last we have hard fact the situat is veri grave, said judith cheng-hopkin, region director for asia of the world food program, which ha taken part in the research. to me thi is a famin in slow motion. peopl cope year after year, and probabl a lot drop off. but the total is veri hard to gaug. for three week thi fall, crew led by foreign scientist were final permit to fan out across north korea to conduct the first random sampl nutrit survey of children, provid by far the most solid data on the crisi. they found that 62 percent of children under 7 had stunt growth, a symptom of long-term malnutrit. thirti percent of 1-year-old suffer from moder to sever malnutrit. thi mean a high likelihood of impair mental and physic develop, becaus the nervou system matur dramat dure thi essenti first year. the research said that avail scientif data suggest that 10 year ago, malnutrit wa rare in north korea. even if the situat improv, it is unlik to improv to the degre that the countri will fulli recov from what we saw, said judit katona-apt, a senior program advis for the world food program. peopl will be small and not as well develop as otherwis and somewhat limit in their mental capac. likewis, when red cross repres thi year test the water suppli at the 840 hospit and clinic where they oper, they found that not one had water that wa suitabl for human consumpt, said sten swedlund, head of the red cross deleg in north korea. but of cours they drink it they have no choic, he said dure a recent trip to beij. there is a veri close relationship between the problem caus by the lack of food and a health sector that' in veri bad shape. virtual all the children under 7 who are malnourish also have diarrhea, he said. none of the aid group ha been abl to studi the issu of hunger-rel death, and the north korean have not releas relev figur, although most expert agre that probabl more than one million and perhap as mani as three million have die prematur sinc the food shortag began. but public health expert say the number who have perish might be difficult to talli in ani case, becaus most death were probabl not from quick starvat, but from immun system weaken by year of hunger, so that common cold more easili give way to lethal pneumonia and an ordinari bout of infecti diarrhea prove fatal. still, there are some disturb clues: in one limit studi conduct by the world food program and other group last year on 4,000 children hand-pick by the govern, 10 percent had a parent who wa dead. in thi fall' independ nutrit survey, 18 team of expert sent to eight of north korea' nine provinc look at 1,800 rural and urban children under seven. in addit to find that 62 percent of children had stunt growth, the team found that about 16 percent of children were suffer from acut malnutrit and were underweight for their height, a sign that they were sever underf at the time of the studi. that figur is higher than in ani countri in east asia and put north korea among the world' worst 10 countri in term of malnutrit. while that 16 percent figur is not quit as bad as that of india and bangladesh, the worst in the world with an 18 percent malnutrit rate, expert say that north korea' number in some way underst the problem. in india and bangladesh, pocket of sever poverti altern with pocket of rel plenti, while in north korea the whole countri is to some degre underf. even in war-torn countri, famin is more in pocket, dr. katona-apt said. it' hard to think of anoth countri that' been affect in thi way. the survey result are especi sober sinc the research studi onli children under 7, the group that receiv nearli all the food donat from abroad. after three year of food donat, mani foreign aid worker in the countri have remark that children in nurseri and kindergarten are look better but that their older sibl are fail. so a month ago, the world food program began provid elementari school with high nutrit biscuit for children age 7 to 12. we have reason to believ that mani peopl are suffer and that the elderli are a neglect age group that is just get weaker and weaker, swedlund said. there are now more than 100 western live in pyongyang, the capit citi, and mani say the long-term hunger is readili appar there. if you walk down the street in pyongyang and ask a child how old she is, you are usual off by three year, swedlund said. she may be 7 but she look just 3 or 4. dr. katona-apt, a nutrit expert who ha work in bangladesh and the sudan, said she wa shock when she first visit a north korean kindergarten last year. there were these two children sit at a desk who were obvious sever malnourish they were so thin and they had patchi hair, she said. and they were just sit there work. thi is accept as normal! they are in school, and they should realli be hospit or place in nutrit rehabilit. if you saw them in a refuge camp, you would recommend immedi intervent. but with a sever deplet public health and hospit system, that option doe not exist, she and other said. mani korean doctor do not know how to diagnos or treat malnutrition; few had seen it befor thi decad. and, in ani case, the hospit lack the food and proper nutrit supplement. swedlund said most hospit lack medicin, had no glass to replac broken window and were colder insid than out, have receiv no coal sinc 1994. he said that even in hospit, sanit and water purif system were virtual nonexist, becaus the countri lack chlorin for purif and fuel to run water pump. he said that next year, the red cross would start to address those problem, spend $3.5 on food for hospit patient and $1 million on water treatment. with few other option, vast number of north korean have resort to eat substitut food, hard cake and noodl made from a mix of nutrit plant, like soybean and sweet potato, combin with

stomachach after eat thi partli indigest materi, he said, but ad, if you'r veri hungri, it fill your stomach. although the north korean date their food problem to a seri of flood and drought in the mid-1990', the foreign research who have work in north korea say medic record and childhood growth pattern indic that the hunger began sever year befor that and is link to the collaps of the soviet union, which had long been north korea' main supplier of food, fuel and fertil. north korea is a mountain countri, with less than 20 percent arabl land. it ha been a food import for decad, mostli from the former soviet union, but also from china. the countri ha to come to grip with the fact that thi is part of a structur problem and can't just be blame on the weather anymor, ms. cheng-hopkin said. still, she and other prais the normal rigid and secret govern for slowli loosen it restrict. swedlund said that after three year in the countri, the intern red cross, which collabor with the north korean red cross, had found offici increasingli respons and doctor more will to share medic record and bring up problem. travel is still restrict. there are more than 100 counti, home to 30 percent of the popul, to which aid group have no access and where they have therefor refus to provid food or medic suppli. still, the number of counti open to the worker ha increas steadili, and freedom to move about ha improv. ms. cheng-hopkin said about half of follow-up inspect were now unannounc, and she note that the research in the nutrit survey were allow to select villag to visit and enter home at random. worker from the red cross and the world food program said they had not observ extrem scene of peopl die of acut starvat and believ that they would have if they were occur frequent. i have not seen acut starvat like i have seen in bangladesh, dr. katona-apt said. but that doesn't mean it can't exist. we'r still realli limit in what we can see. swedlund said it wa unlik that the counti still close to foreign were markedli differ from the open one. and while some have surmis that the close counti might harbor pocket of death and devast, he said he accept north korea' explan that they had been exclud from some area for nation secur reason. one thing i'v learn is how import nation secur issu are to the north korean, said swedlund, a retir admir in the swedish navi. and i realli think these area are import from that standpoint, he ad, go through a map of close area and describ what western intellig expert know about militari instal there. he also reject the notion that the north korean militari is steal donat food, a charg level by the organ doctor without border, when it angrili pull out of north korea last summer to protest the mani restrict on group work there. now that aid group say they are start to get somewhat better cooper from the north korean, they hope to repeat their nutrit survey everi 6 to 12 month. and they are still analyz some tantal findings: boy were twice as like to suffer from stunt growth as girl, and everi child whose mother wa dead wa malnourish. a gener of north korean children is alreadi scar for life, said astrid heiberg, presid of the

narrow. the disappoint elect result also left gingrich open to a fractiou challeng for hi post as speaker. member and aid said wednesday that a furi at the speaker had bubbl up overnight and that some member were tri to organ a slate of candid to replac gingrich and hi leadership team when hous republican conven on nov. 18 to select their leader for next year. as rep. mark sanford, r-s.c., put it, when a company' stock price goe down, it' usual the ceo who get fire. top republican aid, speak anonym, were even blunter. peopl were veri angri last night, one aid said. today it' a mixtur of seeth and dismay. it' just ugli. and newt know it. hi career is on the line. anoth aid said, most peopl are realli angri with newt, and no one know what to do with it. but some are dip their toe in the water and see what the temperatur is. a possibl slate could contain the name of rep. robert l. livingston of louisiana to replac gingrich, steve largent of oklahoma to replac dick armey of texa as major leader, and jennif dunn of washington to replac john a. boehner of ohio as confer chairman. rep. david m. mcintosh of indiana is also said to be consid a run for speaker, but it wa not clear whether he would be part of ani slate. rep. tom delay of texa, the major whip, wa said to be secur. armey bluntli acknowledg the scrambl go on in the wing to oust the leadership. told on nightlin that there were republican after hi head, armey replied: they'r welcom to it if they'r big enough to take it. publicli, gingrich ha express confid about keep hi job as speaker. but he ha been grim-fac over the last 24 hour and closet himself wednesday with hi top strategist make call to shore up hi support among member. he look like the victim of an accid, said rep. peter king, r-n.y., who support gingrich. he' veri somber in tone. the question, as it alway is with gingrich, is how mani member are prepar to rebel against hi leadership. in the past, no more than a coupl of dozen member have openli express their dissatisfact with him, and a coup attempt last year fizzl for lack of support. i'm hope more peopl will understand the need for a seriou reassess thi year, said rep. charl t. canadi, r-fla., who said he had hope for a challeng to the speaker after the 1996 elect, when the republican also lost seat. the realiti is this: our major keep shrink, canadi said. if it shrink ani more, it will be gone. but gingrich ha built support among moder, and some perceiv the elect as a repudi of the conserv. rep. sherwood l. boehlert, r-utah, said the result show that thi wa the right direct for the parti. to maintain our major, we'v got to moder some of our view, boehlert said. thoma mann, a congression scholar at the brook institut, said that moder support gingrich in part becaus no appeal altern had emerg. they know he see the broader world and is prepar to moder if it make sens, mann said. newt' gone out of hi way to support the moder. he' nurtur a relationship with them. but mann and other said that anger ha been build at gingrich for sever reason, includ hi sign on to a budget deal last month that seem to capitul to presid clinton, not offer a clear legisl agenda for republican and not commun a clear polit messag. we are most defin by who we hate said rep. mark souder, r-ind. but voter are more sophist than that, and republican better have someth to say about where we'r go. the anger grew in the last few day when the speaker approv a $10-million anti-clinton advertis campaign that allow democrat to turn the elect into a referendum on gingrich, who ha never been nearli as popular with the public as clinton ha been. as if onli slowli absorb the implic of the loss, the speaker seem unabl at a news confer here wednesday morn to pinpoint whi the parti suffer a net drop of five seat in the hous. as late as tuesday afternoon, he wa predict a net pickup of between 10 and 30. until we look at it better, i frankli don't understand all the thing that happen yesterday, he said, and i'm not sure anybodi els in the countri doe either. but he said republican should have maniac focus on a basic messag of cut tax, save social secur and prevent drug abus, and campaign aggress on those theme. he contrast the lack of focu thi year with the contract with america that prove so success in 1994. peopl thought we stood for someth pretti big, he said. but gingrich also seem awar of the mount concern about hi leadership, repeatedli cast the elect result as a victori for hi leadership team becaus republican had stay in the major for three elect in a row for the first time in 70 year. he also suggest that those who would challeng him have littl support. the peopl who normal are quot on thi are peopl who would in fact take the parti to a narrow base, gingrich said, refer to the period erupt of concern among conserv about hi leadership. i'd like to see who it wa that had a plan that they were confid over the last 60 day would have been more success and whi they didn't share it. an intens struggl for control of the hous is underway, with rep. bob livingston conduct a telephon campaign to replac rep. newt gingrich as speaker and gingrich fight with a counter-campaign that ha given some member paus about oust him. at the same time, a small band of republican vow on thursday that they would not vote to re-elect gingrich under ani circumst, a move that, becaus of the republicans' shrunken hous major, could tie the parti in knot for month becaus it could throw the speakership to a democrat. rep. matt salmon, r-ariz., said: i person have made the decis that i cannot vote for newt gingrich for speaker in januari, and there are six other who have told me they feel the same way, seven peopl who just will not, and it take six to deadlock the vote. furi at the speaker ha boil over sinc tuesday' elect, when republican suffer a net loss of five seat in the hous. they blame gingrich, the party' chief strategist. but mani were alreadi angri at him for what they said wa hi failur to articul a clear messag for the parti go into the elect and for a messi budget process that gave presid clinton a polit edg and contradict republican principl of fiscal conservativ by contain massiv amount of pork spend. hous republican are to meet nov. 18 to vote by secret ballot for their leader. whoever win the party' nomin for speaker then stand for elect by the full hous in januari. even if gingrich win the secret ballot, he could be deni re-elect as speaker in januari if salmon and at least five other refus to vote for him. becaus the republican now control the hous by onli 12 seat, it would take just six vote against gingrich to deni him a major and allow democrat to potenti elect one of their own as speaker. with such a chaotic and unaccept prospect loom, livingston told gingrich that he should step asid for the good of the parti, accord to republican offici. the offici said that livingston spoke to gingrich shortli after the disastr elect return but also befor the elect, reflect livingston' earlier displeasur with the speaker over the budget process. sever republican said that both livingston, the chairman of the appropri committe and one of the few member with the statur to stand for speaker, and gingrich were work the phone on thursday in a struggl for vote. livingston ha said noth publicli about a challeng to gingrich, but sever member and aid said on thursday that he would announc hi intent, possibl as soon as friday, after he had determin if he could win. he won't do it 'til he ha hi duck in a row, and right now a lot of peopl are still loyal to the speaker, said an aid to a republican who, like mani other, is tri to straddl the line between fealti to a speaker who may retain power and encourag to a challeng who offer a salv to an embattl parti. stun by the democrat resurg in the mid-term elect, congression republican tore into each other wednesday over who wa to blame for their failur to make the tradit opposit parti gain in an off-year elect. the soul-search and recrimin and a possibl of congression leadership challeng came as elect result show that republican had been unabl to increas their 55-45 hold over the senat and that democrat had pick up five seat in the hous. the democrat surg mark the first time sinc 1934 that the president' parti had gain seat in a midterm elect, and it whittl the republican hous major down to a mere six vote. the democrat victori were even more remark in a polit year mark by the months-long scandal over presid clinton' affair with monica lewinski. the republicans' new 223-211 major (assum a democrat lead in oregon hold on to win), with one independ, amount to the smallest congression major sinc the republican-control congress of 1953, the last time republican control the hous until they captur it again in 1994. with attent now shift to the hous judiciari committe and it impeach inquiri, rep. henri hyde told fellow republican on the panel in a confer call wednesday that the onli wit republican were like to call would be the independ counsel, kenneth starr. hyde, the chairman, told lawmak he hope to have the committe vote on possibl articl of impeach by thanksgiv, an act that would take the issu out of hi hand and put it into gingrich'. committe democrat declin comment wednesday until they could discuss hyde' plan among themselv. tri to put the best face on the result, speaker newt gingrich said in marietta, ga., that the republican still held onto the hous for three elect in a row for the first time sinc the elect of 1932. but furiou rank and file republican burn up the phone line to each other, discuss whether to mount leadership challeng in both chamber in the next few week. we'v got to reach out and have more than southern white male run the washington republican parti, said rep. joe scarborough, a conserv from florida. he said that republican thi year had been left without ani accomplish to run on. we need an agenda first of all, he said. we went an entir calendar year without an agenda. rep. chri shay, a moder from connecticut call the elect a devast loss and said simpli, there are go to be major chang in our leadership. all segment of our parti want to see chang. at the white hous, clinton call the elect result a vindic of hi party' polici. if you look at all the result, he said, they are clear and unambigu. the american peopl want their busi, their concern, their children, their famili, their futur address here. that' what the messag e of the elect wa. one of the first difficult question now face congress is how to proceed with the impeach inquiri in the face of public resist to remov clinton from offic, and with a republican major now so slim that it is almost certain that the 218 vote requir for impeach cannot be assembl. in a public statement releas wednesday, hyde said the committe continu to have a clear constituion duti to complet it work in a fair and expediti manner. our duti ha not chang becasu the constitut ha not chang. but sen. robert torricelli, d-n.j., said the elect result guarante that impeach will fail. i think ani seriou effort to remov presid clinton from offic is effect over, he said. it is simpli for newt gingrich and trent lott to decid on an exit strategi. from the other side of the aisl, rep. rick lazio, a long island republican, said, the inquiri should be wrap up expediti, fairli and it ought to be resolv in the immedi futur. for the past year, republican struggl to keep control of the hous with a 228-207 major and to find consensu among their party' compet faction. with their number reduc, the republican leadership will need to carri out a tortuou balanc act to unit a hard-cor conserv faction that want a more aggress social agenda with a bloc of moder who want their parti to return to the center. ani small republican faction will now have enorm leverag. the new arithmet of the hous may even lead to democrats' and moder republicans' form ad hoc major on issu, take control away from republican leader. alreadi see some of the possibl, rep. peter king of long island, n.y., said northeastern republican would be strengthen. it give us much more leverag with the leadership and make it easier to protect new york, he said. it' go to weaken the posit of the strident conserv and the anti-northeast conserv. just two week ago, gingrich had foreseen elect gain rang from 10 seat to more than 40. seem uncharacterist uncertain wednesday, he said he had troubl account for the result. thing were happen out there that none of us fulli understand--neith parti in my judgment, he said. take hi share of the blame for hi party' loss, the georgia republican said he had misjudg how the public would recoil from the clinton scandal as amplifi in the modern media world and how the scandal would drown out other republican theme. i mean i total underestim the degre to which peopl would just get sick of 24-hour-a day talk televis and talk radio and then the degre to which thi whole scandal becam just sort of disgust by sheer repetit, he said. and as a result i think we probabl underestim the need to realli aggress push a much stronger messag about cut tax and save social secur, win the war on drug, reform educ and nation defens. major leader sen. trent lott of mississippi also admit mistak, say hi parti had not present a clear enough messag in the final 96 hour of the campaign. he also conced that congress' final scrambl to pass a $500 billion budget bill hurt hi parti. one of thi lesson for republican out of thi is that we need to listen more care to the peopl and we need to have a clear understand and concis messag that we do appli across the nation, he said in washington. both lott and gingrich said republican would put an emphasi next year on tax-cut and shore up the social secur system. even as the two leader spoke, their angri rank-and-fil lawmak were make phone call tri to assess whether to mount challeng against the republican leader who have steer the congress sinc the republican' assum control four year ago. one senior republican staffer said the hous had becom a tinderbox of intrigu. scarborough said, the long distanc charg in washington offic probabl are go through the roof today. everybody' call everybodi. everybodi recogn that something' terribl wrong with the direct of washington republican when republican governor are do so well in new york, massachusett, florida and texa. and while gingrich ha not gone out of hi way to identifi himself with the republican campaign' last-minut ad blitz attack presid clinton, hi caucu know he is respons. gingrich ha face down an upris befor, foil a coup attempt against him by disgruntl conserv and some of hi own leadership team in the summer of 1997. ani move to remov him remain a long-shot. but with hous leadership elect now set for mid-novemb, republican said thi time the dissatisfact in their caucu had cross ideolog line to moder like shay as well. we got shellack, said rep. christoph cannon, a conser from utah. we beat ourselv becaus we had no agenda. republican were discuss possibl challeng to gingrich, hi second-in-command, rep. dick armey, and other member of the senior leadership team. some were envis tri to run an entir new ticket head by rep. bob livingston, the appropri committe chairman from louisiana and includ rep. steve largent, an oklahoma conserv. ask whether tuesday' elect result could cost him the speakership, gingrich said, i'm not particularli concern. republican close to him said they expect the anger to dissip. in the senat, where leadership race take place in earli decemb, some republican were talk of mount challeng against mid-level leadership figur. sever senat express particular piqu toward the re-elect chairman, senat mitch mcconnel of kentucki, who pour parti dollar and much of hi own time into tri to defeat the democrat champion of campaign financ overhaul, russel feingold of wisconsin. feingold won in a close race. some lawmak on wednesday approach sen. chuck hagel of nebraska to see if he would replac mcconnel. hagel confirm he had talk to more than eight senat, and wa consid whether to challeng mcconnel. hagel lambast the republican leadership for the elect outcom. thi is a big loss for us, he said. we squander a veri histor opportun last night. to just break even is a loss. most incumb coast to victori tuesday night. but some will not be return. five hous republican were defeated: vinc snowbarg of kansa, bill redmond of new mexico, jon fox of pennsylvania, mike pappa of new jersey, and rick white of washington. one democrat also lost hi re-elect bid rep. jay johnson of wisconsin. the new hous member includ 17 republican and at least 22 democrat. david wu, a democrat wa lead molli bordonaro, a republican in the race for one hous seat in oregon, but the final victori announc wa not expect until friday after absente

of the democrat are the son of former lawmak, mark udal of colorado, son of morri udal who repres arizona; tom udal of new mexico, son of the other udal brother, stewart, a former congressman and

congression democrat disavow hi war on speaker newt gingrich, jame carvil, presid clinton' former campaign strategist and chief outsid defend, put forth a new battl cri wednesday: he will not be muzzl. not onli that, but carvil went beyond hi customari denunci of gingrich and the republican and, in an interview, train hi fire on leader in hi own parti for not be suffici aggress four week befor elect day. my sens of frustrat is that i believ the democrat have a much better chanc of do much better than anyon expect, carvil said. and i don't think anyone' emerg to tri to pull it togeth. everybodi ought to be push, the leadership in the congress, the white hous, the dnc. we ought to hammer gingrich everi day. how can you take the congress back if you don't make a case against the peopl who are run it? i have never heard of a strategi like that. sound increasingli agit, he went on: the onli peopl left to be activ in thi elect are democrat. the right wing, they'r bounc off the wall. they'r go out to vote. rep. dick gephardt, the minor leader, complain to erskin bowl, the white hous chief of staff, after carvil appear on the nbc new program meet the press on sept. 27 and declar, cpl. cue ball carvil will be roll into battl against newt gingrich. the concern among hous democrat, one express by some white hous offici as well, wa that carville' vitriol would make the democrat appear overli partisan and could be especi damag to democrat in margin district who do not want to appear too easi on the presid. but on wednesday, carvil wa anyth but timid. if gephardt peopl think they'v quiet me down, he said, i'm not quiet. carvil said he told offici at the white hous, don't wast your breath about call me and tell me not to say thi. carvil insist that he would rather do battl with republican than with hi fellow democrat. if they want to fight with me, they can, he said. i'm go to fight with the republican. yet he could not help but ridicul hi parti. ask to describ the democrats' strategi for the elect, carvil said, if there is one, no one' share it with me. just four year ago, it wa a good bet that newt gingrich would be the pivot figur in us. polit at the turn of the millennium. seemingli overnight he had taken a moribund minor parti and turn it into a pumped-up, issue-driven hous major. with a promis to balanc the budget, end welfar and repres more conserv social valu, he appear to have rearrang the polit map for congress just as ronald reagan had done for the presid. but gingrich' leadership is now so shaki that even if he maintain hi hold on the speaker' offic, he is in danger of margin. a chang thi dramat suggest someth far more profound than a miscalcul about elect tactic. what look like one of the major realign in us. polit histori might turn out to have been noth but a temporari shift. the gingrich revolut wa fuel by anger, a revolt of white working-class american against what they perceiv as a democrat bia in favor of black and other minor, and a middle-class reject of the polit of big govern and big deficit. they were the same resent that ronald reagan had exploit so success. but old polit habit and a moribund republican leadership allow the democrat to retain control of congress throughout the 1980, and turn reagan' econom program into an undisciplin tax-cut spree that creat prosper along with huge budget gap. gingrich' attention-grab rhetor, energi and talent for polit organ final took reagan' formula for success to the congression elect in 1994. but onc in power, he ran head on into bill clinton, whose polit instinct were even better. the presid co-opt part of the contract with america, particularli the balanc budget and welfar reform. he adapt the republican social messag into a call for thing like school uniform and televis rate system, which symbol more respons and parent control without support govern intrus into privat live. the republican right' genuin contempt for clinton wa base in part on the well-known flaw in the president' charact. but it wa mainli a reaction to the eas with which he had divert what wa suppos to be the flood tide of their revolut. they expect that the genuin success of gingrich' first year in offic would lead to still larger victori for minim govern and tax, unfett free enterpris and a return to conserv christian valu. but the public wa happi to be led in anoth direct, and focu on the concern of age babi boomer about health care and social secur. the govern that wa seen as the enemi when the issu were budgetari onc again look like a potenti alli. back in 1994, both parti were so stun by the sudden chang in their congression fortun that they may have overestim what it all meant. in particular they may not have realiz how quickli good econom time, a drop in crime and nation welfar reform could blunt the power of race in us. polit. the democrat had becom liter a minor parti as white voter resent identifi their polici with citi, black and immigr. but last week union worker and cathol return to the democrat fold. without race as a wedg issu, the solid black democrat vote becam a power advantag in key state. black, women and latino angri at republican anti-immigr initi were the win coalit in california, north carolina and new york. the speaker wa right to say thi wa not the elect we expect. there may inde be a republican major in america, but it appear to resembl the republican of dwight eisenhow rather than newt gingrich pro-busi, wari of debt and with an inher distast for bring up messi social issu like abort. the republican who have begun talk about compassion conservat and the polit of inclus may be peddl polit mush, but they peddl it to victori on tuesday. the congression republican party' long sojourn in the wilder of the hous minor may have left it too accustom to opposit to figur out what it can be for, and too attach to the polit of anger to make sens of a nation in the mood for moder. gingrich ha

interest, especi speaker gingrich' strong support for america' continu leadership for freedom, peac and prosper in the world. mani republican took the opportun to portray gingrich as a visionari. rep. sherwood boehlert of new york said that dure the first confer call, there wa shock and surpris and strong express of appreci for lead us to the promis land. hi support said gingrich had the vote to win the elect to nomin a speaker, which is to be conduct by secret ballot. but, they agre, the party' slim, six-vot major meant everi vote would be a battl. kenneth duberstein, a former offici in the

to implement hi plan. in an unusu bite reaction, rep. dick gephardt of missouri, the democrat leader, said he hope that gingrich' resign would clear the fierc partisan air that he had foster. i hope that whoever succe newt gingrich as speaker will immedi begin the process of repair the damag that wa wrought on thi institut over the last four year, gephardt said. hous republican predict that gingrich' resign would set off a more wide-rang and hectic scrambl to replac him than had been anticip. there will be a lot of pretend to the throne who will test the water, said boehlert, who had support gingrich for re-elect as speaker. there won't be ani shortag of candid. the presidenti campaign of 2000 began wednesday, like it or not. the millenni elect will be fought on a polit play field whose rough outlin, if not it exact boundari, were drawn by the voter in tuesday' elect, which deliv a crush disappoint to the giddi hope of the republican and an unexpect elixir to the recent ail democrat. presid clinton call it an astonish triumph of issu over investig and said the democrat had won so mani major victori becaus they had a clear messag. republican agre. of cours the next 18 month will bring mani surpris and mani revers of fortun. but the elect result offer import guidelin. tuesday wa a great day for vice presid al gore, for at least three reason. he work furious and success in the last ten day befor the ballot to persuad democrat loyalist not to stay home and sulk, appear on behalf of no fewer than 224 candid, accord to hi offic. a moder within the spectrum of hi own parti, he watch moder win crucial elect, notabl in the california gubernatori race, where lt. gov. gray davi, a cautiou pragmatist like gore, won a smash victori. the return an even break in the senat and a democrat gain of five in the hous of repres also made the impeach of presid clinton less like. and the better shape clinton is in as hi term end, the better chanc gore, hi sidekick for six year now, stand in the presidenti nomin process and, ultim, the elect. but california voter also complic the nomin process and set gore strategist to work on tactic to uncompl it, becaus he and they consid the state absolut central to hi presidenti aspir. in a referendum in 1996, california adopt a primari system under which republican, democrat and independ voter would all receiv the same ballot, with candid of all parti list. that violat the rule of both major parti, and a measur on the ballot tuesday, proposit 3, would have rescind the 1996 chang. but it fail, rais the possibl that california' march 7 primari will be a mere polit popular poll, with convent deleg chosen in caucu or convent a nightmar. tuesday wa a bad day for the republican right. high-profil right-wing lost across the countri, from attorney gener dan lungren in the california governor' race to sen. lauch faircloth, deni re-elect in north carolina, to rep. mark neumann of wisconsin, who fail in a senat race despit a huge spend advantag over sen. russel feingold, to ellen sauerbrey in maryland, who prove unabl on her second tri to prevail over an unpopular democrat governor, parri glenden. both conserv and moder in the parti said the republican had to get back to basic. even speaker newt gingrich conced that the result should sober everi republican and call for new strateg think. if you make it a referendum on a presid with a 67 per cent approv rate, as they tri to do, you shouldn't be surpris if the elect goe against you, said gov. tom ridg of pennsylvania, a moder whose promot mention him weekli as a possibl vice-presidenti nomine. sen. john mccain of arizona, a conserv who tend to steer away from divis social issu, won re-elect with 68 per cent of the vote. he is studi the possibl of a presidenti race, but befor he or ani other republican nomine can hope to win, he said in an interview wednesday, congression republican and their leader need to learn some lesson. i just hope thi debacl is a wake-up call for our peopl, he said. you'v got to be for someth smaller govern, better educ, someth. we'r seen as the parti that' against everyth. poll taken late in thi year' campaign bore mccain out. they show that the republican are no longer identifi with issu that were onc their elector bread and butter, such as low tax and law and order. tuesday wa also a fresh demonstr, for anyon who need one, of the polit util of pitch a tent big enough for almost everyon. black politician in north carolina, maryland and california report that their fear of an indiffer black turnout had prove groundless. black vote prove indispens to a consider number of hard-press democrat candid, especi where they felt their interest directli threaten. the figur on hispan vote, assembl from exit poll and from the candidates' own precinct analys, show dramat differ. in california, where the outgo republican governor, pete wilson, had play the anti-immigr card with a vengeanc, both major democrat candid davi and sen. barbara boxer, who won re-elect after trail in earli poll clean up among hispan voter. he took 78 percent, she 72. but both of the bush brother, jeb in florida and georg w. in texa, took more than half the hispan vote in their highli success gubernatori campaign. so did mccain. jeb bush is marri to a hispan woman, he and hi brother both speak spanish fluentli and frequent, and senat mccain ha long espous hispan caus. both georg w. bush and mccain will draw strength, if they decid to run, from their proven abil to appeal to hispan voter, as well as their gener elector strength. georg w. bush took 69 percent of the vote in texa, where a democrat sat in the governor' chair onli four year ago, and which ha the second-largest bloc of elector vote. florida ha the fourth-largest. governor bush of texa utter a ralli cri for the moder. a leader who is compassion and conserv, he said in hi victori speech, can eras the gender gap and open the republican parti to new face and new voic. but figur on the right saw thing differ. jame dobson, a lead religi broadcast, said that republican had fare poorli becaus gingrich and sen. trent lott of mississippi, the major leader, had cave in to the presid on the budget and de-emphas social issu such as abort and flag desecr. he call all but explicitli for the ouster of gingrich. likewis, the millionair publish steve forb, anoth probabl candid in 2000, said the leadership will have a lot to answer for. tuesday prove the potenc of educ as an issu, and suggest that it will emerg as a major theme of the 2000 campaign. clinton, in hi limit involv in the campaign, and gore, in hi extens particip, both stress democrat program to build more school and hire more teacher. almost a quarter of california voter and there are now almost twice as mani voter in california as in ani other state name educ as their most press concern. elsewher, democrat won the governorship of alabama and south carolina against the odd, partli by emphas their rivals' opposit to lotteri that will help to pay for school. in iowa, a democrat wa elect governor for the first time sinc 1969 on a platform that featur the dilapid condit of the state' school and a promis to remedi it. tuesday demonstr the overrid import of money in modern american polit. feingold, one of the princip backer of campaign-fin reform, surviv to fight anoth day, but so did oppon of reform. and the return in hous race, show that all but six of 401 member who sought re-elect had won, underlin onc again how hard it is, under the present system, for a challeng to rais enough money to compet effect. the difficulti of rais money may doom mani would-b presidenti candidaci. gore will have what he need, as will bush, forb and former gov. lamar alexand of tennesse. but how mani other will? final, tuesday deliv an indecis messag about impeach. close to two-third of voter nationwid told exit pollster that they intend to send no messag about clinton, but they made it clear in respons to other question that they dislik the hous inquiri into the president' alleg misde and want to see it end. in onli two state, kansa and nebraska, did a major of voter say they favor even a congression censur of clinton, a much milder form of punish advoc by mani clinton backer. some republican said privat that there should be no hear at all in the clinton matter, and some democrat began talk about a deal, the equival of a plea bargain that would bring the matter to an earli close. nevertheless, republican member of the hous judiciari committe said they need to press ahead with the constitut process that the hous ha set in motion. among those take that view were rep. bob barr of georgia, a fierc foe of the presid, and rep. mari bono of california, whose tone ha been more mute. but rep. david dreier of california, the incom rule committe chairman, said that the elect ha play a role in ensur that one of us ha a desir to drag that out. stun by the democrat resurg in the mid-term elect, congression republican tore into each other wednesday over who wa to blame for their failur to make the tradit opposit parti gain in an off-year elect. the soul-search and recrimin and a possibl of congression leadership challeng came as elect result show that republican had been unabl to increas their 55-45 hold over the senat and that democrat had pick up five seat in the hous. the democrat surg mark the first time sinc 1934 that the president' parti had gain seat in a midterm elect, and it whittl the republican hous major down to a mere six vote. the democrat victori were even more remark in a polit year mark by the months-long scandal over presid clinton' affair with monica lewinski. the republicans' new 223-211 major (assum a democrat lead in oregon hold on to win), with one independ, amount to the smallest congression major sinc the republican-control congress of 1953, the last time republican control the hous until they captur it again in 1994. with attent now shift to the hous judiciari committe and it impeach inquiri, rep. henri hyde told fellow republican on the panel in a confer call wednesday that the onli wit republican were like to call would be the independ counsel, kenneth starr. hyde, the chairman, told lawmak he hope to have the committe vote on possibl articl of impeach by thanksgiv, an act that would take the issu out of hi hand and put it into gingrich'. committe democrat declin comment wednesday until they could discuss hyde' plan among themselv. tri to put the best face on the result, speaker newt gingrich said in marietta, ga., that the republican still held onto the hous for three elect in a row for the first time sinc the elect of 1932. but furiou rank and file republican burn up the phone line to each other, discuss whether to mount leadership challeng in both chamber in the next few week. we'v got to reach out and have more than southern white male run the washington republican parti, said rep. joe scarborough, a conserv from florida. he said that republican thi year had been left without ani accomplish to run on. we need an agenda first of all, he said. we went an entir calendar year without an agenda. rep. chri shay, a moder from connecticut call the elect a devast loss and said simpli, there are go to be major chang in our leadership. all segment of our parti want to see chang. at the white hous, clinton call the elect result a vindic of hi party' polici. if you look at all the result, he said, they are clear and unambigu. the american peopl want their busi, their concern, their children, their famili, their futur address here. that' what the messag of the elect wa. one of the first difficult question now face congress is how to proceed with the impeach inquiri in the face of public resist to remov clinton from offic, and with a republican major now so slim that it is almost certain that the 218 vote requir for impeach cannot be assembl. in a public statement releas wednesday, hyde said the committe continu to have a clear constitut duti to complet it work in a fair and expediti manner. our duti ha not chang becaus the constitut ha not chang. but sen. robert torricelli, d-n.j., said the elect result guarante that impeach will fail. i think ani seriou effort to remov presid clinton from offic is effect over, he said. it is simpli for newt gingrich and trent lott to decid on an exit strategi. from the other side of the aisl, rep. rick lazio, a long island republican, said, the inquiri should be wrap up expediti, fairli and it ought to be resolv in the immedi futur. for the past year, republican struggl to keep control of the hous with 228 seat and to find consensu among their party' compet faction. with their number reduc, the republican leadership will need to carri out a tortuou balanc act to unit a hard-cor conserv faction that want a more aggress social agenda with a bloc of moder who want their parti to return to the center. the democrat held 206 seat, and one wa held by an indepennd. ani small republican faction will now have enorm leverag. the new arithmet of the hous may even lead to democrats' and moder republicans' form ad hoc major on issu, take control away from republican leader. alreadi see some of the possibl, rep. peter king of long island, n.y., said northeastern republican would be strengthen. it give us much more leverag with the leadership and make it easier to protect new york, he said. it' go to weaken the posit of the strident conserv and the anti-northeast conserv. just two week ago, gingrich had foreseen elect gain rang from 10 seat to more than 40. seem uncharacterist uncertain wednesday, he said he had troubl account for the result. thing were happen out there that none of us fulli understand--neith parti in my judgment, he said. take hi share of the blame for hi party' loss, the georgia republican said he had misjudg how the public would recoil from the clinton scandal as amplifi in the modern media world and how the scandal would drown out other republican theme. i mean i total underestim the degre to which peopl would just get sick of 24-hour-a day talk televis and talk radio and then the degre to which thi whole scandal becam just sort of disgust by sheer repetit, he said. and as a result i think we probabl underestim the need to realli aggress push a much stronger messag about cut tax and save social secur, win the war on drug, reform educ and nation defens. major leader sen. trent lott of mississippi also admit mistak, say hi parti had not present a clear enough messag in the final 96 hour of the campaign. he also conced that congress' final scrambl to pass a $500 billion budget bill hurt hi parti. one of thi lesson for republican out of thi is that we need to listen more care to the peopl and we need to have a clear understand and concis messag that we do appli across the nation, he said in washington. both lott and gingrich said republican would put an emphasi next year on tax-cut and shore up the social secur system. even as the two leader spoke, their angri rank-and-fil lawmak were make phone call tri to assess whether to mount challeng against the republican leader who have steer the congress sinc the republican' assum control four year ago. one senior republican staffer said the hous had becom a tinderbox of intrigu. scarborough said, the long distanc charg in washington offic probabl are go through the roof today. everybody' call everybodi. everybodi recogn that something' terribl wrong with the direct of washington republican when republican governor are do so well in new york, massachusett, florida and texa. and while gingrich ha not gone out of hi way to identifi himself with the republican campaign' last-minut ad blitz attack presid clinton, hi caucu know he is respons. gingrich ha face down an upris befor, foil a coup attempt against him by disgruntl conserv and some of hi own leadership team in the summer of 1997. ani move to remov him remain a long-shot. but with hous leadership elect now set for mid-novemb, republican said thi time the dissatisfact in their caucu had cross ideolog line to moder like shay as well. we got shellack, said rep. christoph cannon, a conserv from utah. we beat ourselv becaus we had no agenda. republican were discuss possibl challeng to gingrich, hi second-in-command, rep. dick armey, and other member of the senior leadership team. some were envis tri to run an entir new ticket head by rep. bob livingston, the appropri committe chairman from louisiana and includ rep. steve largent, an oklahoma conserv. ask whether tuesday' elect result could cost him the speakership, gingrich said, i'm not particularli concern. republican close to him said they expect the anger to dissip. in the senat, where leadership race take place in earli decemb, some republican were talk of mount challeng against mid-level leadership figur. sever senat express particular piqu toward the re-elect chairman, senat mitch mcconnel of kentucki, who pour parti dollar and much of hi own time into tri to defeat the democrat champion of campaign financ overhaul, russel feingold of wisconsin. feingold won in a close race. some lawmak on wednesday approach sen. chuck hagel of nebraska to see if he would replac mcconnel. hagel confirm he had talk to more than eight senat, and wa consid whether to challeng mcconnel. hagel lambast the republican leadership for the elect outcom. thi is a big loss for us, he said. we squander a veri histor opportun last night. to just break even is a loss. most incumb coast to victori tuesday night. but some will not be return. five hous republican were defeated: vinc snowbarg of kansa, bill redmond of new mexico, jon fox of pennsylvania, mike pappa of new jersey, and rick white of washington. one democrat also lost hi re-elect bid rep. jay johnson of wisconsin. the new hous member includ 17 republican and at least 22 democrat. david wu, a democrat wa lead molli bordonaro, a republican in the race for one hous seat in oregon, but the final victori announc wa not expect until friday after absente ballot are count. unlik the self-proclaim revolutionari of the republican class of 1994, mani of the newli elect member are career politician who rose through the rank of local and state govern. three of the democrat are the son of former lawmak, mark udal of colorado, son of morri udal who repres arizona; tom udal of new mexico, son of the other udal brother, stewart, a former congressman and secretari of the interior, and charli gonzalez, who won the texa seat of hi father, henri. a struggl for control of the hous is under way, with rep. robert livingston conduct a telephon campaign that could lead to him run against newt gingrich as speaker. but gingrich' counter-campaign ha given some member paus about oust him. at the same time, a small band of republican vow on thursday that they would not vote to re-elect gingrich under ani circumst, a move that, becaus of the republicans' shrunken hous major, could tie the parti in knot for month. rep. matt salmon, r-ariz., said: i person have made the decis that i cannot vote for newt gingrich for speaker in januari, and there are six other who have told me they feel the same way, seven peopl who just will not, and it take six to deadlock the vote. furi at the speaker ha boil over sinc tuesday' elect, when republican suffer a net loss of five seat in the hous. they blame gingrich, the party' chief strategist. but mani were alreadi angri at him for what they said wa hi failur to articul a clear messag for the parti go into the elect and for a messi budget process that gave presid clinton a polit edg and contradict republican principl of fiscal conservativ by contain massiv amount of spend for local project. hous republican are to meet nov. 18 to vote by secret ballot for their leader. whoever win the republican nomin for speaker must stand for elect by the full hous in januari. even if gingrich win the secret ballot, he could be deni re-elect as speaker in januari if salmon and at least five other refus to vote for him. becaus the republican now control the hous by onli 12 seat, it would take just six vote against gingrich to deni him a major. with such a chaotic and unaccept prospect loom, livingston told gingrich that he should step asid for the good of the parti, republican offici said. the offici said that livingston spoke to gingrich shortli after the elect return but also befor the elect, reflect livingston' earlier displeasur with the speaker over the budget process. sever republican said that both livingston, the chairman of the appropri committe and one of the few member with the statur to stand for speaker, and gingrich were work the phone on thursday in a struggl for vote. livingston ha said noth publicli about a challeng to gingrich, but sever member and aid said on thursday that he would announc hi intent, possibl as soon as friday, onli after he had determin if he could win. rep. peter king, r-n.y., wa one of sever member who spoke with livingston on thursday. he told me he' make a number of phone call, that he' gotten a veri posit respons about run for speaker, and he'll decid within the next 48 hour, king said. he won't do it till he ha hi duck in a row, and right now a lot of peopl are still loyal to the speaker, said an aid to a republican who, like mani other, is tri to straddl the line between fealti to a speaker who may retain power and encourag to a challeng who offer a salv to an embattl parti. mani republican immedi blame gingrich for the party' loss on tuesday. talk quickli emerg the next day of a slate of candid to oppos gingrich and hi lieuten. the list of possibl candid for leadership posit includ rep. steve largent of oklahoma, who talk with livingston on thursday about challeng gingrich, republican offici said, speak on the

party' loss tuesday. leadership take credit when thing go right, he said. they ought to take the blame when thing go wrong. ask if gingrich should remain speaker, hyde said: i rather think he will, but that remain to be seen. the energi that mani vent publicli on wednesday as anger toward gingrich seem devot on thursday to intens intern polit calcul about whether livingston could succeed in toppl gingrich and whether he should succeed. while mani support him as a veteran who understand the hous and ha shown shrewd polit skill in manag the massiv feder budget, other are reviv imag of the louisianan as a hot-head who gave the parti a bad name dure the govern shutdown two year ago and who tend toward arm-flail in heat moment. one conserv leader said that he and hi alli had reserv about livingston becaus he wa obsess about tri to keep social issu out of the budget process. the budget, he said, ha been a vehicl for conserv over the year to add restrict on feder money for abort and other thing you can't get through the senat or past a presidenti veto. if livingston is the challeng, i doubt that will caus a ralli of the real conserv in congress. some moder said they were prepar to support him. rep. marg roukema, r-n.j., said, i would be amen to livingston. still, she caution, i'm not after newt. but it' wrong not to sit down and serious look at our option. ken johnson, an

","Speaker of the House Newt Gingrich has announced that he will not seek re-election to the post when the vote comes up on November 18th.He also announced that he would be leaving the House when his current term as Speaker expires in January.This announcement comes on the heels of a poor Republican showing in the mid-term elections.Although the Republicans retained a majority in the House, the Margin of Republican control shrank in the face of Democratic gains.Gingrich had been seen as the man who led the Republicans our of the doldrums into control of the House and the Senate.","Most Democrats, except for former Clinton strategist James Carville, were hesitant to attack Speaker Newt Gingrich as the 1998 elections approached.Republicans were expected to add to their majority in Congress.However, Republicans lost seats in both the House and Senate.Republicans became disenchanted with the Gingrich ""vision"" and blamed him for the losses.An active campaign began to replace Gingrich as Speaker with Louisiana Congressman Robert Livingston as the main actor.After a losing struggle to maintain his position, Gingrich resigned as Speaker.House Republicans then turned their attention to impeachment proceedings of President Clinton.","The 1998 election ended the political career of Newt Gingrich, who had become Speaker in 1994, leading a conservative, issue-driven, GOP majority.In Oct Democrats were urged to go after him.Although both houses retained a narrowed GOP majority, Newt, with his combativeness and Impeachment-fixation, was blamed for the failures by both wings of his party.The 1998 winners were Gore, Clinton, and moderates.Newt's issues seemed dead in the booming economy and old Democratic loyalists ignored Clinton's morals and returned to the fold.As fellow Republicans jockeyed for his positions, Newt resigned as Speaker on Nov 6 and also decided to leave his House seat.","James Carville complained that fellow Democrats didn't join his war against Speaker Newt Gingrich leading up to the congressional elections of 1998.Gingrich had led the impeachment inquiry against President Clinton in the House.When, contrary to all predictions, the Democrats gained five seats in the House and held their own in the Senate, Republicans enlisted in Carville's cause, blaming Gingrich for the election results.Gingrich battled fiercely as Rep. Livingston rallied forces against him, but ultimately Gingrich accepted defeat agreeing to cede the speakership and his seat in the House.He blamed his defeat on blackmail by Republican cannibals."

howev, it would end the independ exist of netscap, an internet softwar maker onc regard as the most seriou challeng to microsoft' domin of the person comput softwar market. netscap, found in 1994, ha struggl over the last 18 month under an assault from microsoft. it navig wa the runaway leader in the market for the browser softwar use to navig the world wide web. but microsoft, respond to the internet revolut, enter the market aggress, quickli match the qualiti of netscape' technolog and then bundl the microsoft browser, internet explor, into it industry-standard window oper system and give it away free. eventu, microsoft' browser technolog caught up to netscape'. earlier thi year, netscap announc layoff and start distribut navig for free as well, as microsoft steadili gain in the browser market. sinc then, netscap ha focus mainli on two busi advertis and transact fee from it netcent web site and sell industrial-strength softwar to corpor that are build their own internet site on which to conduct electron commerc. aol believ it ha the expertis to increas revenu from netscape' web site and, help by sun' programm and vast corpor sale forc, to acceler netscape' softwar sale as well, execut involv in the negoti said. among larg corpor, sun' version of unix, solari, is among the most popular oper system for the power comput that run netscape' server softwar. the much smaller netscap would be place under the wing of aol and sun microsystem. the three compani had combin revenu of more than $12.4 billion last year. microsoft, by comparison, had revenu of more than $14 billion. thi deal would insur that the fundament element of netscap surviv within bigger compani that can drive it technolog forward, said david b. yoffi, a professor at the harvard busi school and co-author with michael a. cusumano of the massachusett institut of technolog of a recent book, compet on internet time: lesson from netscap and it battl with microsoft. the impact of the deal, if ani, on the government' antitrust suit against microsoft is uncertain. it doe appear to support a key theme of microsoft' defens name, that it oper in a fast-mov industri where corpor allianc shift all the time. thu, microsoft argu, antitrust polici should tread gentli. but the deal, govern offici insist, should have no direct effect on the current case. no matter how much the allianc shift, it doesn't affect the central fact of microsoft' monopoli and how it ha use and abus it market power to protect it monopoli, said david boi, the justic department' lead trial lawyer in the microsoft case. execut repres netscap, aol and sun microsystem are govern wit at the microsoft trial. and the seriou merger talk between netscap chief execut offic jame barksdal and aol chairman steve case began about a month ago, or just after the start of the microsoft trial, accord to peopl close to the talk. industri analyst suggest that the compani may have been embolden to take stronger anti-microsoft step base partli on the percept that the antitrust case would weaken microsoft. and repres of kleiner perkin caufield &amp; byer, a silicon valley ventur capit firm regard as a power broker among microsoft' rival, sit on the board of netscap, sun and aol. still, execut involv in the talk said that the time of the propos deal wa unrel to the antitrust trial. nor should it, one person note, be regard as a single-mind attempt to circl the wagon against microsoft. inde, aol, accord to one person close to the talk, plan to keep microsoft' internet explor browser as the default choic on it on-lin servic. one of the government' alleg in the antitrust suit is that microsoft won out over netscap as the main browser for aol becaus microsoft use it window monopoli as a bargain chip. to win the browser deal, microsoft offer aol prime real estat on the window desktop, the main screen on more than 90 percent of person comput sold today. stay with microsoft' browser can be seen as proof that aol still regard placement on the window desktop as crucial, as well as a care step to avoid undermin one of the alleg in the government' case. for aol, the netscap purchas would acceler it evolut toward the internet. at present, it flagship on-lin servic is a hybrid to it own proprietari servic, it ha ad a gateway to the world wide web. in addit, for consum who do not subscrib to aol' dial-up servic, it also ha it own web site, aol.com, which attract about 24 million visitor a month, accord to media metrix/relev knowledg, a market research firm. it big web site offer a wide rang of inform, entertain, internet chat and e-mail, a lead exampl of the all-in-on site that have becom known as portal. netscape' netcent traffic ha slip a bit in recent month, to under 16 million visitor a month, but it, too, is a major portal. togeth, they should be a huge player in the intensifi portal battl for viewer and result advertis revenu. yahoo is the current leader among portal site with more than 25 million monthli visitor, while microsoft' site attract more than 20 million a month. though known as a new-media compani for consum, aol is also interest in boost it electron commerc busi with the netscap purchas. aol ha recent done work with eastman kodak, american greet and other compani, not onli promot their product to on-lin subscrib but also build the internet infrastructur of softwar to conduct electron commerc. aol note project like a recent one from forrest research inc., which predict that worldwid internet commerc could reach as high as $3.2 trillion by 2003, or 5 percent of global sale. sun microsystem, analyst say, could be a strong partner for aol in the market for internet commerc softwar. sun is a corpor softwar compani with a sale forc of sever thousand. as it move increasingli to internet technolog, aol should prove an excel partner for sun in term of develop and use sun' java, an internet program languag. and while netscape' browser no longer gener revenu on it own, it is a distribut channel for java technolog. have netscape' browser safe in the hand of a friendli compani is of strateg import for sun, sinc microsoft own the altern in the browser market. aol is expect pay littl, if ani, premium over netscape' stock price on friday, execut close to the deal said, sinc netscap share have more than doubl in the last month. in the last week alon, netscape' stock ha jump about $12, or nearli 45 percent, follow report that it wa discuss a possibl partnership with aol. the stock close friday at $39.1875, up $2625. aol' share gain $1.50 friday, close at $84875. envis a thoroughli network world in which the world wide web is a limitless marketplac of inform, entertain, product and servic, america onlin inc. tuesday laid out the detail of it agreement to buy the netscap commun corpor for $4.2 billion. by move quickli toward what both compani have recent come to see as the inevit converg of technolog and media, america onlin hope that it will secur a solid lead in a battl alreadi join by giant like the microsoft corp. and the intern busi machin corp. to transform the greater part of cyberspac into a vast virtual mall. part of that vision rest on an allianc with sun microsystem that america onlin negoti as part of the deal. sun not onli bring a cyber-savvi sale forc to the effort but, even more importantli, a strong technolog partner in develop netscape' industrial-strength softwar for run internet site. sun is inde a technolog heavyweight. it own the java program languag special design for internet applic, and solari, among the most popular commerci oper system for the power comput that big corpor use to serv up internet servic like the world wide web, e-mail and retail transact. it also manufactur a highli respect line of power comput base on it own microprocessor chip. but for america onlin and for the big internet player against which it will compet the real potenti gold mine lie further down the road, perhap five year away, when peopl will ventur on line for inform or shop not onli from person comput but from inexpens internet applianc cost $200 each, or mayb includ free as part of a subscript servic, just as some cellular phone are now. today, be wire remain a compar elitist activ an estim 25 percent of american household had access to the internet last year, and 5 percent of household bought merchandis on line. but the execut at america onlin and netscap hope that their deal will acceler the timet for the day when the net is ubiquit, when peopl will tap into the world wide web from appliance-lik devic, pager, cell phone, televis set-top box or comput as routin as they use the telephon today. a new gener of internet devic to be abl to deliv our servic anywher is a key part of what thi deal is about in the long run, said stephen m. case, 40, the chairman of america onlin. for the present, howev, the idea is to make america onlin, the nation' lead onlin servic, the standard way to get onto the internet, the execut explain. netscap, the internet pioneer, is a crucial part of that effort, they said. there is no assur that thi vision of the technolog futur will prove accur or, even if it doe, that the america online-netscap combin will lead the way. still, the long-rang game plan help explain what brought america onlin and netscap togeth. and the abil of the companies' execut to sell that vision to netscape' whiz-kid programm in particular will determin whether the merger succe. netscape' headquart in mountain view, calif., is like becom a prime target for silicon valley headhunt. as is the case with ani softwar compani, netscape' key asset is it talent programm, and mani of these code hacker may be reluct to work for america onlin, which still ha a reput as a middle-brow servic cater to onlin newcom, known deris as newbi. stock option and other financi incent will be tailor to tri to keep netscap employe on board. but these peopl want to chang the world, and we'v got to be clear that join with america onlin, along with the sun compon, realli is a bigger opportun for us, said marc andreessen, the 26-year-old cofound of netscap who led a team of young programm from the supercomput center at the univers of illinoi to silicon valley to start the internet softwar compani in 1994. thi ought to be the preemin internet compani over the next decad, andreessen declar, speak from a cell phone on a streetcorn in palo alto, calif. for hi part, andreessen, a netscap execut vice presid, will becom netscape' chief technolog offic for the next three or four month, until the merger is complet. hi new job at america onlin ha not yet been determin, but it is like to be chief technolog offic of the combin compani as well, an america onlin execut said. alreadi, accord to one netscap board member, andreessen ha deliv a 12-page single-spac memorandum to case, set out hi view of the technolog road map the new compani should follow into the futur, emphas the opportun for electron commerc in an environ in which most peopl are link to the internet. netscap, popul with comput sophist, and america onlin, known as an on-ramp to the internet for the technolog challeng, seem a corpor odd coupl. but the two compani, it execut explain, had been evolv toward each other for more than a year. in a telephon interview from america online' headquart in dull, va., case describ netscap as an enterpris that had morph itself from a compani depend on sale of it softwar use to brows the world wide web and in microsoft' cross-hair into a busi that reli on advertis and other revenu from it popular netcent web site and from sell softwar to corpor to handl electron commerc. the netscap transform wa larg a reaction to microsoft' competit assault on it browser busi a central element in the government' antitrust suit against microsoft. microsoft bundl it browser into it industry-standard window oper system, and gave away the browser for free. the govern alleg these step were part of a pattern of anticompetit practic, while microsoft maintain the move were intend mainli to benefit consum. earli thi year, after lay off worker and suffer a larg loss last year, netscap announc that it would also distribut it browser for free. it seem to have stabil it busi around it new model. netscap announc tuesday that it earn $2.7 million on revenu of $162 million in it fourth fiscal quarter, which end in septemb. yet america onlin ha also chang in the last coupl of year, move well beyond it reput as an onlin servic for beginn. it now ha an internet chat servic and run it own all-in-on site on the web, known as a portal, which includ e-mail, internet search, news, entertain and onlin shop. america onlin ha realli chang from a close onlin servic for novic user to an internet media and technolog compani with a divers set of brand, andreessen said. these two compani have been move in the same direct, and the fit is a good one. america onlin inc. want to becom the next microsoft in two promis information-ag field where microsoft corp. is just anoth compani the internet media busi and electron commerc. with it propos purchas of netscap commun corp., aol, the nation' largest dial-up onlin servic with more than 14 million subscrib, hope to take a signific step toward that ambiti goal. if the $4 billion deal is complet the compani had not reach a final agreement as of monday night aol would acquir a lead internet brand and enlarg it wire audienc by absorb the million who regularli visit netscape' popular netcent site on the world wide web. acquir netscap would realli enhanc america online' role as the premier internet media compani, said jame f. moor, presid of geopartn inc., a consult firm. america onlin is assembl the kind of audienc number that will convinc peopl the internet is becom a mainstream media. in the new media busi, as in tradit media like televis or newspap, eyebal translat into advertis revenu. but what realli intrigu media execut and consum market about the new media news, entertain and servic render in comput code is that it is inher a two-way medium with which peopl can interact with the tap of a key or the click of a mous button the interact that advertis and market want to see, of cours, is buy. and it is the potenti for exploit an instant, direct connect to consum that ha fuel all the recent optim about electron commerc. today, compani are sell everyth from book to babi cloth over the internet. most compani have not progress beyond the experiment stage, but there are a hand of encourag success stori like amazon.com, the on-lin bookstor. by 2003, forrest research inc., whose busi is analyz trend in cyberspac, project that internet commerc could reach $3.2 trillion, or 5 percent of all sale worldwid. aol is at the forefront of thi converg of media and commerc converg, and integr reflect in the lineag of it leader. steve case, the chairman, wa onc a new-product manag for pepsico' pizza hut chain, while robert pittman, the presid, is a former mtv execut. microsoft is also invest heavili in new media and electron commerc. it ha an onlin servic, msn, which compet with aol, as well as information-and commerc web site that focu on travel, car and real estat. it also own sidewalk, a network of local site that list movi, restaur and store in citi around the countri includ seattl and new york. it msnbc internet news servic is half of a joint ventur with nbc. microsoft is expect to be a formid competitor in the media-and-commerc busi. it ha no shortag of bright peopl and it ha more money than ani rival. besid deep pocket, microsoft ha the built-in advantag in ani computer-bas medium becaus it window oper system run more than 90 percent of person comput sold today. it control of the window desktop give it the most valuabl piec of commerci real estat in the inform age. in theori, at least, own that desktop screen should help microsoft steer consum to it onlin offer an issu that is key to the government' antitrust suit against microsoft. but so far, microsoft ha start slowli in the field of internet media and electron commerc. microsoft may want to, but it doe not domin these new market, said richard shaffer, a princip of technolog partner, a research firm. america onlin recogn that the big opportun is in these emerg growth busi like electron commerc instead of tri to take microsoft on head-on. still, if the netscap deal is complet, aol will also find itself in the softwar busi in a way it ha never been in the past. netscap is known as the pioneer in the commerci develop of softwar use to navig the world wide web. microsoft saw the browser softwar as a direct threat to it industri domin and pursu that market aggress, bundl it own browser with it window and give it away free tactic that have been challeng by the govern. but netscap no longer gener revenu from it browser, which it now also distribut for free, but from the sale of heavy-duti softwar sold to corpor. much of thi softwar is use as the technolog back offic for electron commerc use in build web site and process transact. a surpris element in the propos deal is that aol intend to hold onto netscape' corpor softwar busi instead of sell it off to an establish softwar compani. america onlin just doesn't have credibl in that market, observ michael a. cusumano, a professor at the massachusett institut of technology' sloan school of manag. execut close to aol explain the decis as the need to provid full-lin offer for electron commerc, from corpor web site to the comput screen of consum. but aol ha decid it need help to preserv and strengthen netscape' corpor softwar busi. to do that, it ha brought in sun microsystem inc. in a side deal, which ha complic the transact consider. aol, accord to execut close to the propos deal, will own netscap, but it will have a joint market and develop partnership with sun. as part of the deal, aol will agre to purchas about $300 million worth of sun' comput for it servic, while sun will appar agre to purchas sizeabl amount of netscap softwar, which sun' sale forc must sell. still, aol and sun have a longer-term object as well one that promis to place them in more direct conflict with microsoft. for nearli a year, william j. raduchel, sun' chief strategist, ha been work close with aol, accord to sun execut. a former harvard econom professor who taught scott mcneali, the sun chairman, raduchel ha focus on sun' internet program technolog, call java and jini, both of which are seen as potenti threat to microsoft' domin. by combin sun' technolog prowess with aol' power consum brand, the sun execut say, there is the potenti for a kind end-run around microsoft' grip on desktop comput. in it research laboratori, sun ha been work on a stripped-down network comput a simple-to-us inform applianc, which could cost as littl as $200 or be given away as part of a subscript servic. the concept is that aol' internet media and electron commerc servic could be deliv to mani more home than today becaus mani peopl still shun the expens and difficulti of use a person comput. the applianc would be mainli a receiv and screen, with most of the comput power resid on vast central comput serv up inform as user request by tap a few button. sun' technolog specialti is thi kind of central network comput. if the long-term aol-sun vision ever materi certainli a three-to-f year bet, at the least it could give both compani a boost and technolog independ from microsoft. microsoft corp. argu in feder court monday that the propos acquisit of netscap commun corp. by america onlin serious undermin the government' antitrust suit against the softwar giant. from a legal standpoint, thi propos deal pull the rug out from under the govern, william neukom, microsoft' senior vice presid for legal affair, said monday morn on the courthous step. the reason behind thi assert, microsoft say, is that the propos deal demonstr that netscap and the larger softwar industri are healthi and vibrant even with all of the illeg and anti-competit practic alleg in the government' suit. but david boi, the government' lead attorney, said all of that wa irrelev. whatev the deal end up be if there end up be a deal is not go to remov ani of the obstacl that microsoft ha place in the path of competit in thi industri, he said. michael lacovara, a microsoft lawyer who wa question a govern wit, economist frederick warren-boulton, suggest to him dure the trial monday that the propos acquisit undermin warren-boulton' argument, that microsoft seem head toward obtain a monopoli in internet browser softwar to match the one it appar hold in oper system. after all, about 22 percent of american who use the internet reach it through america onlin. and at present aol use microsoft' web browser, internet explor, as the service' default choic. in exchang for that, microsoft place an aol advertis and internet link in window 98. lacovara ask the wit whether, onc aol' servic contract expir in januari, he would expect aol to continu to distribut microsoft softwar. ye, warren-boulton respond. it is not at all clear to me that aol' incent to do thi is chang by thi propos merger with netscap. he note that america onlin offici had said their need to be among the onlin servic featur in window forc them to accept microsoft term establish internet explor as the default choic. lacovara then ask warren-boulton the question that lay under hi entir cross-examin of the wit and microsoft' larger assert monday about the propos netscape-aol deal. sure thi combin, he ask, tell you someth about the natur of competit in the softwar industri? warren-boulton' answer wa probabl not the one lacovara had been after. to the extent that thi potenti merger is the result of microsoft' action with these exclus contract and other action, he said, it is unfortun to see the disappear of a firm like netscap, the brightest, newest star. warren-boulton' purpos on the stand for the govern is to establish that microsoft doe have a monopoli in operating-system software; more than 90 percent of the world' comput use a microsoft oper system. that is the foundat under most of the government' case sinc feder antitrust law forbid certain behavior by a monopolist that would be legal for a firm that face healthi competit. through repeat, often circumlocuti question, lacovara tri to make the case that microsoft' overwhelm market share wa ephemer. the softwar industri is so vibrant and fast move, he suggest, that microsoft could be toppl from it posit at ani moment a point of view the compani encourag among it employe. on friday and monday, lacovara repeatedli point out that other compani are place other oper system on the market, and some softwar compani princip microsoft' greatest rival are write softwar for these new system. but warren-boulton argu that the exist of these fring competitor in the oper system market doe not mean in ani way that microsoft doe not have monopoli power. on monday afternoon, lacovara made an issu of the success appl comput co. is have sell it new imac comput. he enter into evid an appl news releas issu last month show, among other thing, that 12.5 percent of the peopl buy apple' new imac comput had previous own a window machin. appl comput use a differ oper system, mac-o. the outcom of the microsoft antitrust case may be a long way off, but one thing is alreadi clear: thi is the first major e-mail trial. the government' prosecut and microsoft corp.' defens, to a strike degre, are legal campaign wage with electron messag. the human testimoni often pale next to the e-mail evid. on the stand or in videotap testimoni, the peopl be question shrug, mumbl and forget. the e-mail is aliv with idea and competit zeal, punctuat with profan and exclam point. the second week of the trial end with the prosecutor be frustrat becaus a lengthi cross-examin by microsoft' lead lawyer left no time for the govern to show sever hour of a videotap deposit of bill gate, the microsoft chairman. with a new wit, an execut of appl comput inc., take the stand monday, it is uncertain when the gate tape will be play. the justic depart and the 20 state su microsoft believ that the tape will strengthen their case becaus it show gate say he wa not involv in plan to take what the govern alleg were illeg step to stifl competit in the internet softwar market. the gate videotap, said david boi, the justic department' trial lawyer, offer an opportun to judg gates' credibl. but the gate credibl gap, if there is one, becom an issu not becaus of the videotap but becaus hi tape remark can be compar and contrast with the e-mail he wrote and receiv. the e-mail record, the govern insist, show gate waist-deep in plot the anti-competit deal and bulli tactic that he deni or profess to have never heard of in hi tape deposit. if hi machin are central to the government' case, whi not summon gate to the trial? the govern doe not need to put gate on the stand, becaus we have hi e-mail and memoranda, stephen houck, a lawyer for the state, told the court. the microsoft legal team ha for month been prepar it e-mail defens. first, microsoft argu, anyth that look damag is taken out of context. i urg your honor, john warden, microsoft' lead lawyer, told judg thoma penfield jackson, to view with consider skeptic the crazi quilt of e-mail fragment that seem to form the core of the government' case. but microsoft ha also mount an e-mail counterattack, cull from the million of messag it obtain by subpoena from competitor in pretrial discoveri. warden' cross-examin ritual is to present a govern wit with an intern e-mail from hi compani and then pose a declar as a question. these interrog have two refrains: isn't it true your compani doe exactli what you are accus microsoft of do, and isn't it true that microsoft prevail not becaus it is a predatori monopolist but becaus of it superior technolog? microsoft is accus of tri to prod compani to stay out of it way. so last week, for exampl, warden produc e-mail from stephen case, the chairman of america onlin, suggest a partnership with netscap commun corp. in which both compani would focu on their respect strength. that divis of labor, case wrote, would be the best way to achiev the goal that marc andreessen, netscape' cofound, describ in an earlier e-mail as beat the beast from redmond that want to see us both dead a refer to microsoft' headquart in redmond, wash. printout of e-mail are just anoth form of written commun. by the 1920, as typewrit becam common, type memoranda start to be use in court case. from the 1950 through the 1980, legal expert say, there wa an explos of document fuel by the new technolog of electr typewrit, photocopi and fax machin, and then person comput. and e-mail, they add, ha play an import role in legal inquiri for year, like the iran-contra case in the 1980 when e-mail found in oliv north' comput prove crucial. but the microsoft case is the result of a sweep govern antitrust investig of a high-technolog compani where e-mail ha supplant the telephon as the most common instrument of commun. e-mail ha just revolution investig of thi kind, one senior justic depart offici said. while under investig, microsoft ha hand over to the govern an estim 30 million document, mostli e-mail. in the trial, the two side have submit about 3,000 exhibit, mainli e-mail. and in their e-mail, peopl often commun more frankli and inform than when write a letter or a report tap it out, punch a button and it' gone into cyberspac. but e-mail commun is documentari evid, which in legal case provid a rich, contemporan record of what peopl were think and plan at the time. it can be a sharp contrast to formal oral testimoni, so often coach by lawyer and craft by select memori. the e-mail record certainli make the i-don't-recal line of respons harder to sustain, said robert litan, a former senior offici in the justic department' antitrust divis who is now at the brook institut. it can also be power ammunit for point to contradict in testimoni. and that is what the govern will do in attack gates' credibl with hi videotap deposit, taken over three day in august. the govern offer a glimps of that strategi on the first day of the trial. it show a few brief clip of a point in the deposit when gate wa ask about a meet on june 21, 1995, at which, the govern alleg, microsoft offer to divid the browser market with netscap and to make an invest in the compani, which is it chief rival in that market. in the tape deposit, gate say he recal be ask by one of hi subordin whether he thought it made sens to invest in netscap. he said that he wa ask about it after the june 1995 meet and repli, i didn't see that as someth that made sens. but in an e-mail on may 31, 1995, gate urg an allianc with netscap. we could even pay them money as part of the deal, he wrote, buy a piec of them or someth. the contradict between gates' deposit and hi e-mail, though, doe not of itself speak to the issu of whether microsoft made an illeg offer to netscap. to be sure, it is what microsoft did not what it said in e-mail commun that count most. but onc the e-mail that look bad get in the record, you end up do what microsoft' lawyer are go to spend much of thi trial do tri to explain it away, said stephen axinn, a lead antitrust litig with the firm axinn, veltrop &amp; harkrid in new york. america onlin built itself into the most potent forc in cyberspac larg by appeal to famili with chatti teen-ag who want to flirt onlin and adult look for an easi way to send electron mail while check the weather and sport score. now, the compani ha to get seriou if it is to win the heart and mind of corpor execut in pin-strip suit. nearli lost in the complex of america online' deal to buy netscap commun corp. is america online' announc that it will enter an entir new market: work behind the comput screen to help compani open and oper onlin store. netscap alreadi ha creat softwar that made it a player in provid support for what is alreadi known as electron commerc. but america onlin now say it ha ambit to offer a much wider array of softwar, consult and servic for onlin merchant. most compani that sell to consum realiz that they need to get into the e-commerc space, said america onlin presid robert pittman in a news confer tuesday. we see a major busi in offer them an end-to-end solut. the market is big and grow bigger by the day. forrest research estim that $325 million will be spent thi year on electron commerc softwar and anoth $5.3 billion on servic that rang from graphic design to the turn-key oper of entir onlin store. by 2002, forrest estim, the combin market for electron commerc servic and softwar should top $35 billion. e-commerc servic are the silver bullet that will enabl compani to be abl to take advantag of the true busi opportun on the web, said traci gere, an analyst at intern data corp. the market is grow veri rapidli, but it is veri fragment. analyst say the leader today in e-commerc servic is ibm, which ha a full line of offer from sophist softwar product to hand-hold consult. other competitor includ well-known inform technolog consult compani such as andersen consult, the spin-off from the arthur andersen account firm; electron data system, which run comput system for big compani, and pricewaterhousecoop, which offer account and consult separ but under one umbrella. softwar compani like microsoft and netscap sell packag program, typic with littl or no consult to help custom use them. there are also plenti of new compani that have sprout up to provid electron commerc servic. some, like agency.com and organ onlin, start basic as advertis and design firm. other, includ u s web and viant, have emphas program and consult. in fact, those two strain are blur togeth, as exemplifi by u s web' pend merger with ck group. america onlin argu that it advantag in thi increasingli crowd bazaar is it abil to combin a broad subscrib base of about 15 million custom with netscap softwar, plu hardwar from sun microsystem, which ha join in america online' ventur into electron commerc engin. thi is the first time anyon ha put a true end-to-end solut that start with the silicon and end with the audienc, said barri schuler, america online' presid for interact servic. we start with sun' line of server, then the commerc tool to build a store, the support servic to process order and then a deal for onlin real estat that can drive the traffic. despit the advantag netscap and sun bring, analyst say that america onlin face a varieti of problem in it new quest. chief among them is whether it can appear to have the consist, focu and follow-through that corpor custom demand. aol is not the first compani that come to my mind when it come to business-qu softwar, said robert chatham, a senior analyst with forrest research. it decis to keep netscap as a separ unit and offer electron commerc servic in partnership with sun will not enhanc it credibl, chatham said. america onlin doesn't look like a homogen vendor, he ad. it look like custom will have to tangl with a menag a troi of aol, netscap and sun. nor have internet servic provid and other telecommunications-ori compani shown much evid, ms. gere of intern data said, that they are capabl of offer the highli specif custom servic that big corpor client demand. telecommun compani that tri to do thing effici for a larg number of custom have not been abl to offer custom one-to-on relationship, she said. pittman said that america onlin had been driven to the e-commerc busi becaus compani that approach it want to sell their good need more help than simpli advertis onlin. we are find peopl who are expert in run bricks-and-mortar store are limit by their infrastructur, he said. they have an onlin store, but their squar footag is too small. even befor the netscap deal, america onlin wa move to provid some electron commerc softwar and servic. it ha been rewrit the softwar that let compani open onlin store to be base on univers accept internet standard rather than the specif comput languag use onli on america onlin. thi new softwar, which now will be combin with netscape' onlin store servic, will be avail for compani to use both on america onlin and on the internet. similarli, it ha develop a servic that let user creat a file with their credit card number and ship address so they can make onlin purchas without retyp all that inform each time. america onlin is work to offer it for a fee to store on the broader internet. there is a wide rang of servic that are incorpor in electron commerc. these includ high-end strategi consult to help compani decid whether and how to sell onlin without hurt their tradit sale in store. there are all sort of comput system to be develop, rang from the onlin store themselv to connect those site to a company' exist inventori and account system. there are creativ servic that includ graphic design, media buy, custom list analysi and other market and promot effort. and there are oper servic that involv actual maintain the big server that user connect to when they use the onlin store that display catalog, take order and process payment. america onlin, schuler said, will emphas servic that relat to market rather than back-offic function. we will consult on how to merchandis and sell onlin, he said. we understand the consum piec of the puzzl. some competitor worri that america online' electron commerc servic may simpli be a devic to sell it softwar and hardwar. the challeng is to prove that client are get the best possibl solut for their busi, said robert gett, the chief execut of viant. if they offer aol and netscap and sun, their answer is a bit taint. netscap doe have an expand forc of about 700 peopl who provid consult and custom program. but they have been most competit, gett said, in compet for nuts-and-bolt project rather than the more lucr assign to develop and carri out a full-fledg strategi on the web. they say, `who know our softwar better than netscape?' gett said. we help custom decid which platform is best for them. but america onlin argu that the combin might of it, netscap and sun is just what the busi need. we alway believ that commerc, that is buy good and servic, is the huge revenu stream of the futur, schuler said. we have onli seen the tiniest tip of the iceberg. america onlin built itself into the most potent forc in cyberspac larg by appeal to famili with chatti teen-ag who want to flirt onlin and adult look for an easi way to send electron mail while check the weather and sport score. now, the compani ha to get seriou if it is to win the heart and mind of corpor execut in pin-strip suit. nearli lost in the complex of america online' deal to buy netscap commun corp. is america online' announc that it will enter an entir new market: work behind the comput screen to help compani open and oper onlin store. netscap alreadi ha creat softwar that made it a player in provid support for what is alreadi known as electron commerc. but america onlin now say it ha ambit to offer a much wider array of softwar, consult and servic for onlin merchant. most compani that sell to consum realiz that they need to get into the e-commerc space, said america onlin presid robert pittman in a news confer tuesday. we see a major busi in offer them an end-to-end solut. the market is big and grow bigger by the day. forrest research estim that $325 million will be spent thi year on electron commerc softwar and anoth $5.3 billion on servic that rang from graphic design to the turn-key oper of entir onlin store. by 2002, forrest estim, the combin market for electron commerc servic and softwar should top $35 billion. e-commerc servic are the silver bullet that will enabl compani to be abl to take advantag of the true busi opportun on the web, said traci gere, an analyst at intern data corp. the market is grow veri rapidli, but it is veri fragment. analyst say the leader today in e-commerc servic is ibm, which ha a full line of offer from sophist softwar product to hand-hold consult. other competitor includ well-known inform technolog consult compani such as andersen consult, the spin-off from the arthur andersen account firm; electron data system, which run comput system for big compani, and pricewaterhousecoop, which offer account and consult separ but under one umbrella. softwar compani like microsoft and netscap sell packag program, typic with littl or no consult to help custom use them. there are also plenti of new compani that have sprout up to provid electron commerc servic. some, like agency.com and organ onlin, start basic as advertis and design firm. other, includ u s web and viant, have emphas program and consult. in fact, those two strain are blur togeth, as exemplifi by u s web' pend merger with ck group. america onlin argu that it advantag in thi increasingli crowd bazaar is it abil to combin a broad subscrib base of about 15 million custom with netscap softwar, plu hardwar from sun microsystem, which ha join in america online' ventur into electron commerc engin. thi is the first time anyon ha put a true end-to-end solut that start with the silicon and end with the audienc, said barri schuler, america online' presid for interact servic. we start with sun' line of server, then the commerc tool to build a store, the support servic to process order and then a deal for onlin real estat that can drive the traffic. despit the advantag netscap and sun bring, analyst say that america onlin face a varieti of problem in it new quest. chief among them is whether it can appear to have the consist, focu and follow-through that corpor custom demand. aol is not the first compani that come to my mind when it come to business-qu softwar,

the center of the government' antitrust suit against microsoft corp., execut involv in the talk said sunday. the propos deal is a complex, three-way transact involv aol, netscap and sun microsystem inc. aol, the lead on-lin servic with more than 14 million subscrib, would acquir netscape' popular site on the world wide web and it softwar busi. but as part of the deal, aol would also enter into a joint market and develop partnership with sun microsystem to strengthen netscape' other busi of sell to larg corpor the heavy-duti softwar need to serv up web page and other internet technolog to mani thousand of user at the same time. the purchas, an exchang of aol share for netscap stock, is valu at roughli $4 billion. a complet deal could be announc as soon as monday morn. but execut involv in the talk caution sunday night that some detail remain to be negoti. the netscap deal, if consumm, would realign three busi at the forefront of the modern economi on-lin servic, internet softwar and electron commerc. it would strengthen two of microsoft' lead rival, aol and sun microsystem. at the same time, howev, it would subsum netscap, an internet softwar maker onc regard as the most seriou challeng to microsoft' domin of the person comput softwar market. netscap, found in 1994, ha struggl over the last 18 month under an assault from microsoft. it navig wa the runaway leader in the market for the browser softwar use to navig the world wide web. but microsoft, respond to the internet revolut, enter the market aggress, quickli match the qualiti of netscape' technolog and then bundl the microsoft browser, internet explor, into it industry-standard window oper system and give it away free. earlier thi year, netscap announc layoff and start distribut navig for free as well, as microsoft steadili gain in the browser market. sinc then, netscap ha focus mainli on two busi advertis and transact fee from it netcent web site and sell industrial-strength softwar to corpor that are build their own internet site on which to conduct electron commerc. aol believ it ha the expertis to increas revenu from netscape' web site and, help by sun' programm and vast corpor sale forc, to acceler netscape' softwar sale as well, execut involv in the negoti said. sun' version of unix, solari, is among the most popular oper system for the larg, power comput that run netscape' server softwar. thi deal would insur that the fundament element of netscap surviv within bigger compani that can drive it technolog forward, said david b. yoffi, a professor at the harvard busi school and co-author with michael a. cusumano of the massachusett institut of technolog of a recent book, compet on internet time: lesson from netscap and it battl with microsoft. the impact of the deal, if ani, on the government' antitrust suit against microsoft is uncertain. it doe appear to support a key theme of microsoft' defens name, that it oper in a fast-mov industri where corpor allianc shift all the time. thu, microsoft argu, antitrust polici should tread gentli. but the deal, govern offici insist, should have no direct effect on the current case. no matter how much the allianc shift, it doesn't affect the central fact of microsoft' monopoli and how it ha use and abus it market power to protect it monopoli, said david boi, the justic department' lead trial lawyer in the microsoft case. execut repres netscap, aol and sun microsystem are govern wit at the microsoft trial. and the seriou merger talk between netscap chief execut offic jame barksdal and aol chairman steve case began about a month ago, or just after the start of the microsoft trial, accord to peopl close to the talk. industri analyst suggest that the compani may have been embolden to take stronger anti-microsoft step base partli on the percept that the antitrust case would weaken microsoft. and repres of kleiner perkin caufield &amp; byer, a silicon valley ventur capit firm regard as a power broker among microsoft' rival, sit on the board of netscap, sun and aol. stock price vault to record level monday, further a recoveri that as recent as two month ago seem nearli unthink. i thought we were in the most seriou correct sinc 1990, but i never thought or wrote that the bull market wa over, said byron wien, us. equiti strategist at morgan stanley dean witter &amp; co. now it seem all of that is behind us. the dow jone industri averag rose 214.72 point, or 2.34 percent, to 9,37427. the record is the first sinc juli 17, when the dow close at 9,33797. sinc aug. 31, when the dow stood at 7,539.07 after a steep

by a daili record for the number of merger and acquisit valu at $1 billion or more. the merger announc not onli prompt investor to chang estim of how much compani were worth but also indic come declin in the outstand share of stock. thi may be a supply-demand stori, where demand for stock is rise and the suppli of stock is reduc as one compani after anoth merg, said hugh johnson, chief invest offic at first albani corp. the flow of money into mutual fund is fairli strong, and there is pressur on manag to put that money to work. two deal seem to be catalyst for broad swath of stock. new that

market wa 20 percent overvalu, he said. nonetheless, the market' recoveri, which ha been buttress by three cut in interest rate by the feder reserv board, ha left mani longtim wall street hand grasp for histor parallel. at thi point we are in new ground, said laszlo birinyi, who head hi own market research firm. at the begin of the year, i said my target for the dow wa 10,000 by the end of 1998. if anyon had ask when the market went through what now look like a correct blip, i would have said my new target would have been about 9,000. i am surpris the 10,000 figur came back on the tabl for thi year. the new york time said in an editori for wednesday, nov. 25: america online' effort to acquir netscap and set up a partnership with sun microsystem is a remind of how rapidli the corpor landscap can chang in fast-mov technic field. but it doe not lessen the need for the justic depart to vigor pursu it antitrust suit against microsoft, the domin player in softwar. the depart ha present solid evid that microsoft ha use it monopoli in oper system to muscl rival and partner so as to head off competit in other softwar realm. the internet ha risen so quickli as an inform medium that onli four year ago, in hi book the road ahead, bill gate scarc mention it. in addit, onli a coupl of year ago america onlin, the world' biggest onlin servic, wa have so much troubl get rid of the bug in the system it wa wide derid as america on hold. now microsoft ha move so aggress into the internet that the justic depart is accus it of predatori behavior, and america onlin ha rocket forward to make deal with other internet player. in it antitrust suit against microsoft, the feder govern charg that the compani ha illeg bundl it own browser with it window oper system to smother netscape' chanc of market it browser. now in the corridor outsid the antitrust trial microsoft' lawyer maintain that netscap ha found a new partner in america onlin and ha no need of protect from the govern. but it could be as easili argu that microsoft ha bludgeon netscap into dissolut, forc a distress sale to america onlin. nor is it clear that custom of america onlin will choos netscape' browser as a vehicl for buy and sell on the internet. even in it newli musclebound form, america onlin remain depend on microsoft' good will for favor placement of an aol icon on the main desktop screen. it may be that, year henc, america onlin, netscap and sun will put togeth an altern mean to the internet through telephon line, cabl or the like. but until that day, fair requir justic depart action to insur that microsoft not use it current posit to thwart consum choic. onli when compani know they can get their product to the consum will they have the incent to innov and turn the internet into the revolutionari medium it promis to be. ","As the government continued to press its anti-trust suit against Microsoft, AOL has begun negotiations to purchase Netscape.Netscape is at the heart of the antitrust suit.Netscape alleges that Microsoft marketing practices, packaging its Internet Explorer in its operating system denied market opportunities to Netscape.The AOL deal, a three-way negotiation between AOL, Sun Microsystems and Netscape, would combined three Microsoft rivals.AOL is counting on the Netscape purchase to allow it to expand its internet Market by helping business operate on the internet in an effort to join Media and technology.","In a bid to become a leader in the lucrative cyberspace economy, AOL will buy Netscape and set up a partnership with Sun.The venture will let AOL offer corporations end-to-end services, including servers, software, and accessibility to consumers.Eventually, AOL hopes to capitalize on the production of cheap devices offering Internet access to more homes.News of the deal helped push the Dow Jones to a new high.Meanwhile, Microsoft, accused by the Justice Department of using its operating system dominance to squelch competition in the browser market, claims the deal shows the software industry is healthy and that Netscape needs no government protection.","As the U.S. government pressed its antitrust case against Microsoft Corp. in November 1998, America Online (AOL) proposed an alliance with Netscape Communications and Sun Microsystems.The three-pronged deal promised to provide on-line services, Internet software and electronic commerce.AOL was to buy Netscape and forge a partnership with Sun, benefiting all three and giving technological independence from Microsoft.Microsoft lawyers argued unconvincingly that AOL's purchase of Netscape would undermine the government's antitrust case, based in large part on Netscape's complaint.It remained to be seen whether AOL could achieve a vast virtual mall.","America Online became the leading force in cyberspace for individuals to exchange e-mail and check the latest news.AOL saw a bright day ahead as a company that could provide online services, Internet software, and electronic commerce.To position itself better in this growing market, AOL sought to buy Netscape and work an alliance with Sun Microsystems.Netscape has faltered because of the ubiquity of the Microsoft Windows operating system requiring its browser.Microsoft argued that a vibrant technology market and rising stock prices undercut antitrust charges against it.At the trial the government presented thousands of e-mails supporting its case."
27,"presid leonid kuchma call friday for correct to ukraine' program of market reform, but pledg that reform would continu. kuchma did not elabor in hi comment to a group of ukrainian economist, say onli that the chang were necessari becaus of the country' econom problem. kuchma urg the economist to come up with recommend befor a nation meet of economist in novemb, the interfax news agenc report. ukrain ha suffer econom problem sinc the 1991 collaps of the soviet union and it ha been especi hard hit by the financi crisi in neighbor russia, it main trade partner. the russian crisi ha hurt bilater trade, caus the ukrainian currenc to fall and led to a withdraw of investor from ukrain. in recent month, kuchma ha implement some econom reform by decre, prompt the intern monetari fund to releas the first instal of a long-await dlr 2.2 billion loan. mani reform, howev, remain stall. nation bank chairman viktor yushchenko wa in washington thi week for consult with imf offici. yushchenko ha warn that the bank would not spend it dwindl reserv to support the hryvna currenc, but ha avoid comment on the currenc in recent day. kuchma met friday with yushchenko, prime minist valeri pustovoitenko and other senior offici to discuss way to stabil the hryvna. the government' press servic said they focus on possibl way to keep the hryvna under 3.5 to the us. dollar through the end of the year. the hryvna ha been trade at 3.4 to the dollar in recent day but trade ha been limit. there are wide expect in ukrain that the hryvna will fall even further, and ukrainian have been stock up on food, cloth and household good to save their fast-devalu money. when the world' financ minist and central banker gather last year in hong kong, they nervous congratul each other for contain at least for the moment a nasti financi brush fire in asia. in a year' time, mani predict in hallway chatter, the troubl in thailand and indonesia would look like a replay of mexico in 1995 a rough bump in the road for a world enjoy remark prosper. talk about bad market call. twelv month later, as the same financi mandarin clog washington with their limousin and glide through endless recept at the annual meet of the intern monetari fund and the world bank, just about everyth that could have gone wrong in the world economi has: the worst downturn in japan sinc world war ii, econom meltdown in russia, a depress in indonesia that is plung 100 million peopl below the poverti line, and deep fear over what happen next in latin america. what make thi year' imf meet most remark, though, is that the harshest critic are direct at the monetari fund itself, and, by extens, at the us. treasuri, which is view as the power behind the imf. thi year, in place of confid predict, there are mutual recrimin. argument are break out over whether the true culprit were croni capitalist and weaken leader like russian presid bori yeltsin, or huge investor who pour money into the world' emerg market with reckless abandon in the mid-1990 and panick in the past twelv month. whatev the reason, one realiti prevails: hundr of billion of dollar have fled from economi on four contin seek the safest haven possibl, often in the unit state and the money is not return anytim soon. and the subtext of everi seminar on capit flow and everi conclav of nervou minist will be some pain blunt questions: can thi be stop? or is the world head for a global recess? fifty-thre year ago the imf wa creat after the bretton wood confer which sought to stabil the world economi and secur the peac after world war ii. now it is under attack from all side, charg not onli with worsen a bad situat by misjudg the econom, but with be polit tone-deaf in some of the most volatil capit in the world, from jakarta, indonesia, to moscow. for the first time, there are disturb question about whether the institut itself is still capabl, financi or polit, of contain the kind of econom contagion that caught the world unawar. onc, the imf' critic were larg found in africa and south asia, were the fund wa often view as arrogant; today they includ wall street' biggest player and top offici in the most power economi of asia and europ. onli a few includ former secretari of state georg schultz and member of congress who are increasingli suspici of all intern institut are talk about scrap the imf altogeth. but almost everyon is talk about creat a new financi architectur that can do what the old one clearli cannot: smother financi wildfir befor they leap around the globe. presid clinton, british prime minist toni blair and other leader, after month of silenc, have edg into the debat, in some case wrest the issu for the first time from their financ minist and central bank. their fear, their advis say, is that 15 month of financi turmoil are now threaten polit stabil. such concern have turn thi year' meet into a tumbl mass of worri and a grope for short and long-term solut. the japanes, the french, the southeast asian are all arriv in washington with differ diagnos of what went wrong, and differ solut about how to set it right. the unit state ha it own set of plan, a mix of suggest to forc more disclosur of financi data in countri around the world and to impos more american-styl financi standard and regul. meanwhil, an ideolog argument is break out over whether the world should slow down a long march toward more free and open market a strategi press by the clinton administr for the past six year. other argu that it is unwis to start rebuild the hospit while the patient are still on the oper tabl. last year the standard answer that all of us were given came down to this: `we have the imf and the world bank, and they know best,' indonesian foreign minist ali alata said over breakfast in washington the other day, reflect on how the crisi turn 30 year of astound growth in hi countri into an overnight depress. then they said everyth that went wrong wa our fault, he said. but now, now i think peopl know that much of the problem came from the outsid, and we need someth better. and the imf itself is begin to fight back, an awkward role for an institut domin by phd. economist who are unaccustom to be openli challeng. everi place you turn you read the same stori, that we came in, that we made thing wors, said stanley fischer, the deputi manag director of the fund, who wa born in northern rhodesia now zambia and becam chairman of the massachusett institut of technology' econom depart befor take a job that ha now put him in the center of the financi storm. we frequent get the blame, some of it well-deserv, he said. but it is polit conveni for govern around the world to cri, `the imf made us do it,' and pin their mistak on us. that' fine. we'd rather be love, but more than that we'd like to be effect. miscalcul, polit and safeti net on a steam januari day, michel camdessu, the imf' top offici, slip into jakarta to the privat resid of presid suharto and sat down for a four-hour meet to tick off, line by line, the huge reform indonesia would have to implement in return for ten of billion of dollar in emerg aid. two previou deal had collaps when suharto ignor the fund' condit, so camdessu insist that he strike a deal directli with suharto, then asia' longest-serv leader. it wa a meet of men who knew differ world of power politics: suharto rose as a gener in central java, and camdessu had deton mine in algeria for the french armi befor enter the french treasuri on hi way to becom head of france' central bank. it wa all there, a senior imf offici recal. he wa told he had to dismantl the nation airplan project, the clove monopoli, all the distribut monopoli. at one point, camdessu look at the impass suharto and said, you see what thi mean for your famili, a refer to their vast invest in the country' key industri. he said, `i call in my children, and they all understand.' but within month, that exchang in jakarta came to symbol the imf' twin troubles: it inabl to understand and reckon with the nation polit of countri in need of radic reform, and it focu on econom stabil rather than the social cost of it action. suharto had no intent of fulfil the agreement. it wa, one of hi former cabinet member said, a delay move that wa obviou to everyon except camdessu. perhap one reason whi the imf sometim appear tone-deaf is that it senior staff is almost entir compos of phd. economist. there are few offici with deep experi in intern polit, much less the complex of javanes cultur that were at work in indonesia. histor, expert in polit and secur have gravit to the unit nation, develop expert to the world bank, and economist to the imf creat danger gap in a crisi like thi one. as a result, the fund had onli a rudimentari understand of what would happen if it demand were met and all indonesia' state monopoli were quickli dissolv. while that system line the pocket of the suharto and their friend, it also distribut food, gasolin and other stapl to a countri that stretch for 3,000 mile over thousand of island. to help balanc the budget, the fund demand a quick end to expens subsidi that keep the price of food and gasolin artifici low. but that, combin with the huge currenc devalu that spark the crisi, result in high price and shortag that fuel riot that continu to thi day, as million of indonesian lose their job. the imf unintent, it offici insist also sped suharto' resign, insist on the elimin of croni capit, code word for remov the suharto famili from the center of the economi. ultim, that may prove to be indonesia' salvat, if the new govern can contain the riot against the ethnic chines minor whose money is desper need to save the country' fast-shrink economi. it is worth note, fischer said thi week, that our program in asia in indonesia, korea and thailand onli took hold after there wa a chang in govern. nonetheless, the indonesia experi ha reviv the argument that the imf is so focus on stabil bank and currenc, on prevent capit flight and free up market, that it is blind to the social cost of it action. among the toughest critic ha been it sister institut, the world bank, whose main charg is allevi poverti. you'v seen the tension almost everi day, one senior world bank offici said recent. the bank ha gone to extraordinari length in recent month to differenti it role from that of the fund, and to announc a tripl of aid to the poorest in the countri hit by the econom chao. even un. secretari gener kofi annan ha join the argument, warn in a speech at harvard recent that if global is to succeed, it must succeed for poor and rich alik. it must deliv right no less than rich. it must be har to the caus not of capit alon, but of develop and prosper for the poorest of the world. imf offici say they are chang strategi when they see they are exact too great a social cost. it' a veri difficult formula to get exactli right, fischer said in august, as russia wa teeter and the imf wa send in $4.8 billion in aid that wa rapidli wast. you need enough disciplin to send the right messag to the market and keep investor from flee. but you need enough leeway to keep peopl from suffer more than they otherwis would. in recent month, he note, the imf ha allow more spend to sustain subsidi for basic good for longer period in indonesia, korea and elsewher. there is a new flexibl at the imf a senior indonesian offici conclud recent. it is a lot better. a us. pawn, or a runaway agenc? the clinton administr admit that the imf ha mani fail, mani of them on display thi year. but it insist that the world ha gone through global financi crise without an imf onc befor in thi centuri and the result wa the 1930. i have no doubt the situat over the past year would have been much wors with greater devalu, more default, more contagion, and greater trade disloc without the program agre with the imf and the financ it ha provid, deputi treasuri secretari lawrenc summer told congress last week. mani republican and some democrat are unconvinc. even though the senat ha overwhelmingli approv an $18 billion contribut to the fund to help it fight new crise, the hous defeat that measur two week ago. the fund' last hope of get the money, which will free up nearli $100 billion in contribut from other nation wait for the unit state to act, will come when the hous and senat tri to resolv their budget differ in a confer committe in the next 10 day. a reject, treasuri secretari robert rubin insist, would send a messag around the world that the unit state is turn it back on the one institut charg with restor econom stabil. everywher els in the world, though, politician and businessmen insist that one of the biggest problem with the imf is that, contrari to the view of congress, it act as the us. treasury' lap dog. ask in jakarta or moscow, and the respons is the same: the imf never ventur far without look back for the approv nod of it master. when the unit state weigh in, howev, is when the imf is call on to rescu a countri in deep troubl. onli then doe the imf and the us. treasuri have the leverag to extract commit in return for billion in aid. in theori, the us. influenc is limited: it ha an 18.5 percent vote in the fund. germani, japan, franc and britain have about 5 percent each. but in practic the unit state usual get it way, exercis it influenc behind the scene, often in interact between fischer and summer. the two met when fischer wa on the mit faculti and summer wa a graduat student take one of hi class, later becom a colleagu at mit. each serv as chief economist of the world bank. it wa summer who wa instrument in place fischer in the fund' no. 2 job, and these day they talk constantli. it' usual a warm relationship, fischer said thi summer. rememb, thi is a job where you cannot turn to outsid for advic you can't call the chief economist at a wall street firm, or even mani of your academ friend, becaus so mani of the issu are confidenti. the treasury' relat with camdessu are often more strain as he play the role of world diplomat, travel the globe and tri to coax along polit leader. the tension were obviou from the start of the asia crisi. the fund made littl secret of it displeasur that the unit state wa not offer direct aid to thailand, a major us. alli, as a sign of support and confid. mind of the backlash in congress when mexico wa bail out with us. money, that wa the last thing the treasuri plan to do. summer, in turn, thought the fund wa not forc the thai to implement it reform commit rigor enough or disclos their true financi pictur. within the us. govern there wa other dissension: the state and defens depart felt the unit state should do more for thailand, but back off when the treasuri ask if they would like to poni up some aid out of their own budget. there were other conflict. when japan use the last imf meet to propos set up a $100 billion asia fund one that would exclud the unit state and would probabl offer aid under much more relax condit than the imf doe. rubin call up camdessu at breakfast one morn and told him that the japanes propos would undercut the imf' author. we'v just had a disput with michel, rubin report to hi aid as he return to hi orang juic and croissant. one of them shot back: and it' onli 8 am. camdessu back down at rubin' insist and walk away from money that asia could have use. japan say it will be back with a similar propos thi weekend, thi time for a $30 billion fund. camdessu ha also rankl us. offici with statement that amount to cheerlead to reassur the market sometim in the face of the fact. in june, with russia on it way to collaps, camdessu declar that contrari to what market and comment are imagin about the slow collaps of russia' economi, thi is not a crisi. thi is not a major develop. the bailout of russia and south korea were prime exampl of how washington muscl into the imf' turf as soon as major us. strateg interest are involv. last christma, as south korea slip within day of run out of hard currenc to pay it debt in decemb, it sent a secret envoy, kim kihwan, to work out a rescu packag. i didn't bother go to the imf, kim recal recent. i call summers' offic at the treasuri from my home in seoul, flew to washington and went directli there. i knew that wa how thi would get done. within day the treasuri dispatch david lipton, it most experienc veteran of emerg bailout, who is leav hi post as undersecretari for intern affair thi month, to shadow the imf staff' negoti with the govern in seoul. fischer wa displeas. to make a negoti effect, it ha to be clear who ha the author to do the negoti, he said. who lost russia? the pattern wa repeat thi summer, when the unit state race to put togeth a $17 billion packag for russia. the imf' staff in moscow declar that russia need no money at all it just need to enact polici that would restor confid in investor. the american and german came to a differ conclus. soon after, us. offici gather in the white hous situat room to consid what might happen to russia if the rubl wa devalu and market reform collaps and to push the imf to come up with emerg money. so the fund began assembl a last-ditch program to prop up a countri that had resist it reform plan for seven year. camdessu, though, wa still hesit, question whether the imf should risk it scarc resourc in russia. we had to pull michel along, a senior treasuri offici recal. as it turn out, camdessus' instinct were right while the approach champion by rubin and summer prove disastr wrong. the first instal of that payment $4.8 billion wa wast, prop up the currenc long enough, in the word of one imf offici, to let the oligarch get their money out of the countri. then yeltsin revers hi commit, let the rubl devalu anyway, began print money with abandon and fire virtual everi reform in hi govern result in a collaps of the imf agreement and the indefinit suspens of it aid program. now, insid the imf and on capitol hill, there are recrimin over who lost russia. publicli, fischer argu that there are no apolog owe for what we attempt in russia. but some imf offici complain privat that they let rubin and summer run roughshod over them, strike a deal that fell apart within week as the russian parliament rebel and yeltsin back away from hi commit. summer respond that the unit state took a calcul risk becaus it wa vastli better that russia succeed than not succeed. the russian collaps touch off new round of econom contagion, with investor flee latin america, and trigger huge loss in hedg fund like long term capit, the greenwich, conn., invest firm that need to be rescu by wall street powerhous whose money it had invest. russia wa a turn point, said robert hormat, the vice chairman of goldman, sach &amp; co. it made the world realiz that some countri can fail, even if the imf and the treasuri interced. and that chang the percept of risk. now, as the countri meet to face a futur that the imf ha warn could be veri bleak, they need to revers those percept, or watch countri slowli starv for lack of capit. the emerg market are call for control on short term invest. the french want a stronger imf. the american say the answer is more disclosur, so that investor are better warn, and tougher regul. these are usual nice, quiet meetings; everyon veri polit, a top us. offici said earlier thi week. not thi year. ukraine' parliament on friday refus to approv presid leonid kuchma' decre establish a state fund to compens peopl for save lost in bank. deputi vote 240-47 to prepar a revis version of the decre and debat it later in the month. they must consid the decre by oct. 10, or els it automat take effect under the constitut. leftist faction, which vote against the propos legisl, said it would not fulli guarante the return of save lost dure the financi instabl that ha recent hit ukrain. the fund kuchma propos to establish would have accumul money in a special nation bank account and repay peopl in case the bank they kept their save in went bankrupt or becam insolv. although the decre provid for compens of deposit amount onli to 500 hryvna (dlr 147 at the current exchang rate), it author said it would cover more than 90 percent of ukrainian who keep their money in bank. the measur wa meant to prevent mass withdraw of deposit that most ukrainian bank have alreadi experienc as peopl, scare by the fall of the nation currenc and the turmoil in neighbor russia, start to stock up on food, cloth and household good. govern offici say that ukrainian have recent withdrawn at least 10 percent of the 3 billion hryvna (dlr 882 million) they deposit in bank. russia' new prime minist pick an unusu way to reassur the nation thursday. after two week of deliber he announc that he still had no plan to rescu the countri from it econom crisi. i want to repeat onc more there is no program, prime minist yevgeni primakov said. it ha yet to be work out. in most nation such a statement might provok alarm. but primakov wa seek to calm an anxiou public that wa worri that the kremlin' cure could be wors than the diseas. it is not as if russian do not have someth to be concern about. thursday primakov conven a meet of top aid to tri to hammer out a strategi for overcom the econom woe. a main item on the agenda wa the plan draft by yuri maslyukov, a communist and the government' senior polici maker on econom issu. it did not take long for maslyukov' plan to hit the street. a newspap, kommers daili, publish it in full thursday morn. not surprisingli maslyukov' plan call for a greater state role in the economi, includ control on hard currenc. a new state bank for reconstruct and develop would be establish use the nation asset of fail commerci bank. wage and pension would be paid in two month, and the minimum wage would be index to inflat. there would be huge tax cut, a combin that suggest that the govern wa commit to print addit money. the exchang rate of the rubl would be set by the central bank, base on chang in inflat and the balanc of payment. maslyukov' plan also impli that russian would be abl to buy dollar at exchang through the countri. it stipul that hard currenc could enter the countri onli with special author. export would be requir to sell most of their hard currenc reserv. that is an allus to currenc control that sent shock wave through the russian public. russian have come to treat the dollar as a second currenc, and mani peopl have squirrel away dollar as a hedg against inflat. it is an obviou stupid, otto latsi, a comment with the newspap noviy izvestiya, said. peopl won't give their dollar away. they will go to the black market if they need to. yegor gaidar, the former prime minist who favor free market, said the plan wa a war against the dollar and predict that it would lead to a shortag of import. as the critic grew, primakov rush to distanc himself from the talk of currenc control. the rumor of the state' becom a monopolist on the inflow of hard currenc into the countri is nonsens, he said, assert that the document publish by kommers daili wa just one of six possibl plan. primakov may be oppos to wildli unpopular currenc control. he may be worri that the plan would would set off the panic buy of dollar, further depress the rubl. or he may simpli be tri to keep hi distanc from maslyukov' plan while russia tri to wrangl it next disburs, $4.3 billion, from the intern monetari fund. the particular could be modifi, but mani peopl follow the maneuv say they believ that it repres the basic thrust of the government' think. primakov ha call for greater state regul and an expans of the money suppli, two theme of maslyukov' plan. the plan also ha mani similar with the plan present to the govern by gorbachev-era advis. we think it is close to be a final document, said the unit financi group, a russian invest busi. it is unclear how long primakov can carri on without spell out a detail strategi. the oust tax chief, bori fyodorov, ha argu that the imf should not provid further aid until primakov ha taken tough measur to build a free market. primakov ha, howev, sought to turn that logic on it head, argu that hi government' econom strategi will depend on the fund' willing to provid aid. hi aim appear to be to pressur the fund by impli that it will be the fund' fault if russia is forc to default on it loan or take draconian measur at home. or as primakov put it thursday, without the fund' money, russia will have to impos unpopular measur. wall

russia about the danger of an anti-western polici. in her first comprehens review of u.s.-russian relat sinc primakov wa confirm as prime minist last month, albright said washington wa deepli concern about russia' direct and did not think the crisi there would soon abat. we have heard a lot of talk in recent day about print new money, index wage, impos price and capit control and restor state manag of part of the economi, she told the u.s.-russia busi council in chicago. we can onli wonder if some member of primakov' team understand the basic arithmet of the global economi. while prais primakov, onc her counterpart when he wa foreign minist, as a pragmatist abl to cooper on key issu with washington, she had harsh word of warn for him. our initi reaction to some of the direct he' go in ha not been particularli posit, she said, ad, the question now is whether that cooper can continu. the unit state must keep up it aid to russia but is adjust it to promot the build of democraci and student exchang as well as arm control, albright said. washington doe not favor more direct aid. more big bailout are not by themselv go to restor investor confid in russia, she said. in the long run, the gap between russia' need and it resourc must be met not by foreign bailout but by foreign invest. albright sharpli critic as self-def the mani voic in russia who want to shift the emphasi in russia' interact with america and our alli from one of partnership to one of assert, opposit and defianc for it own stake. russia could not stand alon in the world, she said, and the unit states' abil to help russian help themselv will go from be mere veri, veri difficult to be absolut imposs. at the same time, she said, washington would not assum the worst, for there are still plenti of peopl in russia who will fight against turn back the clock. and she urg the world and american critic to be patient with the work of the democrat process in russia and not start each day by take a censu of reform in the kremlin, a censu that american offici themselv promot befor presid bori yeltsin dismiss the previou govern. while moscow may continu to oppos ani nato use of forc against serbian forc in the southern provinc of kosovo, albright said, nato must be prepar to act regardless. if the communist parti ha it way and it ha been plan for month million of russian will take to the street on wednesday for some of the biggest demonstr in year. but now that communist or politician with the communist stamp of approv are run the countri and it economi the question is what the marcher will be demonstr against. presid bori yeltsin and hi econom advis were easi target two month ago. but yeltsin seem but a shadow of himself today, and hi advis are gone. the communist, who have undergon a sort of resurg by play on the discont, are work hard to cast themselv as outsid in the govern that they help run and to keep the focu of the protest on wednesday on yeltsin and hi polici. even that strategi may backfir, howev, becaus discont over yeltsin doe not necessarili translat into support for hi predecessor. an advis to the communist parti leader, gennadi zyuganov, made headlin not long ago when he call the new govern bourgeoi. the character wa strike, becaus the new prime minist, yevgeni primakov, wa one of zyuganov' top choic for the post. the deputi prime minist in charg of the economi, yuri maslyukov, is a communist parti figur who onc head gosplan, the infam central-plan program that help bring the soviet union to ruin. we don't have slogan that are aim against the govern, the first secretari of the moscow communist parti committe, alexand kuvayev, said in a recent interview. all the slogan are aim against the presid and the econom cours of the countri. onli the presid can fulli be blame for the cours that ha brought the countri to thi situat. anger over russia' fate, and their own, is draw some russian back to soviet-styl slogan and old-styl hostil toward capit. the ardent pro-communist newspap sovietskaya rossiya devot most of it front page on thursday to what it said were the result of a contest among reader for protest slogan. the entri rang from catchi to kitschi, from, legisl, offici, banker studi the constitution; the exam is oct. 7, to, imperialist! help russia return the export capit, and we will pay the debt at onc. russia ha seen noth approach thi sort of econom chao and despair sinc 1993, when hyperinfl swept the economi. there is no real way of know whether the latest travail will produc huge and ugli crowd or small, peac one. a deputi editor and polit analyst at a newsweekli, itogi, masha lipman, said the situat wa not unlik that of 1993, when yeltsin sought, and won, a popular mandat in a referendum. he use it to dissolv the communist-domin parliament and increas hi own power. that led to an autumn showdown, the shell of parliament by tank and the total defeat, for the time be, of yeltsin' legisl oppon. you can interpret thi demonstr as a communist mandat, but i don't think they will act like yeltsin, ms. lipman said. support for the communist is at it smallest level, mayb 20 percent. in a survey of 1,714 peopl that wa releas last week the all-russian public opinion center said that nearli half the popul support the idea of demonstr against yeltsin, but that bare one-tenth were like to particip in ani way. nobodi is interest in ani sort of struggl, yuri levada, who head the center, said in an interview. thi is mainli a gener express of a great wave of distrust of author, mainli the presid. he' the great scapegoat for all our sin. there seem to be littl enthusiasm for demonstr of ani sort. onli a few thousand peopl turn out sunday for the fifth anniversari of the shell of parliament and yeltsin' subsequ triumph over the communist. the communist parti and the feder of independ russian union, a leftist organ that say it is the main sponsor of the protest, predict that 9 million russian will particip on wednesday. the govern ha vow to keep order without resort to forc. but it is concern enough that it ha summon 11,000 polic offic to patrol moscow and 6,000 militari troop to interven if violenc erupt. protest sinc 1993 have gener been tepid, a deep-seat feel here. some demonstr last week, more or less practic run, hint at similarli dampen march thi year. presid bori yeltsin would respond strongli to ani effort to prohibit russian from buy foreign currenc, believ the move would be like bring anoth iron curtain down on the countri, hi spokesman said friday. the presid clearli understand that such a ban would be a clear violat of our right . that would mean a return to the iron curtain in everyday life, said presidenti spokesman dmitri yakushin. the remark came after media report of a govern econom plan in the work that would prohibit russian from buy us. dollar and other foreign currenc, and institut other strict econom control, roll back seven year of reform. though govern offici say such a plan is onli one of six possibl, prime minist yevgeni primakov warn thursday that he might be forc to take unpopular measur to rescu the russian economi if it doe not receiv the next instal in a dlr 22.6 billion loan from the intern monetari fund. central bank chairman viktor gerashchenko and financ minist mikhail zadornov flew to washington on friday for negoti with the imf over the dlr 4.3 billion instal. imf offici have said they want the russian govern to come up with a sound econom program befor the loan is given, and have made it clear that currenc control and boost the money suppli by print rubl are not accept. but primakov said that the country' plan would be depend on the imf loan, not the other way around. no short-term econom plan will be known for anoth three week, long after the imf is set to make it decis, said first deputi prime minist vadim gustov. a draft version of the government' fourth-quart budget would reli heavili on the imf loan, the kommers newspap said. without the loan, the govern would have to engag in major deficit spend. call for soviet-styl control part of the plan draft by first deputi prime minist yuri maslyukov and leak to the press have appar creat a rift within the cabinet. the plan drew heavi critic from zadornov, and gerashchenko call the idea of ban foreign currenc sale a mad idea. meanwhil, russia' stock market drop by 5 percent to 38.8 friday, but trade wa so light the downward move meant littl. the stock market ha continu to fall sinc the crisi hit aug. 17. and tax collect wa down in septemb, the result of the collaps in russia' bank system, said alexand pochinok, head of the government' financ and credit depart. revenu total 14.3 billion rubl (dlr 875 million), 700 million rubl (dlr 43 million) less than expect. the govern want to revers thi trend by rais tax for oil and ga compani, but the idea is expect to meet sharp resist in the lower hous of russia' parliament, which want to cut tax rate, pochinok said. prime minist yevgeni primakov said saturday that the econom crisi would not bring an end to the government' program of privat state properti. privat will be accomplish for growth of product, growth of invest and growth of product effect through renew of major fund, primakov said dure a meet of western businessmen. we shall conduct privat so that it serv the interest of the peopl, the state, and busi, he said, accord to the itar-tass news agenc. primakov reassur the businessmen, member of the prime minister' consult council on foreign invest in russia, that the govern had no plan to ban the circul of us. dollar in russia. but, he said, the govern would take step to staunch the flow of dollar from russia. respond to media report of a govern econom plan that would prohibit russian from buy us. dollar and other foreign currenc, primakov said the report absolut do not correspond to realiti, itar-tass quot him as say. he said there wa no need to regul the influx of dollar into russia, but the govern should take step to prevent what he call the dollar drain. russian compani stash about dlr 2.5 billion outsid the countri in septemb alon, the interfax news agenc report friday, quot central bank figur. primakov said foreign investor are the forc that will help russia to minim it loss from the current econom crisi. we are veri much interest in foreign invest, especi in one that go into the real product sector, primakov said, accord to interfax. we need a continu dialogu with foreign investor, without whom it will be difficult for us to overcom the current difficulti. he said russia want long-term invest. foreign capit ha been come to the countri via short-term oper, primakov said. thi, he said, is not to our like or your. viktor gerashchenko, the central bank chairman, said on friday that the govern must act to stem the flow of dollar from russia. gerashchenko and financ minist mikhail zadornov were in washington saturday for the annual meet of the intern monetari fund, where they plan to spell out the measur russia is take to bail out it financ system. russia want the imf to releas the second dlr 4.3 billion instal of a loan that wa approv in juli, a month befor the country' economi crash and the govern effect default on it foreign loan. imf offici have said they want the russian govern to come up with a sound econom program befor the instal is given, and have made it clear that currenc control and boost the money suppli by print rubl are not accept. in a season of crash bank, plung rubl, bounc paycheck, fail cropsand rotat govern, mayb it is not the ultim insult. but the nation that bore tolstoy and chekhov, and still regard a well-written letter as a labor of love, is buckl a littl thi week, becaus it can no longer wish good health to baba anya in omsk. the post offic is broke. in 60 of the country' 89 statelik region, more than 1,000 mail car have been sidetrack, mani stuf with up to 18 ton of letter, newspap and parcel. the state railway ministri refus to carri more mail until the post offic make good on some 210 million rubl in old bill about $13 million in today' dollar, or $35 million in dollar six week ago. air mail, which amount to one of everi four or five letter, wa also suspend at one of moscow' major airport until thi week, when the post offic cough up 5 million rubl for old bill. a second airport is still demand 3 million rubl for past-du debt. so much mail is back up that post offic in moscow and elsewher have simpli stop accept out-of-town mail, except for area that can be easili reach by truck. deliveri schedul have fallen week, and perhap month, behind. the situat is realli extraordinari, said vladimir sherekhov, the deputi chief of mail servic administr in the government' commun committe. we'v never had anyth like thi befor. mayb the post offic ha been lucki. extraordinari is the rule elsewher in russia. until friday, the lower hous of parliament wa prepar to sue the govern for failur to provid soap, heat, toilet paper and copy-machin paper in the legislature' monument downtown offic. it turn out that politician had exhaust their fund by cut short their recess and return to address the nation' econom crisi. earlier in the week, offici said russia' arctic ship rout may close next month becaus half the nation' icebreak are in disrepair and there is no money to fix them. the oldest of the ship is so ancient that it nicknam is granni. such anecdot evid that russia is lose it wheel, like one of it old, ill-maintain volga sedan, is everywher. but oddli, real sign of public distress are not particularli common, perhap becaus the system rare seem to shed a part as big as a postal system. if the us. postal servic is increasingli a pipelin for sweepstak notic and bill, the russian post offic still hold a special place in the nation convers. russian still write letter to each other, frequent and fervent, and mani in remot region get their news through the mail. million use the mail to ship can good and other provis to needi rel and friend in faraway area, an especi vital servic in winter. and in the last few year, the post offic ha becom a vehicl for a grow mail-ord trade in book, cloth and other catalog item not readili avail outsid big citi. exactli whi all thi ha rumbl to a halt is in some disput. what is clear is that the post offic and the railway ministri both suffer from what ail everi russian ventur, privat and public alike: nobodi pay hi bill. the state railway ministri complain that it is continu stif by custom who believ the railroad are honor-bound to carri freight whether they are paid or not. the govern ha specifi nearli 40 categori of freight which the railroad must carri for next to noth. among the biggest deadbeat are the power ministri the militari and interior depart which did not pay dure soviet time and feel littl need to pay now. it' a psycholog form dure the socialist period, said tatiana pashkova, the deputi spokeswoman for the ministri, and the same situat exist with the post offic. we'v been in disput for a veri long time. alway we tri to understand their differ. but we can't carri

with a combin mass of 70,000 pound that curri and her crewmat had to reli on a computer vision system and camera view, rather than direct line of sight. thi wa the first time such a blind dock had ever been attempt. curri posit the solar-wing zarya, still on the end of the shuttl robot arm, sever inch directli abov uniti. it wa slow going; she want and need perfect align. onc she wa sure she had it, cabana fire endeavour' thruster, and the brief burst rais the shuttl and therebi uniti enough for the dock mechan on the two station compon to snap togeth. the histor moment occur abov the south pacif. it took sever tri, howev, for zarya and uniti to be pull tightli togeth. the dock ring between them would not retract properly; mission control quickli trace the problem to the attach robot arm and ask the crew to releas it hold on the dock zarya. that did the trick. the union intend to last the station' 15-year or more lifetim set the stage for a spacewalk by two astronaut on monday to attach electr connector and cabl between the two compon. mission control thought sunday' work might take hour longer than plan and gave the six astronaut plenti of time for the task. but everyth occur more or less when and how it wa suppos to, asid from a piec of space junk that stray too close. befor begin their final approach to zarya, the six astronaut had to steer clear of a chunk of a rocket launch last month from california. mission control order the pilot to fire the shuttl thruster to put an extra three mile between endeavour and the space junk, put endeavour a total of five mile from the orbit debri. the smaller gap would have been probabl a littl too close for comfort, mission control said. the bigger worri, by far, wa over endeavour' pursuit and captur of zarya, and it coupl with uniti. the shuttle' 50-foot robot arm had never befor handl an object as massiv as the 41-foot, 44,000-pound zarya, a power and propuls modul that wa launch from kazakstan on nov. 20. it will provid all of the necessari electr and steer for the fledgl space station until a perman control modul can be launch next summer. minut after zarya' captur, cabana call down that two antenna on the modul were still undeploy as russian flight control had fear. the antenna must be fulli deploy in order for zarya' manual dock system to work; that system won't be need befor next summer, offici said. the onli other problem wa with a zarya battery; the astronaut took up a replac part. the 36-foot, 25,000-pound uniti, the first american-mad compon, will serv as a connect passageway, or vestibul, for futur modul. it wa crucial that zarya and uniti be joined; if they could not be connect with the robot arm, nasa would have sent out two spacewalk astronaut to manual fit them togeth. in all, three spacewalk are plan for endeavour' 12-day flight, not onli to hook up electr connect between the two modul but to instal handrail and other tool for futur crew. the join modul will be releas from endeavour onc all of the work is complet. nasa estim 43 more launch and 159 more spacewalk will be need after thi mission to assembl the entir orbit complex. onc complet, the 16-nation space station will have a mass of 1 million pound, be longer than a footbal field, and hous up to seven astronaut and cosmonaut. for the second day in a row, astronaut board space shuttl endeavour on friday for liftoff on nasa' first space station construct flight. let' go do thi, said command robert cabana. amen, repli a launch control. rain and cloudi sky were onc again a threat. but nasa wa confid the master alarm in endeavour' cockpit would behave; it went off with just 4{ minut to go in the countdown thursday, forc a delay. nasa ha onli five minut or less each day to launch endeavour in order to meet up with the first space station part, which wa put in orbit two week ago by the russian. the shuttl contain the second station compon. the master alarm blare and red light flash just befor the shuttl wa to lift off earli thursday. by the time control trace the problem to a momentari drop in hydraul pressur and decid to press ahead, it wa too late they had miss the cutoff by a second or two. sure, it' frustrat, said bill readdi, shuttl program director and a veteran shuttl command. but we do thing right. we do thing by the book, and we'r not go to cut ani corner even if it mean just shave a second or two. the six astronaut crawl out of the shuttl, and two threw up their hand. cabana held up hi thumb and index finger a half-inch apart: we were that close. the problem wa confin to one of endeavour' three hydraul pressur unit. the pressur drop just long enough to trigger the alarm, evid becaus of a sensit switch, then return to normal. nasa engin spent the day examin the problem, but found noth wrong with ani of the system and were confid it would not reoccur. endeavour' flight is alreadi a year late becaus of a cash crunch in russia, one of nasa' partner in build the intern space station. the one-day delay cost nasa about $600000, mostli in fuel and overtim pay. aboard endeavour is an american-mad connect passageway name uniti. the astronaut will use the shuttl robot arm to captur the russian space station piec and attach it to uniti. then, two spacewalk will hook up all the electr connect and cabl between the two cylind, and attach handrail and tool for futur crew. until the alarm sound, it look as though the weather would be the onli problem. rain and cloud move in from the atlant 1{ hour befor liftoff, but drift away with minut to spare. secretari of state madelein albright and other dignitari from around the world had gather in the drizzl to see endeavour and it crew off. here we have 16 countri cooper on a ventur to the futur, said albright, who wa expect back for friday' attempt. thi is a good invest. the planet' most dare construct job began friday as the shuttl endeavour carri into orbit six astronaut and the first u.s.-built part of an intern space station that is expect to cost more than $100 billion. after a last-minut alarm on the shuttl forc a postpon earli thursday, the launch went off flawlessli at 3:36 friday morn, right on schedul. the night sky wa clear, and the moon full. with a roar, endeavour made it fieri ascent and briefli turn the florida coastlin from night to day. more than five minut and 500 mile later, the spaceship' main engin could still be seen in the distanc, twinkl like a new star. on their 12-day flight, endeavour' astronaut are to locat a russian part alreadi in orbit, grasp it with the shuttle' robot arm and attach the new us. modul. wield tool hundr of mile abov earth, work method in the cold void, the astronaut will be start a five-year assembl that is like to make the construct of the pyramid and the great cathedr look like child' play. construct of the station, which will be a research facil, will requir an estim 160 space walk, which, for safeti reason, will alway be done by two peopl. when complet, the intern space station, domin by solar power array, will cover an area equal to that of two footbal field. modul of interconnect laboratori and live quarter for up to seven astronaut are to form a habitat equal to that of two 747 jetlin. the station' batteri alon, if line up, would extend a half-mil. the project entail high risk, becaus of the technic difficulti of put all thi togeth in the unforgiv environ of space, along with the danger inher in fli the space shuttl to the construct site. the work is further complic by intern polit and worri about money. the russian, whose particip in the partnership clinch the post-cold war deal five year ago, are now a wild card. moscow' econom and polit woe have left western offici unsur of it abil and willing to come up with it share of money and technolog. at the same time, the station' cost are rise, and it critic among scientist worri that it appetit for money will consum their own feder financ. the project' total cost is a subject of debat, but the most credibl estim now put the price of assembl and of oper for a decad, the station' estim lifetim, at $110 billion. of that, american taxpay are to spend roughli $96 billion, and the project' 15 foreign partner about $14 billion. the station is intend to be a grand laboratori where, in the environ of weightless, investig can develop new materi and new drug and explor physiology' remain mysteri, in part so that human may someday know how to adapt for long space flight to other world. friday, in ani case, littl wa heard about the project but prais. great show, endeavour, mission control in houston radio to the six astronaut as the shuttl went into orbit. at the florida spaceport, secretari of state madelein albright laud the launch team and the new ventur. that wa truli, truli fantast, she told the team after the liftoff. and it wa import, she ad, to have so mani nation work togeth on the kind of issu that the 21st centuri is go to be concern with. so my congratul to all of you, the secretari said. stupend work. the main cargo thursday wa the uniti modul, the first u.s.-built station part. small compar with the giant to come in three dozen shuttl flight dure assembl, the unit is 18 feet long, weigh 13 ton and is to serv as a connect hub for other modul. saturday, one of the astronaut, lt. col. nanci curri of the armi, is to have the shuttle' robot arm hoist uniti from the payload bay and secur it to endeavour' dock system, move the unit from a horizont to a vertic posit. then, sunday, the astronaut are to rendezv with the modul known as zarya, or sunris, which russia launch into orbit from kazakhstan on nov. 20. financ by the unit state but built in russia, zarya, 41 feet long, is be a kind of tugboat for the embryon station, furnish power and propuls as well as commun and rendezv abil. when endeavour' payload bay is within 10 feet of zarya, colonel curri is to reach out with the robot arm and pull the russian modul into posit over uniti. the mechan arm ha never befor move anyth so big. zarya, while complet weightless in space, ha 21 ton of mass. if mishandl, it can crush and kill. as col. curri hold zarya steadi, endeavour' command, col. robert cabana of the marin corp, a veteran of three space flight, is to nudg the shuttl forward to join the two station piec togeth. when mate with special attach, zarya and uniti will form the station' first element, 63 feet long and 78 feet wide out to the tip of the solar array. start monday, a pair of space-walk astronaut are to hook up electr connect and data cabl between the unit, attach antenna and instal tool and handrail for futur visitor. the builder will be col. jerri ross of the air forc, 50, and dr. jame newman, 42, a physicist. their seri of three space walk will continu wednesday and end saturday, dec. 12. as construct goe on outsid, the astronaut insid endeavour will be busi make prepar to enter the new station through a connect tunnel and dock system. next thursday, the crew will enter the embryon station for the first time, instal portabl fan and light. friday they will again enter, to prepar for the arriv in 1999 of the next major element, the first one both built and financ by russia. the other astronaut on endeavour are it pilot, maj. frederick sturckow of the marin corp, and a mission specialist, sergei krikalev of the russian space agenc. after separ from the new outpost, the crew is to bring endeavour back to the kennedi space center on dec. 15, with the mission length just shi of 12 day. gretchen mcclain, nasa' director in washington for the intern space station, said in an interview here that it overal cost were actual small for individu american. over it lifetim, she said, the annual cost will equal that of a pizza and a soft drink for each of the nation' 96 million taxpay. us. cost for construct, she ad, were $24 billion, and for oper through the year 2012 were $10.4 billion, for a total of $34.4 billion. most expert outsid the agenc consid thi figur ridicul low becaus it ignor mani billion of dollar spent in earli develop work as well as the cost of numer shuttl flight, which run about $800 million apiec. follow a seri of intric maneuv and the skill use of the space shuttl endeavour' robot arm, astronaut on sunday join the first two of mani segment that will form the intern space station. the shuttl and it crew of six snare the russian-mad zarya control modul after chase it around the earth in ever-clos orbit throughout the day. less than an hour after a rendezv 240 mile abov the earth shortli befor 6 p.m., lt. col. nanci curri of the armi deftli use the 50-foot arm to grab the 40,000-pound cylind as the craft pass abov russia and to slowli pull it toward the shuttl. see zarya up close, col. robert cabana of the marin, the shuttl command, confirm that two antenna had fail to deploy from the modul follow it launch from kazakhstan on nov. 20. there were earlier indic that the antenna, which will be use later by the station to manual assist spacecraft dock, had not extend. curri took almost two hour to painstakingli move zarya abov the american-mad uniti dock port posit in endeavour' cargo bay. when the two piec were align within inch of one anoth, cabana fire small thruster rocket that rais the shuttl, allow the modul to clamp togeth. the two station piec, togeth measur about 77 feet from end to end and have a combin mass of 70,000 pound, are the first of 100 major compon to be unit in space over the next five year to form an orbit outpost that would weigh almost a million pound and span an area the size of two footbal field. more than 40 addit mission by us. shuttl and russian rocket will be use to haul all of the compon and other suppli into orbit, and astronaut from both nation are to spend almost 1,800 hour do spacewalk to assembl the entir structur. the spece station is expect to cost it partnership of 16 nation more than $40 billion just to construct. bring the piec togeth is onli the first step in mate them. a pair of astronaut are to make three spacewalk thi week, the first on monday, dure which they will hook up electr and commun cabl, remov cover, attach handrail and perform other task to get the modul to work as one unit. the most difficult part of sunday' mate of the $240 million zarya to the $300 million uniti wa bring them togeth after the shuttl caught up with the russian unit. curri had to use the canadian-built robot arm to place zarya on top of uniti without be abl to see where the piec join. uniti, rais in endeavour' cargo bay on saturday, is so larg that it block currie' view of the mate fixtur from the shuttle' window. she use view from remot camera and a computer vision system built on the arm to estim the rel posit of the two larg segment. the computer system examin mark on both modul, comput their relationship to one anoth use the mark and display the result on a laptop comput. we'v never done anyth like thi befor, curri said befor the flight, ad that she had practic the difficult maneuv more than 100 time over the last two year. the flight of endeavour, which took off from cape canaver, fla., last friday, had gone accord to plan until earli sunday, when mission control order the shuttl to chang it orbit slightli to avoid a piec of space debri. air forc space debri tracker note that the shuttl wa to pass within 1.6 mile of a spent stage of an american booster rocket launch last month. although thi wa consid a safe distanc, shuttl control decid to widen the separ to five mile as an extra precaut. endeavour and it astronaut close in sunday to captur the first piec of the intern space station, the russian-mad zarya control modul that had to be connect to the uniti chamber aboard the shuttl. stack the two giant cylind 240 mile abov the earth wa consid the most difficult part of the mission. the job fell to nanci curri, the shuttl crane oper who had deftli hoist and reposit uniti in the cargo bay on saturday. the two station piec are so big 77 feet from the tip of one to the tip of the other with a combin mass of 70,000 pound that curri and her crewmat were go to have to reli on a computer vision system and camera view, rather than direct line of sight. such a blind dock had never been attempt befor. mission control gave the astronaut plenti of time for the task. the main thing i'v tri to do for the last two year work on thi flight is make sure we have time. we have margin on everyth, said flight director bob castl. befor begin their final approach to zarya russian for sunris the shuttle' six astronaut had to steer clear of a chunk of a rocket launch last month from california. mission control order the pilot to fire the shuttl thruster to put an extra three mile between endeavour and the space junk, put endeavour a total of five mile from the orbit debri. the smaller gap would have been probabl a littl too close for comfort, mission control said. the bigger worri, by far, wa over endeavour' pursuit and captur of zarya, and it coupl with uniti. the shuttle' 50-foot robot arm had never befor been assign to handl an object as massiv as the 44,000-pound zarya, a power and propuls modul that wa launch from kazakhstan on nov. 20. it will provid all the necessari electr and steer for the fledgl space station until a perman control modul can be launch next summer. the 36-foot, 25,000-pound uniti will serv as a connect passageway, or vestibul, for futur modul. in case zarya and uniti could not be connect with the robot arm, two spacewalk astronaut would have to manual fit them togeth. the astronaut would be go out anyway monday to attach electr connector and cabl between the two compon. in all, three spacewalk were plan for endeavour' 12-day flight. nasa estim 43 more launch and 159 more spacewalk will be need after thi mission to assembl the entir orbit complex. onc complet, the 16-nation space station will have a mass of 1 million pound, be longer than a footbal field, and hous up to seven astronaut and cosmonaut. endeavour' astronaut connect the first two build block of the intern space station on sunday, creat a seven-stori tower in the shuttl cargo bay. it wa the first time that the russian-built zarya control modul and the made-in-america uniti chamber had ever touch. it look to be a perfect and, hope, long-last fit. we have captur of zarya, command robert cabana announc the moment the two piec came togeth. congratul to the crew of the good ship endeavour, repli mission control. that' terrif. the 240-mile-high construct job began two hour earlier with nanci currie' captur of zarya (russian for sunris) use the shuttl robot arm. we'r halfway home, cabana said. then came the hard part: stack the two giant cylind in the cargo bay. the two station piec are so big 77 feet from the tip of one to the tip of the other with a combin mass of 70,000 pound that curri and her crewmat had to reli on a computer vision system and camera view, rather than direct line of sight. thi wa the first time such a blind dock had ever been attempt. curri posit the solar-wing zarya, still on the end of the shuttl robot arm, sever inch directli abov uniti. it wa slow going; she want and need perfect align. onc she wa sure she had it, cabana fire endeavour' thruster, and the brief burst rais the shuttl and therebi uniti enough for the dock mechan on the two station compon to snap togeth. the histor moment occur abov the south pacif. it took sever tri, howev, for zarya and uniti to be pull tightli togeth. the dock ring between them would not retract properly; mission control quickli trace the problem to the attach robot arm and ask the crew to releas it hold on the dock zarya. that did the trick. the union intend to last the station' 15-year or more lifetim set the stage for a spacewalk by two astronaut on monday to attach electr connector and cabl between the two compon. mission control thought sunday' work might take hour longer than plan and gave the six astronaut plenti of time for the task. but everyth occur more or less when and how it wa suppos to, asid from a piec of space junk that stray too close. befor begin their final approach to zarya, the six astronaut had to steer clear of a chunk of a rocket launch last month from california. mission control order the pilot to fire the shuttl thruster to put an extra three mile between endeavour and the space junk, put endeavour a total of five mile from the orbit debri. the smaller gap would have

the fledgl space station until a perman control modul can be launch next summer. minut after zarya' captur, cabana call down that two antenna on the modul were still undeploy as russian flight control had fear. the antenna must be fulli deploy in order for zarya' manual dock system to work; that system won't be need befor next summer, offici said. the onli other problem wa with a zarya battery; the astronaut took up a replac part. the 36-foot, 25,000-pound uniti, the first american-mad compon, will serv as a connect passageway, or vestibul, for futur modul. it wa crucial that zarya and uniti be joined; if they could not be connect with the robot arm, nasa would have sent out two spacewalk astronaut to manual fit them togeth. in all, three spacewalk are plan for endeavour' 12-day flight, not onli to hook up electr connect between the two modul but to instal handrail and other tool for futur crew. the join modul will be releas from endeavour onc all of the work is complet. nasa estim 43 more launch and 159 more spacewalk will be need after thi mission to assembl the entir orbit complex. onc complet, the 16-nation space station will have a mass of 1 million pound, be longer than a footbal field, and hous up to seven astronaut and cosmonaut. a last-minut alarm forc nasa to halt thursday' launch of the space shuttl endeavour, on a mission to start assembl the intern space station. anoth attempt for endeavour and it crew of six astronaut is schedul for friday at 3:36 am. thi wa the first time in three year, and 19 flight, that a shuttl countdown had been stop after the spaceship wa fuel and the crew aboard the craft and readi to go. the uncommon delay prompt frown and furrow brow here, although offici stress that it wa entir warrant. we want to err on the conserv side, ralph roe, launch director at the kennedi space center, said at a news confer after the sudden halt of the countdown just 19 second befor liftoff. everyth had been go smoothli for a rare nighttim launch, set for 3:58 on thursday morn. the weather, forecast to be iffi, turn out to be fine, and the sky wa alight with a nearli full moon. but the length of the so-cal launch window wa, as plan, unusu short onli 10 minut. that breviti wa a result of endeavour' have to rendezv with a space-st part that russia put into orbit last month. the show-stopp aros about four minut befor liftoff when the comput in the space shuttl set off a master alarm. control studi the data and discov a momentari pressur drop on one of the hydraul system that control the movement of the shuttle' engin and it rudder and other flight surfac. offici eventu decid that the pressur drop wa insignific, and they resolv to press ahead. but by then it wa too late: time had run out for one of the procedur need to keep the shuttle' fuel supercold. so the countdown wa abort just 19 second from blastoff. the six astronaut began to emerg from the shuttl an hour later and ultim head for bed to rest up for anoth attempt earli friday. ","On Friday the shuttle Endeavor carried six astronauts into orbit to start building an international space station.The launch occurred after Russia and U.S. officials agreed not to delay the flight in order to orbit closer to MIR, and after a last-minute alarm forced a postponement.On Sunday astronauts joining the Russian-made Zarya control module cylinder with the American-made module to form a 70,000 pounds mass 77 feet long.NASA estimates 43 more launches and 159 more space walks are needed to assemble the complex.When completed the 16-nation space station will be longer than a football field.It will be used to study adaptation to space flight.","Russia and NASA jointly decided against a Russian cost-cutting proposal to orbit the 2nd space station, a 16-country cooperative project, closer to Mir, citing complexity, risk, and bad sun angles.After 5 years of assembly, the research station will house 7 people.A 12-day shuttle mission will attach the US Unity module to the Russian Zarya, already in orbit.Thursday's launch was delayed by a pressure drop.A 2nd attempt Friday was perfect.Unity was attached to Zarya in a blind docking using cameras and computer images.Electrical and cable connections come next.Unity will serve as a passageway for future modules.Two Zarya antennas failed to deploy.","After discarding a suggested change of orbit, the Russian Space Agency went ahead with plans to launch its Zarya module of the international space station on Nov. 20, 1998.Although delayed for a day, U.S. plans to launch the space shuttle Endeavour carrying the U.S. module Unity and six astronauts were carried out on Dec. 4.The astronauts' job was to connect Unity with the already-orbiting Zarya as the first step in assembling 100 major components of the planned space station.Using the shuttle's 50-foot robot arm, the two modules were joined setting the stage for a spacewalk by two astronauts the next day to attach electrical connectors and cables.","The International Space Station when completed will have a million pound mass and be longer than a football field.It will house up to seven space explorers.The initial assembly of space station components involves linking the US Unity, carried into space by the shuttle Endeavour, with the Russian Zarya.The Russians had asked for a different launch profile in order to be able to transfer equipment from its MIR station, but that was not possible.Endeavour astronauts successfully completed the complicated maneuvers to join the two space objects.NASA estimates that 43 more launches will be required to completely assemble the 16-nation space station."
33,"make their first collect decis about monetari polici, the 11 european nation launch a common currenc on jan. 1 cut interest rate thursday in a surpris move that won market confid. ten of the 11

routier, 26, wa juggl busi call halfway between london and pari. when hi phone went dead as the high-spe eurostar train pull into the underwat tunnel that link england to the contin, the london-bas french banker loosen hi italian silk tie and introduc himself. i definit describ myself as a european, he said in the fluent english he perfect work at an australian bank. i may get sentiment when they play the marseillais, but for all the practic thing, i see myself as a citizen of europ. i like the lifestyl in franc, but i don't make my live there. the year 1999 is the offici start-up date of the euro, the common european currenc that will unit 11 countri monetarili. but throughout europ, a differ kind of integr ha alreadi taken root. routier, who wa spend a day in pari to meet with hi bank' french client, is at the vanguard of a new gener of european who do not have to brace themselv for a shock in the new year. mobil, fluent in sever languag and aggress non-nationalist, they are alreadi live the kind of borderless, cosmopolitan exist that the singl european currenc is suppos to advanc. they do not share their parents' memori of world war ii or their parents' sens of nation ident. peopl worri when they hear talk of a common european defens polici becaus it suggest that at the end of the day, we have one govern, said kleon papadopoulo, a greek banker base in london. countri are afraid to lose their sovereignti, but i don't see it as a bad thing. if a govern is good, stabl and effici, who care if it is base in berlin or athen? papadopoulo, 36, who studi busi in the unit state and britain, could serv as a model for the new european. he work for a swiss bank in london, speak greek, english and french, and in the past year ha travel, among other place, to belgium, the unit state, cuba, switzerland and itali. like hundr of thousand of other european, he chose london and it busi financi market as the best place to work. he said he doe not feel as if he live in england. he live in london, the clubhous of financi europ. and membership ha it privileg. papadopoulo live in the fashion knightsbridg area, drive a porsch he bought in brussel, and work out at the fashion gym of the carleton tower. i went to the london school of econom in 1984, and the onli other `foreigners' i met were from the middl east, he say. now friend and co-work are italian, french, greek, spanish, german, even russian. you feel it everywher. the street are jam with foreign. not tourist peopl who live and work here. baby-boom in europ often describ themselv as the 1968 gener, wean on the protest and social turmoil that convuls european societi 30 year ago. less dramat but equal signific wa a 1968 law guarante freedom of movement within what were then the six countri of the common market. a frenchman could work in holland, an italian could work in germani without a permit. back then some economist dourli predict huge migrat, particularli of unskil labor move from southern countri to the more prosper north. actual, as huge industri like steel shrank in the 1970 and '80, so did the job opportun for working-class european. there are 15 countri within what is now the european union, but onli a small percentag of their citizen have move to other countri, accord to estim prepar by eurostat. those who do mostli find job in the servic industri as waiter, maid or garbag collector. there are still legal barrier prevent most doctor, lawyer and academ from find work in other countri. so far the european union ha been most profit put to use by white-collar busi execut who eagerli follow career opportun across nation border, time zone and languag barrier. twenty-f year ago that kind of mobil wa the preserv of a far smaller elit, the top execut of major compani or multin corpor. technolog, from high-spe train to the ever-evolv apparatu of busi lap-top comput, cell phone, fax machin ha made european mobil access to mid-level manag, young entrepreneur and even student. cabl televis, which allow german to watch italian game show or swede to watch french news program, ha spread the zeitgeist to the mass. thi year superga, an italian brand of sport cloth and shoe, open a major advertis campaign with a seri of magazin ad that show fashion young peopl saucili cavort with european leader a leggi young woman push her bicycl up the step of the elyse palac to greet presid jacqu chirac, a young man play stick hi tongu out the window of the plane of the former german chancellor, helmut kohl. thi kind of ad would not have been possibl five or 10 year ago, said aldo cernuto, execut creativ director of the milan offic of pirella gottsch low, an intern advertis agenc. now european unif is on the tv all the time; it ha seep into people' unconsci. even peopl who do not care about polit recogn the face of a toni blair or jacqu chirac. ten year ago, veri few peopl did. accord to the european union, britain ha twice as mani eu citizen as franc, but it is not the countri with the highest concentr of resid from other european countri. accord to estim base on survey prepar by eurostat, nearli a third of the resid of tini luxembourg, which ha low unemploy and a high standard of live, are from other european countri. belgium, which ha the european commiss and nato headquart, is second, with 5.4 percent. paradox, perhap, britain, the one major european nation that ha held off from join the euro, is wide view as the nerv center of the new cosmopolitan, headquart for the new european banker and busi execut drawn by london' financi district, a more flexibl bureaucraci and the univers of the english languag. perhap just as surprisingli, london also serv as an exampl of anoth less obviou aspect of european cosmopolitan the breakdown of certain social barrier. studi abroad wa onc a privileg reserv to the son and daughter of europe' elit. now the european union ha a 12-year-old scholarship program, call socrates-erasmu, that thi year allow 200,000 european univers student 5 percent of the eu' entir univers popul to studi in other countri within the union for up to a year, free. in the last 20 year, busi school in europ have multipli, and most offer u.s.-styl mba program that teach an american approach to busi. thi too ha allow a measur of meritocraci to creep into european busi. juergen schrempp, the head of daimler, start as a car mechan, note stephen szabo, a professor of european affair at the john hopkin univers school for intern studi in washington. that would have been unthink in germani 20 year ago. social mobil, moreov, is fuel by movement. when peopl transfer to anoth countri, they find it easier to shed the psycholog or cultur trap of home. i could never have the kind of job i have had i stay in pari, routier explain. franc is still veri hierarch. boss want to know where you went to school, what your father doe. in london, none of that matter as long as you make money. mani briton still view their countri as weigh down by heavi class distinct. for exampl, toni smith, 36, editor of sever portugues magazin in lisbon, seiz an opportun to studi in vienna 14 year ago, and never look back. he ha live all over europ, and is fluent in portugues, spanish, german, french and serbo-croatian. hi father, a car mechan, had not travel out of britain until 1992. smith said he could never have succeed as well had he stay home. i didn't go to public school or oxbridg, he explain. i'm not say it imposs, but it would have been much more difficult in england. yet continent european who flock to london find themselv bypass english societi and join a cosmopolitan world where birth and breed do not matter as much. ildiko iliff, 30, chose to work in london to escap the sexism she encount on the contin. mr. iliff, who is hungarian, speak fluent english, german, french and italian, and met her canadian husband, roger iliff, 30, while both were attend the univers of bocconi busi school in milan in 1995. like hi wife, iliff speak four languag and ha live and travel all over the world. she work on the eastern european desk of a british bank; he work for a major intern consult firm. origin they plan to work in itali, but mr. iliff said the prevail attitud toward work women there made it imposs for her to find as good a job. i went to job interview at italian bank and they onli ask me about my husband' job, she said with a grimac. and they made it clear that they were afraid i would get pregnant and ask for matern leav. philipp haspeslagh, 48, a professor at insead, the prestigi intern busi school in fontainebleau, outsid pari, call mr. iliffe' choic cherry-pick choos the best deal for herself. as he put it, if they cannot find what they want in one countri, they can pick up and seek it elsewher. twenty-f year ago, haspeslagh wa a pioneer when he did the same thing. a belgian who studi busi at harvard, he live and teach in franc and doe consult work all over europ, from sweden to the czech republ. the messag on hi cell phone is in three languag french, flemish and english. hi student, a gener behind him, see noth except in hi transnation. these european form an advanc guard that is still rel small in number, but expert say they carri a disproportion influenc on their societi. in germani, for exampl, it is the busi peopl who are push ahead with chang and pull politician along behind them kick and scream, szabo said. they are look at a larger market and feel the competit pressur of global. politician are respond to a domest constitu. they are answer to an

the worsen outlook for european economi, and wasn't a capitul to polit pressur financ minist oskar lafontain. it' not a dramat step. it wasn't in respons to polit pressur, tietmey said, refer to germany' cut. the coordin rate cut could lead to a reduct in the current pessim and a reduct in financi market turbul, he said. but tietmey, head of the bank on which the ecb is model, promis that the

free to find hi voic. a member of the portugues communist parti sinc 1969, he serv as editor of a lisbon newspap, diario de noticia, dure an 18-month period when the left look like to seiz power in portug. but an anti-communist backlash in novemb 1975 forc him out of the newspap and he began translat french text into portugues to make end meet. in the late 1970, he also turn to novel, publish three in success in 1977, 1978 and 1980. but it wa in 1982, with baltasar and blimunda (memori do convento in portuguese), that he achiev hi intern breakthrough. thi is a rich, multifacet and polysem text that at the same time ha a histor, a social and an individu perspect, the swedish academi note thursday. the insight and wealth of imagin to which it give express is characterist of saramago' work as a whole. set in 18th-centuri portug dure the inquisit, the book tell of the baroqu effort of a war veteran, baltasar, and a visionari, blimunda, to escap to the heaven aboard a fli machin power by human will captur by the hypersensori blimunda. thi fantast stori take place against the veri real background of the tortuou construct of the massiv mafra convent by thousand of men held in the grip of the inquisit. when the novel wa publish in the unit state in 1987, irv how acclaim it as brilliant in the new york time book review. mr. saramago is constantli present as a voic of european skeptic, a connoisseur of ironi, how wrote. i think i hear in hi prose echo of enlighten sensibl, caustic and shrewd. in hi next novel, the year of the death of ricardo rei, which is also a homag to the great portugues poet fernando pessoa, who appear in it as a ghost, saramago set hi stori in the earli year of the salazar dictatorship, with the tale follow the romant and sexual misadventur of a poet-physician. write in the new york time, herbert mitgang call it a rare, old-fashion novel at onc lyric, symbol and medit. saramago, whose sens of literari freedom is evid in hi unconvent punctuat and conflict use of tens, sought a differ form of freedom in the stone raft, where he imagin the confus unleash when the iberian peninsula suddenli break free from the rest of europ and begin drift toward the new world and threaten to collid with the azor. to the delight of briton, gibraltar is left behind. unsurprisingli, the bitter satir, the gospel accord to jesu christ, prove controversi, with god shown as use the innoc human jesu to creat a religion that ha spawn violenc and intoler. when a lisbon juri pick the book as portugal' entri for a 1992 european literari prize, the country' conserv govern veto the choic as blasphem. it wa then that saramago decid to leav hi small, crowd apart in lisbon for the rel solitud of lanzarot. the histori of the sieg of lisbon, publish in the unit state last year, is a whimsic tale set in motion by the decis of a humbl proofread at a publish hous to insert the word not into a key passag in a standard histori of portug. with thi lunat creativ act, as edmund white put it in the new york time book review, he total derail the nation saga by affirm that the crusad did not in fact help liber 12th-centuri lisbon from moorish occup. white end hi juli 1997 review with a prescient remark. word ha it that saramago is overdu for a nobel prize, he note. no candid ha a better claim to last recognit than thi novelist. with the recent public of blind in the unit state, onli saramago' latest novel, todo os nome, or all the name still await translat into english. in the tradit of andr gide and julian green, though, he ha now embark on hi journal. the fourth volum of these caderno de lanzarot wa just publish in lisbon. saramago will receiv hi nobel prize, worth the equival of $967,500 thi year, at a ceremoni in stockholm on dec. 10. three american pharmacologist were award the nobel prize on monday for their surpris discoveri of how natur product of a ga, nitric oxid, can mediat a wide varieti of bodili action. those includ widen blood vessel, help to regul blood pressur, initi erect, battl infect, prevent format of blood clot and act as a signal molecul in the nervou system. the prize, for physiolog or medicin, went to dr. robert furchgott, 82, of the state univers of new york in brooklyn; dr. loui ignarro, 57, of the univers of california at lo angel, and dr. ferid murad, 62, of the univers of texa medic school in houston. the announc of a signific phase of the discoveri by two of monday' winner at a meet in 1986 elicit an avalanch of research activ in mani differ laboratori around the world, said the nobel committe at the karolinska institut in stockholm, which make the award. it citat said that the research had led to new treatment for treat heart and lung diseas, shock and impot. ignarro discov the principl that led to the use of viagra as an anti-impot drug, said dr. sten orreniu, a professor of toxicolog at the karolinska institut. nitric oxid start the process by which blood vessel in the peni widen to produc an erect. nitric oxid, a chemic rel of the anesthet ga nitrou oxid, is better known as a common air pollut form when nitrogen burn, such as in automobil exhaust fume. but scientist now know it is distribut wide in the bodi. the discoveri honor on monday were made larg dure the 1980 at a time when scientist knew that bacteria produc nitric oxid but did not think it wa import in anim and human. the award committe said that thi wa the first discoveri that a ga can act as a signal molecul in the organ. the discoveri wa startl becaus nitric oxid is total differ from ani other known signal molecul and so unstabl that it is convert to nitrat and nitrit within 10 second. recipi of the nobel prize, includ some who have lobbi for it for year, often profess surpris on learn of their award. thi year' winner were refreshingli candid. furchgott said he had plan to sleep late on monday, a holiday, but wa awaken at 5:30 at hi home in hewlett, ny. he said that he knew that previou nobel prize winner had nomin him for the award, but that he still wa somewhat surpris to receiv it. i guess i had some good friend vote, furchgott said. he said he could not get back to sleep. murad said he had ponder the odd and thought that mayb i could win the prize, if not now mayb in a coupl of year. he describ the award as the culmin of a career and said that when it happen, it' incred. ignarro wa travel in itali. dr. gerald levey, the dean of ucla, said we actual anticip thi day for about four year now. the three 1998 winner never work togeth, but we talk a lot of shop talk at meet, furchgott said. dr. valentin fuster, the presid of the american heart associ and the head of cardiolog at mt. sinai hospit in manhattan, said that the discoveri of nitric oxid and it function is one of the most import in the histori of cardiovascular medicin. doctor have learn from the prize-win research that in heart diseas, the endothelium, or inner line of arteri, make less nitric oxid. drug like nitroglycerin, howev, can help replenish store of nitric oxid. now, drug compani are tri to develop more power heart drug base on newer knowledg of nitric oxide' role as a signal molecul. research have also learn that nitric oxid produc in the endothelium rapidli spread through cell membran to the underli muscl cell in arteri. then it can shut off muscl contract in the arteri, thu widen them and reduc blood pressur. inhal of nitric oxid ga ha save the live of some peopl with certain lung diseas, particularli infant who have develop danger high pulmonari blood pressur. but regul the amount of nitric oxygen inhal is critic becaus too much can be lethal. nitric oxid play a harm role in the collaps of the circulatori system, or shock, result from overwhelm microbi infect. bacteria can releas product that caus white blood cell to releas enorm amount of nitric oxid. as a result, blood pressur drop. scientist are tri to develop drug that can block product of nitric oxid in such infect. white blood cell also play a role in attack cancer cell. the ga can also induc a type of program cell death known as apoptosi. scientist are studi nitric oxide' effect on the immun system to stop the growth of cancer. they are also explor nitric oxide' possibl role in regul bodi temperatur. doctor are measur the product of nitric oxid in the lung and intestin to diagnos a number of ailment, includ asthma and coliti, and are studi it role in menstruat. nitric oxid form in nerv cell spread rapidli in all direct to activ cell in the vicin and influenc mani function, like behavior and the mobil of the intestin tract. nitric oxid is also be studi for it role in smell and memori. nitric oxide' role is still unfolding; scientist have written thousand of scientif paper about it in recent year and have start a journal, nitric oxid. the nobel committe cite furchgott for perform in 1980 an ingeni experi that show that a drug, acetylcholin, widen blood vessel onli if the inner layer, or endothelium, wa intact. furchgott conclud that blood vessel widen becaus the endotheli cell produc a signal molecul that he call edrf, for endothelium-deriv relax factor, which relax smooth muscl cell in blood vessel. furchgott' find led to a quest to identifi the factor, the citat said. (option trim can begin here) the citat did not refer to an accid in furchgott' laboratori that play a major role in hi discoveri. in 1995, in the annual review of pharmacolog and toxicolog, furchgott wrote that on may 5, 1978, in the first of a seri of plan experi on arteri from a rabbit, a technician did not follow direct correctli. the technician perform one step of the experi befor instead of after he wa suppos to wash out a drug use in an earlier phase of the experi. furchgott expect that the arteri would contract. instead, they relax. it wa the first time he had seen the drug under studi produc such a reaction, and he use the insight to plan addit experi. furchgott omit the technician' name in that paper and in anoth in 1996 in the journal of the american medic associ. on monday, he said david davidson wa the technician. (option trim end here) the committe cite ignarro for conclud in 1986, from a brilliant seri of analys conduct independ of furchgott, that edrf wa ident to nitric oxid. furchgott said he and ignarro made the announc at the same symposium in 1986 at the mayo clinic in rochest, minn., but the paper were not publish until 1998. murad wa cite for work conduct over the year while he work at the univers of virginia in charlottesvil, stanford univers in palo alto, calif., and abbott laboratori in illinoi. murad said he felt fortun to have heard furchgott report hi earli work on edrf in 1980. murad show that a ga could regul import cellular function and studi how nitroglycerin and relat heart drug led to the releas of nitric oxid. (option trim can begin here) in hi earli train at case western reserv univers in cleveland, murad work in the laboratori of dr. theodor rall, who also train anoth nobel prize winner, dr. alfr gilman of the univers of texa southwestern in dalla. gilman said in an interview that he believ rall, now retir and live in charlottesvil, va., wa the first scientist to have train two nobel prize winner. in addit, rall work with dr. earl sutherland, who also won a nobel prize. in hi earli reseach year, murad work on a chemic known as cyclic guanosin monophosph, which later turn out to be critic in the nitric oxid stori. murad' traine refer to the earli work as dump experi becaus all they could do in the laboratori at the time wa crude add variou hormon and agent to slice of tissu, cell cultur. it took year to develop the more refin techniqu that led to the understand of nitric oxide' mani role in the bodi. but for mani year, most of the scientif commun wa skeptic of the abil of a free radic like nitric oxid to activ an enzym, murad said in 1996 when he and furchgott share the albert lasker basic medic research award. (option trim end here) the nobel prize were creat by the will of alfr nobel, whose invent of dynamit involv the use of nitroglycerin. the award committe note an odd twist to thi year' award. when nobel develop chest pain from heart diseas, it said, he refus to take the nitroglycerin hi doctor prescrib becaus he knew it caus headach. nobel dismiss nitroglycerine' benefit in the relief of chest pain. nobel die in 1896. the prize that the three scientist will share is now worth $938,000. when alfr nobel wrote the direct establish a literatur prize in hi name, he chose an unclear word and scratch out a few letter. question about the prize have engag and piqu the literari world ever sinc. a new chapter in the mysteri will be written thursday, when the swedish academi announc thi year' winner of the world' most prestigi prize for writer. the prize focus intens media attent on the swedish capit and the clamor of journalist gener drown out a question: whi doe the world care so much about the literari choic of a hand of peopl in a quiet and remot countri? doe the nobel prize realli recogn the best? when ask that question, swedish academi perman secretari sture allen smile and said look at the list of prizewinn! the answer obscur as much as it clarifi. on one hand, the nobel prize ha recogn world-renown writer such as isaac bashevi singer and brought little-known wonder to light, such as wislawa szymborska. but the prize arguabl also ha honor the mediocr, heap attent on those who would have been more fairli serv by obscur. among them is the winner of the first prize in 1901, sulli prudhomm. that choic wa denounc by sweden' lead literari light, august strindberg, and a group of swede sent a letter to leo tolstoy apolog for the academy' slight in not choos him. argument over the academy' choic are inevit, consid the instruct they were given. nobel' will say the prize should recogn literatur that work in an ideal direct. what, exactli, he meant by ideal** is unclear and the academy' choic have reflect the confus. the academi ha chosen to interpret the word to appli to work rang from the good-heart charm of szymborska' poetri to the crush hopeless of samuel beckett' write. when nobel wrote the word ideal in swedish idealisk** he superimpos the last coupl of letter over previou one. allen wa so curiou to understand nobel' thought that he engag a forens expert to tri to find out what the earlier letter were. the expert succeed to a point. he found that the first word nobel wrote wa idealirad, a word that doesn't exist. despit the inclar around the edg, allen said he is confid that the academy' choic bolster nobel' core idea that literatur would be the basi for some kind of progress. about thi year' choic, he won't say more than that: the academi is bound to keep it deliber secret. but observ love to specul on who might win, even who' on the shortlist for the prize, thi year worth 7.6 million kronor (about dlr 974,000). name that freuqent come up in the guess includ vs. naipaul, china' bei dao and pa kin, american poet john ashberi, and jose saramago of portug. a day after win the nobel prize for literatur, portugues novelist jose saramago insist that while he wa delight to win the award, it could just as easili have gone to mani other portugues writer. i'm not the onli one who deserv it, said the first portuguese-languag author to obtain the prestigi award. there have been other portugus author, like fernando pessoa, whose work would justifi 1,000 nobel speak at a pack press cofer in madrid, saramago joke about how he heard he had won the prize from german air hostess at frankfurt airport as he wait for a flight home to spain' canari island. the news left the 75-year-old writer no choic but to leav the airport and return to the city' book fair to meet the press and public. at that moment i wa over the moon and return to the book fair the onli thing i wa worri about wa that the whole thing wa an error, said saramago. dismiss the vatican paper' disapprov thursday of hi achiev, saramago, a known atheist, quip that he wa awar that the pope had been among the juri, i wouldn't have won the prize. the vatican is easili upset, said saramago, i think that the vatican should keep it mind on it prayer and leav peopl alon. meanwhil in portug, where saramago is schedul to arriv on tuesday, the delight at the swedish academy' award for saramago wa reflect in the daili paper, with even the country' three daili sport paper ampl space to the event. the two lead daili, publico and diario de noticia, gave over their entir front page to saramago. lisbon citi hall rush out poster say congratul jose saramago which were hung up around the capit dure the night. saramago wa born into a poor, illiter famili in azinhaga, a small town near lisbon. he never finish univers but continu to studi part-tim while support himself as a metalwork. noth in my life would have led one to think i'd win the nobel prize, said saramago. i wasn't born to win the nobel. i didn't have my own book until i wa 18. hi first novel, publish in 1947 terra do pecado, or countri of sin wa a tale of peasant in moral crisi. for the next 18 year, saramago, a communist who oppos the 41-year conserv dictatorship of antonio salazar, publish onli a few travel and poetri book while he work as a journalist. he return to fiction onli after salazar' regim wa toppl by a militari upris in 1974. sinc the 1980, hi work have been translat into more than 20 languag. regard the futur, saramago said the book he is current work on will be call the cavern and deal with a modern version of myth of plato and the cave. three american research on monday won the nobel medicin prize for discov how nitric oxid act as a signal molecul in the cardiovascular system, a breakthrough with applic rang from harden of the arteri to impot. the prestigi prize went to robert f. furchgott, loui j. ignarro and ferid murad. furchgott is a pharmacologist at the state univers of new york in brooklyn, ignarro is at univers of california-lo angel and murad is at the univers of texa medic school in houston. the citat by the karolinska institut said it wa a senat that the simpl, common air pollut (nitric oxide), which is form when nitrogen burn . could exert import function in the organ. becaus of the research, we know today that nitric oxid act as a signal molecul in the nervou system, as a weapon against infect and as a regul of blood pressur. signal transmiss by a ga that is produc by one cell, penetr through membran and regul the function of anoth cell repres an entir new principl, the citat said. understand how nitric oxid transmit the signal ha spark research on a wide rang of new drug, includ those that can be use in the treatment of heart problem, artherosclerosi, shock and impot. the prize amount of 7.6 million kronor (dlr 978,000) is divid equal among the three. last year, the prize went to stanley b. prusin

that he genuin intend to bring home a peac agreement. who is the right wing now if sharon is in the foreign ministri and negoti with the palestinian? ask uzi benziman, an editori board member of the newspap haaretz and author of a critic biographi of sharon. it will be just the settler and some real hard-lin who don't compris more than 15 percent of public opinion. so it' realli quit an intellig move, suggest that netanyahu mean busi in tri to get an agreement. but the palestinian took the news hard, and read it differ. i think it' a clear-cut messag from bibi, saeb erekat, a lead negoti for the palestinian, said, use netanyahu' nicknam. i imagin peopl will tri to explain netanyahu' intent as tri to get the support of the right. what he is tri to do is make peac with the right wing at the expens of make peac with us. it mean he want to continu on the path of non-negoti, becaus he want to continu to be prime minist at ani cost. sharon declin to be interview friday becaus hi appoint must still be approv by the cabinet on tuesday, an approv that is expect. an aid, raanan gisin, said sharon accept the posit so that he could stem the tide of danger develop and contribut to fight the risk face israel. a retir gener who fought in everi isra war, sharon, 70, is a lead figur of the likud parti who ha done much battl with the likud prime minist. at the most recent parti convent, he said that netanyahu didn't know hi right hand from hi left, which the prime minist dismiss friday as a comment made in the height of polit argument. and when netanyahu first form hi cabinet in 1996, the fact that he did not give sharon a senior posit caus an 11th-hour crisi befor the swearing-in ceremoni. sharon retreat to hi famili farm in the negev, and david levi, who had been name foreign minist, said he would not serv unless sharon wa given a post. netanyahu then creat a cabinet job, the minist of infrastructur, especi for sharon. levi resign in januari after a lengthi power struggl with the prime minist, and sinc then netanyahu ha been serv as hi own foreign minist. sharon, a member of the old guard, ha a complic polit past, highlight by a string of militari victori, and checker, to mani, by hi indirect role, as defens minist, in the lebanes christian phalangist massacr of unarm civilian in the sabra and shatila refuge camp in lebanon in 1982. mani isra, even those who despis hi polit, see him as a strong, experienc figur who know hi mind and who is capabl of be moder when he ha power. friday afternoon, the right-w polit establish nearli univers applaud the appoint. uzi landau, who is a likud hard-lin, said he wa reliev to hear confirm what ha been a rumor for week. i feel more safe about the negoti if minist sharon is directli involv, said landau, who head the parliament' secur and foreign affair committe. undoubtedli it will facilit the situat for the prime minist to show the right that arik sharon is identifi with the program, so therefor they can live with it. right befor the announc wa made, leader of the nation religi parti, who had threaten to bring down the govern, chang their comb tone. they emerg mollifi from meet with netanyahu late thursday, say they would leav the govern intact. still, they would not connect their chang of heart to the nomin of sharon. appoint sharon is a polit step we like veri much, said shaul yahalom, the minist of transport and a leader of the nation religi parti. but it will have no effect on how we see the peac agreement. our concern there is on whether ani of the 160 jewish settlement are endang. the appoint of sharon come against a backdrop of violenc that ha erupt thi week. friday, a 19-year-old isra soldier, michal adato, wa stab to death by a palestinian man as she got off a bu in her hometown, the settlement of tomer in the jordan valley. netanyahu report that he had receiv a sympathi note from arafat, who condemn the attack. also friday, in the continu clash between palestinian youth and soldier in the divid citi of hebron, 32 palestinian were lightli injur by rubber bullet after the funer of a palestinian protest shot dead on thursday. after netanyahu made the announc friday, an isra report introduc a question by state that netanyahu had diminish the polit threat from the right wing by appoint sharon. are you will to sign on that? netanyahu said. i do not know that. i do know one thing that when you are depend on the vote of one or two peopl you can never know what will be. he wa refer to hi razor-thin major in parliament which some analyst perceiv to be hi key motiv in appoint sharon. more than anyth els, thi reflect the polit weak of netanyahu, said yaron ezrahi, a lead intellectu and critic of the prime minist. he ha recogn that the next redeploy is inevit if he doesn't want to be seen as contribut to the wave of polit violenc that would follow a failur. but he doesn't have the domest polit power to carri out the big decis on hi own. the new york time said in an editori on saturday, oct. 10: just day befor head to the unit state for critic negoti with palestinian leader, prime minist benjamin netanyahu jolt the middl east peac effort with the appoint of ariel sharon as isra foreign minist. the most optimist read is that sharon, long an implac foe of the palestinian, is prepar to make peac with them and then sell it to the isra who are most oppos. unfortun, he is also capabl of wreck the entir peac effort. much will depend on whether netanyahu can control hi strong-wil aid, a goal that ha elud other isra leader. like a polit typhoon, sharon ha roar across isra life for better than three decad as a brilliant militari command, a reckless defens minist and an ardent conserv, often leav destruct in hi wake. he still bear the burden of hi role in the massacr of hundr of palestinian by christian militiamen in lebanon in 1982. an isra inquiri found he wa indirectli respons for the kill at the sabra and shatila refuge camp. as a leader of the most conserv wing of the likud parti, sharon can help netanyahu hold togeth hi shaki cabinet dure potenti decis negoti with yasser arafat, the palestinian leader. that will be fine if sharon is will to play a construct role in the peac talk himself. but such behavior is not like to be the first impuls of a man who ha famous said he would never shake hand with arafat. sinc netanyahu ha design sharon as hi chief negoti, the new foreign minist will soon have the opportun to act more respons. the first order of busi when the two side get togeth next week outsid washington is to wrap up negoti over the further withdraw of isra forc from the west bank coupl with secur guarante from the palestinian. sharon can show statesmanship by help netanyahu close thi deal, even though it is oppos by the isra settler whose caus sharon ha long champion. success in these talk would clear the way for the last and most difficult negoti about a perman settlement, includ the shape and statu of a palestinian state and the futur of jerusalem. if sharon ever hope to overcom the shame of sabra and shatila, he must becom a forc for peac in the middl east. brief biographi of ariel sharon, name israel' foreign

","Ariel Sharon was named Israeli foreign minister just weeks before a scheduled peace summit in the US, aimed at negotiating an Israeli withdrawal from 13% of the West Bank.Arabs reacted strongly and said the hard-line, right-wing, warrior and former defense minister would kill any progress for a settlement in the mid-East.Many blame Sharon for a 1982 massacre of Palestinian civilians at refugee camps in Lebanon.Others believed his appointment was an effort to placate the far right and gain their support for the Netanyahu government and the concessions necessary for the peace process.Sharon vowed not to shake Yasser Arafat's hand.","Prior to his appointment as foreign minister by Israeli Prime Minister Natanyahu in 1998, seasoned warrior Ariel Sharon announced that if appointed, he would not shake hands with Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat.The remark fit Sharon's long history of unyielding bellicosity towards Palestine.When he was appointed some thought that Netanyahu was placating Israel's far right wing while striving for peace.Others saw it as a move to scuttle the peace effort.Arab commentary deemed the appointment ""tantamount to disaster"" and ""the bullet of mercy"" to the peace process.Peace talks in the U.S. were in the offing with the outcome in doubt.","Appointment of Ariel Sharon as Foreign Minister by PM Netanyahu does not bode well for the peace process.His appointment is surprising in that the two have differed on withdrawal from Palestinian territory and is seen as an effort to placate the right.Sharon, 70, is an unapologetic warrior on the battlefield and in partisan politics.He brings heavy baggage: right-wing intransigence and responsibility for failing to prevent the killings of 460 unarmed Palestinians in refugee camps during the Lebanon incursion.Sharon has said that he will not shake Arafat's hand and his appointment is seen as a ""bullet of mercy"" for the Middle East peace process.","In a move widely viewed as an effort to placate the far right as he moves to withdraw from more West Bank land, Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu named hardliner Ariel Sharon foreign minister and chief peace negotiator.Sharon, a military leader with legendary victories in the 1967 and 1973 Mideast wars, is infamous in the Arab world as the defense minister in the 1982 invasion of Lebanon during which Lebanese Christian militiamen, Israeli allies, slaughtered hundreds of unarmed Palestinians.His appointment as lead negotiator was denounced as a ""disaster"" in the Lebanese press and ""a bullet of mercy to the peace process"" in a Syrian paper."

45,"whether or not the talk between exxon and mobil lead to a merger or some other busi combin, america' econom histori is alreadi be rewritten. in energi as in busi like financi servic, telecommun and automobil, global competit and technolog have made unthink combin practic, even necessari. oil compani like exxon corp. and mobil corp. have an addit pressur, one unthink less than two decad ago. crude oil price have fallen sharpli, plung 40 percent just thi year to level, adjust for inflat, not seen sinc befor the first oil embargo 25 year ago. as such, the oil compani, have spent year cut their cost, are desper for further save in order to continu oper profit with such low price. exxon and mobil are the two largest, strongest competitor to emerg from the nation' most famou antitrust case, the 1911 breakup of john d. rockefeller' standard oil trust. now they face a royal dutch/shel group that is larger than either of them. they will also confront a british petroleum plc made far more potent in the unit state by it agreement thi summer to buy amoco corp. for $48.2 billion. industri execut say further deal on thi scale are inevit. execut at both compani did not return call thursday for comment on the talk, and it wa unclear thursday night what the outcom might be. but if exxon and mobil agre to becom one, antitrust regul are like to be cautiou about put back togeth much of what they long ago broke apart. even so, most oil industri analyst contend that improv effici from combin giant energi compani would do more to lower cost than the more concentr ownership of ga station and refineri would do to rais them. the ultim beneficiari of all thi will be the consum, said daniel yergin, the chairman of cambridg energi research associ. if exxon and mobil ultim do combin, the cost could prove heaviest for energi industri employe. analyst say that of the about 80,000 global employe at exxon, base in irv, texa, and the more than 40,000 at mobil, in fairfax, va., thousand would be like to lose their job. exxon, with lee r. raymond, and mobil, with lucio a. noto, both have chief execut who have been preoccupi with the humbl accommod that low oil price have made necessari. oil compani were everybody' favorit target dure the trust-bust era earli thi centuri and again dure the arab oil embargo of the 1970. now they seem especi vulner as demand weaken in much of the world, especi in econom troubl asia, weigh further on alreadi depress price. they'r piti, helpless giant, said ronald chernow, the author of titan, a biographi of john d. rockefel, standard oil' founder. as such, these giant are compel to continu cut cost and spread the risk of their huge, expens intern project that are need to develop oil reserv need for the next centuri. mobil, with $58.4 billion in sale last year, might seem larg enough to undertak anyth. but in compet for right to develop huge natur ga field in turkmenistan, a former soviet republ, mobil wa unabl to match shell' offer to build a pipelin for $1 billion or more. oil compani have decid that they cannot count on a rebound in oil price to reviv their fortun ani time soon. earlier thi month, the energi depart predict that the collaps of asian demand would continu to depress oil price for nearli a decad, and by as much as $5.50 a barrel in the year 2000. and thursday, the organ of petroleum export countri put off until march ani decis on extend their oil product cutback to prop up price. moreov, improv technolog for explor and product and the open of new region to develop have ad to the alreadi huge suppli of oil that is on hand now. in respons, mani energi compani have alreadi begun a new wave of cutback in their staff and oper. to further reduc cost, compani like mobil are form partnership that stop short of full merger. two year ago, mobil agre to combin it european refin and market oper with british petroleum', result in annual save of about $500 million. shell and texaco then form a refin partnership in the unit state. in the face of these partnership, said ami jaff, an energi analyst with the jame a. baker iii institut for public polici in houston, if you'r an exxon, how do you compet? though mobil and exxon might have high concentr of ga station in certain area of the unit state, analyst say they have far more competit at the pump than befor oil price collaps in the 1980. thousand of conveni store now also sell gasolin produc by a varieti of refin compani, and foreign nation oil compani, like venezuela', sell their suppli through acquir compani like citgo. under noto, mobil ha been hunt for way of becom larg and lean enough to surviv. he took the lead in the deal with british petroleum and ha consid buy up smaller compani. and he ha made it clear that corpor or person pride would never block a deal. in the european agreement with british petroleum, mobil' red fli hors have come down from the front of mani ga station, while the green and yellow bp logo have gone up. as major oil compani team up, said john hervey, an analyst with donaldson lufkin &amp; jenrett, if the price is right, ego will not get in the way. in the past, mobil reportedli had further talk with british petroleum about other combin, as well as talk with amoco about form an american refin ventur. the compani wa also interest in conoco inc. when dupont co. began look to divest itself of that oil and ga busi. but no deal were reach. more recent, there wa specul on wall street that mobil had been talk with chevron corp. british petroleum purchas of amoco put more pressur on noto to seek a deal, hervey said. i don't think thi whole thing would have start if british petroleum had not pull the trigger, he said. the british petroleum-amoco deal, progress quickli sinc the august announc toward an expect $2 billion in annual save, ha put even compani as larg as exxon on the spot. there, raymond ha so far concentr more on make hi oper more effici than on find alli. though royal dutch/shell' financi resourc are greater than exxon', some analyst say exxon still ha the size and sound to absorb a compani of mobil' size. onli the largest oil compani can afford to take advantag of today' best opportun. find new field in the deep water off the coast of west africa or in the gulf of mexico can requir platform cost $1 billion or more. produc oil in the state of the former soviet union ha taken more time and money than mani investor anticip. in septemb, noto wa among the american execut invit by a saudi leader visit washington to greatli step up invest in hi countri, too. noto spent from 1977 to 1985 in saudi arabia himself, build up mobil oper includ a huge refineri. but ani new partnership with the saudi might requir both mobil' connect and exxon' capit. back when standard oil organ it oper by state, exxon wa standard oil of new jersey, while mobil wa standard oil of new york. even after the standard oil monopoli wa broken up, they remain for sever year in the same build in manhattan. chernow, the rockefel biograph, note that two piec of the standard oil trust are alreadi like to be unit. british petroleum bought standard oil of ohio in the 1970, and amoco wa onc standard oil of indiana. the break-up of standard oil and the result competit ha often been cite as a preced for the current antitrust action against microsoft. chernow see no reason whi allow an exxon acquisit of mobil to go through should suggest more lenienc for microsoft. exxon would not be obvious larger than it lead competitor, the way microsoft is, he said. in the energi busi today, he ad, there are other larg dinosaur that stalk that particular jungl. the board of exxon corp. and mobil corp. are expect to meet tuesday to consid a possibl merger agreement that would form the world' largest oil compani, a sourc close to the negoti said friday. the sourc, who spoke on condit of anonym, said the prospect were good for complet an agreement. exxon and mobil confirm friday that they were discuss way to combin. they caution, howev, that no agreement had been reach and there wa no assur they would reach one. the statement sent the stock of both compani surg, suggest investor believ the compani will combin. share of exxon, the biggest us. oil compani, rose $1.6875, or 2.3 percent, to $74375. share of mobil, the no. 2 us. oil compani, rose $7.625, or 9.7 percent, to $86. some analyst said that if the two giant reach an agreement, it wa like to be in the form of a takeov by exxon of mobil. exxon is far larger and financi stronger. analyst predict that there would be huge cut in duplic staff from both compani, which employ 122,700 peopl. adam sieminski, an oil analyst for bt alex. brown, said that the compani would probabl make cut to save about $3 billion to $5 billion a year. sieminski and other analyst said exxon would have to offer a premium of about 15 to 20 percent over it price prior to monday, when seriou specul of an exxon takeov of mobil first circul and sent mobil share up sharpli. they said the transact would probabl be an exchang of mobil share for exxon share. base on mobil' $75.25 share price a week ago, a takeov of the compani would be worth about $70 billion. the merger discuss come against a backdrop of particularli sever pressur on lucio noto, the chairman, presid and chief execut of mobil, to find new reserv of oil and natur ga and to keep big project profit at a time of a deep declin in crude oil price. thi is one of the most intellig chief execut in the busi and a man of consider abil but he inherit some seriou structur problem in hi compani, said j. robin west, the chairman of petroleum financ co., a consult group to the energi industri base in washington. he said that mobil' prime asset includ the arun natur ga field in indonesia, one of the largest in the world, which ha contribut up to one-third of mobil' profit for year but is begin to run down. the field, in product sinc 1977, suppli liquefi natur ga to japan and korea. although mobil under noto ha move quickli to cut cost and muscl it way into promis new area such as kazakhstan, where it is a partner in a joint ventur to develop the huge tengiz oil field, the payoff from such ventur is mani year away. other compani face similar strain. the challeng is to replac their crown jewel and grow in an increasingli competit environ, west said. noto ha not been shi about sit down with other compani such as british petroleum and amoco thi year to see if a combin made sens. although exxon chairman lee raymond head a much stronger and bigger compani than mobil, he ha not been immun to the strain on the global petroleum busi. those strain intensifi thi year when russia' econom collaps rais the risk of exxon' extens explor ventur in that countri. exxon ha also been more of a follow than a leader in huge project in the deep offshor field, where major find have been made near west africa and in the gulf of mexico. new that exxon and mobil, two giant in the energi patch, were in merger talk last week is the biggest sign yet that corpor marriag are back in vogu. even befor that combin came to light, deal-mak wa fast and furiou. on monday alon, $40.4 billion in corpor acquisit were either announc or declar immin. drive the resurg in merger is a roar stock market, the recognit by major corpor that it is get harder to increas revenu intern and grow confid among market player that the economi will not plung into a recess next year. there are also industry-specif issu, like low crude-oil price that are drive oil giant into one another' arm. but for investor, mega-marriag are not where the real money is to be made. rather, it is among smaller compani, whose still-depress stock price are lure bigger acquir with stock that again are near their peak. if exxon buy mobil at close to current price, deal thi month will have a total valu of more than $140 billion off from april' peak of $244 billion but three time the volum in septemb, when the stock market wa fall. which industri are like to wit the most merger? tom burnett, director of merger insight, an institut invest advisori firm in new york, say more deal are a certainti in energi, which is suffer from low crude-oil price. burnett also say health care execut are find it tougher than ever to lift earn. but smaller compani may be a better way to play the takeov game. charl laloggia, editor of the special situat investor newslett in potomac, md., said: some of the premium in high-profil merger aren't so great anymor. the valu are in small-cap stock. anoth reason is that deal involv smaller-cap candid are less like to incur the wrath of antitrust regul. laloggia reckon that the odd of pick takeov winner increas if an investor focus on compani alreadi partial own by anoth. in the energi sector, houston explor qualifi, he says; the oil and ga driller is 66 percent own by keyspan energi. he also believ more deal are immin among drug chain and supermarket. long drug store and drug emporium, he say, remain acquisit candid, though neither is control by anoth concern. in supermarket, laloggia like the great atlant &amp; pacif tea co., 55 percent own by tengelmann group of germani. anoth pick is smart and final, an oper of warehouse-styl store that is 55 percent own by the us. subsidiari of group casino, france' largest supermarket chain. both a&amp;p and smart and final are trade at just about book valu, laloggia said. takeov typic occur abov book valu. final, he recommend nation presto industri, a maker of housewar and electr applianc, which is trade near $39, close to it low for the year. the compani ha $30 a share in cash on it balanc sheet, no debt and a dividend yield of 5 percent. after last month' announc acquisit of rubbermaid by the newel co., laloggia think nation presto could find itself in an acquirer' cross-hair. it wa new high again for the standard &amp; poor' 500-stock and nasdaq composit index friday as anticip of a new wave of merger and a gener rush by investor to join the equiti rebound push stock up. oil stock led the way as investor soak up the news of continu talk between exxon and mobil on a

involv sun microsystem. at the same time, germany' deutsch bank and banker trust are schedul to formal announc their merger on monday. there is no question that the merger euphoria is the headlin, said hugh johnson, chief invest offic at the first albani corp. but the flow into mutual fund is also strong. exxon rose 1 11/16, to 74], while mobil jump 7|, to 86. chevron, reflect the bounc that

small recoveri in the face of stronger growth is probabl becaus new inflat number show that price are in check and analyst are still forecast that the economi will begin to slow down next year. mani analyst have note dure the eight-week stock market ralli, in which the nasdaq composit index jump 42 percent, that investor were buy again even though major financi problem around the world includ a slump asia, a weaken latin america and a troubl russia have not been resolv. johnson said he thought that investor, inspir by the feder reserve' three interest rate cut in two month and by the new stimulu packag in japan, assum that these problem will be solv. investor are look over the valley and they like what they see, he said. but he worri that the financi crisi, which began in thailand in juli 1997 and wa intensifi by the effect default of russia in august, will not go away quickli. it seem that in everi financi crisi, everybodi get the impress that the storm ha pass, johnson said. but it is never that easi. exxon corp. and mobil corp. have held discuss about combin their busi oper, a person involv in the talk said wednesday. it wa unclear wednesday whether talk were continu. if the compani were to merg, it would creat the largest us. compani in term of revenu. a possibl merger wa report separ by both the financi time of london and bloomberg new. the report talk between exxon, whose annual revenu exce that of wal-mart and gener electr, and mobil, the no. 2 us. oil compani, come as oil price have sunk to their lowest in almost 12 year. a combin compani would be bigger than royal dutch/shel group, the world' largest oil compani by revenu. financi term of the discuss could not be determin wednesday. neither exxon or mobil would comment. ani union would reunit two part of john d. rockefeller' standard oil trust, which wa broken up by the suprem court in 1911. exxon wa then known as standard oil of new jersey, and mobil consist of two companies: standard oil of new york and vacuum oil. both exxon, which ha a market valu of $176.7 billion, and mobil, which ha a market valu of $61.1 billion, have a histori of be fierc independ. both have alreadi cut back on staff and made themselv lean in order to surviv long period when oil price are low. but thi ha been a particularli unsettl year for the oil industri, and there is littl prospect that crude oil price will recov soon. consequ, chief execut of most oil compani have had to swallow their pride and look for suitabl partner. thi summer, british petroleum announc a $48.2 billion agreement to buy amoco corp., creat the world' third-largest oil compani and prompt analyst to predict even more widespread consolid. it show that megamerg are doabl, said adam sieminski, an analyst for bt alex. brown. he ad, howev, that a combin between exxon and mobil would not be an easi match becaus mobil ha been known for be a proud compani that ha said in the past that it would not want to merg. exxon, he ad, is a well run compani that like to grow it own busi. he ad that the head of both compani, lee raymond, the chairman of exxon, which is base in irv, texa, and lucio noto, the chairman, presid and chief execut of mobil, which is base in fairfax, va., are differ person. it will not be easi, he said of combin the two far-flung compani, which have vast network of refineri and ga station that overlap in the unit state and europ. if you offer enough money you can make anyth happen, he ad. both compani are under pressur to find new field of oil to help them surviv in the long term. like other oil compani, they had hope to quickli tap into the vast reserv of russia. even though they were prepar to spend billion, they have held back becaus of the polit and econom crisi in russia and great reluct by russian offici and oil compani to give up control of vast field. thu they have had to fall back on their own explor area such as the deep water in the gulf of mexico and west africa. such explor is veri expens, and even when larg field are found it often take platform cost $1 billion to bring the oil into product. oil price have been under pressur for more than a year, fall more than 40 percent from the $20-a-barrel level becaus of grow inventori of petroleum and declin asian demand caus by the econom crisi there. on wednesday, crude oil for januari deliveri fell 29 cent, or 2.6 percent, to $11.86 a barrel on the new york mercantil exchang, close to the 12-year low of $11.42 reach on june 15. member of the organ of petroleum export countri and some other oil-produc nation, notabl mexico, have tri to stem the price drop with pledg to cut back on product. but those pledg have not alway been honor, and ralli in the oil market thi year have proven short-liv. opec member on wednesday continu their discuss on extend their product cutback, and an agreement is expect as earli as thursday. in the spring, opec agre to reduc product by 2.6 million barrel a day, about 3 percent of the daili world suppli of 74 million barrel. the main result of that agreement appear to have been to keep oil price from fall below $10 a barrel. washington regul said wednesday that they had not been notifi about the exxon-mobil discuss. the feder trade commiss is still review british petroleum' pend purchas of amoco. an exxon-mobil deal would be certain to receiv sever months' worth of scrutini by the commiss, which would review how much of the industri such a merger would control. analyst and invest banker were split about the logic of the possibl merger. some point to difficulti that the compani could face if they were combin. if you ask me if exxon need to be bigger, the answer is probabl no, said garfield miller, presid of aegi energi advisor corp., a small independ invest bank base in new york. it is hard to say that there is anyth in particular to gain. in particular, miller said, the two compani have enorm similar in their domest refin and market busi. they realli do overlap quit a bit, he said. you realli do wonder what is the benefit of all that redund. anoth invest banker in the energi busi, speak on the condit of anonym, also question the rational for the discuss merger. when you look at the bp-amoco deal, you can ration it, the banker said. but none of those reason appli to an exxon-mobil deal. but ami jaff, an energi research analyst with the jame a. baker iii institut for public polici, said the combin of the two compani would be logic, in part becaus it would give them greater influenc in bid for project in middl eastern countri. thi is a deal that make sens, ms. jaff said. with thi combin compani, there is no project that would be too big. in addit, ms. jaff said, the merger would provid each compani with new oil and ga asset in area of the world where they had littl influenc. there are a lot of complimentari asset where they are not redund, she said. she said that exxon, for exampl, ha a strong presenc in angola, while mobil doe not. and mobil ha signific asset in the caspian sea and nigeria, where exxon is weak. exxon and mobil, the nation' two largest oil compani, confirm friday that they were discuss a possibl merger, and antitrust lawyer, industri analyst and govern offici predict that ani deal would requir the sale of import larg piec of such a new corpor behemoth. those divestitur would further reshap an industri alreadi undergo a broad transform becaus of the low price of oil. but the merger and other corpor combin are also begin to creat a new regulatori climat among antitrust offici, one that may prove particularli challeng to exxon and mobil. although the compani onli confirm that they were discuss the possibl of a merger, a person close to the discuss said the board of both exxon and mobil were expect to meet tuesday to consid an agreement. share of both surg on the new york stock exchang. oil explor and drill interest would not necessarili present antitrust problem in an exxon-mobil merger becaus competit in those area is brisk. but in retail and market oper, an exxon-mobil combin would be like ford merg with gener motor, macy' with gimbel, said stephen axinn, an antitrust lawyer in new york who repres texaco in it acquisit of getti more than a decad ago. in the unit state, the deal would come under the purview of the feder trade commiss, which under the clinton administr ha examin larg corpor merger with a vigor not seen sinc the 1970. the agenc ha block a number of propos merger, such as the $4 billion combin of stapl and offic depot, the two largest offic suppli discount, and two deal involv the four largest drug wholesal. on the other hand it ha approv other big merger, such as boeing' $14 billion acquisit of mcdonnel dougla. the agency' analysi of an exxon-mobil combin, a senior offici said friday, will turn on how it might resembl john d. rockefeller' standard oil trust befor it wa dismantl by the suprem court in 1911. the big antitrust issu is whether, by a merger or allianc, they will be abl to get the competit of one anoth off their back, particularli against the background of bp-amoco and shell-texaco, said eleanor m. fox, a professor at the new york univers school of law and an antitrust expert. it may be that we are look at a consolid on the world level that look like the consolid on the nation level 100 year ago. the feder trade commiss recent approv a signific joint ventur between shell and texaco after the ventur agre to sell a refineri and divest some retail oper in hawaii and california. it is also consid the propos $54 billion merger of british petroleum and amoco and will now have to re-examin that combin in light of the new talk between exxon and mobil. in the past, when there have been two merger involv the same industri, the govern ha consid them togeth in decid how to deal with them, said terri calvani, a former commission at the feder trade commiss whose client now includ chevron. but come in the aftermath of the shell-texaco and bp-amoco deal, a combin of exxon and mobil, which have significantli overlap retail and refineri busi in the unit state and europ, pose question that antitrust offici have not confront sinc the 1980. it' a real test case, said frederick leuffer, a senior energi analyst at bear stearn. if the ftc let thi one go through without major divest, then everyth would be fair game. whi couldn't gm merg with ford? while the 1911 breakup of standard oil is view by washington offici and industri execut as ancient histori, exxon and mobil have becom the domin rival in some retail and refin market, and in the product of lubric and petrochem. leuffer said he believ divestitur necessari in thi case could be so larg that they are deal-break. other analyst and lawyer, while disagre that the requir divestitur could kill the deal, said the compani would nonetheless have to shed signific oper and that they expect challeng to be rais by a broad spectrum of constitu, includ competitor, custom and state offici. these are not absolut obstacl, said john hervey, an analyst at donaldson lufkin &amp; jenrett. in the past, when two big oil compani have merg, aggress attorney gener from the state have almost alway becom involv in rais question becaus of the high visibl of the local ga station. when a state attorney gener drive by and see four station on a corner and two of them are mobil and exxon, they are certain to rais question, axinn said. exxon and mobil have signific concentr of retail and market concern in the northeast, the southwest and the west coast, where they also have big refin oper. becaus the two compani are involv in everyth from explor and ship to refin and retail, the mean of the deal for consum will take month for the regul to sort out. the regul examin such a transact would dissect each busi, determin whether it market is global, nation or more local, and determin whether the combin entiti ha too high a concentr of the busi in those area. expert agre that the regul are most like to permit exxon and mobil to keep their exploratori and oil product busi becaus those area are alreadi highli competit and a merger would not result in higher price. hervey said those market are alreadi so fragment that the combin market share of major american and european oil compani is onli 17 percent. they have been downsiz, cut back and re-engin. so when the 900 or so remain blue-collar worker here at mobil' largest domest refineri, out of about 1,500 a decad ago, heard last week that their compani wa discuss a possibl merger with exxon, it wa like a siren warn them that an alreadi suspect valv might be about to blow. i think it' a terribl thing, said dick mabri, a refineri oper, as he emerg in the plant' artifici twilight from the main gate after hi 12-hour shift end at 4:30 on sunday morn. he stop to rub eye rim with red, but on thi topic hi bedtim could be delay. it' a reviv of the standard oil compani. it' go to put 20 or 30 thousand peopl out of work. i think the justic depart should step in and stop it. ernest lewi, whose overal bore a big e patch appropri to hi scale, ad hi uh-huh'. the latest evid of where thing were head hulk right nearbi, he said, glanc over at a new power plant like to be oper by an outsid compani without the union that now man the refinery' gener. but if the mobil corp. ha to be sold, lewi said, note the gain in hi compani stock hold, a buyer as solid and larg as the exxon corp. might be the least of all evil. if we merg with chevron, we'd be moron, he ad. a grow american economi that can make a billionair out of someon with an unproven idea for internet market is still slough off worker in older industri, in petroleum as much as ani. those here point to the tote board by the beaumont plant' brick headquart, that they say show they have alreadi handl 171 million barrel out of 130 million plan for the full year. but the number that matter even more are the one like 89.9, 88.9, even 81.9, on nearbi ga station the lowest price, after inflat, sinc the depress. which is whi mobil and exxon are consid combin into the world' largest oil compani. some peopl close to the talk caution that no deal would be consid by their board until at least tuesday, mayb wednesday. and that is whi, begin last wednesday even, the phone at the home of jimmi herrington, the presid of the oil, chemic and atom worker local 4-243 rang without stop. no, he didn't know about that merger talk on televis, said herrington, who also work full-tim produc lubric. he had ask some mobil manag, in a meet earlier thi month, about all the rumor, but they said they had heard noth. oil industri analyst say that the first target of a combin company' effort to cut billion of dollar in annual cost would be the offic staff and the profession, like geologist and engin, in the field. one company' account could almost do the work for two. but the crew here fulli expect that an exxon or ani other buyer would ask yet again whether the refineri could turn more crude oil into gasolin, motor oil and other product with even fewer peopl. union leader rais the prospect that exxon would have to sell the refineri. antitrust regul, they say, are bound to notic that exxon ha refineri an hour' drive in one direct and three hour in the other, along a gulf of mexico crescent that form the petrochem industry' home. the beaumont plant, a steam, hum chemistri set line the nech river off the gulf, ha becom the prime provid of livelihood here sinc it wa built almost under the spray of the nearbi spindletop gusher. with mount overtim that can stretch a shift to 16 hour or more, worker regularli make $55,000 or $65,000 a year. peopl go there to retir there, herrington said, as he drove around the plant' fenc peripheri. lewi, in hi 17th year, is a third-gener employe. but hi nephew labor here too is the except. the worker stream to and from the plant befor dawn are mostli bald or go gray, a sign that for a full gener the refineri ha been more concern about how to get rid of worker than how to attract them. the cutback have, so far, come through attrit, with retir often encourag by incent. but the plywood sheet cover the window of most of the fast food place and ga station around herrington' union hall advertis that the best time are long gone. hi member chafe at the expert who come in from wall street to question the justif for everi person' job. in tire and danger task, they question the elimin of most relief labor in favor of cover vacat and sick with overtim (although some like the extra pay, and they say the plant ha becom safer over the years). they complain about the grow number of outsid contractor take over formerli union task. but with mani worker choos to invest at least some retir save in mobil stock, a 1990 etho is gain. some share credit with the plant' manag for the effici measur they agre are necessari for true job secur. some take the attitud that everi compani is alway for sale. they will not be too concern about what we feel about it, said sam salim, one of the electr plant worker whose futur is uncertain. but if they fork out $60 billion? i'd look it over. with most mobil execut say as littl as possibl for now, call on sunday to the local plant manag and a compani spokesman did not elicit a peep. union leader, howev, are alreadi squawk. i don't believ creat new monopoli is the way to prop up the industri, said robert wage, a former refineri oper himself and now the union' presid, by telephon saturday. nevertheless, with admir foresight the union negoti a claus in last november' three-year contract extens guarante that ani compani buyer would have to keep to it term. mani member, who typic came to work after high school, are alreadi mold the oil companies' latest exploit into case studi fit for rapaci mba'. they'r the biggest, said bobbi whisneant, an assist oper in the gasolin and lubric oil unit, refer to exxon. he wa come, earli on sunday morn, through a plant gate whose white canopi seem borrow from a self-servic station. so they go buy the second biggest. that' one way to get rid of the competit. i just hope it' not someth like the 80 buy compani and scrap them. or someth like the robber baron era a centuri befor, said mabri, anoth oper. didn't the teacher teach us all through school that the standard oil compani would never come back? rememb that? he said, look to hi friend, lewi, the big e, for agreement. but i better shut up. i still work for mobil. use to, lewi said. exxon corp. and mobil corp. have held discuss about combin their busi oper, a person involv in the talk said wednesday. it wa unclear wednesday whether talk were continu. if the compani were to merg, it would creat the largest us. compani in term of revenu. a possibl merger wa report separ by both the financi time of london and bloomberg new. the report talk between exxon, whose annual revenu exce that of gener electr co., and mobil, the no. 2 us. oil compani, came as oil

and mobil ha signific asset in the caspian sea and nigeria, where exxon is weak. time are tough in the oil patch. still, it boggl the mind to accept the notion that hardship is drive profit big oil to either merg, as british petroleum and amoco have alreadi agre to do, or at least to consid the prospect, as exxon and mobil are do. still, big oil and small oil are get squeez by low petroleum price and the high capit cost of explor. given the exot local of the most promis, untap field, it seem unlik that explor will get cheaper. and with west texa crude trade at around $12 a barrel, it seem a safe bet oil that won't be sell for $100 a barrel by the turn of the centuri a price some analyst in the earli 1980 were predict it would reach. philip k. verleg jr., publish of petroleum econom monthli and a senior advis to the brattl group, a cambridg, mass., consult firm, spent some time late last week talk about mobil, exxon and the chang dynam of the oil busi. follow are excerpt from the conversation: q. (italics)ther is a lot of focu on the antitrust aspect of an exxon-mobil deal. do you see ani problems?(end ital) a. let me say right off that i don't think thi is a done deal. i think it is far from that. but if it were to happen, i don't see mani problem. bp amoco is the perfect end-to-end merger, one in which there is littl or no overlap with the compani you are merg with. exxon-mobil come close. the first issu is competit in local market. the onli possibl problem area there is on the west coast, but both compani are pretti small player there. if there is a reason thi merger might get extra attent, it will be becaus exxon and mobil have not been terribl friendli toward either the clinton administration' or the european union' posit on global warm. q. (italics)whi are you skeptic about the deal?(end ital) a. well, mobil ha been tri to get bigger. they had talk with amoco. they want to buy conoco. but i don't understand where lucio noto, mobil' chief execut, fit into thi. that could be an impedi to an agreement, becaus in a merger i don't think he ha a place, and he ha been a veri strong leader. q. (italics)mobil is the country' second-biggest oil compani, behind exxon. whi do they need to get bigger?(end ital) a. in the first decad of the next centuri, the realli big explor opportun will be veri capit intens, and onli compani with the deepest pocket will be abl to stay in the game: royal dutch, exxon and bp amoco. compani of mobil' size are probabl margin player. q. (italics)that suggest mobil ha been harder hit than exxon by the downturn in prices.(end ital) a. from 1988 to 1996, exxon' explor and product expenditur rose 8 percent. mobil' rose 14 percent. but mobil' expenditur were much more sensit to price elast of oil than exxon'. they were push the envelop, and when price fell they had to cut back. exxon ha tri to build a veri larg presenc systemat, without pay much attent to month-to-month or even year-to-year fluctuat in oil price. they are brutal effici. q. (italics)earli thi month the energi depart said oil price would stay soft for nearli a decad. do you agree?(end ital) a. you know, everi time i see forecast that go out that far i want to go out and buy stock in oil compani. i think we are go to see low oil price for six month to a year. it is conceiv we could go into the next centuri with oil at $5 a barrel, depend on what happen to the world economi. dure that period, we are go to see a substanti reduct in invest in explor and product, lead to a reduct in suppli come out of non-opec countri. that will strengthen the hand of the opec countri. and when the asian economi start grow again that will lead to a good deal higher oil price, say $20 a barrel, in the next 18 month. q. (italics)th number of oil compani is go to shrink in come year, regardless, isn't it?(end ital) a. we are probabl head toward a world in which there are no more than five or six big oil compani, possibl eight. there is realli no preced for have as mani big player as we have in the oil busi in thi modern societi. q. (italics)do you think oil stock are a good investment?(end ital) a. i think oil compani are still a worthwhil invest, but it is not a place where an investor should plan on make money over the next 9 to 12 month. and it is an area where investor need to be care, becaus in that period there will be a good deal of consolid among smaller compani. time are tough in the oil patch. still, it boggl the mind to accept the notion that hardship is drive profit big oil to either merg, as british petroleum and amoco have alreadi agre to do, or at least to consid the prospect, as exxon and mobil are do. oil compani of all stripe are get squeez by low petroleum price and the high capit cost of explor. given the exot local of the most promis untap field, it seem unlik that explor will get cheaper. and with west texa crude trade at around $12 a barrel, it seem a safe bet that oil won't be sell for $100 a barrel by the turn of the centuri someth analyst were predict dure the oil price run-up of the earli 1980. philip verleg jr., publish of petroleum econom monthli and a senior advis to the brattl group, a cambridg, mass., consult firm, spent some time late last week talk about mobil, exxon and the chang dynam of the oil busi. follow are excerpt from the conversation: q. there is a lot of focu on the antitrust aspect of an exxon-mobil deal. do you see ani problem? a. let me say right off that i don't think thi is a done deal. i think it is far from that. but if it were to happen, i don't see mani problem. bp amoco is the perfect end-to-end merger, one in which there is littl or no overlap with the compani you are merg with. exxon-mobil come close. the first issu is competit in local market. the onli possibl problem area there is on the west coast, but both compani are pretti small player there. if there is a reason thi merger might get extra attent, it will be becaus exxon and mobil have not been terribl friendli toward either the clinton administration' or the european union' posit on global warm. q. whi are you skeptic about the deal? a. well, mobil ha been tri to get bigger. they had talk with amoco. they want to buy conoco. but i don't understand where lucio noto, mobil' chief execut, fit into thi. that could be an impedi to an agreement, becaus in a merger i don't think he ha a place, and he ha been a veri strong leader. q. mobil is the country' second-biggest oil compani, behind exxon. whi do they need to get bigger? a. in the first decad of the next centuri, the realli big explor opportun will be veri capit intens, and onli compani with the deepest pocket will be abl to stay in the game: royal dutch, exxon and bp amoco. compani of mobil' size are probabl margin player. q. that suggest mobil ha been harder hit than exxon by the downturn in price. a. from 1988 to 1996, exxon' explor and product expenditur rose 8 percent. mobil' rose 14 percent. but mobil' expenditur were much more sensit to the price elast of oil than exxon'. they were push the envelop, and when price fell they had to cut back. exxon ha tri to build a veri larg presenc systemat, without pay much attent to month-to-month or even year-to-year fluctuat in oil price. they are brutal effici. q. earlier thi month the energi depart said oil price would stay soft for nearli a decad. do you agre? a. you know, everi time i see forecast that go out that far i want to go out and buy stock in oil compani. i think we are go to see low oil price for six month to a year. it is conceiv we could go into the next centuri with oil at $5 a barrel, depend on what happen to the world economi. dure that period, we are go to see a substanti reduct in invest in explor and product, lead to a reduct in suppli come out of non-opec countri. that will strengthen the hand of the opec countri. and when the asian economi start grow again, that will lead to a good deal higher oil price, say $20 a barrel, in the next 18 month. q. the number of oil compani is go to shrink in come year, regardless, isn't it? a. we are probabl head toward a world in which there are no more than five or six big oil compani, possibl eight. there is realli no preced for have as mani big player as we have in the oil busi in thi modern societi. q. do you think oil stock are a good invest? a. i think oil compani are still a worthwhil invest, but it is not a place where an investor should plan on make money over the next 9 to 12 month. and it is an area where investor need to be care, becaus in that period there will be a good deal of consolid among smaller compani. ","Exxon and Mobil discuss combining business operations.A possible Exxon-Mobil merger would reunite 2 parts of Standard Oil broken up by the Supreme Court in 1911.Low crude oil prices and the high cost of exploration are motives for a merger that would create the world's largest oil company.As Exxon-Mobil merger talks continue, stocks of both companies surge.The merger talks show that corporate mergers are back in vogue.Antitrust lawyers, industry analysts, and government officials say a merger would require divestitures.A Mobil employee worries that a merger would put thousands out of work, but notes that his company's stock would go up.","In a move considered unthinkable a few years ago, Exxon Corp. and Mobile Corp, have entered into negotiations which could result in a merger of the two companies.Such a merger, should it occur, would form the world's largest oil company and the largest U.S. company, placing it above Wal-Mart.The merger, and talks like it among other oil companies, is being prompted By low petroleum prices and high production costs.Talks of a merger have sent the price of stocks of both companies soaring.The merger could prompt anti-trust action and the merging companies would have to divest themselves of some interests.Mobile workers fear a merger will cost them jobs.","Exxon Corp and Mobil Corp are reported to be discussing a business merger.Other oil companies have merged to compensate for low oil prices and increasing costs of oil exploration in more remote areas.The mergers are consistent with a trend in corporate marriages that is changing U.S. economic history.The mergers are pushing stocks up and the Exxon-Mobil merger could benefit consumers and lead to further savings.Some people believe the merger would require selling of large corporate pieces and put thousands out of work.If the companies merge, it would be the largest U.S. company and bigger than the world's largest oil company, Royal Dutch/Shell Group.","Exxon and Mobil consider merger.Partnerships already formed.Oil prices are lowest in 12 years and future exploration will be costly.The new company would be largest in the US and put back together pieces of Standard Oil, a monopoly broken up by courts.Experts mixed on merger's advantages.It would be an anti-trust test, since companies are involved in many facets of the business, require the sale of large units.Refinery workers, others would lose jobs.There is an upswing in corporate mergers, pushed by bull market and recognition that it's hard to increase revenue internally.Merger anticipation sent stocks higher in oil, internet and computers."

what? came the repli from the offic, who obvious thought the moment announc would be about clinton' impeach, not livingston' polit self-immol. just so, the democrat, alreadi deep into bone-raw exhaust after their long fight to save the presid, grasp for bear. it is a surrend to a develop sexual mccarthyism! declar rep. jerrold nadler, d-n.y., a lead presidenti defend tri to ralli democrat around the argument that livingston should not resign ani more than presid clinton should quit under fire. but the republican were surg to the fore on the strength of livingston' announc, fight tear as they rose to salut him as the ultim polit role model in the gruel impeach process as it roar into the final minut of debat. for some it is no longer good enough to make a mistak, to confirm that mistak and take the consequ of that mistak, said tom delay, the republican whip, hi hand shake, hi eye tear as he address the hous and sought to drive the exampl of livingston all the way down pennsylvania avenu. he understood what thi debat wa all about honor, duti, integr and the truth, said delay argu that in one swift blow, livingston had demonstr himself to have been a far better speaker than clinton ha been a presid. with someth of the polit elan the presid show in initi the iraq attack as hi own impeach loom, hous republican, batter in public opinion poll, had found a rocket' red glare of their own. i have hurt you all deepli and beg your forgiv, livingston told the hous, the nation and hi famili as he announc retreat. onli moment befor, democrat openli hiss the man as livingston firmli read hi own judgment upon the president: sir, you have done great damag to thi nation over the past year. presidenti resign wa in order, he continu, and then came the shout of you resign! you resign! and as livingston close the circl on hi career, he stun the place into a collect breath of disbelief and somehow almost threaten to reduc the dark histor issu befor the hous the impeach of the presid into a matter of anticlimax. they must not succeed, david bonior, the democrat whip said of the republican as he wa given the task of refocus the day on the misde of the presid, not the departur of the speaker. we are here to debat impeach and should not be distract from that, he declar. the onli way we can stop thi viciou cycl, bonior cri out from the floor, is if we refus to give into it, whether it is bill clinton or bob livingston. but the hous wa still reel through the frenzi day as the fate vote on the presid approach and the notion of resign lick about the capit citi like a flame in a forest. reject a last-minut democrat attempt to soften it action to censur, the hous of repres move to impeach presid william jefferson clinton for perjuri on saturday and to call on the senat to tri him, convict him and remov him from offic. but even befor the vote, republican press anoth line of attack, demand clinton' resign. rep. robert livingston, nomin for speaker last month by hi parti, startl the hous when he announc he would not run for speaker and would resign from the hous after 21 year of servic. he urg the presid to heal the wound that you have creat. you, sir, may resign your post. angri democrat boo and shout, you resign! livingston continu, i can onli challeng you in such fashion if i am will to heed my own word. apolog again for extramarit affair reveal two day ago, he said, i believ i had it in me to do a fine job. but i cannot do that job or be the kind of leader that i would like to be under current circumst. then he bolt from the hous chamber, nearli knock report and member down. (the hous vote 228-206 to approv the first articl of impeach, accus clinton of commit perjuri befor a feder grand juri. the vote wa announc at 1:24 pm. est, leav the 42nd presid to face trial in the senat on whether he should be remov from office.) clinton reject the advic immedi. hi spokesman, joe lockhart, said, the presid ha no intent of resign. by call on livingston to reconsid, the presid argu more broadli against resign under fire. perhap speak to both case, lockhart said, it would be wrong to give in to thi insidi polit of person destruct. unless clinton chang cours, thi would be onli the second impeach of a presid in the 209-year histori of the republ, and the first sinc andrew johnson wa acquit in 1868. sen. trent lott of mississippi, the major leader, ha insist that no bargain over censur can prevent it from start. but the senat could halt a trial later as part of a deal. consid the degre of partisanship display saturday, assembl the two-third major requir under the constitut for convict is most unlik. sixty-seven vote would be requir, and there are onli 55 republican in the senat, along with 45 democrat. four articl of impeach befor the hous charg clinton with perjuri in lie about hi affair with monica lewinski to a feder grand juri here on aug. 17. he wa also charg with perjuri in the paula jone sexual harass suit, obstruct of justic and abus of power. the republican argument, over and over, wa that clinton had lie in deni have sexual relat with ms. lewinski. rep. dick armey of texa, the major leader, said, a nation of law cannot be rule by a person who break the law. rep. nanci johnson of connecticut said: there can be no justic without the truth. that is just profoundli so, and that is whi perjuri matter. rep. gerald kleczka of wisconsin began the democrats' argument by say, what the presid did wa wrong, both person and moral, but hi act did not threaten our democraci and thu do not rise to the level of impeach offens as defin by our found father in our constitut. rep. charl schumer, new york' senator-elect, said: the rule of law requir that the punish fit the crime. allow us to vote for censur. saturday' vote were the penultim step in the most seriou conflict between congress and a presid sinc richard m. nixon resign in the face of impeach and certain convict on aug. 9, 1974. but while that case spun out from a 1972 break-in at democrat headquart in the waterg complex, thi one began with a murki land deal in arkansa in 1978. through the effort of kenneth starr, the independ counsel under the law enact in the wake of waterg, the investig spread to examin clinton' affair with a white hous intern. all year it ha preoccupi the capit despit an immens disconnect with public opinion; sinc the scandal becam public in januari, poll have shown that the public oppos impeach and want the inquiri brought to an end. even on friday night, after a 13-hour debat, a cb new poll of 548 peopl show that onli 38 percent want their repres to vote for impeachment; 58 percent want a no vote. the conflict now enter unchart sea, sinc the nixon resign cut the matter short and the johnson trial occur in a differ america, with no nuclear weapon or cabl televis or public opinion poll. but the capit wa still rife with confid specul. some guess, or hope, that the result of the recent poll, which show increas in support for resign as a way to spare the nation a trial in which ms. lewinski and linda tripp would be star wit, would weaken clinton' resolv. other thought the republican, see dismal number in poll about their party' stand in the unit state, would be the first to blink. with a major in the senat, they have the power to end a trial at ani time after the senat receiv notic of impeach on the day it conven, jan. 6, or the next day. but while clinton ha focus on the poll, and the cb new survey show that 64 percent still approv of hi handl of hi job as presid, resign could almost immedi subject him to crimin prosecut. and republican have steadfastli ignor the poll all year, and confront them directli on saturday. repres jc. watt of oklahoma, newli elect as chairman of the republican caucu, said: what' popular isn't alway right. you say poll are against thi. poll measur chang feel, not steadfast principl. poll would have reject the ten command. poll would have embrac slaveri and ridicul women' right. you say we must draw thi to a close. i say we must draw a line between right and wrong, not with a tini fine line of an execut fountain pen, but with the big fat lead of a no. 2 pencil. and we must do it so everi kid in america can see it. the point is not whether the presid can prevail, but whether truth can prevail. last weekend, when the judiciari committe recommend the four articl of impeach, clinton' side still hope to prevail with the help of 20 to 30 republican moder who were uncommit. as the week wore on, almost all of them broke against the presid. one who did not, rep. christoph shay of connecticut, said saturday: after judg starr' report to congress in septemb, and hi present to the judiciari committe in novemb, i conclud that impeach offens were not proven, and that the proven offens were not impeach. but the president' continu failur to come to grip with hi action, the sincer and argument of member of the judiciari committe from both side of the aisl, the chang of heart and convict by member on my side of the aisl who origin oppos impeach and who now support it, and the strong and power opinion of so mani of my constitu who oppos my posit and who want the presid impeach caus me to rethink my posit. he added: yesterday morn, befor i visit with the presid, i conclud that my origin posit wa the correct one, for me. i believ that the impeach offens have not been proven, and that the proven offens are not impeach. but rep. tom delay of texa, who ha led the republican effort to forc clinton from offic, dismiss hi and other argument as moral relativ. he began by prais livingston: there is no greater american in my mind, at least today, than bob livingston, becaus he understood what thi debat wa all about. it wa about honor and decenc and integr and the truth; everyth that we honor in thi countri. it wa also a debat about relativ vs. absolut truth. he continu, the president' defend have said that the presid is moral reprehens, that he is reckless, that he ha violat the trust of the american peopl, lessen their esteem for the offic of presid and dishonor the offic which they have entrust him, and that but that doesn't rise to the level of impeach. rep. jose serrano of new york said, my constitu don't hate bill clinton; they love him and they'r pray for him right at thi veri moment. you may have the vote today to impeach him, but you don't have the american peopl. and let me tell you someth, i grew up in the public hous project of the south bronx. i can see a bunch of bulli when i see them. the bulli get their, and you'r go to get your, too. rep. henri hyde of illinoi, the judiciari committe chairman who brought the charg to the hous floor, said the congress and the american peopl need to distinguish between privat act of infidel and public act by public offici. in clinton' case, he said, the hous wa deal with a serial violat of the oath who is the chief law-enforc offic. he said that the senat could be innov and creativ in decid how best to punish clinton, but that the hous wa bound by the constitut to move ahead with articl of impeach. justic is so import to the most humbl among us, hyde said. equal justic under the law that' what we'r fight for. democrat, read from the same constitut, voic diametr opposit conclus, and attack the fair of the proceed that culmin saturday. we'r lose track of distinct between sin and crime, said rep. jerrold nadler, d-ni. we'r lower the standard of impeach. what the presid ha done is not a great and danger offens to the republ. democrat also critic republican for impeach clinton at the veri moment that us. troop wage war against iraq. six day befor christma our troop are in battl, and a lame-duck congress is rush to overthrow the command in chief, said rep. david bonior of michigan, the second-rank hous democrat. the ghost of waterg hung over the hous chamber. one republican cite the parallel between the charg the hous judiciari committe brought against nixon 25 year ago, and the count that the same committe brought to the hous floor for affirm on saturday. nixon cheat. he cheat the elector system, said rep. lindsey graham, a south carolina republican on the judiciari committe. and now, graham said, the full hous is vote to impeach clinton becaus we believ he commit crime that result in cheat our judici system. but most of the day' debat wa firmli root in clinton' effort to conceal hi sexual affair with monica lewinski. rep. bob barr, a georgia republican on the judiciari committe who is one of clinton' fiercest critic, held up copi of the us. crimin code, the judiciari committee' report on the impeach inquiri and, final, the constitut, in defend hi decis to impeach the presid. today, we reli on the three pillar of our society: the law itself, evid and the constitut, said barr. there is no joy in uphold the law, watt said. if we cannot see lawless, our children cannot recogn it. how can we tell our children honesti is the best polici when we don't demand it as a polici? but democrat assail the veri premis on which the republican major built it impeach case against clinton. rep. john conyer jr. of michigan, the rank democrat on the judiciari committe, assail the four articl of impeach, count by count, as unfound by evid and fail to rise to impeach. he save hi most savag scorn for the final count, abus of power. the major ha simpli tri to dress up the perjuri count in the waterg abuse-of-pow languag, conyer said. rep. bob livingston, who confess to hi colleagu thursday night that he had had adulter affair, stun the hous chamber saturday morn by say in the impeach debat on presid clinton that he would not serv as speaker and would quit congress in six month. he urg the presid to follow hi exampl and quit, too. but at the white hous, where call for clinton' resign are derid as a republican strategi, the presid sent a spokesman into the driveway to urg livingston to reconsid hi resign. livingston stood in the well of the hous he ha serv for two decad and call on clinton to resign hi offic rather than forc a trial in the senat, draw boo from hi colleagu and cat-cal that he should quit instead. he then did just that. i must set the exampl that i hope presid clinton will follow, livingston announc to a shock and silent chamber in an act that left the republican parti in total chao just hour befor the vote to impeach clinton. the decis also left the parti leaderless on the eve of the open of the 106th congress, when republican must govern with one of the narrowest major in histori. sever republican, includ rep. tom delay of texa, the major whip, somberli welcom the news, suggest it reliev them of an excruci embarrass. in laud livingston' move, delay said, he understood what thi debat wa all about it' about honor and decenc and integr and the truth, everyth we honor in thi countri. but democrat said they were aghast, and mani includ clinton call on livingston to reconsid hi decis. mr. livingston' resign wa wrong, declar rep. jerrold nadler, d-ni. it is a surrend to a develop sexual mccarthyism. are we go to have a new test if someon want to run for public offic are you now or have you ever been an adulter? he call on the countri to distinguish between sin and crime. white hous press secretari joe lockhart said clinton wa disappoint at the news of livingston' plan and wish that he would reconsid. lockhart said the presid firmli believ that the polit of person destruct in thi town and thi countri ha to come to an end. he reaffirm that clinton would not resign, saying: the presid is go to do what' in the best interest of the countri. it would be wrong to give in to thi insidi polit of person destruct. livingston' announc resign wa all the more stun for it disclosur in a process that could result in the president' remov from offic. the speaker is second in line to the presid, after the vice presid. newt gingrich, the outgo speaker, who wa driven from the post after republican lost five seat in the novemb elect, technic remain speaker until jan. 6, when livingston' elect wa to be ratifi by the new congress. but gingrich ha remov himself from the daili oper of the hous at thi extraordinari session and ha begun to dismantl hi offic. livingston' decis wa said to be driven in part by the anger of a group of about a dozen conserv in hi parti who were disillus that he had withheld news of hi affair from them. they had threaten to withhold their vote for him in the elect in januari that would formal make him speaker. he wa also concern about the pain caus to hi famili by further disclosur, some member said. they ad that, not lost on mani in hi parti, wa the exampl he would set for the presid by offer to resign hi post now. delay, no. 3 in the hous republican leadership, is expect to fill the power vacuum at least temporarili, in deed if not in titl, while the parti regroup to find a new speaker. mani member quickli ralli around rep. denni hastert of illinoi. hastert, one of delay' deputi whip who is well respect among hi colleagu, had been promot as a candid for major leader last month, but never mount a campaign. rep. dick armey of texa onli precari held on to hi majority-lead post last month and wa not consid a like candid for speaker. he is expect to manag the reorgan, which republican leader have set for jan. 4. livingston met privat with hi closest advis friday as the impeach debat unfold. some of hi colleagu believ he had made a mistak in disclos thursday night just as the hous wa move into the divis debat over impeach that he had on occas stray from my marriag. he told republican leader late thursday afternoon that hustler magazin wa go to expos hi affair earli next year. some leader urg him to keep quiet, but hi wife, bonni, encourag him to tell hi colleagu immedi, despit the moment vote that wa near on the floor. at that point thursday night, roll call, a newspap on capitol hill, report on it web site that livingston wa go to admit to the affair and wa go to offer to resign. in a closed-door meet with hi fellow republican, he did admit to the affair but made no offer to step down, receiv three stand ovat instead. thursday night, livingston state that he would not be intimid by these effort to exploit hi past. but friday he remov himself from public action and that night drew hi closest advis into hi confid. hi aid said saturday that they had no clue what wa he wa contempl, and few other member were awar of hi plan. ask if he had ani advanc word, rep. jc. watt of oklahoma, a newli elect member of the republican leadership, said: i had no idea. ask if there had been intern parti pressur on livingston to resign, rep. harold roger, r-ky., said: i didn't know about it if there wa, but ad, there were some member who were critic of it. as the leader tri saturday to hold the parti togeth on and off the hous floor, most republican stuck to their prepar script on the floor in favor of impeach the presid. but some began express their anguish. rep. henri hyde, r-ill., who admit to hi own adulter affair earlier thi year, said after livingston' resignation: those of us who are sinner must feel wretch today. someth is go on repeatedli that ha to be stop, and that is a confus between privat act of infidel and public act. to much applaus, hyde declared: congress ha no busi intrud into privat act. republican, inde livingston himself, had made thi same distinct between clinton' sexual indiscret and livingston', say that clinton lie about hi privat act and therefor abus the legal system and hi power. as livingston said in hi statement thursday: these indiscret were not with employe on my staff and i have never been ask to testifi under oath about them. democrat hope that livingston' seemingli drastic action would wake up the hous to how poison the atmospher had becom and might prompt republican to reconsid the impeach of clinton. rep. paul kanjorski, d-pa., said, we are now start to offer up sacrifici lamb to whatev terribl diseas thi is. in a stir speech applaud even by some republican, rep. dick gephardt of missouri, the democrat leader, prais livingston as a worthi, good and honor man and said hi resign wa a grave mistak. it' a terribl capitul to the neg polit forc that are consum our polit system and our countri, gephardt said, ad that the event of the last few day show life imit farc. we need to stop destroy imperfect peopl at an unattain altar of public moral, he said, urg hi colleagu to step back from the abyss and reject resign, impeach and viciou self-right. the new york time said in an editori for sunday, dec. 20: the republicans' drive for a partisan impeach base soley on party-lin vote power rather than ani sens of proport produc an unexpect sideshow in the resign of rep. bob livingston from hi role as futur speaker of the hous. analyst on both side of the struggl over presid clinton' futur will point to livingston' downfal as evid of a gener breakdown in legisl civil on capitol hill. democrat will see a moral symmetri, depict livingston as a victim of the sexual puritan he wa wield against clinton. but the one thing that no one should fall for is livingston' invit to use hi resign as a model for resolv the crisi at the white hous. livingston' statement rock congress, but it should not shake the foundat of the somber constitut process now underway. by lie under oath, clinton made it necessari for the hous to consid impeach. the evid convinc most american that the presid should be censur, but not remov from offic. livingston allow gop partisan to block censur in the hous. the result is that after saturday' expect impeach vote, after livingston' unexpect announc, the mission of the senat remain the same. it must resist those republican who want to short-circuit the constitut process with demand for resign, and it must use the upcom senat trial as a forum for find a censur commensur with the president' person dishonesti and offens against the law. these requir stern punish but not remov from offic. in undertak thi work, the senat must also reassur the american peopl that a decis wisdom at the core of our messy-look polit system ha not melt down. in such distemp time, thi is a shine opportun for the senat. it member pride themselv on be the republic' fire wall against presidenti excess and the popular or partisan passion that sometim seiz the hous of repres. no one can predict whether senat major leader trent lott will rise to the defin challeng of hi career or whether he will surrend to the mean streak he acquir dure 16 grumpi year as a minor member of the hous. we would like to see lott reach for a star role in histori. lott' growl respons to question about censur is not encourag. he may be right that the constitut requir him to conven a trial, but noth in that document prevent him from speedili guid the senat toward censur negoti. inde, a simpl major vote 45 democrat plu 6 cooper republican can end the senat trial at ani time, clear the way for introduct of the kind of censur resolut suggest by former sen. bob dole. in an intrigu report on nbc, tim russert describ discuss among a bipartisan group of senat about a censur that would involv some form of presidenti confess, a fine and a joint congression request that independ counsel kenneth starr not prosecut clinton in the court. if lott refus to allow a bipartisan search for censur, the burden will fall upon respect member like joseph lieberman on the democrat side and orrin hatch for the republican. through cooper, they can guid the senat toward a punish that fix clinton in histori as a presid who lie under oath, but avoid the taint of partisan vengeanc associ with the hous impeach vote. the senate' histor reput for prudenc requir it to find appropri punish for a person weak presid who ha damag the rule of law, but not threaten the stabil of the govern. hous speaker-elect robert l. livingston present a fresh note of shock to the impeach debat against presid clinton on thursday night as the republican leader wa forc to admit to hi republican colleagu that he had carri on adulter affair in hi past. it ha suddenli come to my attent that there are individu work togeth with the media who are investig my person background in an effort to find indiscret which may be exploit against me and my parti on the eve of the upcom histor vote on impeach, livingston declar in a statement after appear befor a shock hous republican confer to head off the disclosur as it surfac in news report. after hear hi admiss in a close session, livingston' colleagu gave him a stand ovat of support and said the question of hi resign had never arisen. my fate is in your hand, livingston told the republican, accord to lawmak who were present. the debat over the president' fate would go forward, republican later insist, draw distinct between the speaker-elect' revel and the sex-and-mendac scandal that ha put clinton on the brink of impeach. the presid is charg in an impeach resolut with perjuri and abus of power in hi attempt to hide sexual indiscret. democrat offer no immedi comment, but republican were brace to hear livingston' admiss allud to in the debat friday by democrat who have decri the investig of the presid as basic a partisan and unfair rummag through hi sex life. livingston, say he had sought spiritu counsel and had receiv the forgiv of hi famili, note he had sever time told report dure hi campaign to becom speaker that i wa run for speaker, not sainthood. he ad, there wa a reason for those word. dure my 33-year marriag to my wife, bonni, i have on occas stray from my marriag, and do so nearli cost me my marriag and famili, livingston said in hi brief prepar statement. but he attempt to draw a contrast with the alleg against the presid, asserting: i want to assur everyon that these indiscret were not with employe on my staff and i have never been ask to testifi under oath about them. the disclosur of the speaker-elect' marit infidel, disclos in rollcal, a capitol hill newspap, sent a new jolt of uncertainti among lawmak as they prepar for the moment debat over the president' admit misbehavior in offic and whether he should be impeach and tri by the senat. rep. henri hyde, the republican chairman of the hous judiciari committe who is to bring the impeach charg against the presid, previous wa cite by a magazin for an extra-marit affair in hi past. then, as on thursday night, republican voic suspicion that democrat defend of the presid instig media investig in an effort to embarrass the clinton' princip accus. but no proof wa offer as republican left their confer, face the uncertainti of a debat that alreadi promis to be bare-knuckl in it partisanship. livingston left the confer surround by capitol polic, not take question from wait report. hi chief leadership aid immedi ralli in support. some who would rather not struggl with thi constitut question continu to tri to twist the debat into an unseemli investig of privat live, said rep. dick armey, the republican major leader. in it report on the internet thursday night, rollcal did not disclos it sourc but made an obliqu refer to hustler, the sex magazin. larri flint, publish of hustler, earlier thi year advertis an offer of a $1 million bounti for inform about e of member of congress guilti of sexual indiscret. it break your heart becaus we'r all subject to human frailti, said asa hutchinson, r-ark., as he left the confer. thi is not a comfort circumst for anyon, he ad, insist the presid and the speaker-elect present two separ issu. we'v got a duti to do under the constitut. it ha gotten to the point where drastic action may be necessari. you know those movi about ebola viru outbreak, where the guy in steril suit come in, seal off the area and complet irradi it? they may have to do that to washington. just erad us and start from scratch. in a few, short day we have manag to make the term surreal, bizarr, split-screen america, shock, runaway train and polit of person destruct useless clich. we no longer govern here. we just roll around in the gutter wonder who' next in thi sexual auto-de-f. on saturday morn, we had the surreal, shock, bizarr, split-screen imag of bob livingston, the speaker-elect, step down after hi marit infidel were reveal. we are all pawn on the chessboard, livingston said, befor ask the presid to resign and then resign himself. livingston' rabid pursuit of the presid, even as he hope to hide hi own dirti laundri, made him an avatar of hypocrisi in a capit rot with hypocrisi. on thursday night, when livingston first confess hi sin to republican in hope of keep hi hold on hi post, hi colleagu gave him a stand ovat. and after he made hi surpris announc saturday, the republican gave him anoth ovat and step up to deliv encomium to their lost speaker. one' self-esteem get utterli crush at time like thi, sigh henri hyde, anoth torment of the presid who also had to admit that he had succumb to temptat. tom delay, the jagged-edg extermin who may next-up in the speaker roundelay, wa choke up, prais the great of livingston for understand that thi wa a debat about relativ versu absolut truth. what could be more rel than a republican who ha hidden a lot of affair tri to impeach a presid for lie about hi? spur by larri flynt' bounti for sinnuendo, the citi wa brace for more crazi. the ship of fool reach cruis speed on friday even, when we had the frighten scene of republican so craze with hatr of the presid that they were railroad through an impeach even though the unit state wa at war with iraq, even though the hous chamber wa mostli empti, even though republican were huddl in a glass hous on the issu of sex and lie, and even though the white hous wa still pitch a tent and plan sleigh ride for a winter wonderland press parti on monday. (the white hous wa keep the journalist quarantin outsid thi year, but encourag them to bring their kid. to soak up some of that cozi famili atmospher, no doubt. whi are the republican so obsess, when everyon in hi right mind agre that impeach is an outlandishli over-the-top punish for clinton and a self-destruct cours for the countri? becaus they genuin hate the presid. they think he' a dishonest, immor, issue-st, selfish child of the '60. they don't think they'r go to pay a polit price for thi, and if they do, they don't care. it might be a great time to see a lot of combov, but it' not a great time to see a lot of statur. the hous debat wa not histori. it wa just a more hideou version of the mclaughlin group. while republican tri to draw the distinct that clinton had perjur himself, they ignor that the presid had been lure by the starr-jon attorney team into testifi on monica lewinski. ordinarili one would feel sorri for livingston. but the republican have brought thi sexual doomsday machin on themselv by focus so single-mindedli on clinton' sex life. the republican were so determin to do their high-tech lynch that they engag in wacki role revers. mani republican hawk argu that bill clinton should not be bomb saddam, claim the time wa suspici, even though they had hammer him for not bomb five week ago. in an incred unseemli display, trent lott, the major leader, and former bush nation secur advis brent scowcroft and bush secretari of state lawrenc eagleburg chime in on the attack. there' too much hate here. and i hate it. we are here to debat impeach and should not be distract from that, the minor whip, rep. david bonior, democrat of michigan, said dure saturday' hous debat, in what leap out as an imposs goal. it would have taken a kaleidoscop televis screen to captur the constantli shift imag compet for center stage: impeach, iraq, the resign of rep. robert livingston, the respons from the white hous. the month lead up to the impeach of presid clinton had becom a seri of televis anticlimax, but the hour befor the vote made up for that lack of drama. there were hardli enough shorthand term or split screen to cover the activ. all the network and cabl channel carri the moment that unexpectedli set the tone, as livingston, a louisiana republican, announc dure the debat that he would not becom hous speaker. the comment had been set to carri the congression ratif of the inevit vote, but suddenli the most plugged-in report were caught off guard. as tim russert said to tom brokaw on nbc, tom, knock us all over. in the echo chamber that televis news so often becom, the share mantra had been weightier in earli morn. for onli the second time in american histori a presid would be impeach, went the standard line. yet despit all the pundit specul and politician telegraph everi move, no one had hint at the livingston resign. the announc wa, as brokaw put it, at least partli a polit ploy, and the repercuss were immedi. report began gather word from capitol hill about candid for the speaker' job, and the convers move to the next stage of the polit tug of war. the republican use livingston' resign to say that the presid should resign, too; the democrat immedi counter with the idea that the presid would stay and that livingston should as well. that led to one of the less-expect split screen of the day, and it wa not a bad choic. while congress wa debat, cnn show anti-aircraft fire in baghdad in one box. in the other, joe lockhart, clinton' press secretari, stood in the white hous driveway tell report that the presid would like livingston to reconsid hi decis. there wa more stateli in the hous than televis usual offer, and one reason wa pure visual. keep in mind that we do not control the pictur, dan rather said on cb, explain that the televis camera in congress are provid by the hous, not the individu network. there wa no way to roam and zoom in for reaction shot, as at a polit convent. but the sens of histori and decorum didn't last long at cb. at noon, befor the vote, cb went to a footbal game, becom the onli network to leav the news coverag. cbs' corpor decis to tri to have it both way meant that rather would break in with updat from washington. i'll see you veri soon, he said as he sign off the complet coverag, look like a trouper. but he wa in a posit no news anchor should have been in on thi day. he later announc impeach vote on a split screen with the footbal game in progress in the upper part of the screen. on the other network and cabl channel, the vote itself liter happen in the background. as tv screen tote up the number of the electronically-cast vote, member of congress mill around and chat on the floor. even the brief democrat walkout after a motion to consid censur wa defeat wa thoroughli forecast. as the democrat straggl down the step of congress, it look curious undramat on televis, though it probabl made a better still photograph onc they were all in place. and while the vote were in progress, the jockey for the speaker' job heat up. we alreadi have a presumpt leader, gwen ifil of nbc new said in midafternoon, name rep. denni hassert, r-ill., who had also been cite by the other network as a like candid. if the polit and militari action had not intrud, it might have been more obviou that the debat on the hous floor sent a messag about vast divis in polit and moral, signal how deep a cultur fissur thi crisi ha open. the impeach, said rep. tom delay, r-texa, wa a debat about relativ vs. absolut truth. rep. jerrold nadler, d-n.y., contend that congress had lost the distinct between sin and crime, and argu against the sexual mccarthyism that ha becom promin. and against the backdrop of the revel of adulteri that led to livingston' resign, rep. dick gephardt, the minor leader, declar the polit of person destruct ha to end. but as all the jabber and polit postur continu, as report race to cover the president' statement about the impeach and the latest brief from the pentagon, there wa littl time to focu on the profound cultur messag beneath those rhetor flourish. bob livingston, the incom speaker of the hous, took no public role friday as the debat unfold on whether to impeach presid clinton. hi previou 24 hour had been hi most visibl in the month sinc hi parti nomin him as speaker and perhap the most excruci in hi public career: he spent most of the day in a chaotic procedur wrangl over the term of friday' debate; he end it by tell hi republican colleagu that he had had extramarit affair dure hi 20-year tenur in congress. hi disclosur follow an investig by larri flynt, publish of hustler, the sex magazin, who said friday at a news confer in beverli hill, calif., that hi public had learn that livingston had had adulter affair dure the last 10 year. flynt said earlier thi year that he want to expos the hypocrisi of those in washington who are investig clinton and in octob offer $1 million to anyon who could prove they had had affair with member of congress. he said friday that thi larger investig, to be publish perhap as soon as januari, would reveal what he describ as indiscret of sever other republican. he said he had no connect with the white hous but that he had hire an investig firm base in washington and made up of former employe of the fbi and the cia. he would not confirm whether the firm is terri lenzner' investig group inc., which ha done work for the president' privat lawyer. livingston wa unavail to report friday. he spent some time friday morn sprawl in a chair in the back of the hous chamber, listen to the debat over whether to impeach clinton for lie about hi own sexual indiscret. sever colleagu knelt at livingston' knee, whisper to him and pat him on the back. he spent most of the day in a privat offic off the chamber, avoid the gauntlet of report who lay in wait for him between the hous and hi regular offic across the street. the onli word out of hi aid wa that the navi had award contract worth million of dollar for ship to be built in hi louisiana district at the avondal shipyard. dure friday' debat, a hand of democrat made onli obliqu allus to human failur. for exampl, rep. john lewi, d-ga., said: let he that ha no sin cast the first stone. who, who among us ha not sin? but no one said that livingston' disclosur or the mild democrat attempt to exploit it would influenc their vote on impeach. rather, on the hous floor and in hallway chitchat, livingston' conduct seem to be the last thing that either republican or democrat want to talk about. bob livingston is a first-rat human be, said rep. david obey, d-wis., who ha work close and spar with livingston on the appropri committe, in an interview. i will repeat what the nun taught me at st. jame a long time ago: we would all be a hell of a lot better off look after our own soul rather than tri to evalu somebodi else'. none of us have ani busi even have an opinion on it. even conserv republican seem readi to overlook the disclosur. we'r not go to say, `bob, you can't be speaker becaus you violat your vow with your wife,' said rep. lindsey graham, r-sc. like mani, includ livingston, graham distinguish livingston' conduct from clinton' by say that the presid had trampl on the legal system wherea livingston' behavior wa strictli privat. despit flynt' claim, mani republican blame the clinton administr for smear livingston, although they offer no evid. thi isn't just happen on it own, said rep. dana rohrabach, r- calif. the onli thing certain now is uncertainti. the smart money shout that presid clinton will never resign, and he concur. the smart money argu that the senat could not muster the 67 vote that would be need to remov the wound presid from offic, which would requir the defect of 12 democrat if all the republican stand against him. the smart money insist that someon will cut a deal to end all thi. mayb so. but the smarter money whisper, rememb. rememb that everyon in washington, includ rep. henri hyde, r-ill., chairman of the judiciari committe, said the hous would never, ever, treat impeach as a partisan issu. wrong. rememb that all the pundit predict democrat loss in the midterm elect, and when the opposit happen, they said impeach wa dead. twice wrong. and rememb that in the new year the nation may travel down a road it ha never travel befor. one other presid, andrew johnson of tennesse, ha been tri by the senat, of cours. but that happen in a differ countri one with onli 37 state, with primit commun, with a simpl economi base larg on agricultur, with onli minim commit abroad. in the toxic polit of century' end in washington, the inconceiv ha becom the commonplac. the wholli unanticip announc saturday morn by rep. robert livingston, r-la., that he would not serv as speaker and would resign from congress, follow hi equal unanticip disclosur on thursday night of sever extramarit affair, onli deepen the capital' profound sens of insecur. the deadli sweep of the scyth of neo-puritan appear unstopp, at least for the moment, and livingston' forthcom resign will increas the pressur on the presid to do likewis. you'v set befor us an exampl, the leader of hous republican major, rep. dick armey of texa, told livingston saturday. the exampl is that principl come befor power. the democrat made the opposit point, argu that the livingston case show how veri wrong it wa to savag peopl for person pecaddillo. one transcend import thing remain the same: although surround by judici trap and presid over by the chief justic, trial of presid are polit process, with power resid in the hand of elect politician. in addit to narrow legal issu of guilt or innoc, they can weigh consider of parti, the nation' futur, their own individu polit well-b and almost anyth els they care to weigh in reach a verdict. the longer they took, the more numer the call for resign would probabl be. even befor saturday' epoch roll-cal, four of ten american interview in the latest new york times/cb new poll said they thought the presid should step down if he were to be indict, despit the fact that a larg major voic disapprov of the impeach proceed. what lie behind that seem contradict, of cours, is the fear that clinton, and the countri with him, would be incapacit. no one took andrew johnson veri serious after he escap convict by a singl vote. but clinton, a man of power will whose whole life ha been a seri of comeback, ha alreadi embark on an effort to show that he can do the nation' busi. richard nixon claw hi way back to respect after leav the white hous when no one thought he could; clinton intend to re-establish hi author while still in offic. he ha one great advantage: two-third of the american public continu to voic it approv of hi polit stewardship, whatev it think of him as a man. the presid will press hard, despit hi much-reduc leverag, for a deal on censur. inde, in as fine a piec of polit ironi as one could ask for, he ha alreadi sought to enlist former sen. bob dole, the republican he defeat in 1996, as an emissari to the senat major. the number are not unpromising: with the help of six republican, the 45 democrat could end the trial at ani time and pass a censur resolut that the hous would sure take up. there are enough republican moder and sometim party-buck to make that a plausibl target. but the republican leader in the senat, trent lott of mississippi, who ha made hi unwilling to take the president' word plainli evid in recent day, is determin to fight such a trial-abort arrang. it is clear that clinton' reput ha been stain forev, no matter what the senat doe. the spot will not out. histori will rememb thi man who so covet a glow legaci not as an impresario of econom growth, not as the mose who point the way to the 21st centuri, but as the second presid ever to be impeach, if not as the first to be oust. that harsh word, impeach, will cling to hi name as sure as teapot dome cling to harding' and depress to hoover'. but he is not alon in have suffer grievou injuri in the polit avalanch that wa shaken loos by the disclosur of clinton' sexual relationship with a former white hous intern, monica lewinski. the republicans' public support ha shrivel to 40 percent in the new times/cb new poll, it lowest level in 14 year, and it could go lower onc the fact of impeach sink in. journalist are seen by mani as jackal, indiffer to whatev person suffer or nation angst they may caus as long as they get the stori, and none too concern about accuraci. in fact, the whole polit cultur of the 1990, with it crimin of polit conduct and it seem indiffer to import nation and intern issu, ha fallen into disreput with ordinari american. the last week seem to crystal the long-term declin in polit civil. republican call clinton a liar, even as he wa commit american pilot to the sky over iraq, and democrat accus their rival of conduct a polit lynch or a polit coup d'etat. bipartisanship may have been the biggest victim of all. parti line on saturday' roll call held as firm as leg iron. almost all of the republican who oppos impeach did so not exclus on legal principl but at least partli becaus of special polit circumst the democrat major in rep. constanc morella' district in the maryland suburb of washington, for exampl, and the gratitud of rep. peter king, r-n.y., for clinton' peacemak in ireland. it is hard to see who ha emerg from it with reput enhanc, except perhap hillari rodham clinton, staunch in the face of decept. if some of the threat and dire predict utter by hous democrat in recent day are to be taken at face valu, the nation is enter upon an era of bad feel, the polar opposit of a second era of good feel, similar to that of the 1820, that clinton had hope to presid over. rep. tom sawyer, d-ohio, compar clinton on friday to sir thoma more, execut for treason in 1535 becaus of hi religi belief. he quot more' word as an admonit for today: what you have hunt me for is not my action but for the thought of my heart. it is a long road you have open. god help the statesmen who walk your road. but amidst all the loos talk about perman damag to thi institut or that, remember: thing chang with startl speed in modern american polit, and the institut of american govern have prove extraordinarili resili. presid nixon, it wa almost univers agre in 1974, had weaken the american presid for mani decad to come. nobodi said that after eight year under ronald reagan, and that wa onli 15 year later. in the end, the will of the peopl meant noth. bob livingston couldn't have been clearer about that. hi mind and the mind of hi follow were close. even as the bomb continu in iraq and american from coast to coast were clamor for an altern to impeach, even as hi own adulter past wa be flush out in the grotesqu invas of privaci that inevit follow the relentlessli prurient pursuit of the presid, even as the countri began to contempl the destruct effect of a lengthi and bitter senat trial, the speaker-design arrogantli and stupidli proclaimed: let us disregard the outsid influenc. the radic on the hill would hear noth but the echo of their own fanatic. impeach! impeach! and that continu even after the stun announc saturday morn that livingston would quit the hous. dismay by the partisan stamped, dick gephardt, the democrat leader, warn dure the impeach debat on friday: in your effort to uphold the constitut, you are trampl the constitut. david bonior, the democrat whip, said: thi is wrong. it is unfair. it is unjust. at a time when event in the world and the challeng at home demand that we stand unit, censur is the one solut that can bring us togeth. to my colleagu across the aisl, i say let go of your obsess. listen to the american peopl. but the voic of reason would not be heard. livingston and hi right-w colleagu, the tom delay, the henri hyde, the bob barr, were on a mission of destruct and would not be deni. ordinari american could cri out all they want. they could protest and demonstr, send fax and e-mail. it didn't matter. the right wa on the march and democraci wa on the run. rep. thoma barrett, a democrat from wisconsin, tri to remind hi republican colleagu that the constitut doe not allow you to remov a presid from offic becaus you can't stand him. he wa, of cours, ignor. the republican will pay a huge price for their brazen, utterli partisan attempt to drag a presid from the white hous in defianc of the will of the peopl. the party' contempt for the voter wa arrogantli but quit adequ sum up by alan simpson, the former senat from wyom, who said: the attent span of american is which movi is come out next month and whether the quarterli report on their stock will chang. if the voter are the dope that mr. simpson think they are, then come 2000 everyon will have forgotten there wa an impeach crisi. but rep. robert menendez, d-n.j., wa probabl closer to the truth when he said, i warn my colleagu that you will reap the bitter harvest of the unfair partisan seed you sow today. one of the mani strang event of the past coupl of week wa the way in which virtual all of the previous undecid republican, the so-cal moder, surrend their independ and line up like lackey to follow the right wing' lead. all proclaim loudli that they were vote on principl, but in fact it wa an exercis in mass cowardic, exemplifi by rep. john mchugh of upstat new york. mchugh announc on tuesday that he would vote for impeach. but if hi decis wa base on principl, he had an odd way of express it. the washington post said mchugh appear to have no stomach for a senat convict or remov of the presid from offic. of hi colleagu in the senat, mchugh said, i, for one, would accept, even welcom, their merci. in other word, let the senat do the heavi constitut lift. mchugh may have wish out loud for merci, but he clearli wa too frighten of the right-wing in the hous to cast a compassion vote himself. the gop can no longer conceal that it is a parti of extremist, of right-w absolutist, a parti out of step with the polit and cultur orient of most american. bob livingston may be leav, but hi arrog comment can still serv as hi party' slogan. let us disregard the outsid influenc. let us disregard the peopl. ","During the Clinton impeachment debate in the House, Speaker-elect Bob Livingston declared that he would set an example for the president and resign from Congress over revelations of his marital infidelities.Republican demands that the president also resign were rejected by Democrats who also said that Livingston should not quit and that the Speaker-elect's resignation was, in the words of Jerrold Nadler (D-N.Y), ""a surrender to sexual McCarthyism"".With the House vote to impeach, the president will face a Senate trial, but it is unlikely that 67 members will vote for conviction.The trial could be mercifully shortened, however, by a vote of censure.","As impeachment proceedings in the House approached a climax, House members were stunned by an admission from House Speaker elect Livingston that he was guilty of an adulterous affair.The admission follows disclosures by Hustler published Larry Flynn, who had offered one million dollars to anyone who could provide such information on a House or Senate member.Livingston's admission was met with a standing ovation by House members, as was his subsequent resignation.In resigning, Livingston called on President Clinton to do the same.Political pundits see the whole process as driven by partisan politics.","House Speaker-elect Robert L. Livingston was forced to admit to his Republican colleagues his past adultery.This was forced by an investigation by Larry Flynt.When Livingston called for Clinton to quit, House Democrats yelled, ""You resign""!Stunningly, he did.TV commentators were caught off guard.Livingston put pressure on Clinton to follow his example.The House moved to impeach Clinton and called on the Senate to try him.Livingston's downfall was said to show a breakdown in legislative civility.Those who want impeachment were called radicals and fanatics.Livingston's pursuit of Clinton was characterized as ""rabid"", showing his own hypocrisy.","House Speaker-elect Robert Livingston shocked his Republican colleagues in the midst of a Clinton impeachment debate by admitting to adulterous affairs during his Congressional tenure.He later urged Clinton to follow his example and resign that increased the fury of the impeachment debate.The House moved to impeach the President for perjury and called on the Senate to try him, convict him and remove him from office.Some who believe the debate shows the fanatical, partisan, and hateful side of Republican behavior, advise the Senate only to censure Clinton and thus avoid partisan vengeance.The issue deepens a cultural fissure and a sense of uncertainty."
47,"the first part of the intern space station wa smoothli orbit earth on friday after a faultless launch that mark the start of a new age in space explor and colon. a russian proton booster rocket carri the modul into it initi orbit 200 kilomet (125 mile) abov the earth and the unit wa oper as plan, offici said. russia' zarya, or sunris, modul is to fli alon for two week befor a rendezv with the american space shuttl endeavour, which is to be launch dec. 3 carri the uniti connect modul. space offici from 16 nation take part in the project cheer as the rocket soar into the cloudi sky abov the central asian stepp from the baikonur launch pad friday a year later than plan. dure the, pickup 4th pv endeavour' astronaut connect the first two build block of the intern space station on sunday, creat a seven-stori tower in the shuttl cargo bay. it wa the first time that the russian-built zarya control modul and the made-in-america uniti chamber had ever touch. it look to be a perfect and, hope, long-last fit. we have captur of zarya, command robert cabana announc the moment the two piec came togeth. congratul to the crew of the good ship endeavour, repli mission control. that' terrif. the 240-mile-high construct job began two hour earlier with nanci currie' captur of zarya (russian for sunris) use the shuttl robot arm. we'r halfway home, cabana said. then came the hard part: stack the two giant cylind in the cargo bay. the two station piec are so big 77 feet from the tip of one to the tip of the other with a combin mass of 70,000 pound that curri and her crewmat had to reli on a computer vision system and camera view, rather than direct line of sight. thi wa the first time such a blind dock had ever been attempt. curri posit the solar-wing zarya, still on the end of the shuttl robot arm, sever inch directli abov uniti. it wa slow going; she want and need perfect align. onc she wa sure she had it, cabana fire endeavour' thruster, and the brief burst rais the shuttl and therebi uniti enough for the dock mechan on the two station compon to snap togeth. the histor moment occur abov the south pacif. the union intend to last the station' 15-year or more lifetim set the stage for a spacewalk by two astronaut on monday to attach electr connector and cabl between the two compon. mission control thought sunday' work might take hour longer than plan and gave the six astronaut plenti of time for the task. but everyth occur more or less when and how it wa suppos to, asid from a piec of space junk that stray too close. befor begin their final approach to zarya, the six astronaut had to steer clear of a chunk of a rocket launch last month from california. mission control order the pilot to fire the shuttl thruster to put an extra three mile between endeavour and the space junk, put endeavour a total of five mile from the orbit debri. the smaller gap would have been probabl a littl too close for comfort, mission control said. the bigger worri, by far, wa over endeavour' pursuit and captur of zarya, and it coupl with uniti. the shuttle' 50-foot robot arm had never befor handl an object as massiv as the 41-foot, 44,000-pound zarya, a power and propuls modul that wa launch from kazakstan on nov. 20. it will provid all of the necessari electr and steer for the fledgl space station until a perman control modul can be launch next summer. minut after zarya' captur, cabana call down that two antenna on the modul were still undeploy as russian flight control had fear. the antenna must be fulli deploy in order for zarya' manual dock system to work; that system won't be need befor next summer, offici said. the onli other problem wa with a zarya battery; the astronaut took up a replac part. the 36-foot, 25,000-pound uniti, the first american-mad compon, will serv as a connect passageway, or vestibul, for futur modul. it wa crucial that zarya and uniti be joined; if they could not be connect with the robot arm, nasa would have sent out two spacewalk astronaut to manual fit them togeth. in all, three spacewalk are plan for endeavour' 12-day flight, not onli to hook up electr connect between the two modul but to instal handrail and other tool for futur crew. the join modul will be releas from endeavour onc all of the work is complet. nasa estim 43 more launch and 159 more spacewalk will be need after thi mission to assembl the entir orbit complex. onc complet, the 16-nation space station will have a mass of 1 million pound, be longer than a footbal field, and hous up to seven astronaut and cosmonaut. russian space offici gave the first modul of the intern space station a routin tweak saturday to push it into higher orbit, and conven a meet on earth to map out it futur. flight control fire one of the module' two maneuv engin to rais it to an orbit about 230 kilomet (157 mile) in space, the station' public affair offic said. russian space agenc gener director yuri koptev told report the maneuv wa carri out with great accuraci, and the 24-ton core modul wa cruis through space without ani problem. the modul, call zarya, or sunris, lift off friday from the baikonur launchpad in kazakstan into an initi orbit 200 kilomet (125 mile) abov earth. zarya is to serv as a space tugboat in the earli stage of the intern project, provid propuls, power and commun. it will fli alon for two week befor a rendezv with the american space shuttl endeavour, which is to be launch dec. 3 carri the uniti connect modul. the intern space station is a u.s.-l successor to russia' mir space station, and is be herald by space offici as the vehicl for unpreced intern cooper in space in the 21st centuri. the head of the space agenc of the unit state, russia, japan and canada, along with the european space agenc, met in moscow on saturday to discuss the project, the interfax news agenc report. the space agenc head agre on a schedul for futur meet and on hold a scientif confer on the project somewher in europ, at an unspecifi date. also saturday, the head of russia' mission control, vladimir lobachev, wa quot as say that russia would take the lead role in manag the intern space station dure it first five year. previous, space offici have said the station would be jointli control from moscow and houston, with the us. space agenc nasa take a lead role. accord to interfax, lobachev said it made sens for russia to control the project becaus the russian-built zarya and a russian-built servic modul would perform most of the life support and navig function for the station' first five year. furthermor, russian engin are more experienc in thi job and nasa offici are awar of thi, he said. the space station is expect to cost at least dlr 40 billion, of which the unit state is expect to pay dlr 24 billion. russia' financ problem delay the initi launch by a year, and some critic have said the station amount to an expens way for nasa to keep russia' beleagu space program aliv. the station will serv as an orbit home for visit astronaut and cosmonaut for at least 15 year. endeavour' astronaut connect the first two build block of the intern space station on sunday, creat a seven-stori tower in the shuttl cargo bay. it wa the first time that the russian-built zarya control modul and the made-in-america uniti chamber had ever touch. it look to be a perfect and, hope, long-last fit. we have captur of zarya, command robert cabana announc the two piec came togeth. congratul to the crew of the good ship endeavour, repli mission control. that' terrif. the 240-mile-high construct job began two hour earlier with nanci currie' captur of zarya (russian for sunris) use the shuttl robot arm. we'r halfway home, cabana said. then came the hard part: stack the two giant cylind in the cargo bay. the two station piec are so big 77 feet from the tip of one to the tip of the other with a combin mass of 70,000 pound that curri and her crewmat had to reli on a computer vision system and camera view, rather than direct line of sight. thi wa the first time such a blind dock had ever been attempt. curri posit the solar-wing zarya, still on the end of the shuttl robot arm, sever inch directli abov uniti. it wa slow going; she want and need perfect align. onc she wa sure she had it, cabana fire endeavour' thruster, and the brief burst rais the shuttl and therebi uniti enough for the dock mechan on the two station compon to snap togeth. the histor moment occur abov the south pacif. the union intend to last the station' 15-year or more lifetim set the stage for a spacewalk by two astronaut on monday to attach electr connector and cabl between the two compon. mission control thought sunday' work might take hour longer than plan and gave the six astronaut plenti of time for the task. but everyth occur more or less when and how it wa suppos to, asid from a piec of space junk that stray too close. befor begin their final approach to zarya, the six astronaut had to steer clear of a chunk of a rocket launch last month from california. mission control order the pilot to fire the shuttl thruster to put an extra three mile between endeavour and the space junk, put endeavour a total of five mile from the orbit debri. the smaller gap would have been probabl a littl too close for comfort, mission control said. the bigger worri, by far, wa over endeavour' pursuit and captur of zarya, and it coupl with uniti. the shuttle' 50-foot robot arm had never befor handl an object as massiv as the 41-foot, 44,000-pound zarya, a power and propuls modul that wa launch from kazakstan on nov. 20. it will provid all of the necessari electr and steer for the fledgl space station until a perman control modul can be launch next summer. minut after zarya' captur, cabana call down that two antenna on the modul were still undeploy as russian flight control had fear. the antenna must be fulli deploy in order for zarya' manual dock system to work; that system won't be need befor next summer, offici said. the onli other problem wa with a zarya battery; the astronaut took up a replac part. the 36-foot, 25,000-pound uniti, the first american-mad compon, will serv as a connect passageway, or vestibul, for futur modul. it wa crucial that zarya and uniti be joined; if they could not be connect with the robot arm, nasa would have sent out two spacewalk astronaut to manual fit them togeth. in all, three spacewalk are plan for endeavour' 12-day flight, not onli to hook up electr connect between the two modul but to instal handrail and other tool for futur crew. the join modul will be releas from endeavour onc all of the work is complet. nasa estim 43 more launch and 159 more spacewalk will be need after thi mission to assembl the entir orbit complex. onc complet, the 16-nation space station will have a mass of 1 million pound, be longer than a footbal field, and hous up to seven astronaut and cosmonaut. russian space expert were make final prepar thursday at the baikonur rocket base to launch the first compon of a multibillion dollar intern space station after a year of delay. built by a russian compani and to be launch atop a russian booster rocket, the 24-ton zarya (sunris) control and cargo modul is a u.s.-fund compon of the station. it will serv as a space tugboat in the earli stage of the project, provid propuls, power and commun. the unman launch, set for 9:40 moscow time (0640 gmt) friday from baikonur in kazakhstan, ha been delay for one year mainli becaus of the cash-strap russian space agency' failur to complet anoth part of the station. after year of discuss, plan and replan, we are about to launch hardwar, gretchen mcclain, deputi associ administr for the new station, said at a news confer earlier thi week. we are readi to begin a project that will bring us into the millennium with women and men live and work in space perman. russian offici ad their tradit note of superstit. it is not in the russian tradit to prefac a launch with . some advanc statement. i would like to knock on wood, which is rather common in the russian tradit, said alexand krasnov, a deputi chief of russian space agency' man flight depart. the station, involv 16 nation with the unit state and russia play the biggest role, will consist of more than 100 element that will take 45 assembl flight to complet. it is due to be complet by 2004. the station will weigh 500 ton (more than a million pound) and is expect to cost at least dlr 40 billion, with the unit state plan to pay dlr 21 billion. it will serv as an orbit home for visit astronaut and cosmonaut for up to 20 year. zarya is to fli alon for two week befor a rendezv with the american space shuttl endeavor, which is to be launch dec. 3 carri the uniti connect modul. the shuttl crew will attach the two modul togeth in three space walk, use the endeavor robot arm. the 12.4-meter (41.2-feet) zarya hold more than 6 ton of fuel in it 16 tank and is capabl of fli independ for 430 day. it control system consist of 36 thruster and two larg engin for major orbit chang. it will be launch by a three-stag heavy-lift proton booster rocket that would put zarya into orbit in less than 10 minut after the blastoff. in the ensu day, the ground control will gradual adjust it orbit in prepar for the meet with endeavor. the space station will not be inhabit until earli 2000, follow the launch of a russian crew modul which is set to blast off next juli or august. russia ha repeatedli fail to meet deadlin for construct the crew modul, put the whole project behind schedul. have lost hope of get the promis govern fund, the russian space agenc ha sold it earli research time on the station to nasa for dlr 60 million to complet the segment. agenc chief yuri koptev said that take part in the new station is the onli hope for the beleagu russian space industri, whose fund ha collaps sinc the soviet collaps. the project would allow russia to keep up to 80,000 job over the next 15 year. koptev assail some russian space engin who continu to insist that more money should be put into russia' own batter 12-year old mir space station to extend it lifetim instead of commit more fund to the new space outpost. the choic mustn't be determin by emot. some peopl are glu to one thing (mir) and don't care about the rest, koptev said at a recent news confer. we must proceed from the understand of what would take us into the futur, allow us to preserv our industri. the russian khrunichev compani ha earn over dlr 200 million for build zarya, whose design wa base on earlier soviet spacecraft, includ some of the mir' six modul. washington nasa and the russian space agenc have agre to set asid a last-minut russian request to launch an intern space station into an orbit closer to mir, offici announc friday. while put the new station closer to russia' 12-year-old mir station would make it easier to transfer equip and suppli from the old outpost to the new one, the request came too late to be act on, said randi brinkley, nasa' space station program manag. nasa wa surpris last week when russia' prime station contractor propos the orbit posit chang just two-and-a-half week befor launch of the first part of the new station. delay the nov. 20 flight by 10 hour to match the orbit would have forc similar shift in the subsequ assembl flight, and result in potenti unfavor sun angl on the solar-pow station, engin said. we have mutual conclud that it would not be prudent to make these chang, brinkley said dure a news confer held at the johnson space center in houston. it ad technic complex and risk to the mission that were not justifi. the decis, which follow frank and candid discuss between the two partner, wa not impos by the unit state, he said. the conclus were mutual, brinkley said. both side conclud that it did not make sens. the russian, struggl to find money for their space program with their nation in econom collaps, had said they want to transfer thousand of pound of newer equip and scientif instrument from mir as an economi move. howev, some critic question the russians' motiv, wonder if the request orbit chang wa part of plan to delay the decommiss and destruct of mir, which the russian have agre to do next summer. the russian have so littl money that the unit state and other partner in the intern station fear that money spent on mir will prevent russia from meet it oblig with the new project. the mir compet with the intern space station for veri critic resourc and for fund, brinkley said. nasa will consid idea for salvag mir' research equip to use on the intern space station, he said, but onli if it doe not interfer with assembl the new station. the unit state and 15 other nation plan to begin build the new station in orbit next week when the russian launch a modul that will suppli power and propuls dure the earli stage of the five-year construct period. the space shuttl endeavor is to follow on dec. 3 with the second station part, a u.s.-built connect passageway that attach to the first modul. the first piec of the intern space station wa orbit earth friday, sprout antenna and unfold solar power panel as it await other segment, which will eventu grow into the largest orbit laboratori in histori. the modul, call zarya from the russian term mean sunris or dawn, took a flawless ride into space atop a three-stag russian proton booster rocket that lift off at 1:40 am. eastern time from the baikonur cosmodrom in kazakhstan. the launch wa wit by the head of the space agenc of the 16 nation that are sponsor the station, which will cost at least $40 billion to build over the next five year. zarya, built in russia with $240 million from the unit state, is to be join in two week by the first american modul, a dock hub call uniti. the space shuttl endeavour is to take off on dec. 3 to rendezv with zarya and attach the two unit. thi is to be follow by 43 more flight by american and russian rocket carri more than 100 part to be assembl in space to form a 900,000-pound research station hous up to seven astronaut. daniel goldin, the administr of nasa, said at a news confer follow the launch, now we onli have 44 launch to go, about 1,000 hour of space walk and countless problem. but becaus of all the partner nation trust each other and work togeth, he said, the intern space station is go to be a realiti. even as the new space station is come togeth, question continu about the fate of russia' exist space laboratori, the 12-year-old mir. becaus of the collaps of the russian economi, doubt that russia can produc enough rocket and other equip to support both project led russia to promis that it would abandon mir and destroy the station by next summer. howev, in recent week russian offici have been lobbi to find way to extend mir' life. accord to a report by the news agenc reuter, presid bori yeltsin' space advis, yevgeni shaposhnikov, said friday he wa prepar a number of propos on extend mir' life past the year 2000. support for such option ha been grow in recent week among russian space offici, astronaut and nationalist, who see mir as a symbol of russian achiev in space. jame van laak, nasa' deputi manag of oper for the space station, said friday that the agenc had not receiv ani formal propos about extend mir' life. nasa would find such a propos unaccept if it ha ani measur impact on the intern space station, van laak said in a telephon interview from the johnson space center in houston, no one ha ani object to mir or keep it oper if the russian find a way to support both project, but they have to demonstr they can. yuri koptev, head of the russian space agenc, said the launch of zarya, a 42,000-pound space tugboat that will suppli power and propuls in the earli stage of station construct, wa a need vindic for the troubl russian space program. the russian space industri is aliv and well and is perfectli abl to fulfil all of it commit on the intern space station, koptev said. a russian proton booster rocket carri the first part of the intern space station into orbit friday, herald the start of a new era in intern space colon. russian space offici and other cheer as ground control announc that the capsul had separ from it booster rocket and reach it first orbit at about 200 kilomet (125 mile) abov the earth. success, shout one exult offici some 10 minut after the giant rocket blast off and enter orbit. the head of the space agenc of 16 nation particip in the project watch the lift-off from a distanc of about 5 kilomet (3 miles). strateg rocket forc troop who had prepar the launch were in underground bunker to avoid poison by the highli toxic rocket fuel. russian and us. offici said the launch wa flawless and the modul perform well dure initi test. they caution that much work remain to be done to get the ambiti space station project up and work. now we onli have 44 launch to go, about 1,000 hour of space walk and countless problem, but becaus of the trust and mutual respect . the intern space station is go to be a realiti, nasa chief daniel goldin told a press confer after the launch. hi russian counterpart, yuri koptev, said the launch wa a vital vindic for the troubl russian space industri, prove it could play a major role in space oper. today we made a truli epoch-mak step to carri out thi project. the russian space industri is aliv and well and is perfectli abl to fulfil all of it commit on the intern space station, he said. the launch went smoothli, with the rocket soar into the cloudi sky abov the central asian stepp. the huge roar of the rocket reverber for dozen of kilomet (mile) across the empti plain around the base. the mood at the launch pad wa tens befor the launch, with space offici and worker anxious make last-minut check to ensur there were no problem. solar power panel on the modul were success deploy shortli after it reach it first orbit and all system were work normal, offici said. the launch of the russian cargo modul, which had been delay for more than a year, usher in a new era of cooper among former space-rac rival. space offici express optim that cooper would further promot world stabil follow the end of the cold war. we still have some contradict, we still have combat missil aim at each other, but the predomin trend is the state of cooper and do thing togeth, said yuri semyonov of russia' energia space compani. the 12.4-meter (41.2-feet) zarya, or sunris, wa launch by a three-stag proton booster rocket. zarya is design to serv as a space tugboat in the earli stage of the project, provid propuls, power and commun. engin finish final prepar earli friday for the liftoff of the 24-ton modul. the rocket blast off under cloudi sky and strong wind, and disappear behind the cloud 40 second later. the intern space station, the u.s.-l successor to russia' beleagu mir, involv 16 nation and is due to be complet by 2004. it will consist of more than 100 element that will take 45 assembl flight to complet. russia' crucial particip ha been hamper by the country' financi problem. the launch of the first segment wa postpon repeatedli, mainli becaus the chronic broke russian space agenc couldn't afford to complet anoth part of the station that is to go up later. zarya is to fli alon for two week befor a rendezv with the american space shuttl endeavor, which is to be launch dec. 3 carri the uniti connect modul. the space station will not be inhabit until at least earli 2000, follow the launch of a russian crew modul which is set to blast off next juli or august. the space station is expect to cost at least dlr 40 billion, with the unit state plan to pay dlr 24 billion. it will serv as an orbit home for visit astronaut and cosmonaut

sold research time on the station to nasa for dlr 60 million to complet the segment. russia rent the baikonur launch pad from kazakstan. endeavour and it astronaut close in sunday to captur the first piec of the intern space station, the russian-mad zarya control modul that had to be connect to the uniti chamber aboard the shuttl. stack the two giant cylind 240 mile abov the earth wa consid the most difficult part of the mission. the job fell to nanci curri, the shuttl crane oper who had deftli hoist and reposit uniti in the cargo bay on saturday. the two station piec are so big 77 feet from the tip of one to the tip of the other with a combin mass of 70,000 pound that curri and her crewmat were go to have to reli on a computer vision system and camera view, rather than direct line of sight. such a blind dock had never been attempt befor. mission control gave the astronaut plenti of time for the task. the main thing i'v tri to do for the last two year work on thi flight is make sure we have time. we have margin on everyth, said flight director bob castl. befor begin their final approach to zarya russian for sunris the shuttle' six astronaut had to steer clear of a chunk of a rocket launch last month from california. mission control order the pilot to fire the shuttl thruster to put an extra three mile between endeavour and the space junk, put endeavour a total of five

20. it will provid all the necessari electr and steer for the fledgl space station until a perman control modul can be launch next summer. the 36-foot, 25,000-pound uniti will serv as a connect passageway, or vestibul, for futur modul. in case zarya and uniti could not be connect with the robot arm, two spacewalk astronaut would have to manual fit them togeth. the astronaut would be go out anyway monday to attach electr connector and cabl between the two compon. in all, three spacewalk were plan for endeavour' 12-day flight. nasa estim 43 more launch and 159 more spacewalk will be need after thi mission to assembl the entir orbit complex. onc complet, the 16-nation space station will have a mass of 1 million pound, be longer than a footbal field, and hous up to seven astronaut and cosmonaut. two astronaut ventur back out on anoth spacewalk wednesday to attach antenna to the intern space station under construct nearli 250 mile abov earth. for the second time thi week, jerri ross and jame newman float out the hatch of the shuttl endeavour to work on the seven-stori, 35-ton station take shape in the open cargo bay. their no. 1 prioriti wa to attach two 100-pound antenna to uniti, the american-mad side of the space station. their other job, time permit, wa trickier: tri to open a stuck antenna on zarya, the russian-built control modul. the plan seven-hour spacewalk wa not nearli as difficult or crucial as monday night' outing, dure which ross and newman hook up 40 electr connect between zarya and uniti. the plan call for the men to lug two suitcase-s antenna about halfway up uniti and instal them on opposit side of the 36-foot cylind. onc activ, the antenna will provid a direct, virtual uninterrupt commun link between uniti and nasa' mission control. otherwis, us. flight control would have to reli on the sporad coverag provid by russian ground station. the electron and comput hookup for the antenna will be made insid uniti on thursday, after the entir crew enter the orbit station for the first time. other spacewalk chore for ross and newman on wednesday even includ erect a sunshad over a comput mount to the outsid of uniti. mission control decid just befor the spacewalk to let newman take a crack at unjam the zarya antenna. flight control urg caution. the antenna wa roll up on a spool, and engin worri the 3-foot strip might pop open with enough forc to hurt him if he got too close. newman had a 10-foot grappl hook for the job. the antenna is one of two that fail to open properli follow zarya' nov. 20 launch from kazakstan. one more spacewalk is plan for endeavour' 12-day mission: on saturday, ross and newman will conduct a photo survey and take out a sack of tool that will be use by futur station visitor. newman also may tri to unjam the other zarya antenna. thi wa the sixth spacewalk for ross dure hi 18-year nasa career, the most by an american, and the third for newman. ",NASA and the Russian Space Agency readied the first part of an international space station for launch from Baikonur base.They decided not to change the orbit of the Zarya module as Russia had requested.Zarya's Nov. 20 launch was a success.The Zarya module orbited Earth for 2 weeks before a rendezvous with U.S. shuttle Endeavor to join it to the Unity module.It was tweaked and working well.It will serve as a space tugboat.The first 2 building blocks of the international space station were successfully joined by Endeavor astronauts in the shuttle's open cargo bay.Endeavor astronauts made 2 of 3 planned spacewalks to work on the space station modules.,"Russia launched the first piece of the international space station into orbit a year after the originally scheduled date.The launch follows a last minute Russian request to change the orbit of the space station to put it closer to Mir.This request was set aside.Two weeks later, the U.S. carried the Unity chamber into orbit.U.S. astronauts aboard the Endeavor shuttle then joined the Unity chamber to the Russian Zarya control module.The resulting 7 story structure appeared to be a perfect fit.In a subsequent second space walk, the astronauts were to install antennas on the Unity chamber as well as to attempt to unjam a Russian antenna.","Jerry Ross and James Newman spacewalked to attach antennas to Unity, the American half of the first stage of the 16-nation space station.Unity will be a connecting passageway for other modules.The other portion of the fledgling station, the Russian- built and launched Zarya module, will provide power and propulsion to the facility.The successful launch of Zarya, which had been delayed over a year due to funding woes, was hailed by the Russian Space Agency head as proof that the Russian space industry ""is perfectly able to fulfill all of its commitments on the international space station"".Russia is scheduled to launch the crew module next year.","After a year's delay Russia launched the first unit of the international space station, then pushed it to a higher orbit.Zarya will provide propulsion, power, and comms.US shuttle Endeavour made a blind docking with Zarya.Two spacewalks made electrical connections with Unity, which will serve as a passageway, attached its antennas and attempted to open a stuck Zarya antenna.A Russian cost-cutting proposal to orbit the station closer to Mir jointly vetoed.Russia promised to destroy Mir but now wants to extend its life.Russia sold early research time on the station to NASA to pay construction costs but claims the management lead for 1st 5 years."
48,"caught in the middl of an econom crisi, mani brazilian factori fear they won't be abl to pay their worker the mandatori year-end bonu. so they'r consid pay with product instead of cash. some workplac have alreadi offer their employe such thing as hammer, nail, screw and bolt instead of the tradit cash bonu that normal is equival to one month' wage, said the head of brazil' largest feder of trade union. the idea is complet unaccept, said joao antonio felicio, secretary-gener of the feder, which repres more than 2,000 union and 19 million worker. we will recommend our union reject such a preposter propos. but strap for cash and punish by high interest rate and declin sale, factori owner may have no other choic, said joseph curi, presid of the sao paulo state associ of small industri, which repres 110,000 factori that employ nearli 800,000 worker. access to credit is almost imposs, curi said. if bank and the govern don't creat some kind of emerg credit line, the onli option mani of our associ will have will be to use product to pay the bonu. factori that produc cloth, shoe, food, toy and household applianc were the most enthusiast about the idea, curi said. curi predict even harsher time for brazil with the belt-tighten auster packag newli re-elect presid fernando henriqu cardoso is expect to announc tuesday. the measur, aim at curb the country' balloon budget deficit equal to about 7 percent of gross domest product are expect to includ spend cut and, possibl, more tax. there is a lot of talk of increas tax, which mean less cash circul in the market and more credit restrict, curi said. it is a shortsight approach that will spell more recess and the collaps of mani small factori. brazil ha been a major casualti of the global econom crisi, buffet by loss of investor confid and a strong outflow of capit. the country' foreign reserv have fallen below dlr 50 billion, from dlr 70 billion at the end of juli. in an effort to prevent a collaps of the nation' currenc, the real, and stem capit flight, interest rate were hike to 50 percent a year. for union leader felicio, the propos product-for-cash swap is a clear sign of the despair the busi sector is feel becaus of the recess econom polici brought by the real plan, the econom stabil program put togeth in 1994 when cardoso wa financ minist. the plan succeed in slash inflat from 2,400 percent to almost zero today. but it also brought recess and unemploy, which now stand at almost 8 percent, the highest in a decad. presid fernando henriqu cardoso' effort to repair the largest economi in latin america may depend on the outcom of thi weekend' gubernatori elect. cardoso want to impos tough measur that would slash govern spend and impos new tax to tri to halt the slide in brazil' economi and restor investor confid. but hi plan, expect to be unveil next week, must be approv by congress, and state governor have enorm sway over local deleg. the influenc governor have on their congression bloc is overwhelm, said univers of sao paulo polit scientist eduardo kugelma. brazil ha been caught up in the financi turmoil that began more than a year ago in southeast asia. as wari investor have fled it financi market, brazil' foreign reserv have fallen below dlr 50 billion from dlr 70 billion at the end of juli. on sunday, voter return to the poll for runoff elect in 12 state and in the feder district of brasilia. the outcom will like determin how success cardoso is in get congress to approv hi econom program, which is aim at trim the budget deficit. new incom, fuel and bank transact tax are expect to be propos. kugelma said oppon of the presid stand a good chanc of win in four larg state sao paulo, mina gerai, rio de janeiro and rio grand do sul. if they win, the presid will face a tough uphil battl, he said. cardoso need the governors' support not onli in influenc the congression deleg, but also in hold down their own spend. the problem is that none of the candid in sunday' elect . want to be identifi with unpopular auster measur, said kugelma. so they promis to spend more money on school, hospit and public work project. sao paulo, brazil' industri and financi powerhous, is perhap the state most critic to the success of cardoso' auster plan. with more than 34 million inhabit, nearli equal to the entir popul of neighbor argentina, it alon account for more than one-third of brazil' econom output and 70 of the 513 congression seat. while incumb governor mario cova, a cardoso alli who is seek re-elect, ha commit himself to the auster plan, cova oppon paulo maluf is a question mark. if maluf win, he will use hi victori as a launch pad to the presid in 2003, kugelma predict. and that mean he will tri to stay as far away as possibl from ani auster measur. brazil and the intern monetari fund move closer tuesday to agreement on an expect dlr 30 billion rescu packag for the world' ninth-largest economi. a joint statement by the imf and the brazilian govern said the two side agre brazil should aim to reduc it budget deficit from an expect eight percent of gross domest product to zero by 2000. the statement wa issu after weekend talk

govern promis, market analyst did not expect an announc until after the elect. instead, the strategi in brasilia and washington appear to focu on reassur the market that work on cut the deficit wa go forward, without provid fodder for oppon in domest elect. the discuss continu with the object of reach agreement soon on the detail program, said a joint statement by the imf and the brazilian financ ministri. becaus of brazil' enorm deficit, the collaps of emerg market ha hit the nation particularli hard, drain foreign currenc reserv and push the economi toward recess. financ offici in washington and around the world fear that a collaps of brazil, becaus of it size and link to other economi, would worsen financi instabl throughout the hemispher. with 160 million peopl, brazil repres the world' ninth-largest economi and is the financi engin of latin america. throughout the day, govern offici met with cardoso in brasilia and were expect to fine-tun a three-year auster packag that cardoso wa to discuss with congression parti leader on wednesday morn. in brasilia, offici said that among the measur be consid were a tax increas on financi transact, to three-tenth of a percent from two-tenth of a percent, and extend the fiscal stabil fund, which set asid 20 percent of all tax collect for presidenti discretionari spend. the fund wa to have expir by 1999. speak in washington, parent said that brazil would aim toward a surplu of 2.6 percent in 1999, 2.8 percent in 2000 and 3 percent in 2001. it had alreadi been announc, at the end of the imf' annual meet in washington two week ago that brazil would have to reach a primari account surplu of 2.5 percent to 3 percent to qualifi for imf aid. the primari account cover govern expens, without interest payment on debt. ernest brown, senior economist for latin america at morgan stanley dean witter, said sign that the brazilian govern and the imf were move closer to an aid packag were reassur, and that he did not expect much more than reassur until next week. i call thi the `we have a pope' scenario, brown said. you'r just go to hear that we have a pope, mayb see the white smoke rise, he said, and not figur out who the pope is until after the elect. the unit state is prepar to commit us. taxpay fund as part of a lend program of at least $30 billion to tri to insul brazil, and with it the rest of latin america, from the worst effect of the financi turmoil circl the globe, accord to us. and foreign offici assembl the program. detail of the us. contribut, which is expect to total sever billion dollar in direct aid or loan guarante, have yet to be negoti. but sever congression leader have been alert to the likelihood that the administr would have to act while congress is in recess. thi earli warn from the administr reflect memori of how congress erupt with object and hear in 1995 when presid clinton commit $20 billion in us. fund to the bailout of mexico. but administr offici said last week that their earli sound indic that member of congress are deepli concern about prevent an econom collaps in latin america that would resound in the unit state, and thu they expect few object. the time of an aid packag for brazil origin expect within the next few day is complic by unexpect delay that have crop up in deal with the brazilian govern. the govern of presid fernando henriqu cardoso face polit riski gubernatori elect on sunday, which may well determin whether brazil can execut an auster program that is the key condit for the loan it is concurr negoti with the intern monetari fund. the biggest role in the rescu program for brazil will be taken by the intern monetari fund, which said last week that it would contribut at least $15 billion and appear to be under pressur from the unit state to do even more. anoth $9 billion or so will come from the world bank and the inter-american develop bank, and the remaind from the unit state and other major industri nation. germani and japan, though, have been reluct to take part, one us. offici note, suggest that latin america is chiefli washington' problem, not their own. so far, us. offici work behind the scene to organ the aid packag have said noth in public about the detail of plan for a direct contribut to brazil. brazil is veri import to the econom well-b of the region, the unit state and the intern commun, and all of us are veri much focus on see how we can be help, treasuri secretari robert rubin said on friday. but in a wide-rang interview about the global econom turmoil, rubin declin to say what strategi he would pursu in deal with brazil' problem and insist that no decis had been made about how the unit state might contribut. but he discuss brazil as an opportun to engag in the kind of prevent financi diplomaci that presid clinton advoc in speech to the imf and the world bank here three week ago. at the time, clinton argu that the monetari fund should provid conting financ to help countri ward off global financi contagion rather than wait for disast to strike. direct us. aid to brazil would clearli send a symbol message: that after a year of tri to manag the financi crisi through the monetari fund, the unit state is now readi to put a limit amount of it own capit at risk to prevent further havoc not onli for brazil but to stop chao spread to argentina, mexico and other countri that are major us. trade partner. that would be a chang of strategi. so far, the unit state ha oper almost entir through intern financi institut, chiefli the imf but it would also be a riski move for presid clinton, econom and polit. even though congress object to the $20 billion in us. fund commit to the bailout of mexico, it turn out that onli $12 billion wa ultim need, and it ha sinc been paid back, with interest. but rubin note on friday that it' a veri differ environ now. other administr offici say they believ that there would be few object in congress to direct us. particip in a brazil bailout. i think there are a lot more peopl in congress who are now scare to death by what' been happen in the market, and what could happen in their own district, a white hous offici said last week, and they won't say much as long as they don't have to vote on it. by act soon to stabil latin america, the administr is hope to capit on two week of rel calm after the late-summ panic that engulf russia and, at it height, led to an outflow of a billion dollar a day from brazil, for fear that it would be the next countri forc to devalu it currenc. whether thi calm mark the begin of a turnaround or just anoth paus in the wildfir that have erupt sinc thailand' currenc crisi in juli 1997 is a matter of consider debat. but mani expert cite the confluenc of sever event that have reassur jitteri investor around the world: two success interest-r cut in the unit state, japan' long-delay move to prop up it bank system with $500 billion in taxpay fund, and a steadi strengthen of currenc in thailand, indonesia and south korea, the first sign that investor may be prepar to return. alway circumspect when it come to comment publicli on market, rubin acknowledg that in the last sever week there have been a number of signific, posit develop. but the former trader, burn dure a 26-year career by mani fals market ralli, warn that seriou issu remain and that it will take some time for the world to work it way out of what he ha repeatedli call the most seriou intern financi disrupt of the last 50 year. in fact, rubin' aid are clearli nervou about the possibl of anoth outbreak that could set off a new round of panic, which ha made it virtual imposs for mani emerging-market countri to borrow money on world market. brazil and japan are the two obviou tinderbox, said jeffrey garten, dean of the yale school of manag, who serv as undersecretari of commerc for intern affair dure clinton' first term. in brazil, the issu is whether the packag that is come togeth will realli be big enough to deal with an explod debt problem. and in japan the question is whether there is real reform that goe along with the money. but after spend 18 month in negoti with the japanes, rubin clearli sens that the unit state ha littl leverag in tokyo; it problem are chiefli root in polit gridlock, not lack of resourc. in brazil, though, the unit state ha a better chanc of buy time and influenc an econom reform program, as long as it doe not appear to be dictat term publicli to cardoso and hi team. but demonstr econom support will probabl requir tap the exchang stabil fund, creat dure the roosevelt administr to help stabil the dollar. the money is under rubin' control, with presidenti approv, and he reach into it to circumv congression object to aid mexico in 1995. but the reaction wa so strong for a time congress restrict tap the fund for intern bailout that rubin ha been extraordinarili cautiou ever sinc. he commit $3 billion in a second line of defens in emerg aid program for indonesia and south korea last year, but no money wa ultim dispers to either countri. us. offici said that south korea did not need the extra help, and that the collaps of the suharto govern in indonesia so chang the polit scene there that it would be too riski to offer direct us. aid. in the bailout of russia whose economi collaps after presid bori yeltsin abandon an agreement to reform the economi and dismiss the lead reform the unit state offer no direct help. those event set off a panick exit by investor from all emerg market, and greatli worsen brazil' troubl. so far, brazilian offici have success calm the market by constantli talk about a forthcom aid program from the imf, convinc specul that it would be danger to bet against the countri. but at the same time, the brazilian offici have maintain the pose that they do not realli need the cash and are certainli in no hurri to get it. us. offici and top offici of the imf are clearli nervou, worri that the longer the negoti drag on, the greater will be the risk of brazil be caught in anoth round of market turmoil. the brazilian want everyon to think that it' all under control, said an invest banker involv in the talk. but the fact is that there' still a real risk that sometim in the next 18 month the govern is go to be forc to devalu it currenc, which is peg to the dollar, but adjust about 7.5 percent a year in a care control fall. to prevent a sudden devalu, the brazilian govern ha had to rais interest rate to more than 50 percent, choke off credit for most compani. meanwhil, the countri is slip into recess. the aid would buy time for the brazilian, but it is conting on cardoso' success in persuad the legislatur to end huge deficit, chiefli through unpopular cut in social spend. the first deputi manag director for the intern monetari fund, stanley fischer, spent friday in brazil to review the country' auster plan, which is expect to be announc after sunday' elect but befor the intern packag, to avoid the appear that the global lender is dictat condit to brazil. brazil ha to do a lot, fischer said last week befor leav on hi trip. in return, i expect the intern commun will make a larg contribut. leader from 19 latin american nation, spain and portug put finish touch saturday on an ibero-american summit declar warn of global recess unless action is taken to stabil the intern financi system. the draft declar said recent financi market turmoil show that adjust must be made quickli to keep the difficulti affect a few from becom a crisi for all. the declar address the world' seven richest nation. the group of seven is compos of the unit state, japan, britain, germani, franc, itali and canada. the final declar will be approv at sunday' summit in thi port citi in northern portug. brazilian presid fernando henriqu cardoso said saturday that brazil and china, two of the world' largest economi, had becom the dike of resist to global recess. protect their economi from the spread econom turmoil, which is affect more countri than at ani time sinc the earli 1980, is key to world econom stabil, he said. brazil is latin america' biggest economi and the eighth-largest in the world, and it econom collaps could take the rest of the contin with it. to halt brazil' slide toward recess, cardoso is prepar auster measur includ spend cut, tax hike and lower interest rate. the reform would help brazil qualifi for an intern monetari fund rescu packag estim at dlr 30 billion. the imf ha put togeth bailout packag total dlr 137 billion sinc the financi crisi struck thailand 15 month ago and then spread from asia to russia. us. presid bill clinton' administr, awar of the impact that a latin american recess would have on the unit state, ha activ push the imf and the world bank to support brazil after it wa hit

american economi, report that the nation' trade deficit widen by $2.2 billion in august to $16.77 billion. that is the widest gap sinc the govern recalcul the way it measur trade flow in 1992. it result from a declin in american export and a sharp increas in what thi countri buy from abroad. so far thi year, the trade deficit is run roughli 50 percent abov last year' level and is up to a project $170 billion for the year, a gap that is expect to widen even further. one senior administr offici who deal with econom issu, speak on condit of anonym, said tuesday that intern project suggest that the trade deficit in 1999 could reach $300 billion, a figur that he said will certainli cut into growth, and could well becom a major polit problem. trade deficit carri with them both good and troubl signal about the economi. the current flood of import is help contain inflat to some of the lowest level in decad. and while sale of american aircraft, comput chip and other good are suffer, the weaken of the dollar on world market in recent week may provid an end-of-the-year boost for american export. but at thi moment of global upheav, the biggest problem face american compani is the inabl of mani nation and some larg compani in asia and latin america simpli to borrow money to make ordinari purchas. the result is such a freez of econom activ that empti ship contain are stack up on american pier. and the effect are hurt everyon from midwest farmer who can no longer send wheat to an impoverish russia, to east coast fishermen who are discov that japan' appetit for

deepli troubl state-own industri and an incipi bank crisi have signal to the unit state in recent week that they have littl interest in ani swift move to open their market further in return for entri into the world trade organ. that amount to a major setback for presid clinton, who for three year ha been use the negoti over china' entri to the world bodi as the centerpiec of hi effort to open china both econom and polit. ostens progress in thi area ha been cite by the administr until recent as one of the success of the administration' china polici, but now offici say privat that the

danger state that everyon suspect is attempt to break out of it 1994 agreement to freez it nuclear weapon project, in return for billion in western energi aid. yet washington ha never call on the starv north korean to revolt against kim' repress regim. hi govern, take a page out of the saddam playbook, suggest last week that if the unit state realli want to look at a mountain tunnel that the pentagon believ is a nuclear instal in the make, it should write a check for anoth $300 million. no one even call for kim' remov when, a few month ago, he lob a three-stag missil over japan just to show he knew how. the rule for call for the end of a regim are pretti murki, said richard feinberg, a professor at the univers of california at san diego who serv in the clinton administration' first term. when they realli want to push someon out, it is becaus that countri is part of a larger strateg concern at the time. but the countri itself usual doesn't have great strateg weight it' anoth matter to call for a chang of leadership in beij or moscow and it help if there is some kind of domest opposit that we can point to. clinton' call for saddam' ouster last weekend creat bare a rippl becaus, after all, he is a proven murder and an avid stockpil of anthrax and plutonium (even if brent scowcroft, who wa presid georg bush' nation secur advis, insist last week that saddam nowaday is simpli an irrit, an annoy, a pest and a problem, but not a threat to the region at the moment). mahathir, howev, is far more complex case. he' a prime exampl of how oppos washington' polit and econom agenda for an interconnect world can move a leader from the list of authoritarian whom washington toler to the list of authoritarian who have outliv their use. like other asian strongmen ferdinand marco of the philippin and suharto of indonesia come to mind he wa use when the fear wa that malaysia would becom a communist domino. but he also seem emin toler long after the cold war wa over. he ha never been accus of enorm corrupt. he turn hi countri into a model of competit, and malaysia becam the exemplar of the big emerg market that clinton' commerc depart tout until thing went sour last year. sure, he wa alway prickli. but he is no terrorist or killer us. compani have flock to hi countri, and say they want to stay and hi iron control over polit discours is no stronger than in neighbor singapor. just thi summer, us. treasuri secretari robert rubin paid him an ostens friendli, if strain, visit and made no refer to human right. that all chang when ibrahim wa arrest and beaten in jail. he ha long been an advoc of the western-styl solut to econom turmoil more open, more freedom and the protest movement against mahathir onli surfac onc he wa in jail. gore leapt on that opportun particularli strike becaus, in the case of indonesia earlier thi year, it took the administr month to come to the conclus that presid suharto had to go. he went.

50,"it wa a surpris scene three month ago when denni rivera, one of new york city' most left-lean labor leader, wa sing the prais of sen. alfons m. d'amato. rivera, presid of the largest union in new york citi, prais d'amato for persuad trent lott, the senat major leader, to support legisl that financ health coverag for hundr of thousand of uninsur children. it look as if rivera' polit potent union might endors d'amato or at the veri minimum stay neutral in thi year' us. senat race in new york. but on monday, rivera' 150,000-member union, 1199, the nation health and human servic employe union, endors rep. charl e. schumer, d-n.y., and therebi risk d'amato' wrath. the endors is riski, labor leader acknowledg, becaus anger thi power senat could make him far less respons to labor' need when union turn to him for help in the futur if he is re-elect. although it may seem illog, two word go far to explain whi rivera' union back schumer: monica lewinski. larg as a result of the lewinski scandal, democrat say they suddenli fear that the republican will gain a filibuster-proof, 60-seat major in the senat, where the republican have 55 seat to the democrats' 45. for labor leader like rivera, the notion of a strong republican major is a nightmar. that fear ha help push other new york union into schumer' column, even though d'amato had long court them. those union includ the teamsters' joint council in new york citi and district council 37, an umbrella group repres 120,000 municip employe. labor leader say they fear that with a filibuster-proof republican major, the senat would push through anti-union legisl, like recent defeat republican propos to curb labor' polit spend and cut financ for the nation labor relat board. we are worri about legisl that will not allow the labor movement to surviv into the next centuri, rivera said. alarm that the democrat will lose senat seat in california, illinoi, wisconsin, nevada and south carolina, rivera' union conclud that it wa worth back schumer. the decis, rivera emphas repeatedli, wa not person but wa base on nation consider. unfortun, the leadership of the republican parti at the nation level in the person of newt gingrich and trent lott are not necessarili from the same cultur as the republican of the northeast, he said. they'r far more conserv, far more anti-labor, far more anti-work, far more pro-busi. we fear that the democrat parti face irrelev in the unit state senat if we go below 41 seat. tri to avoid a ruptur with d'amato, rivera prais him as an effect senat. the endors could be a boon for schumer. rivera' union and the teachers' union have labor' strongest polit oper in new york. in addit, schumer will get thousand of dollar from the local as well as use of it renown phone bank, which can make 50,000 polit call a day. a spokesman for d'amato said, al d'amato' proud that he' been endors by over 100 union feder and local, repres more that 400,000 work men and women, and he'll continu hi effort on behalf of work middl class famili. hi labor endors includ the new york citi patrolmen' benevol associ and the new york state build and construct trade council. besid the back of 1199, schumer also receiv the endors of 1199' parent union, the servic employe intern union, which ha 350,000 member in new york state. rivera who did not support d'amato the last time he ran either announc the endors dure the found convent of the new york state council of the servic employe union. the convent pack town hall, and the new group aim to make the servic employe a power to be reckon with by bring togeth a dozen union local to forg a common polit and legisl strategi. earlier thi year, 1199 merg with the servic employe, and as part of that agreement, rivera becam head of the servic employe in new york state. nearli 60 year behind the time, the hous vote friday to condemn the nazi-soviet nonaggress pact of 1939. the measur, a nonbind resolut, wa brought to the floor by rep. john shimku, r-ill. he is of lithuanian descent, ha a pocket of lithuanian in hi hometown of collinsvil and want to tri to highlight hi support for the baltic states' past effort against soviet repress. shimkus' measur is an exampl of how member of congress are spend their time as they stand idl and wait for republican leader to reach agreement on spend bill with the white hous, thu avoid a govern shutdown and allow them to go home and campaign for the novemb elect. with time on their hand, mani republican are use the hous floor as their person stage to elicit vote on topic that they can boast about to the folk back home. most of these matter have littl chanc of find their way into law, but member hope to turn them to their advantag on elect day. there are plenti of other item whose sponsor hope will not attract attent. these tend to be special-interest matter that member hope will escap scrutini in the rush to leav town. the sponsor of these measur now have the ad advantag of the impeach inquiri, which ha been preoccupi congress, the news media and the public and give them cover to move their pet caus quietli into the gigant omnibu packag that congress will eventu present to clinton for sign. these quieter measur includ one propos by mississippi' two senat, trent lott and thad cochran, both republican. they want agricultur export credit to buy chicken for russia, which ha bought the chicken but cannot pay for them. the chicken are from mississippi. democrat have littl influenc in the republican-control congress. but some democrat are close enough to republican leader, and to republican goal, that their measur are taken serious. these includ rep. john murtha, d-pa., the rank democrat on the nation secur subcommitte of the appropri committe, who is push a measur to increas militari pension. perhap the best exampl of an attempt to forc a vote for polit advantag is a measur that would requir minor to notifi their parent if they are seek contracept from feder fund famili plan clinic. hous leader allow the measur to be brought to the floor as a way to appeas the more conserv member, who believ they have been shortchang by the budget process. it pass the hous by a vote of 224-200 but ha almost no chanc of becom law. the senat doe not plan to take it up, and clinton would almost certainli veto it. but rep. tom coburn, r-okla., said that vote like these were import becaus they put their sponsors' ideolog foe on the record as oppos someth that sound reason, and that opposit can be use against them in the nov. 3 elect. it wa not a voic mail messag that dr. marilyn rymer, a neurologist in kansa citi, mo., would routin delet, even as a regist democrat. speaker newt gingrich' offic, it said, wa call to discuss a nation leadership award. dr. rymer ha won acclaim as the director of a promin stroke-treat center, but thi proposit seem particularli grand. when she return the call, she said she wa told she would also be name honorari chairman of an elit committe to advis gingrich on legisl. too good to be true? well, dr. rymer would have to pay her own way if the committe should actual meet, and as an honorari committe chairman, she discov, she would be a member of a committe compos entir of honorari chairmen. and oh, the speaker want a donat of $500 to $1,000 to help our effort, accord to a transcript of a similar chat with anoth doctor, to elect a bigger republican major in the hous of repres. with the approach of the midterm elect next month, it turn out that the nation republican congression committe, which support candid for the hous, ha been sponsor similar call to ten of thousand of small-busi owner, includ doctor. with thi and other fund-rais program, the committe say it ha amass $62 million for the elect. but campaign financ watchdog say the solicit mark a new departur in polit fund rais, one they call akin to the practic of market compani like the publishers' clear hous that hook consum with vision of million-dollar windfal to induc them to subscrib to magazin. by cite the speaker and promis celebr and influenc, they say, the call are a bait-and-switch scheme to seiz the attent of peopl who might otherwis hang up. dr. rymer say she wa incens. so wa dr. stanley turecki, a child and famili psychiatrist in new york who vote as an independ and wa also call. i wa absolut outrag, he said. anybodi els who would do that would fall into the categori of consum fraud. kenneth gross, a washington lawyer who special in elect law and repres both democrat and republican client, said, i have never heard of that particular devic. but it doesn't appear illeg, he said, ad, it' a fund-rais gimmick to get attent. fred wertheim, presid of democraci 21, a nonprofit, nonpartisan advoc of campaign financ reform, said, thi is a new version of caveat emptor buyer be damn instead of buyer bewar. when busi do it, he ad, congress order investig. but thi isn't go to be investig becaus it' member of congress who are do it. todd harri, a spokesman for the nation republican congression committe, said that he had not heard of ani complaint and that there wa no intent to deceiv. the nation leadership award is a part of what we call donor and member fulfil, harri said. it' part of bring them into the process. it' import that they be recogn for the support they give the parti. there' no quid pro quo that peopl solicit could receiv award for past contribut, he ad. what most peev dr. rymer and turecki is the messag left with secretari and answer machin invok gingrich' offic and propos the award. they say they envis a senior aid at a telephon in the speaker' chamber under the capitol dome. the call, howev, are not place by aid to gingrich, by ani of hi offic or by anyon in washington. they are made by peopl with headset and comput at the home of infocis manag corp., a telemarket firm and congression committe client in akron, ohio. on it web page, infocis say it 1,400 employe oper 1,584 telephon line and 9 phone center. everi word in the script is approv by our client, the compani say on it web site. everi conceiv object is script with a power rebutt. besid telemarket for busi, said jami blair, a supervisor at the center, we special in help the republican parti and conserv polit group. howev far they are from gingrich, the telemarket are instruct to answer return call with: republican congression committe, newt gingrich' offic. may i help you? a doctor in kansa citi, mo., who is a regist republican and who declin to be name, dial the gingrich number (888-484-1644) left on answer machin and secretli record the ensu discuss, which is legal in missouri. we were ask to contact you on behalf of the speaker, say a woman who pick up the call and identifi herself as nanci. he is right now aggress push legisl to cut tax by as much as half, and he' also interest in legisl to cut capit gain to a singl rate of 15 percent. to assur passag of the legisl, the speaker want to increas hi republican major, she say, ad, to help us do that, the speaker is pull togeth a group of individu such as yourself and is invit you to be an honorari chairman on hi advisori council. nanci continues: there will be correspond with the speaker, such as confer call. it' a great way that he can get your input and thought on legisl that doe concern you. or mayb survey or questionnair. later, nanci says: as a member of hi committe, you would be receiv from the speaker our nation leadership award, which is realli quit an honor. and to be honest, he will be ask each of our chairmen if they could help our effort to increas our major with a one-tim contribut of $500 or $1,000. now that would be use on the nationwid media campaign that newt ha undertaken to target those seat we realli need. and as someon who i'm sure would also benefit from thi, could i tell the speaker he could count on your help? the doctor demur. i am a regist, you know, republican in kansa, she tell nanci. probabl if i were to do someth it would be to go through my own repres. then the doctor tri to ascertain where nanci is locat. is thi congressman gingrich' offic that i'm talk to? the doctor ask. the speaker' offic, say nanci. thi is the speaker' offic. that i'm talk to, say the doctor, double-check. uh-huh, nanci repli. the law prohibit polit fund-rais call from feder offic. vice presid al gore is under a justic depart investig for fund-rais call he allegedli made from hi offic in the 1996 presidenti campaign. but the call can be made from just about anywher els, includ campaign offic. harri said the call are in no way relat to the speaker' offici offic. he added: what is more import is not where the call get rout. peopl are more interest in an award with the speaker' good name on it than whether the call get rout to washington or ohio. turecki disagre. i see it as basic sleaz, he said. the last time georg voinovich ran for offic, he won re-elect as ohio' governor with 72 percent of the vote, stun even hi most optimist support and set a 20th-centuri record for victori margin in ohio polit. thi year, voinovich, a republican who is bar from seek a third term, is run again, thi time for the senat seat held by john glenn, a democrat who is retir. and while there are few who expect voinovich to repeat hi elector benchmark of four year ago, politician of both parti gener acknowledg that he is well posit to increas the republican major in the senat. that ha not prevent voinovich' democrat oppon, mari boyl, from undertak a vigor campaign. ms. boyl, a former commission in cuyahoga counti, which encompass cleveland, is crisscross the nation' seventh-most popul state in what she describ as a grass-root campaign that, while oper on a compar shoestr, ha nonetheless attract to her side nation known democrat presid clinton foremost among them on the campaign trail. glenn, the former astronaut who is prepar to return to space thi month at the age of 77, ha not made an endors in the senat race. like mani candid thi year, ms. boyl, 55, is campaign hard on the issu of educ, seek to portray voinovich, 61, as a lacklust steward who allow the state' school to declin. he promis to be the educ governor, said ms. boyl. but after seven and a half year he ha fail the student of thi state. her role in the campaign, she said, is to remind the peopl of the state of ohio that georg voinovich made a promis and that he didn't deliv on it. specif, she discuss a decis last year by the ohio suprem court that cite wide dispar in the qualiti of the state' school and rule unconstitut the formula for fund them. she ha also attack her republican oppon for support a propos to rais the state' sale tax by one percent. under that plan, half the addit fund would have been use for school improv with the remaind earmark for reduc properti tax. that statewid ballot initi last may prove to be wildli unpopular, with about 80 percent of the voter oppos it. while the topic of tax and educ are hot one thi polit season in ohio, it is not clear that ms. boyle' emphasi on them ha help her campaign. despit some narrow in the opinion poll, she is still trail voinovich by 15 percentag point in some poll and as much as 20 point in other. there is also a sharp fund-rais dispar. ms. boyl, who is run her first statewid race and ha widespread union support, ha rais nearli $2 million so far, far less than the nearli $7 million voinovich ha taken in. also, voinovich, a former lieuten governor, ha been on statewid ballot five time over the last 20 year and thu is the better-known candid. the elector dynam of ohio are also aid voinovich. the northern half of the state, with it histori of industri, union citi, ha a tradit of vote larg for democrat candid, while the southern tier of the state is consid more conserv and typic lean republican. but voinovich and ms. boyl share the same home terrain, depriv ms. boyl of the geograph advantag that often accompani democrat candid. inde, as a boy, voinovich onc deliv newspap to the boyl home in the working-class collinwood section of cleveland. and voinovich, a former mayor of cleveland, ha develop a reput as a moder republican who work well with democrat. voinovich, while campaign vigor himself, is keep a full schedul of offici duti, assum the role of the experienc, elect offici. if i get into the senat, i will probabl know more about domest polici than ani member of the senat, he said in an interview on wednesday in canton, sandwich between a ribbon-cut ceremoni and a fund-rais recept at a vacuum cleaner museum. as mayor, i had my nose rub into the problem of urban america and wa fairli success in deal with them. and, as governor, i have dealt with the problem of medicaid, welfar and educ. i'm the onli person in the unit state who ha been presid of the nation leagu of citi and chairman of the nation governor associ. to hi opponent' charg on hi record on educ, voinovich is dismiss. i'm probabl the onli republican in the unit state who ha been endors by the ohio educ associ and nation educ associ, he said, ad that ms. boyl wa a member of the state legislatur dure the period cite in the suprem court rule. mari boyl wa vice chairman of the way and mean committe and a member of the democrat leadership dure those year, voinovich said. they did noth to fix the build, they did noth for technolog and the urban school district. ms. boyl, who ha not yet begun to run campaign commerci on televis, said her statu as the underdog had allow me to be more focus, more intens. paus after a campaign fund-rais breakfast with former democrat sen. bill bradley of new jersey here on wednesday, ms. boyl said: thi ha been a marathon and it' been pretti much uphil. but now, we'r down to the last three mile. it' a tough race. in a cocoon of loyal and wealthi support, presid clinton said friday that he must live with the consequ of hi mistak, although he contend that democrat should take pride in the achiev of hi presid and take heart from it possibl. clinton ha stop apolog for hi conduct with monica lewinski, but he ha taken to make glanc, at time humbl, refer to it, befor move on to attack the republican congress as indiffer to americans' need. he did so friday at a seri of fund-rais. in one deft sentenc, he acknowledg hi person pain while claim credit for the country' econom strength, make a compact appeal for both sympathi and support in an appear earlier in the day in cleveland. after thank the gather donor for the veri kind person thing they had said to him, the presid declar, if i had to do it all over again, everi day, i would do it in a heartbeat, to see america where it is today as compar to six year ago. as the applaus die away, clinton continu, i want you to understand, too, that we all have to live with the consequ of our mistak in life. he ad with a chuckle: most of us don't have to live with it in quit such a public way. but nobodi get out of life for free. to the music of a saxophon and a hammer dulcim, clinton rais about $200,000 over lunch in a privat home in cleveland for the democrat senat candid in ohio, mari boyl. then he flew to philadelphia to rais half a million dollar for the democrat parti. by midsumm, the president' aid were delight to have persuad him to condens hi fund-rais remark to just 10 minut of polici point and partisan jab. but as hi troubl have grown and the mid-term elect have approach, hi free-form remark have becom longer. in cleveland on friday, he spoke for 26 minut and here on friday even he spoke for almost 20 minut. these fund-rais visit have fallen into a pattern sinc clinton' videotap grand juri testimoni on aug. 17. he is laud, applaud and embrac by hi host and the donor. mr. presid, these are your friend here today, said toni georg, the host of the cleveland event, offer the refrain of those who have play a similar role. but in cleveland as elsewher, protest who were scatter along the president' motorcad rout were remind of call for hi resign and impeach, and of the mockeri some are heap upon hi presid. at a ralli for the presid outsid citi hall here friday night a group of teamster chant, two more year. clinton' motorcad rout wa line downtown with hundr of peopl, some of them carri support or condemnatori sign. after an impromptu shop trip, dure which he wa greet with shout of we love you, clinton told some donor at the begin of an impass repris of hi cleveland speech: i didn't even mind the protest, that' the american way. but, he ad, he prefer it when they were in the minor, and that seem to be the case. as he rode into cleveland, clinton pass a billboard for a local radio station, wncx. lovin', touchin', squeezin', it read, the word superimpos on a cartoon of the presid with hi arm over ms. lewinsky' shoulder, the washington monument besid them. the presid left it to hi aid on friday to respond directli to the latest gusher of grand juri disclosur in washington. instead, in hi remark, clinton spoke with pride of hi record and with urgenc about address the intern econom crisi and the need of struggl farmer and schoolchildren. as he typic doe now befor such partisan audienc, he also walk through hi polit calcul for the mid-term elect. clinton said in cleveland that republican had brag privat to him about their prospect. they tell me, `oh, we'r go to do veri well, mr. presid, in these mid-term becaus we have so much more money than you do,' and becaus democrat who turn out to re-elect clinton would not return to the poll in an off-year. that argument, of cours, would also insul clinton from ani blame for depress the democrat vote. but he often goe further than that, say that hi predica could actual help the democrat. lower-incom democrat voter, he said, might not bother to vote in a typic elect. the peopl that were good enough to serv you here at thi event today, they'v got a lot of hassl in their life, he said. but, he said, advers is our friend, becaus it can overcom apathi and focu us on what is at issu here. what should be at issu, clinton said, are hi achiev and agenda and the republicans' record, which he describ harshli. what have they done? he ask in cleveland. they kill the minimum wage increas for 12 million american. they kill campaign financ reform. they kill the tobacco reform legisl. white hous offici and gay democrat, concern that the nation' largest gay and lesbian polit organ is about to endors sen. alfons d'amato for re-elect, are intens lobbi the group to tri to shift it support to the democrat challeng, rep. charl schumer. publicli, offici in the organ, the human right campaign, said they were still deliber their posit in the close watch race, consid among the tightest in the nation. they said they would probabl make an endors by friday. but privat, organ offici and gay activist from both parti who have been monitor the debat say the group is most like to endors d'amato, a republican seek hi fourth term. they also rais the possibl that the group would endors both candid, or remain neutral. if the group endors d'amato, said offici who spoke on the condit of anonym, the endors would be base on three major factors: the group tend to favor incumb, ha been search for alli among the senat republican major and consid d'amato' recent record on gay issu to be quit strong. an endors by the group, which is held in high regard by mani gay and lesbian voter, could prove import in swing voter to d'amato in a tight race. it would also be a major symbol victori for the senat, who ha sought to recast himself as a centrist in recent year and could use the endors to build hi stand among moder swing voter. a d'amato endors would also weaken schumer' effort to portray the incumb as a right-w extremist and would signifi to mani voter a fray of the tradit democrat coalit that ha includ black and gay voter, women and labor union. the intens of the debat surround the endors underscor the import of the new york senat race to democrat across the nation, who see defeat d'amato as one of their best opportun to prevent the republican from gain 60 seat in the senat enough to stop a democrat filibust. the republican current hold a 55-to-45 major. there is sentiment in the commun that if the republican get 60 vote, that trent lott will basic be in charg polit for the next two year, said david mixner, a close friend of presid clinton' who is gay. he wa refer to the senat major leader, who ha call homosexu a sin and liken it to kleptomania. saturday, schumer pick up hi own endors from new york' largest gay and lesbian polit organ, the empir state pride agenda. although the human right campaign is bipartisan, it ha been veri close to the clinton administr, ha mani democrat on it board and receiv much of it money from democrat contributor. larg becaus of the group' strong democrat tie, gay democrat, new york liber and white hous offici are infuri that it is even consid endors d'amato, who also run on the right to life and conserv parti line and often receiv high rate from the christian coalit, which typic oppos legisl on civil right for gay peopl. although the organ ha been thought to be inch toward a d'amato endors for month, the lobbi campaign for schumer ha pick up intens in the last two week, driven partli by a grow sens that the race is now closer than ever. democrat and advoc in both parti who support right for gay peopl said that vice presid al gore, hillari rodham clinton and secretari for health and human servic donna shalala have made person appeal to human right campaign offici urg them not to endors d'amato. white hous offici said they did not know whether the three had made such appeal, and human right campaign offici declin to comment. schumer met privat with the group' top offici last week to make one last pitch for the endors. clinton administr offici have also been buttonhol the group' board member at everi opportun, from cocktail parti to fund-rais, rais concern about a d'amato endors. some new york advoc of civil right for gay peopl have flood the organ with phone call, e-mail messag and letter. democrat offici have been encourag the group' major donor to express their opposit to d'amato. peopl involv in the lobbi effort said that at best, they are hope the group will endors both candid, or make no endors at all. chuck schumer ha been a strong support of issu that are import to gay commun, said a senior white hous offici who spoke on the condit of anonym. the last thing that they should want to do is hurt the candidaci of someon who ha been so support of their agenda. the human right campaign is consid the most influenti gay and lesbian organ in washington, with a nation membership of 250,000 and an annual budget of more than $13 million. the group wa creat in the earli 1980 in larg part to counter the rise of the christian right and ronald reagan. paradox, d'amato wa first elect in the reagan landslid of 1980 and remain a strong support of presid reagan. for d'amato, who ha aggress court gay voter, the endors would repres a crown achiev in hi effort to reposit himself as a moder. sinc 1993, the senat ha back the right of gay citizen to serv in the militari, sponsor legisl to prevent job discrimin against gay worker and oppos hi own leadership' attempt to block the nomin of two openli gay men to posit in the clinton administr. to gay support of d'amato, an endors by the human right campaign would signifi the polit matur of the gay elector and help the organ insul itself from accus that it is too close to the democrat parti. those who support a d'amato endors, includ top offici within the human right campaign, contend that in the current polit climat, where congress is almost certain to remain under republican control after novemb, gay peopl must build allianc with moder republican. human right campaign offici also say their stand polici is to support friendli incumb, even when their challeng have better vote record on gay issu. that is the case in new york, where schumer' rate by the human right campaign ha been consist better than d'amato'. both men, howev, have anger advoc of right for gay peopl by vote for legisl that allow state to not recogn gay marriag. in a preced wide cite by d'amato support, the organ endors sen. john f. kerri, a democrat, over the republican challeng, william weld, in the 1996 massachusett senat race, even though weld' record on gay right wa consid stronger. the move anger gay republican, who now contend that snub d'amato would prove that the group is bias toward democrat. but there is clearli a larg number of human right campaign contributor and board member who strongli feel that endors d'amato will perman damag the group, particularli among women. they fear that abort right support will quit the group in drove becaus d'amato ha never waver in hi opposit to abort dure 18 year in congress. mani new york gay activist would also be deepli upset if the group endors d'amato, whom they blame for instal the state senat major leader, joseph bruno, whom they consid to be strongli anti-gay. matt foreman, execut director of the empir state pride agenda, cite d'amato' role as the architect of the state republican parti as a major reason the group endors schumer. while he ha critic fellow republican in washington for their intoler, here at home, hi own party' blatant discrimin is still the order of the day, foreman said. for that reason, some white hous offici say they think a human right campaign endors of d'amato will be almost meaningless among gay voter. they contend that it might even hurt the senat among hi conserv base. i don't think anybodi will vote for al d'amato becaus of an hrc endors, said a white hous aid who spoke on the condit of anonym. but i think some peopl in the right to life parti and some upstat peopl are go to say, `who is thi guy and whi should we vote for him?' white hous offici and gay democrat, concern that the nation' largest gay and lesbian polit organ is about to endors sen. alfons d'amato for re-elect, are intens lobbi the group to tri to shift it support to the democrat challeng, rep. charl schumer. publicli, offici in the organ, the human right campaign, said they were still deliber their posit in the close watch race, consid among the tightest in the nation. they said they would probabl make an endors by friday. but privat, organ offici and gay activist from both parti who have been monitor the debat say the group is most like to endors d'amato, a republican seek hi fourth term. they also rais the possibl that the group would endors both candid, or remain neutral. if the group endors d'amato, said offici who spoke on the condit of anonym, the endors would be base on three major factors: the group tend to favor incumb, ha been search for alli among the senat republican major and consid d'amato' recent record on gay issu to be quit strong. an endors by the group, which is held in high regard by mani gay and lesbian voter, could prove import in swing voter to d'amato in a tight race. it would also be a major symbol victori for the senat, who ha sought to recast himself as a centrist in recent year and could use the endors to build hi stand among moder swing voter. a d'amato endors would also weaken schumer' effort to portray the incumb as a right-w extremist and would signifi to mani voter a fray of the tradit democrat coalit that ha includ black and gay voter, women and labor union. the intens of the debat surround the endors underscor the import of the new york senat race to democrat across the nation, who see defeat d'amato as one of their best opportun to prevent the republican from gain 60 seat in the senat enough to stop a democrat filibust. the republican current hold a 55-to-45 major. there is sentiment in the commun that if the republican get 60 vote, that trent lott will basic be in charg polit for the next two year, said david mixner, a close friend of presid clinton' who is gay. he wa refer to the senat major leader, who ha call homosexu a sin and liken it to kleptomania. saturday, schumer pick up hi own endors from new york' largest gay and lesbian polit organ, the empir state pride agenda. although the human right campaign is bipartisan, it ha been veri close to the clinton administr, ha mani democrat on it board and receiv much of it money from democrat contributor. larg becaus of the group' strong democrat tie, gay democrat, new york liber and white hous offici are infuri that it is even consid endors d'amato, who also run on the right to life and conserv parti line and often receiv high rate from the christian coalit, which typic oppos legisl on civil right for gay peopl. although the organ ha been thought to be inch toward a d'amato endors for month, the lobbi campaign for schumer ha pick up intens in the last two week, driven partli by a grow sens that the race is now closer than ever. democrat and advoc in both parti who support right for gay peopl said that vice presid al gore, hillari rodham clinton and secretari for health and human servic donna shalala have made person appeal to human right campaign offici urg them not to endors d'amato. white hous offici said they did not know whether the three had made such appeal, and human right campaign offici declin to comment. schumer met privat with the group' top offici last week to make one last pitch for the endors. clinton administr offici have also been buttonhol the group' board member at everi opportun, from cocktail parti to fund-rais, rais concern about a d'amato endors. some new york advoc of civil right for gay peopl have flood the organ with phone call, e-mail messag and letter. democrat offici have been encourag the group' major donor to express their opposit to d'amato. peopl involv in the lobbi effort said that at best, they are hope the group will endors both candid, or make no endors at all. chuck schumer ha been a strong support of issu that are import to gay commun, said a senior white hous offici who spoke on the condit of anonym. the last thing that they should

should we vote for him?' in other elect year, rep. david price and julia carson would have had littl in common other than that they were democrat with rel safe seat. price is a centrist who ha repres thi high-tech district in north carolina for all but 2 of the last 12 year, a polit scientist who ha taught at duke and yale. mr. carson, fairli liber, is a hous freshman who work her way up in polit from the grass root, have been rear in poverti. but parti offici who open thi elect year with high hope of recaptur the hous are begin to worri that democrat incumb like price and mr. carson share someth else: greater-than-expect peril on elect day. as in mani congression race, the biggest variabl is the white hous scandal, which ha inject fear and uncertainti into campaign around the countri. other democrat incumb who republican offici cite as lock in contest that are more competit than expect includ rep. corrin brown of florida, vic snyder of arkansa, loi capp and ellen tauscher of california, martin frost of texa, melvin watt of north carolina, john lafalc of new york and sander levin of michigan. here in north carolina' 4th congression district, price, acknowledg that hi own poll show him in a tight race, said: thi is a swing district that is sensit to ani tide or trend. it' someth you think about a lot in connect with the president' troubl. the effort of price and mr. carson to contain the lewinski debacl and their opponents' attempt to capit on it offer import clue suggest how clinton' problem are influenc the conduct of race around the countri. mani democrat are straddl a line that seem to shift a bit with everi new scandal-rel disclosure: they do not want to appear close to a presid whose conduct embarrass them, and yet, sens the possibl of a public backlash against republican, they are weigh their word care and are wari of hop on ani impeach bandwagon. and while publicli these democrat express confid that the scandal will have littl impact on them, their campaign are prepar for the worst by place greater emphasi than ever on behind-the-effort to prod their core constitu to vote. in a reflect of the uncertainti that the clinton scandal ha cast even among republican, the challeng in the price and carson district both are polit novic seek offic for the first time have differ strategies: tom roberg, a comput execut in raleigh who is take on price, ha broadcast a televis commerci exploit the scandal. tom roberg ha call for bill clinton' resign, the narrat say. thi is not the time to be silent, price. where do you stand? but in indianapoli, gari hofmeist, a conserv jewel challeng mr. carson in indiana' 10th congression district, is take a more subtl approach: rather than mention the scandal directli, he note as often as he can that julia vote with clinton almost 100 percent of the time. ask whi he wa not much rais the scandal directli, hofmeist said: don't murder somebodi when they'r in the process of commit suicid. there would be a danger if we went overboard. the best evid of the discomfort of both price and mr. carson is that when ask in separ interview whether they would want clinton to campaign in their district, both said it would be imposs at thi late date for the white hous to schedul a visit. what if there wa a sudden schedul chang? both paus, squirm a bit and muster answer that were hardli affirm. given the president' popular, i doubt it will hurt me, mr. carson said. and price? i don't think that would be such a good idea, he said. i'v never had a presid campaign here, and i wouldn't want to start thi time although he is eagerli welcom erskin bowl, the president' chief of staff and a popular nativ son in north carolina, to stump with him here thi sunday.) make strategi for the stump is further complic by anecdot evid that run counter to democrat fear and republican hope. in three day of campaign stop here in north carolina and in indianapoli, the scandal wa rare rais by ani voter be court by the candid of either parti. when a report ask about it, mani voter said that as appal as they were at clinton' behavior, they had a hard time relat it to their decis on which way to vote in the congression elect in five week. as hofmeist walk through the park lot outsid a gun and knife show at the indiana nation guard armori in indianapoli last sunday, billi derring, a 57-year-old machinist who is retir on disabl, call him over to express outrag about the million of dollar that had been spent to investig clinton. it' pathet to spend all of our money, said derring, who identifi himself as an independ. it shouldn't have gotten thi far. hofmeist tri hi best to make the republicans' case. there ha to be rule of law, he said. mr. carson said she hope that democrat and swing voter alik would becom so fed up with the lewinski inquiri that the issu might even help her. to that end, she proudli inform audienc that she vote against make public the report deliv to the hous by kenneth starr, the whitewat independ counsel. i wa one of 63 member of congress who vote against put all that filth on the internet, she said, ad that starr' inquiri had been a cruel hoax in term of fiscal respons and account. the carson campaign is count on voter like timothi dali, a 38-year-old real estat execut who vote for a republican two year ago but now favor mr. carson. i'm pull the democrat ticket becaus i'm tire of it: the right side of the republican parti is play polit, dali said. we'd like to see them go on with the people' busi. back here in the 4th district, price ha some reason to be worri. he wa first elect to the hous in 1986 but, as a four-term incumb, wa oust in the republican sweep of 1994 (onli to win hi seat back two year later). in addit, the district wa redrawn last year to includ a larg durham section where voter do not know him well. determin not to be a midterm casualti of clinton onc again, price say he is wage the most vigor get-out-the-vot ground campaign of hi career. rather than engag roberg over the clinton scandal, price ha begun broadcast a televis commerci that emphas hi central issue: educ. the congressman' advis say they intent produc an advertis that appear decidedli nonpolit it featur school children in a play in an effort to break through the televis clutter about the scandal. but the price campaign also ha a weapon it is hold in reserv, in the event roberg appear to be ride the clinton scandal to advantage: the incumbent' advis say they would not be timid about run commerci underscor that he earn a divin degre befor get hi doctor in polit scienc. at a coffe with voter in a wealthi enclav of raleigh the other night, roberg open hi remark by assert that clinton had lost the moral author to lead. yet none of those assembl ask him about the scandal; they were more concern about the state' plan to build a highway near their neighborhood. the last time georg voinovich ran for offic, he won re-elect as ohio' governor with 72 percent of the vote, stun even hi most optimist support and set a 20th-centuri record for victori margin in ohio polit. thi year, voinovich, a republican who is bar from seek a third term, is run again, thi time for the senat seat held by john glenn, a democrat who is retir. and while there are few who expect voinovich to repeat hi elector benchmark of four year ago, politician of both parti gener acknowledg that he is well posit to increas the republican major in the senat. that ha not prevent voinovich' democrat oppon, mari boyl, from undertak a vigor campaign. ms. boyl, a former commission in cuyahoga counti, which encompass cleveland, is crisscross the nation' seventh-most popul state in what she describ as a grass-root campaign that, while oper on a compar shoestr, ha nonetheless attract to her side nation known democrat presid clinton foremost among them on the campaign trail. glenn, the former astronaut who is prepar to return to space thi month at the age of 77, ha not made an endors in the senat race. like mani candid thi year, ms. boyl, 55, is campaign hard on the issu of educ, seek to portray voinovich, 61, as a lacklust steward who allow the state' school to declin. he promis to be the educ governor, said ms. boyl. but after seven and a half year he ha fail the student of thi state. her role in the campaign, she said, is to remind the peopl of the state of ohio that georg voinovich made a promis and that he didn't deliv on it. specif, she discuss a decis last year by the ohio suprem court that cite wide dispar in the qualiti of the state' school and rule unconstitut the formula for fund them. she ha also attack her republican oppon for support a propos to rais the state' sale tax by one percent. under that plan, half the addit fund would have been use for school improv with the remaind earmark for reduc properti tax. that statewid ballot initi last may prove to be wildli unpopular, with about 80 percent of the voter oppos it. while the topic of tax and educ are hot one thi polit season in ohio, it is not clear that ms. boyle' emphasi on them ha help her campaign. despit some narrow in the opinion poll, she is still trail voinovich by 10 percentag point in some poll and as much as 18 point in other. there is also a sharp fund-rais dispar. ms. boyl, who is run her first statewid race and ha widespread union support, ha rais nearli $2 million so far, far less than the nearli $7 million voinovich ha taken in. also, voinovich, a former lieuten governor, ha been on statewid ballot five time over the last 20 year and thu is the better-known candid. the elector dynam of ohio are also aid voinovich. the northern half of the state, with it histori of industri, union citi, ha a tradit of vote larg for democrat candid, while the southern tier of the state is consid more conserv and typic lean republican. but voinovich and ms. boyl share the same home terrain, depriv ms. boyl of the geograph advantag that often accompani democrat candid. inde, as a boy, voinovich onc deliv newspap to the boyl home in the working-class collinwood section of cleveland. and voinovich, a former mayor of cleveland, ha develop a reput as a moder republican who work well with democrat. voinovich, while campaign vigor himself, is keep a full schedul of offici duti, assum the role of the experienc, elect offici. if i get into the senat, i will probabl know more about domest polici than ani member of the senat, he said in an interview on wednesday in canton, sandwich between a ribbon-cut ceremoni and a fund-rais recept at a vacuum cleaner museum. as mayor, i had my nose rub into the problem of urban america and wa fairli success in deal with them. and, as governor, i have dealt with the problem of medicaid, welfar and educ. i'm the onli person in the unit state who ha been presid of the nation leagu of citi and chairman of the nation governor associ. to hi opponent' charg on hi record on educ, voinovich is dismiss. i'm probabl the onli republican in the unit state who ha been endors by the ohio educ associ and nation educ associ, he said, ad that ms. boyl wa a member of the state legislatur dure the period cite in the suprem court rule. mari boyl wa vice chairman of the way and mean committe and a member of the democrat leadership dure those year, voinovich said. they did noth to fix the build, they did noth for technolog and the urban school district. ms. boyl, who ha not yet begun to run campaign commerci on televis, said her statu as the underdog had allow me to be more focus, more intens. paus after a campaign fund-rais breakfast with former democrat sen. bill bradley of new jersey here on wednesday, ms. boyl said: thi ha been a marathon and it' been pretti much uphil. but now, we'r down to the last three mile. it' a tough race. sen. alfons d'amato, the new york republican who is run for re-elect, went to manhattan' grand central termin the other morn to accept an award from mass-transit advoc. but the report who had gather there show littl interest in the shini train car at the senator' back. instead, they repeatedli ask him how he would vote on an impeach of presid clinton. look, i'm not go to make ani comment with respect to that subject matter, d'amato respond. i am not just a citizen. i am a citizen-sen who may be call upon to make a decis. but d'amato is someth els as well: a candid in what may be the tightest senat race in the nation. and variat of hi ellipt respons can be heard in senat race around the countri, where both republican and democrat are encount similar question. all of which suggest that after the hous vote thursday to author an impeach inquiri, thi year' 34 race for the us. senat have becom, beyond what they alreadi were, the elector equival of juri select. if the hous vote to impeach clinton, the matter goe to the senat, which must decid by a two-third major whether to convict him and, thu, remov him from offic. as a result, the monica lewinski matter ha suddenli inject a new disrupt forc into the senat contest. voter, even those who support clinton, expect their polit leader, republican or democrat, to renounc clinton' behavior, and candid have been do that. but impeach is anoth matter; most poll show the nation is against it. the danger for senat candid is that with impeach now a real possibl, the debat may move beyond the president' behavior about which there is littl disagr to the more problemat issu of whether he should be remov from offic. for most of the strategist involv in the race, there is littl guidanc on how to handl the impeach issu. advis to candid of both parti said in interview last week that they were perplex and worri, unsur what they can or should do on the issu to gain the advantag or guard against harm. i can't tell how thi one is go to go, said mike russel, a spokesman for the republican senatori campaign committe. thi is a veri surreal environ. of the 34 senat seat in play, 18 are held by democrat and 16 by republican, who now hold 55 seat in all. republican would have to win 28 of the 34 race to produc the 67 vote necessari for convict, assum such a vote were to go along parti line. onli an elector catastroph for the democrat, which seem almost unthink, could produc such a huge loss. jennif duffi, who follow senat race for the cook polit report, a nonpartisan newslett, said that so far, at least, none of the senat candid ha made an explicit appeal for vote base on how they would vote on a presidenti juri. but she and other are wonder if thi may be about to chang. thi is difficult ground to measur. one of the central question of thi polit year ha been how clinton' deal with ms. lewinski might affect turnout. for a long time, politician assum that dispirit democrat would stay home as a rebuk to clinton, just as mani republican did in novemb 1974, three month after presid richard m. nixon resign. but now some analyst wonder if the partisan fight in congress last week might have the opposit effect among some democrat. that' the problem, said stuart rothenberg, the editor of an independ polit newslett in washington. it' not that we don't know, and that the politician don't know, where the gener public stand on impeach. the problem is that we don't know where the elector stand on impeach. and ask voter to think ahead to an impeach proceed as they cast their ballot in a senat race is, in the word of stuart steven, a republican consult, a doubl bank-shot. such strategi, he said, tend to work onli with a small number of single-mind or sophist voter. against that complic backdrop, the prevail think is that the use of the impeach issu will vari from race to race, state to state and week to week, depend on the circumst of the candid and the composit of the elector. if democrat tri to turn the imag of clinton in the dock to their advantag, it would be in state with a democrat edg or with sizabl number of black voter, who overwhelmingli support the presid. in contest like those, it might well prove to be in the interest of a democrat candid to, as one consult put it, sit down in front of a camera and tape an advertis in which the candid denounc the president' behavior but solemnli pledg to vote against impeach. strategist in both parti believ that kind of approach could prove effect. thi is an issu where there is a huge disconnect between the elit and the public, said fred yang, a democrat consult with client in wisconsin and the carolina. that kind of democrat strategi might emerg in california, new york, illinoi, wisconsin, washington and perhap arkansa. by contrast, democrat in south carolina, georgia and nevada would be less like to oppos clinton' impeach. on the other side, republican consult are tell their candid to stress clinton' misde and stay away from talk of impeach. the last thing the parti want is to turn the senat elect into a referendum on whether clinton should be forc from offic. the white hous might think from the overal public number that mayb they would like to make thi a referendum elect, said ed goea, a republican pollster who is work in senat race thi year. republican certainli aren't go to let that happen. d'amato respond to question about clinton with the languag that republican consult have been suggest to their candid. when and if that matter come to the senat, i will decid on the fact that are present to me at that time, d'amato said. it would be veri prematur for me to suggest ani cours of action without it be refer. becaus, inde, we may be call upon to act as a juri of some kind. but schumer, a member of the hous judiciari committe, which is conduct the impeach investig, virtual embrac the issu. in a live telecast of the hear, he said the presid deserv a lesser punish, such as censur or reprimand. and schumer plan to campaign in new york on monday with clinton at hi side. schumer' media advis, hank morri, seem to suggest last week that impeach will grow as an issu. senat d'amato claim he doe not want to share hi opinion with the peopl of new york, morri said. and if he doesn't have an opinion, he' the onli new yorker who doesn't have an opinion. ask if schumer would rais the issu in a televis commerci, morri responded: we don't talk about what we'r go to do. i wouldn't rule it in and i wouldn't rule it out.

some of the closest combat in the half year of the kosovo conflict, to the point of fight room to room and floor to floor, occur near thi villag six week ago, in the day befor 21 women, children and elderli member of the delijaj clan were massacr by serbian forc, their mutil bodi left strewn on the forest floor. piec togeth what happen, from surviv famili member, ethnic albanian separatist forc and offici serbian inform, a stori emerg of fierc guerrilla resist to an onslaught by serbian tank, artilleri and infantri. the serbian forc fight here appear to have suffer unusu heavi loss and, after the guerrilla final fled, took reveng against the civilian, shoot women and children at close rang as they tri to run away from their pursuer. accord to rel who found the bodi, pajazit delijaj, 65, wa decapit, hi brain left on display on the ground. hava delijaj, 65, wa shot and one of her feet cut with a knife so that it hung by a thread of skin. young women and children who had run a few hundr yard up a rocki path were mow down. miracul, a 6-week-old babi, dituri, wa found by her father aliv in the clasp of her dead mother, lumnij, 30, more than 24 hour after the kill. blood wa in her mouth and her mother' hand on the babi, said imer delijaj, the father, an avow member of the kosovo liber armi, the ethnic albanian guerrilla forc, who return in uniform to discov the bodi. i move her

cook for the guerrilla at the famili compound when they return from fight in the day befor the massacr, recal how she fled, crawl, fall, run and hide in the wood as the serb shot at her. i could feel the dirt hit me from the impact of the bullet, she said in an interview, her nose still bloodi from what she said wa a heavi fall dure her flight. first it wa machin gun, then grenad, then cannon, she said. everi time i move and they heard leav rustl, they shot. the massacr of the delijaj, whose forebear settl in the drenica valley about 150 year ago, wa not the first in the conflict that ravag the serbian provinc between march and octob and ha now lull into an uneasi truce. inde, the conflict between serbian forc bent on keep kosovo in serbia and guerrilla fight for the independ of it heavili ethnic albanian popul first drew intern attent with the massacr of the jasari clan in earli march by serbian unit at prekaz, in central kosovo. but the kill of the delijaj, rang from the paralyz patriarch, fazli, 94, who wa burn in hi bed, to the slaughter of valmir, 18 month, who wa found shot, is the most thoroughli document so far. human right watch, a new york-bas group, believ the knowledg gather so far increas the possibl of prosecut by the un. war crime tribun in the hagu, netherland. the hague' prosecutor could also draw on the observ of diplomat, human right monitor and report who saw the bodi scatter in the ravin where the victim were kill befor they were buri in shallow grave in the clan' nearbi compound. in other kosovo massacr, bodi had been move from the site

saturday morn, sept. 26, from their headquart at likovac, north of here. by then, the albanian guerrilla had fled the area around the delijaj compound, dispers after what a senior command of the kosovo liber armi, naim maloku, term particularli fierc combat with the serb. in the day befor sept. 26, he said, the guerrilla caught in a serbian pincer movement had decid to fight rather than surrend. the fight sometim hous to hous, even room to room took an unusu heavi toll among the serb, said maloku, a former offic in the yugoslav armi. he said he believ that it wa those death the serb aveng with the massacr of the delijaj. in other major attack dure the conflict, the guerrilla gener found an escap hatch. in obrinj, led by anoth former offic of the yugoslav armi whom maloku declin to name, the guerrilla fought, use land mine and rocket-propel grenad. maloku said he knew from a report made by rebel headquart that at least 47 serbian soldier and polic offic were kill in the fight between here and bajinc, three mile east. we took weapon from 47 serb, he said. the state-control serbian media center in kosovo' capit, pristina, said 10 serbian polic offic were kill in the fight, includ five reservist who die when their vehicl hit an antitank mine on sept. 25. the announc of 10 serb kill in one action is unusu high. the practic of take violent reveng is a time-honor tradit in the balkan. from 1991 to 1995, in the war in croatia and bosnia, serb, croat and, to a far lesser extent, the main victim, the muslim, aveng world war ii massacr and new blood feud, driven into kill by leader who exploit old conflict to carv new fief for themselv as the old, communist yugoslavia collaps. in thi case, it appear, serbian vengeanc wa visit upon the delijaj. survivor of the clan said they had fear an assault on their collect of mud and brick home line a rocki dirt track directli opposit the villag of likovac, the serbs' base just a mile away. the serb had push the rebel out of likovac in august and the guerrilla had establish new headquart around bajinc, six mile east of obrinj. as the serb swept down from the nearbi cicavica mountain, and up from the road that run from pristina to klina, it wa clear that obrinj would be a target. most women and children in the area had move into appl valley, where more than 10,000 refuge had gather outdoor, seek safeti in number. but imer delijaj, 38, said he decid that the ravin below hi famili compound would be a better hide place. he said he believ the women, children and elderli would be spare if the serb found them. as the serb approach on foot the saturday morn of the massacr, the last person to flee the compound itself wa bashkim delijaj, 21, the youngest son of 94-year-old fazli. bashkim delijaj said he had stay behind to look after hi bedridden father. the shell start again at 7 am. on saturday and i saw a tank convoy approach, with infantri behind the tank, bashkim delijaj recal in an interview. i wa smoke a cigarett when a grenad fell on the roof and from a hole in the gate i saw soldier come from about 30 meter away. they were in brown armi uniform, had huge knive or small axe. mani had beard. bashkim delijaj said he wa unabl to carri hi father to safeti, and did not have the courag to tell him what wa happen. i told him i wa get the anim out of the barn, he said. he said he ran, hid, ran some more, and eventu receiv shelter from a farmer, all the time hear shoot and shell. when the fire had die down monday morn, he return to the compound and ran into imer, still wear hi guerrilla uniform. they went to one of the hous and found imer delijaj' brother, adem, 33, shot dead, hi bodi sprawl on the ground in the rain, and the burn torso of fazli. i look in the window of our hous and saw onli the bone of my father, which look like what we learn in biolog class, he said. togeth, the two men went to find out what had happen in the ravin. there they found the bodi. first, ali, 65, who, imer delijaj said, had been cut through the neck with hi own tobacco cut knife. then pajazit, who had been decapit in a makeshift tent, hi brain place between two foam mattress. then hava, 65, who wa sprawl near the tent. they move on to find jeton, imer' 10-year-old son, and imer' mother, hamid, 60, not far away. imer' sister-in-law, luljeta, who wa seven month pregnant, had been mutil, he said. a littl further up the ravin, imer said he saw hi wife, lumnij, 30. he open hi wife' coat and found hi 6-week-old babi girl, now 3 month old and recov at a relative' home in likovac. he said he tri to clean the babi and then put her under hi jacket and walk a few feet further to find the bodi of hi 4-year-old daughter, menduhij, and two other young children, donieta, 5, and gentiana, 7. the corps of other famili member were found in the wood and two older men, habib, 51, and hysen, 53, were found the next morn, imer said. on oct. 3, the bodi of two miss teen-ag girl, mehan, 16, and antigua, 13, were found in the bush at the side of a road near an abandon serbian polic compound. later in the month, the bodi of hajriz wa found push down a well, close to the ravin. one uncl, sharif, who wa in the ravin, is still miss, presum dead. human right watch, which ha been document the delijaj massacr, ha describ it as the most viciou of a pattern of attack on civilian by the serb in the kosovo conflict. (to a lesser extent, albanian guerrilla also attack serbian civilian, forc them from their home, and allegedli carri out at least two massacres.) the evid strongli indic that the gornj obrinj kill were follow by consciou mutil carri out after the victim were kill, a come report by human right watch say. delijaj famili member have told human right watch monitor and other that they saw an ethnic albanian polic offic accompani the serbian polic offic dure the fight. they believ that the polic offic, who is post at the nearbi glogovac polic station, wa use by the serbian special polic offic as a guid to the obrinj area. thi polic offic, who is appar one of a small group of ethnic albanian offic who have remain loyal to the serb, could be an import wit for crimin investig from the war-crim tribun in the hagu, accord to human right expert. the ethnic albanian policeman could be an import wit to identifi the polic and armi unit respons for the atroc, said peter boueckhart, a research for human right watch. it is vital that those who carri out these atroc are prosecut by the hagu tribun. at the burn delijaj compound in the last week, imer delijaj ha been act as the host of a wake which, follow albanian tradit, will last sever week and began after famili member return from their hide place in the wood. color photograph of the youngest member of the famili, and of imer' mother

remors for allow hi famili to use a hide place so close to the famili compound, which for all practic purpos wa an inform base for fighter. hi lawyer, bajram krasniqi, who said he wa eager to be help to investig of the hagu tribun, said in pristina that he believ imer delijaj felt guilti for a faulti decis. whether the tribun will close examin the case remain unclear. slobodan milosev, the yugoslav presid, ha issu onli a hand of visa to investig from the tribun. two investig who were in kosovo at the time of the massacr left six day later without visit the site or contact krasniqi about the kill. would imer delijaj seek reveng? as he sat on the floor of hi live room with a group of male visitor, he replied: it' easi to answer. if i can see eye to eye with men i will fight them. but onli with men in uniform and in a fair fight. if i see children with them, i will treat them like children all over the world. children are children. american and alli forc in bosnia on wednesday

enamor of the center-right opposit parti than they are of the govern major. prodi, an economist, is admir by hi western alli as a down-to-earth leader who vow to tame italy' bloat economi and reckless govern borrow and actual live up to hi pledg. by rais tax, lower interest rate and reduc the deficit, itali met the requir for membership in the euro last spring, a feat that onli a year befor wa consid imposs by german and french economist. prodi wa help by a healthi global economi and a rare consensu among industrialist, labor union and taxpay, who fear that exclus from the euro would condemn itali to third world statu. but hi fiscal disciplin wa not follow by reform of a polit system that is inher fragil. there are more than 40 parti in itali, and the government' effort to amend the constitut to introduc a two-parti system fail. unless the italian polit system chang, itali is condemn to polit instabl, said sergio romano, a former diplomat and polit scienc professor. the countri need stabil and credibl, and that will never happen as long as the govern is hang from a thread. in 1996 prodi won with a patchwork quilt of center-left faction mostli made up of cathol moder and leftist. he reli on a fring marxist group, the communist refound parti, for a major in the lower hous. and that allianc, fragil from the begin, final fray to the break point thi week. the hard-lin leader of communist refound, fausto bertinotti, said hi parti would vote against the 1999 budget and would also end it 28-month-old pact with the center-left coalit. that posit drove the moder wing of communist refound, worri that a vote against prodi would open the door to a center-right govern, to split away. but the 20-odd deputi who defi bertinotti were not enough to squeez prodi through. i am not bitter, prodi said moment after hi defeat. even today i receiv a lot of support. in the end the coup de grace wa deliv by one of hi own, a member of the coalit. they have won by the treacheri of one singl person, sergio mattarella, a deputi in prodi' coalit, angrili told report, refer to silvio liotta, a member of the italian renew parti. foreign minist lamberto dini, who head that parti, said liotta would be expel. prodi ha often said he would not govern with ani other major than the center-left one that elect him in 1996. but throughout hi tenur, he wa forc to seek temporari allianc to push through major polici decis. he struggl to the last to tri to keep hi origin major intact. on thursday, in an effort to woo more moder communist to hi side, the prime minist, a staunch alli of the unit state, warn that he would oppos a nato strike aim at stop serbian violenc in kosovo unless the un. secur council approv the attack. washington maintain that nato doe not need a new un. resolut to order a strike. premier romano prodi said monday he would appeal directli to parliament to save italy' second-longest govern sinc world war ii, threaten with collaps by the defect of it communist alli. the address to parliament wa expect wednesday, follow perhap by friday by the vote of confid that will determin whether prodi' 2 1/2-year-old, center-left allianc stand or fall. prodi' far-left alli, the communist refound parti, provok the crisi by withdraw it support over the weekend and say it would not vote for hi deficit-cut 1999 budget, which is key to italy' particip in the european common currenc. prodi ha said he would call a confid vote if he lost the communists' support. i'v alway act with coher, prodi said befor a morn meet with presid oscar luigi scalfaro on the crisi. i'v never chang strategi and i don't want to do polit gymnast. the break with prodi' govern divid refound. armando cossutta, leader of the moder wing, resign as parti presid monday. he said the party' desert of prodi wa wrong and danger, but at the same time promis to follow the parti line. we are in a veri complic polit crisi which could lead to earli elect, cossutta told report monday. and with the divis in the left, thi would mean a victori for the right. if the crisi come to a confid vote and prodi lose, he would offer hi resign. onc he doe that, it is up to scalfaro to decid what to do. he could ask prodi or someon els to form a new govern or he could call elect 2 1/2 year earli, someth most analyst think unlik. work in prodi' favor is the fact that few parti think they would stand to gain by earli elect, includ the communist refound. there wa specul prodi would reopen negoti that would win back the communists' grudg support, as he ha manag to do in the past. prodi' govern ha held togeth thi long in larg part becaus of the wide share desir to see itali qualifi for particip in the 1999 debut of europe' common currenc, the euro. that happen earlier thi year leav the dispar alli without so clear a reason to stay togeth. prodi lead italy' 55th govern sinc world war ii. he ha outlast all but bettino craxi, who serv 3{ year in two back-to-back stint from 1983 to

expans earlier thi year and on send troop into albania last year. prodi wa even forc to resign a year ago after a bitter battl over spend cut link to the euro. the crisi wa resolv, and prodi return to work, after he made steep concess and promis a 35-hour work week. by one vote, premier romano prodi' center-left coalit lost a confid vote in the chamber of deputi friday, and he went to the

destabil italy' govern at a time when the outcom of the recent elect in germani ha alreadi inject a note of uncertainti into the futur of european econom and fiscal polici. mauro zani, a spokesman for the democrat parti of the left, the main parti in prodi' coalit, call the decis by communist refound a misfortun for the entir countri. passag of the budget, he said, is essenti to avoid disast. prodi' coalit is a loos allianc of the former communist, known as the democrat parti of the left, and prodi' moder catholic-ori follow. it is support by communist refound, a fring group of hard-lin

rival zulu-bas inkhata freedom parti. the decis on de klerk seem certain to damag the commission' credibl. the panel, creat as a way of put south africa' brutal past to rest without the expens and polit divis of trial, ha caus controversi from the start. it ha held more than 160 hear throughout the countri, listen to both victim and to perpetr seek amnesti. but mani white say the commiss is on

said. but other say that too mani question are be rais about the panel' compet. the whole affair is beyond the pale, a mockeri of justic, said roboy vonholdt, a 56-year-old sheep and ostrich farmer who believ that the commiss ha been a theatric act. we should all turn our back on the past and move forward. we need them and they need us. let' all make money and let good econom condit prevail. the

that more than 400 peopl had been notifi they would be implic to give them a chanc to respond. onli 15 success argu themselv out of the report, he said. crimin prosecut for atroc commit dure the war against white rule could drag on for at least six year, a top prosecutor said monday. key figur implic in human right abus by the truth and reconcili commiss alreadi are under investig, the offici, jan d'oliveira, told report. they includ two unnam gener in the apartheid state' secur apparatu, presid nelson mandela' ex-wif winni madikizela-mandela and offici of the african nation congress, he said. the remark by d'oliveira, who recent wa appoint a deputi nation director of prosecut, were the clearest signal yet that crimin case would be brought against figur accus by the commiss of gross human right violat. the commiss releas it report oct. 30. it chronicl the human right abus commit by apartheid govern and their oper as well as by the african nation congress and other fight the racist system. the issu of continu prosecut is signific. mani feel that drag on crimin reckon of the horror of the apartheid era will onli prolong bitter and delay reconcili. but support of prosecut feel that deni justic to the victim is a wors evil. on a practic level, highli public prosecut of anc figur could have an impact on nation elect next year, when the parti will seek to consolid it hold on power. the panel' chairman, archbishop desmond tutu, ha call for a two-year time limit on prosecutions; d'oliveira call the period wholli impract. the prosecutor did not name the other target. we have alway work on the principl of that we will prosecut the highest rank, he said. the commiss ha the abil to grant amnesti to those who admit their misde and are found to have act with polit motiv. the report said individu who have not sought amnesti should be prosecut. madikizela-mandela ha not sought amnesti. the commiss found her account for human right violat commit by her bodyguard, who the report said kill and tortur suspect oppon. madikizela-mandela wa convict in 1991 of kidnap and be an accessori to an assault on four young men. she wa sentenc to six year in jail, but paid a dlr 3,200 fine on appeal. the anc offici wa among the most promin anti-apartheid activist. the two gener were implic dure truth commiss testimoni. prosecutor are readi to move forward pend the amnesti applic of

intern expert, charl villa-vicencio, research head of the truth and reconcili commiss, said ignor the psycholog need of those who carri out human right abus could alien a potenti danger sector of societi. we must give attent to the heal of perpetr, not just for the sake of perpetr, but for the sake of the nation as a whole, he said. the confer, organ by the medic research council, is examin mental health issu rais by the truth commiss, which is charg with probe crime commit by all side in the anti-apartheid struggl. as the commiss prepar to hand over it final report at the end of the month, south african are examin it pain and traumat explor of their bloodi past. with the power to grant amnesti to mani who tortur, bomb or maim innoc civilian, the process ha at some stage anger peopl in nearli all walk of life. mani white see the panel as favor the black liber movement, while mani black accus it of be too soft on former state offici, especi top rank minist. howev, villa-vicencio appeal for toler in deal with all those who have commit crime, say that the potenti for wrongdo exist in everyon. we all, the entir human race, carri with us the capac for evil, he said. mani of thursday' speaker touch on the figur of polic death squad leader eugen de kock, who wa given jail term total more than 200 year after a kill spree that cost dozen of live. de kock ha appli for amnesti for hi crime. dan stein, a specialist in neurobiolog and stress disord, said de kock typifi mani killer from all side in the conflict by hi sheer banal of evil. mani peopl have found him in interview to be an ordinari, even likeabl person, he said about the man whom subordin dub prime evil. ginn fouri, a physiotherapist whose student daughter wa gun down by black activist in a 1993 attack on a cape town bar, said it wa necessari to help those whose circumst compel them to do wrong. struggl to control her tear, fouri told deleg she had attend the amnesti hear of her

counsel togeth with their victim, fouri earn a stand ovat from the 50-strong audienc. we must take the initi in understand other and start the process of reconcili and heal our broken land, she said, her voic shake with emot. the new york time said in an editori on sunday, nov. 1: the 3,500-page report of the south african truth and reconcili commiss, releas on thursday, is the most comprehens and unspar examin of a nation' ugli past that ani such commiss ha yet produc. draw from the commission' own investig and the testimoni of hundr of applic for amnesti and 20,000 victim, the report is a detail look at the crime of the apartheid era, and blame success white govern for the vast major. it ha fulfil it mandat of tell the fullest truth possibl, which is one reason that everi polit parti in south africa ha denounc it. besid accus the govern of assassin and bomb, the report critic the inkatha freedom parti for it massacr and collabor with secur forc, and blame the african nation congress for the murder of civilian and other crime. it singl out former presid pw. botha, chief mangosuthu buthelezi, the inkatha leader, and winni mandela, among other, for detail treatment of their role in polit crime. one major flaw in the report is the absenc of a section accus fw. de klerk, the last apartheid presid, of know about sever bomb after the fact and keep silent. it wa excis becaus de klerk is su the commiss. the anc also su, unsuccess, to stop public. the lawsuit are a disappoint sign that south africa' polit parti are not interest in an honest look at their past, nor in the free flow of inform. the controversi ha ad to widespread complaint that the commiss ha not help the process of reconcili. thi is wrong. true reconcili which occur when a societi is no longer paralyz by the past and peopl can work and live togeth cannot be base on silenc. no societi can be restor to health by paper over as much pain as south african have suffer. a noisi and inform debat about complic in the crime of the apartheid era is necessari, if uncomfort. the report is onli part of the truth commission' contribut to the heal process. the hear themselv, which allow victim of human right violat to tell their stori in public, help the countri heal and open the eye of mani white to the unpleas truth about apartheid. the amnesti process, while permit mani import crimin to escap justic, is allow famili to know exactli what happen to their love one in dozen of case that would like have never gone to trial in south africa' fragil judici system. the process of help the victim with scholarship and other necessari aid goe on, although it will not be enough. no commiss can transform a societi as twist as south africa' wa. but the truth commiss is the best effort the world ha seen, and south africa is the better for it. the deal that south africa' truth and reconcili commiss offer wa simpl enough: confess your crime, appli for amnesti and you will go free. if you don't come forward, you will be prosecut. after more than two year of hear into apartheid-era atroc, the commiss last week unveil a 3,500-page report name dozen of peopl it believ were up to their elbow in the gore but never appli for amnesti. so the prosecut should begin soon, right? not so fast. the studi wa bare in the hand of presid nelson mandela befor talk of new amnesti deal had begun. it seem that nearli all of south africa' polit parti includ the rule african nation congress have key offici who could end up in the dock becaus of the report. suddenli, there is lot of talk about how the countri can't withstand a round of polit divis trial, and mani polit analyst here are bet that an agreement of mutual benefit is in the of. alreadi, three major polit parti are call for some kind of new amnesti, and the anc isn't close the door. anc spokesman thabo maseb said it wa prematur to talk of a gener amnesti, but he acknowledg that the parti wa discuss an amnesti specif tailor to violenc by black south african against other black that litter the kwazulu/nat provinc with bodi dure the late '80 and into the '90. in choos a truth commiss rather than a nuremberg-styl trial with which to close out it brutal past, south africa hope for an idealist reconcili. peopl would come clean and receiv true forgiv. societi would then be abl to move on, it wound cleans and heal. it wa a model watch close around the world by other societi wonder how to disentangl themselv from the grudg of a brutal past. but given the chanc, hundr of south africa' perpetr did not come forward. commiss offici themselv say they were frustrat by the lack of cooper, howev exhaust their report may seem. it is perhap too late, howev, to press for more. today' south africa ha urgent new problem to deal with unemploy, crime, white flight, too few school and hospit. so it may wind up settl for a more pragmat reconcili one that give amnesti to the unrepent simpli becaus it' more practic for all concern to move on. in recent year, truth commiss have gain popular in mani place, notabl chile, argentina and el salvador. but south africa' the biggest and most power, abl to grant amnesti and to subpoena wit wa suppos to be the real test. certainli the commiss forc the nation to see the gruesom detail of it past, as sob survivor and stone-fac tortur told of smash genit and near suffoc. and the commission' work ad much to the knowledg about what happen in south africa between 1960 and 1994. but it will be year befor the effect of the commiss can truli be judg. ha anyon realli forgiven anyon els? will vendetta persist? no one can answer. one thing seem clear, however: four year after south africa held it first non-raci elect, a grow number of south african want to be done with the past. raymond louw, the publish of a respect weekli newslett, southern africa report, say a new amnesti propos could come up dure the februari session of parliament, in time to remov the issu from next year' elect campaign. you simpli can't have thi countri torn apart by prosecut, he say. everybodi is go to be howl for an amnesti. they alreadi are. even as archbishop desmond tutu, the commission' chairman, deliv the report, he seem to be anticip a push for a new amnesti and argu against it. he said such a move would be highli unfair to those who came forward. he suggest instead that there be a two-year time limit, after which anyon not indict would in effect get amnesti. to be sure, there will be opposit to ani propos to limit prosecut. more than a dozen human right and victim advocaci group have alreadi band togeth to condemn such propos as unconscion. the idea for a truth commiss emerg as a compromis from the long negoti that brought about south africa' peac transit from a white supremacist state to a non-raci democraci. dure the talk, the white nation parti govern push for a blanket amnesti, and the anc refus. in the end, onli about 250 former polic offic came forward, most of them foot soldier. and onli two high nation parti offici, former law and order minist adriaan vlok and polic commission johan van der merw, confess to role in order bomb. in it report, the commiss call the apartheid state the primari perpetr of gross human right violat and held such high rank former offici as former presid pw. botha, hi former armi chief, georg meir, and the former intellig chief, niel barnard, respons. these men, and other of lower rank, have not appli for amnesti for the anc, the most embarrass prospect is the possibl prosecut of mandela' former wife, winni madikizela-mandela, who is accus in the report of take part in a number of assault and abduct. lesser-known offici could face charg too. the anc is held respons for at least 76 death in kwazulu/nat. the anc' problem are further complic by it effort to make peac with the larg zulu-bas inkatha freedom parti. virtual no one from that parti came forward to ask for amnesti. yet the report found that inkatha, work with the white govern, wa respons for widespread slaughter in kwazulu/nat and in the township around johannesburg. inkatha' leader, chief mangosuthu buthelezi, and mani key parti offici stand accus of foment a wide rang of abus. but prosecut chief buthelezi could lead to new warfar in kwazulu. part of the reluct to go forward with prosecut may be the result of still anoth factor: the judici system is alreadi overwhelm with rise crime and the evid from the apartheid era is old. so whi spend the time and the money? at the moment, onli one polit parti is oppos to ani form of new amnesti the tini but influenti democrat parti, a liber group that wa not involv in the violenc. it head, toni leon, say a new amnesti would onli prove that the more thuglik your behavior, the more you get away with. but he conced that hi is a lone voic. at thi point, he say, there is littl enthusiasm for anyth but close the book on the past. a panel probe apartheid-era abus ha accus the african nation congress of human right violat, includ tortur and bomb attack, the state broadcast said monday. the anc, which led the struggl against white rule and now is in power, previous ha acknowledg it wa told to expect implic in right violat. the truth and reconcili commiss will releas it final report on 2 1-2 year of investig on thursday. the report wa expect to place overwhelm blame for the era' abus on white govern and their brutal secur servic. presid nelson mandela' offic receiv an advanc copi on monday ahead of the handov ceremoni, when retir archbishop desmond tutu, who chair the comiss,

themselv, despit the sugar-co of hope, ooz malic. in one of them, homosexu is link to drug addict and certain death by aids; all of them implicitli posit that homosexu is itself a diseas in need of a cure. matthew shepard ha now been cure, that' for sure. as hi uncl, rw. eaton, told the denver post, the 21-year-old matt, who aspir to a career in diplomaci and human right, wa a small person with a big heart, mind and soul that someon tri to beat out of him. of hi nephew' shatter bodi eaton said, it' like someth you might see in war. and a war it is. go to the famili research council' web site

nation investig effort focus on abort clinic violenc. ms. reno and senior fbi offici, includ robert bryant, the deputi fbi director, have met with physician and abort right group in recent day to discuss way to enhanc feder investig effort and coordin with local agenc. feder author first organ an abort clinic task forc in 1995 after the kill of a florida doctor. the unit, which wa charg with investig whether a nation conspiraci exist, spent nearli two year studi abort clinic violenc. the unit disband without uncov a nation conspiraci. law enforc offici said that the unit' oper did help reduc violenc at abort clinic and that, in part, the decis to re-establish it wa prompt by ms. reno' desir to send a renew messag to anti-abort extremist that the govern would aggress investig these crime. slepian' murder fit the pattern of four earlier sniper attack on abort doctor in canada and western new york, date from 1994. none of the attack have been solv. bernard tolbert, special agent in charg of the fbi in buffalo, said at a news confer here wednesday that investig had not determin whether there is a link between the five kill. there' a possibl they could be link, but certainli no inform, he said. tolbert gave littl inform about the subject of the material-wit warrant, except to say that kopp' black 1987 chevrolet cavali, with the vermont licens plate bpe216, wa seen near slepian' home begin sever week befor the murder. we don't have ani idea of where he is, tolbert said of kopp. we are look for him everi place we can, everi place he might be. a photograph of kopp taken in januari 1997 ha been distribut to law enforc agenc around the unit state and canada. the nation abort feder ha sent out an advisori to clinic around the countri about the search for kopp, said melinda duboi, assist director of womenservic, the clinic where slepian work. she said name kopp a materi wit in the case had not brought relief to the nurs and other worker at the clinic. i don't think it make me or anyon els at the clinic feel differ, she said. i don't want anybodi to relax and say, `oh god, they got the guy.' that' easi to happen. i still want peopl to be veri vigil. the clinic is the last in the buffalo area that is perform abort. slepian wa one of onli a hand of doctor in buffalo who were still will to perform the procedur in the face of picket, protest and threat. sinc hi death, doctor from outsid buffalo have come to the clinic to continu provid abort servic. rosina lotempio wa stand outsid abort clinic here befor oper rescu storm into town in 1992 for the rowdi spring of life ralli, in which hundr were arrest. she wa there befor lamb of christ demonstr came to town in 1993. she wa on the sidewalk outsid buffalo gyn womenservic the morn of oct. 23, about 12 hour befor barnett slepian, the clinic doctor, wa fatal shot in hi home. and she wa there friday, brown rosari bead in her hand, a small gold cross on a chain around her neck, quietli pray for abort to stop. i'm heartbroken when i have to come here, mr. lotempio, 58, said as she stood in the cold, wear small black earmuff and a white turtleneck adorn with a tini silver pin of babi feet. it' veri difficult out here; i depend on god, she said, after pray for sever moment to decid whether to talk to a report. the bomb, the fieri rhetor of abort oppon and the poster of bloodi fetus may captur the attent of the news media, but peopl like mr. lotempio are the foot soldier in the abort battl. they call themselv street counselor and come to the clinic whenev they believ abort are be perform. they pray and they talk to women, hope to chang their mind. some scream profan. other, like mr. lotempio, denounc not onli the violenc against doctor and clinic, but also the block of door and the shout of ugli epithet at clinic worker and patient. for the approxim 80 abort oppon here, their protest is more like a job than a polit activ. there is a schedul. peopl count on them to show up. mr. lotempio, a mother of three and grandmoth of six, connect her involv to a convers in the 1970 in which she help a friend decid to abort an unwant pregnanc. two decad later, she wa haunt by her own question: whether the fetu wa male or femal. i just felt horribl and i felt guilti, she said, tear in her eye. i thought that if i wa at the clinic do someth, i could make up for that baby' life. dure mr. lotempio' 8 a.m.-to-10 am. shift friday, about a dozen peopl circl the area in front of the buffalo clinic, say the hail mari. other take her spot on tuesday and wednesday. she return on saturday, when up to 40 peopl crowd the sidewalk. similar band of protest march in front of abort clinic throughout the unit state, and local protest are often join by band of peopl who roam the countri. at the clinic on main street, north of downtown buffalo, there is an odd sens of commun. local protest greet dick, the secur guard, by name. they sometim see the enemi abortion-right volunt who escort patient in and out of the clinic in the supermarket or on the soccer field. robert behn, one of the protest leader, even spent two hour talk about abort over breakfast last year with slepian. and sever said they cri when they heard of slepian' death. most of the protest, includ mr. lotempio, were among the thousand of peopl arrest here in 1992, the height of anti-abort activ in buffalo. but if oper rescu return, as plan, for a spring of life reunion in april, mr. lotempio said, she will not be there. instead, she plan to stay in church and pray, to avoid the milit she say she find uncomfort. glenn murray, a lawyer for womenservic clinic, said: when peopl from out of town show up, that is when we feel the most danger. the local peopl are a known quantiti. we know most of the local peopl by name. buffalo ha been among a hand of hot spot for abort protest for the last decad. it is a heavili cathol citi where thousand of protest from around the countri demonstr for two week in 1992. they fail to close abort clinic, but 500 peopl were arrest in ralli that snarl traffic and drew nation headlin. those ralli, as well as earlier protest and continu sidewalk vigil, have had an impact, peopl on both side of the abort issu say. the number of clinic perform abort in the buffalo area ha drop to one from three. and after slepian' death and the retir thi week of anoth doctor, there are onli two doctor in the area for whom abort form a signific part of their practic. the daili demonstr count thi as progress. but their perch outsid the clinic mean they wit far more of what they believ are murder than what they call rescu. about 30 women a day might go into the clinic. after eight year, mr. lotempio can count eight women who chang their mind and did not get abort while she wa at the clinic. insid the clinic, the protest just make a hard job harder, mani clinic worker say. while some demonstr simpli repeat the rosari, other protest call out to patient as they drive into the park lot behind the build, or walk up to the fortresslik front. they ask question like do you know what your babi look like? or is it a boy or a girl? sometim they accus peopl of murder and tortur and sin, or threaten them with damnat. feder law bar protest from come within 15 feet of the clinic entranc, and from lean sign against it wall. some push the limit, frustrat clinic worker and guard. the rule protect peopl from physic harass, but becaus of the distanc, they turn what could be quiet convers into catcal and taunt. when a patient goe into the clinic, the protest take on a differ persona, said melinda duboi, director of the buffalo clinic. they scream and yell and call us name. they lie. some day we'r immun to it, but other day it' just too much. linda palm, 51, march at the clinic on friday, said she identifi with the clinic patient. when she wa 23, she said, she struggl with the difficulti of be unmarri and pregnant herself, but decid to have her child, and marri the father. she began protest in 1990, after attend an abort protest march in albani. while veteran and civic leader devot wednesday' nation holiday to honor fallen soldier, remembr day ha becom a chill vigil for canadian in the front line of the abortion-right movement. there is immedi fear, becaus an anti-abort gunman is believ to be at larg. and there is long-term anxieti, becaus even in thi countri where abort are legal and publicli fund, women may find access diminish. there is specul the sniper' time is link to remembr day becaus some anti-abort activist use the day to commemor abort fetus. three time sinc 1994, a sniper ha use thi time of year to fire into the home of a canadian doctor who perform abort, each time wound the target. the attack were spread across canada ontario, manitoba and british columbia. us. and canadian investig now believ those attack were link to two shoot of abortion-provid doctor in upstat new york, includ the oct. 23 slay of dr. barnett slepian at hi home near buffalo. an american anti-abort activist, jame kopp, is want for question about the shoot. polic say they don't know which side of the border he is on, fuel uneasi at clinic and hospit throughout canada. you must realiz canada ha the largest undefend border in the world, said keith mccaskil, a polic inspector in winnipeg, manitoba, and spokesman for the investig. mani women' clinic have tighten secur, and doctor who provid abort have been urg to take precaut. i would suggest they be extrem awar of their day-to-day go on, whether dure their busi day or after hour, said toronto detect rick stub. across canada, there have been report of obstetrician-gynecologist modifi their practic or decid to stop perform abort. some wear bulletproof vest and hang sheet over window of their home. abortion-right group say most doctor are not back down. there' a great deal of sad, said susan fox, director of a clinic in edmonton, alberta, that provid abort. but there' also a feel of determin that we won't be deter or scare by these action. marilyn wilson, execut director of the canadian abort right action leagu, see a long-term threat becaus fear of violenc may intimid young doctor from enter the field. there are almost no doctor who have stop perform these procedur, even under the current reign of terror, she said. but young doctor with famili wouldn't necessarili want to do thi. they may not be will to put their live at risk. the abort debat is onli one of sever factor contribut to a shortag of obstetrician-gynecologist in canada. the nation societi that overse the special say there are about 1,400 doctor in the field, a shortfal of 600, and most are in their 50 or 60. the societi say long hour and limit on fee paid by the public health-car system are caus burnout and deter medic school graduat as they choos a specialti. anoth problem is that few canadian medic school offer train in abort. women in canada' big citi gener have adequ access to abort. those in rural area often face long journey, and the provinc of princ edward island prohibit abort at it six hospit, forc women there to travel to new brunswick or nova scotia. abortion-right group say the situat would improv if the ru-486 abort pill were avail in canada. no drug compani ha appli for permiss to market the pill, either fear boycott or doubt it profit. the govern ha been urg to make a public appeal to drug compani, but the health depart say thi can't be done. it would be a conflict of interest, said bonni fox-mcintyr, a depart spokeswoman. as a regul we have to stay at arm' length, so we can judg an applic imparti. abort wa illeg in canada until 1988. now there is no abort law of ani sort, about 100,000 abort are perform annual, and poll indic roughli three-quart of canadian favor pro-choic polici. yet public support doesn't spare doctor from fear. dr. henri morgental, who led effort to overturn the old abort law and whose toronto clinic wa bomb in 1993, say he and hi colleagu are sacrif person freedom as they reluctantli increas secur measur. unfortun, doctor who are commit to provid these servic will have to accept a certain diminish of their enjoy of life, he said. in the aftermath of last month' deadli sniper attack on an obstetrician in upstat new york, attorney gener janet reno announc last week that she wa set up a new investig unit to examin the possibl that the doctor wa the victim of a broader anti-abort plot. the unit, the nation clinic violenc task forc, will includ a dozen justic depart lawyer and involv sever law-enforc agenc. but the main work of look into the shoot of dr. barnett slepian in hi suburban buffalo home and how it fit a larger pattern of organ violenc will be done by the fbi, which ha jurisdict over domest terror. for mani in the fbi, that' a problem. in contrast to the old imag of gung-ho fbi agent turn their surveil machineri on polit group, a number of senior fbi agent privat express misgiv about the attorney general' latest task forc, the second she ha order to begin a broad investig into a conspiraci involv anti-abort violenc. fbi offici fear that expand the investig could drive the agenc over the ill-defin boundari that separ inquiri into crimin activ from those into polit caus and unpopular idea. today' agent are eager to disassoci themselv from the old j. edgar hoover day of trampl the civil right of polit dissid in the guis of seriou investig. they do not want the agenc drawn into the middl of the bitter ideolog war between anti-abort group and abort right advoc, who have long assert the exist of an organ campaign against clinic and doctor. mani of those call for govern help were onc themselv subject of fbi interest as anti-war and civil right activist. senior agenc offici, includ director loui freeh, were start their career in the earli 1970 and watch in dismay as the fbi wa shaken by revel about cointelpro, the counterintellig program that allow agent to spi on, burgl, wiretap and infiltr anti-war and civil right group like student for a democrat societi and the student nonviol coordin committe. some offici are dubiou that a conspiraci exist to kill doctor who perform abort. they came up empti hand when reno order the first feder inquiri in 1994 after the kill of a florida doctor and hi bodyguard. the justic depart conduct a two-year grand juri investigation; agent pursu some anti-abort activist use surveil team. but investig never found a specif plot against abort clinic and staff member. violenc at abort clinic is onli part of the problem. the fbi ha in recent year found itself thrown into a minefield of polit ting case involv the volatil world of anti-govern militia, environment and christian extremist, white separatist, anim right activist and islam fundamentalist. the fbi is veri quick to jump from investig crime to investig polit associ, said david cole, a law professor at georgetown univers. when you move from investig crime to investig group, that all-import nexu to crimin conduct get lost, the focu get broader and broader and you start sweep in all kind of law polit activ. in respons to terrorist attack like the bomb of the world trade center in 1993, the oklahoma citi feder build in 1995 and the olymp park in atlanta in 1996, the agenc ha increas effort to deter such incid in a major prevent program. in such case, the justic depart, the fbi and other law enforc agenc said they oper under domest secur guidelin that requir investig to find a reason indic that a group is plan to break the law befor they can open an inquiri into an organ. befor the author can use such intrus tactic as wiretap or properti search, they must have specif evid. yet fbi agent throughout the countri have quietli evalu the threat pose by a varieti of extremist group through it link to local author and inform interview with the leader of some group. their conclus is that most of these group pose littl real danger. much more difficult to investig are lone terrorist inflam by the oratori of extremist ideolog but who belong to no group, drift along society' fray margin, off the grid, as some agent describ it, without the usual tie to famili, friend or work. the profil fit eric robert rudolph, the fugit want for bomb at the atlanta olymp, a gay nightclub and two abort clinic. he ha kept hi belief mostli to himself, although acquaint hint that he wa familiar with religi extrem and hate group. in contrast, jame charl kopp, who is be sought as a materi wit in the kill of slepian, left a trail of clue about hi motiv. he wa an earli follow of randal terri, a leader of oper rescu. later, kopp wa associ with the lamb of christ, an anoth milit anti-abort group. one law-enforc offici said that the govern should do what it doe best. we should investig violat, he said. we shouldn't investig group. everyon who knew dr. barnett slepian knew that the slight, gray physician endur a measur of stress that would exhaust, even break, most peopl. there were the stranger who paw through the garbag can at hi home and growl murder as they pass him in the groceri store aisl. demonstr assail hi pregnant patient as they arriv at hi offic for their checkup, call him a babi killer. outsid the clinic where he perform abort two day a week, picket shout epithet like pig to hi face. slepian, an obstetrician and gynecologist by train and an abort doctor by principl, rare acknowledg the strain. he might crack an occasion joke at the expens of the protest who shadow him at work and on weekend. then he would do someth unexpect, like invit an anti-abort leader to breakfast or stop and chat with a familiar demonstr outsid the clinic. so when he wa kill oct. 23 by a sniper' bullet fire through the kitchen window of hi home in the buffalo, n.y., suburb, a furtiv execut that fit a pattern of four earlier attack on abort provid in western new york state and canada, friend and rel wonder not so much that slepian' work could arous such murder violenc. he had predict as much himself. instead, they wonder, onc again, that he persist in that work, long after other buffalo doctor had surrend to the pressur of abort oppon. he wa an incred fatalist person who thought that if your number' up, it' up, and there is noth you can do about it, said h. amanda robb, the doctor' 32-year-old niec. and he wa incred stubborn. he said that women had a right to comprehens health care and sinc he wa a women' doctor, he wa go to provid it for them. slepian is the third doctor to be kill in the last five year in bomb and shoot that have kill 7 peopl and wound 17 at abort clinic around the nation. to hi tormentor, he wa simpli an abort doctor. to member of the abort right movement, he wa a martyr for their caus. but slepian wa far from either. in interview with friend and famili member, he emerg as more than a one-dimension abstract a conserv who advoc old-fashion valu like self-reli, a shi man who had rare flash of anger, a doctor who perform abort but had no more patienc for women who had multipl abort than for women who had multipl children they did not want or could not support. he wa kill becaus he perform a medic procedur that ha becom emot and politic. yet there is noth in hi life to suggest he wa a crusad in either polit or medicin. rather, he wa an obstin, unassum man who did a remark thing. out of contrari and out of conscienc, say those who knew him, he refus to allow anyon to dictat what kind of doctor he should be, and for that, he paid with hi life. the clue to slepian' flinti brand of commit lie, in part, in hi upbring. hi wa a famili that took success for grant even as it teeter on the edg of poverti. to earn money for medic school, he shovel muck at a ranch and drove a taxi. he made few friend, but those he had were friend for life. when their wive were sick, he call repeatedli. when they were lone, he flew to their side. slepian, who wa known as bart, use to tell peopl that he chose obstetr becaus it is a specialti that expos a doctor to the least suffer, and that he perform abort becaus it wa legal and the altern were so much wors. slepian often express exasper over women who came to him for abort after abort. don't they get it? hi clinic staff recal him say more than onc. he had the same impati for women like those he rememb from hi resid in inner-c buffalo, who had child after child and no mean of support. he had the contempt for that of somebodi who had pull himself up by hi bootstrap and made it in the world, ms. robb said. he believ that to ban abort or, just as shame in hi view, to stop teach young doctor how to perform them, would not correct the human imperfect that he found so irrit. there are 1.5 million abort perform in thi countri, hi niec said, and he just felt we'r not equip to handl 1.5 million unwant children. when he wa kill, at the age of 52, bart slepian own an impos red brick home in the quiet suburb of amherst, complet with a swim pool with piped-in music and an assort of the time-sav gadget he ador. slepian' trajectori to that comfort doctor' life had been unconvent. hi grandfath, a russian jewish immigr who start out sell shoelac from a pushcart in boston, propel all five of hi son into harvard at a time when few jew met the university' blue-blood standard. hi father, in turn, decre that hi own three son would be doctor or earn phd'. we grew up in a home where there wa tremend, tremend, tremend respect for educ, said serena robb, slepian' sister, who is four year older than him. if you got an a, it wa ok if you got a b, you got yell at. the family' mean did not match it expect. slepian' father, philip, had join hi own father' busi manufactur leather sole for shoe. soon after bart wa born in 1946 in boston, the compani fail, so to save money, the father move hi famili of six to hi in-laws' apart in mckeesport, pa., and then to rochest, ny. onc settl, slepian' father set himself up as a freelanc writer, crisscross the countri in hi old studebak, research the origin of promin citizen at the librari of congress and write their stori for small-town newspap. he sold articl by the hundr, and wa still write until hi death nine year ago at the age of 93. the success that wa expect of bart slepian did not come easili. as a child, he wa so shi that he cri when anyon look at him, hi sister recal. an unexcept student, he went to a local commun colleg befor transfer to the univers of denver, where he major in zoolog. reject by medic school in the unit state the fate of two out of three applic in the late 1960 he studi one year in belgium and then enrol at the autonom univers for medicin in guadalajara, mexico. hi friend rememb him as funni and obstin, a thin young man with glass and a reced hairlin who beat all comer at arm-wrestl and pool. bart had certain belief, strongli held, said richard schwarz, an old classmat who is an internist on long island. he alway said you shouldn't sit around whine about thing, schwarz said. he would say, `go after what' your and what' right.' bart slepian' determin surfac in quirki way. he onc insist on go to the top of the world trade center, despit a crippl fear of height. to get to the window, he crawl, inch by inch. i said, `you don't have to do this,' recal schwarz, who wa with him at the time. and he said, `i want to do it.' bart made it count. he felt aliv. forc to drop out of school everi few semest to work, he live in reno with hi sister serena, a widow who wa struggl to take care of two young daughter. she work as a waitress and a blackjack dealer, share her tip with him while he drove a cab, clean barn at a ranch and work as a laboratori assist at the local veteran administr hospit. after graduat, he move to buffalo for hi medic resid. there he marri lynn breitbart, a regist nurs 10 year hi junior, and scrape togeth the money to buy an obstetr practic from a doctor who wa about to retir. he had a sooth, unhurri manner. when a patient of hi, patti durlak, wa diagnos with diabet, slepian refer her to a specialist but call everi few day for month to help her overcom a fear of the needl she had to use for her insulin inject. the other doctor said, `just deal with it,' mr. durlak recal. not dr. slepian. in most way, he wa a typic suburban famili man, work six day a week and spend hi free time at littl leagu game and counti fair with hi four son. but by the late 1980, he and other abort doctor in buffalo were under sieg. in one notori 1991 incid record on videotap, the rev. paul schenck, one of the fieriest of buffalo' anti-abort leader, threw himself in front of the doctor' car as he pull into the clinic driveway. slepian park on the street. as he push hi way through the crowd of chant demonstr, schenck cup hi hand around hi mouth and lung, shout, slepian, you pig! slepian' attempt to separ the abort conflict from hi privat life were futil. the protest follow him home and the man who had been so bash as a boy found himself, uncomfort, at the center of controversi and attent. onc, he show hi anger. in 1988, when demonstr jeer at him from the sidewalk in front of hi home as he open hanukkah present with hi children, the doctor came out brandish a basebal bat. he deni he hurt anyon, but a town judg order him to repair one protester' smash van window and pay a portion of another' medic bill. the outburst surpris hi famili and friend. it wa not slepian' style to make a public fuss, much less acknowledg the stress of be taunt by protest. stress? hi oldest brother paul respond gruffli when ask about the doctor' mood. i never heard the word use in my famili, except as an engin term. he said it wa a nuisanc. mr. slepian did not respond to request for an interview. she express rage to the buffalo new shortli after the shoot. she said that whoever had kill her husband deserv the death penalti and that she would be happi to administ the lethal inject herself. she also spoke out after schenck' brother, robert, anoth anti-abort leader who frequent confront slepian, sent a bouquet of flower. mr. slepian denounc him as a hypocrit. after the confront in 1988, slepian turn to civil harass lawsuit, letter and leviti to deal with the protest. in 1993, when a man activ in the anti-abort effort wa arrest for rifl through the doctor' garbag can at home, slepian tri to treat the incid lightli. they hope got the bag full of dirti diaper, he joke. he tri to engag hi critic through the local newspap. he told the buffalo new that abort protest should turn their energi to help women avoid unwant pregnanc through birth control and counsel. in a letter to the editor he warn that by repeatedli call him a murder, hi critic were incit violenc. slepian accept that oppon of abort act out of moral convict, hi friend said, but resent the person attack. he thought it tend to demon and dehuman him and increas the danger, said hi lawyer, glenn edward murray. so slepian took a step that few of the nation' beleagu abort clinic doctor dare. he insist that if he tri hard enough, he might cut through the venom. to the dismay of the staff member who fear for hi safeti, slepian began about a year ago to stop and chat with protest he recogn outsid the womenservic abort clinic in buffalo, where he work two day a week. he surpris a gather of protest who were prepar for what they euphemist call a hous call, or demonstr at the doctor' home, and invit the protest' organ, the rev. robert behn, to breakfast. their hourlong convers the next morn wa inconclus, behn said, dismiss slepian' gestur as an attempt to get peopl to like him. he ask slepian how perform abort affect him spiritu. in respons, he recal, the doctor said, i'm fine spiritu. slepian, meanwhil, focus more on time away from home with hi famili. he plan to take a cruis next spring. he bought a time-shar apart near disney world in florida. he had so mani plan, said ellen fink, a close friend of the coupl for 15 year. he wasn't done. he wasn't done live yet. still, sometim dure the most casual convers, a shadow would appear. when hi wife gave him a gray african parrot for a birthday gift, slepian joke that the bird would probabl outliv him so he would teach it hi eulog. he would talk about the funer he want, mr. fink said. he said he didn't have a lot of friend and want all of them to come in separ car, one in each car, so he'd have a long process. in the week befor hi death, slepian had reason to be preoccupi with thought of mortal. a medic checkup had reveal a blockag of hi heart, mr. fink said, recount a convers with mr. slepian the day of the slay. a blockag is a sign of probabl coronari arteri diseas. he wa to have more test the follow week. i said, `lynn, just relax, it' go to be ok,' mr. fink recal. that same day, the nation abort feder sent a fax to the womenservic clinic warn of a pattern of sniper attack on abort doctor that occur in earli novemb. marilynn buckham, the clinic director, sent it to slepian. he definit took it serious, she recal. typic, the doctor did not share ani concern he might have felt. it wa a normal day, said tammi latini, hi offic assist. we were hors around.' that even, the slepian went to synagogu to mark the ninth anniversari of the death of slepian' father. shortli after they return home, a sniper' bullet smash through the kitchen window, kill slepian as he chat with hi wife and son. the protest return to the clinic five day later, the first day it reopen. mr. buckham, the director, said slepian would not have been surpris. they have their routin. so did he. he never want a day to end on a bad note, she said. at the end of the day, i would alway say, `thank you for coming.' and he would alway turn with a stupid grin and say, `thank for have me.' the slay of dr. barnett slepian in hi home last week elimin the mainstay of the onli abort clinic here, but it ha not elimin women' access to abort. that is becaus the avail of abort in the buffalo area, as in much of the unit state, is a complex realiti, one affect by class and educ, medic train and the person convict of individu doctor. knowledg middle-class and affluent women here who find themselv with an unwant pregnanc can usual obtain an abort from their privat gynecologist, or if a gynecologist ha a person object to the procedur, through a referr to a colleagu. women who are poor, young or uneduc and have no such regular relationship with doctor have to reli on special clinic like the one slepian work in, or on hospit. it is thi group for whom unplan pregnanc are far more common than for prosper women that face a shrink univers of possibl as a result of the fear set off by slepian' kill and the slay of five other doctor and clinic worker sinc 1993, medic expert said. if you'r well off and well connect, you can get your abort, said dr. stephen wear, co-director of the center for clinic ethic at the univers of buffalo, which train doctor for the buffalo area' hospit. for everybodi els, it' less and less avail. the number of abort in the unit state ha been declin steadili sinc the first year after the suprem court' roe vs. wade decis legal abort in 1973, accord to the alan guttmach institut, which studi reproduct issu. they now number roughli 1.5 million a year, accord to report by guttmach, or 1.4 million, accord to the nation right to life committe, the nation' largest anti-abort group, which calcul it estim partli from the guttmach figur. the number of provid who identifi themselv as perform abort as part of their practic is diminish as well. a 1994 guttmach studi, the last one publish, found that the number had decreas 18 percent between 1982 and 1992, to 2,380 from 2,908. moreov, the studi said, onli 12 percent of the nation' resid program routin offer train in abort dure the first trimest, though mani do offer elect cours. laura echevarria, director of media relat for the nation right to life

provid, includ 61 hospit and 44 clinic. still, that provid figur greatli underst the number of privat doctor who perform them in their offic, medic expert say. mani obstetrician and gynecologist in manhattan provid abort as part of their palett of servic, and have for mani year, said dr. richard hausknecht, the medic director of plan parenthood. rich and middle-class women have alway had access to abort, and they alway will. the major threat to avail in the citi is less a result of anti-abort violenc than of medic train. the bottom line is that we'r face an impend shortag of physician who are adequ train and will to do the procedur, said dr. john choat, chairman of the new york state divis of the american colleg of obstetrician and gynecologist. but the lack of train program is also a result of polit pressur on hospit and univers by antagonist of abort and the same climat of fear. physician tend to lie low, choat said. they don't public the fact that they do them. if they do them, they do it quietli out of fear for their practic and for their live. one develop on the horizon that is expect to chang the outlook for abort substanti is final feder approv, expect next year, of the ru-486 pill, the drug that end an earli pregnanc without the need for surgeri. when the pill wa introduc in franc and in edinburgh, scotland, hausknecht said, the number of surgic abort plummet. in juli 1988, when randal terri drove through the night from hi home in binghamton, n.y., to atlanta to start the seri of anti-abort protest that would final put hi new hard-lin group, oper rescu, onto america' front page, jame charl kopp wa in the van ride alongsid him, accord to former leader of oper rescu who spoke on the condit of anonym. and, those peopl say, when terri wa arrest on the first

anti-abort movement surg in late 1988 and 1989, accord to the former leader of oper rescu. now, kopp is be sought by feder and local law enforc author for question as a materi wit in the murder of an obstetrician who perform abort in the buffalo region. the author also say he may have inform that will help solv four other sniper attack on doctor who perform abort in canada and upstat new york. some abortion-right group are seiz on kopp' role in oper rescu to rais new question about the connect between the recent anti-abort violenc and the hard-lin anti-abort protest group that burst onto the nation scene in the late 1980. for year, the feder bureau of investig and the justic depart have look in vain for evid to determin whether a nation conspiraci might be behind a seri of clinic bomb and shoot of doctor and other clinic staff member that began in the earli 1990. a feder grand juri in alexandria, va., that look into conspiraci alleg wa ultim disband without find a nation underground. but some feder law enforc offici say they hope that kopp may help provid such a link. in fact, the announc that law enforc offici are look for him ha been made as attorney gener janet reno ha prepar to reviv an interag task forc to look onc again for possibl conspiraci behind anti-abort crime. feder law enforc offici and the author say kopp is not now a suspect in the sniper attack on oct. 23 that kill dr. barnett a. slepian near buffalo. but they say kopp' car wa seen near slepian' home in amherst, ny. in the week befor the doctor wa shot. one day after issu a warrant for kopp'

about 400 that have pour into the fbi' inform line: (800) 281-1184. the polic have gone through photograph of abort protest and clinic worker in buffalo and around the countri, and they are also review hundr of hour of videotap of demonstr in search of kopp' face. at thi point, offici consid the shoot of slepian to be connect to three attack in canada and one in rochest on doctor who provid

over four year and 3,000 mile, from vancouv, british columbia, to buffalo. as is the case with mani earli veteran of oper rescu, kopp wa transform into a hard-cor anti-abort milit in jail in atlanta in 1988, accord to mani peopl who were in jail with him who insist on anonym. by outward appear, dorothi hayes' life seem ordinari. she and her famili live in a rambl old home on the shore of lake ontario, and everi morn, she give her husband, john, a peck on the cheek befor he goe to work. she run errand, like other suburban mom, and spend much of her day take care of her children. but one thing set mr. hay apart from her neighbor. as a devot oppon of abort, the 43-year-old mother of nine regularli play host to a seri of travel speaker, priest and protest mani of whom have come to rochest intent upon spread the word against abort and shut down clinic that provid it. she is one of thousand of peopl across the countri loos associ with anti-abort group like the lamb of christ who have open their home to the lambs' founder, the rev. norman weslin, and other itiner demonstr. while mani includ mr. hay disavow violent tactic, support of abort right say that peopl like her bear some respons when the protest they help blockad clinic or threaten doctor. these peopl who provid father weslin with food and shelter when he come into town to close the clinic are not innoc, said ann glazier, the director of clinic defens for the plan parenthood feder. it' just not credibl to say they aren't part of the extremist activ that is take place at these clinic. they are still guilti of interf with women' access. but mari quinn, a local organ for the lamb of christ who also offer her home to protest, see matter in a differ light. take peopl in like thi is an act of christian chariti, mr. quinn said. `peopl who travel around the countri do thi work are taken in by those of us that who don't want to lose their stupid hous. we take in these peopl becaus they are will to make the sacrific. member of the lamb of christ have been persist figur in protest at the buffalo women' clinic where dr. barnett slepian work befor he wa shot to death last month. although no suspect ha been identifi in the shoot or in sever similar attack in new york and canada over the past sever year, offici are look to question a vermont man whose car wa seen near dr. slepian' home. that man, jame charl kopp, ha particip in abort protest for more than a decad, and often wa a hous guest of other member of the lamb of christ. while mr. hay say she would never so much as obstruct a clinic' door, some of those to whom she ha given refug have no qualm about do so. weslin, the leader of the lamb of christ, is one of those who ha benefit from mr. hayes' hospit, a modern version of the generos that christ and the apostl knew well. he pride himself on be arrest more than 60 time dure protest in front of medic clinic. and throughout the 1980 and earli '90, he wa activ in clinic rescu, in which protest tri physic to restrain patient tri to enter clinic. weslin stay at mr. hayes' home onli onc, begin in may 1996 when he first came to speak at local church about the anti-abort movement. but dure a stay that last sever month, he wa arrest on feder charg of block access to a rochest health clinic where abort were perform. he wa later convict and serv two and a half month in prison. dure the protest outsid the clinic, he and sever other protest lock themselv in a homemad contrapt call the oven, made of cement and iron. it took polic offic sever hour to lug the devic to a hors trailer that cart it off. at the same protest, one man glu hi head to a lock on a gate surround the clinic, a move some protest later said wa an accid. abort oppon like mr. hay and mr. quinn speak of attend peac observ at abort clinic and offer prayer for the unborn. they talk about counsel women about altern to abort at roman cathol pregnanc center, and their support of anti-abort candid. but they also say they saw noth wrong with weslin tri to block access to clinic. they describ the activ as peac resist meant to stop what they see as murder. weslin and the other hous guest of mr. hay and mr. quinn come recommend from friend and member of local cathol church, they said, ad that most are speaker at local church or anti-abort event. and although they say they would never take into their home a stranger want by the fbi, like kopp, they conced that they sometim know littl about their guest. but mr. hay and mr. quinn say they know a lot about weslin. an armi veteran, he ha been a leader of the anti-abort movement for more than 25 year, they say, and found a home for unw mother. mr. hay said that when she met him, it wa obviou he wa a man of peac who had a tremend devot to the bless mother and basic recogn that we are helpless lamb. barbara frederick, anoth local abort oppon who develop tie to the lamb after weslin came to town, ad that the priest epitom a man of god. i just knew when i look at hi holi shoe and hi simpl coat that had been mend 50 time, she said. he wa humbl, a man who wa do thi for a higher purpos, tri to save peopl through sacrific and prayer. opp also ha robust defend among the peopl who hous him as he rode about the countri from protest to protest. e. kenni, 20, said that hi parent hous kopp in their st. alban, vt., home for two year after he spoke at their local church in 1988. dure kopp' stay, he wa a pleasur, kenni said, alway help around the hous. he wa a nice guy, kind of like an uncl to us, kenni said. he'd sit around and play video game with us and make us model plane out of wood. like weslin, kopp wa consum by a need to fight abort and often talk about it evil, kenni said, ad that kopp wa a gentl man who want to becom a cathol priest. he wa alway in a good mood, kenni said. he never did anyth violent at all. both kopp and weslin have been arrest repeatedli dure abort protest. the men have move in the same circl and at time found themselv arrest at the same event. mr. quinn said that weslin told her in a recent telephon convers that he knew kopp. weslin could not be reach for comment, but it is clear that the two men have encount each other. both face misdemeanor charg after block a burlington, vt., health clinic in 1990 that kopp call the mill. and they spent time in the same jail in atlanta in 1988 after a clinic protest. slepian' death ha abort oppon like mr. hay and mr. quinn worri, both about how the kill is be portray in the media and what it will do to membership in group like the lamb of christ. for a long time, you felt like the voic in the desert that wasn't be heard, mr. hay said. and then there wa thi horribl tragedi of thi doctor' death becom the face of the movement. we'r about save live, she said. the fbi ha not talk to mr. hay, but kenni said that agent have spoken to him. the justic depart say that a feder task forc set up thi week to investig the kill of slepian is look for evid connect anti-abort violenc at variou clinic. it' fair to say that when investig these event, we will look at ani connect between individu engag in crimin conduct, myron marlin, a spokesman for the depart, said. mani local cathol associ with the lamb of christ have tri to distanc themselv from the kill of slepian. they are mail literatur say that the killer doe not repres their movement. in addit, some peopl associ with the lamb are offer other possibl explan for the kill. some say they believ that the killer might have been someon overcom by grief after a person experi with abort. other wonder whether the shooter had tri to wound the doctor to scare him or prevent him from perform more abort. the lamb also wonder whether abortionist oppon are be blame for a shoot commit by a disgruntl patient. one idea gain currenc among the lamb, and promin display on their web site, suggest that the kill wa the result of a plot by abort support to discredit abort oppon just befor last week' elect. mr. hay say she doesn't know the truth. there are wacko who travel around and they may be in front of the clinic becaus we are drawn to the same place, she said. but you don't know everyon who show up and you don't turn to the person next to you and tell them they don't belong there. mr. frederick said that anyon who would shoot a doctor who provid abort wa someon who had snap, perhap becaus of the import of the situat. member of the lamb of christ and other oppon of abort in rochest wonder whether the kill of slepian will hinder their effort. when weslin first arriv two year ago, he brought new focu to a group that often had done littl more than counsel pregnant women and set up booth on colleg campus, they said. in mani citi, they have a priest for life coordin and lead rosari march against abort, mr. quinn said. but with father weslin come here, we could final come togeth and feel like we were do someth sacrifici as a group. mr. hay said that she felt the first pull of the movement in the earli 1980, when she heard women speak about choic in regard to abort. then she saw silent scream, a well-known anti-abort film that purport to show the footag of an abort. what i saw wa the end of life, she said. she began to volunt at a cathol pregnanc center where she encourag women not to kill their child. she also began to hous unw mother and went to stand vigil outsid local clinic where abort were perform. mr. hay look at her 3-month-old daughter, bernadett, then point to the prenat imag of the infant, a sonogram taken at 13 week that she keep on her refriger door. she describ what could have been her baby' fate, had she been someon else' child. two pound and two inch ago, she could have been a partial-birth abort, mr. hay said, refer to a controversi late-term abort procedur. they have the hardest time get the shoulder out, so they can get to the head and punctur it. it' brutal, but what do you expect when the purpos is a dead babi? there' no question that these doctor are tri to murder a child. ","Dr. Barnett Slepian, the mainstay of Buffalo's only abortion clinic, was slain as he stood at his kitchen window.Slepian has been described as a fatalist who stubbornly adhered to doing what he thought right.The FBI is looking for James Kopp for questioning as a material witness in the slaying.Kopp has long been identified as a major voice in the anti-abortion movement.Attorney General Reno will investigate if the slaying is part of a nation-wide plot.In Canada, authorities are worried that new violence could erupt as Remembrance Day approaches.Anti-abortion pamphlets have been delivered to a Canadian newspaper, possibly by Kopp.","On Oct. 23, 1998, a sniper killed Dr. Barnet Slepian, a mainstay in the last abortion clinic in the Buffalo area and one of only a few doctors performing the procedure in the face of protesters and threats.Many of the protesters are itinerants like Rev. Norman Weslin, founder of the anti-abortion group Lambs of Christ, who travel about spreading their message and shutting down clinics.Another itinerant demonstrator, James Charles Kopp, is wanted by the FBI as a material witness in the Slepian murder.In addition to anti-abortion violence, a shortage of doctors who are trained and willing to do the procedures imperil their widespread availability.","The primary doctor at the last abortion clinic in Buffalo, NY, was shot and killed.Dr. Slepian, a stubborn man, dedicated to women's care, and an unlikely martyr.It's the 7th such death, and the 4th similar attack.James Kopp is sought as a material witness.The anti-abortion movement has local and itinerate members.Their activities go from prayers and talking to confrontations, threats and violence.After this killing, the FBI resumed a search for an anti-abortion conspiracy.Since the first few years after Roe v Wade, the number of abortions has declined, as has the number of clinics and doctors providing the procedure, especially for poorer women.","Abortion clinics continue to be targeted by anti-abortion groups such as Operation Rescue, Lambs of Christ, and Army of God.Opposition ranges from silent vigils to vocal and physical intimidation, and even murder.Dr. Bart Shepian of Buffalo's only abortion clinic was murdered in his home.Police in the US and Canada are looking for James Kopp, a known abortion opponent, as a material witness in that murder.The clinics serve poor, young, and uneducated women since the well-to-do use their established providers.AG Janet Reno has named a task force to find out if the Slepian murder, the third in five years, is part of an organized campaign of violence."

next season, becaus he want to test free agenc. there is a good chanc the yanke will not offer him the most lavish contract, so william might be forc to decid between the fattest paycheck and a new situat in the basebal citi of hi choic or a pretti fat paycheck and a familiar situat in the bronx. scott bora, williams' agent, compar hi client with player in the $10 million-a-year bracket last

know dure the year, i think it would be veri hard, but not imposs, to start from scratch somewher els. william continued: but i think the realiti of the game in thi day and age is thing happen. you can't realli write thing in stone that they'r go to happen. peopl get trade. peopl becom free agent and go to other team. i have to make a decis realli think about all the peopl i'm account for. when

teammat and manag, and where the team ha been in the post-season for four straight year, he did not hesit to answer. my respons to that would be it' not the time right now to start think about that, william said. if i start think about that, it'll distract me to what i need to do in the world seri. william then talk about how the yanke are at the end of a remark season and how he did not want hi situat to disrupt that. but, with williams' statu uncertain, he wa ask if the next four to seven game would be bittersweet, sinc he could be end a 13-year associ with the yanke. i don't want to talk about that, william said. i'm go to have a lot of fun out there. i'm go to go all out. then william walk away from the interview. the new york time said in an editori on saturday, oct. 17: it is fit that thi most memor of basebal season should conclud with a world seri that open saturday night in yanke stadium, the age but still grand cathedr of the sport. bedeck in bunt and banner, the rever

team of the modern era, or just a talent squad that own the regular season but fold in the world seri. new yorker are a boister, boast bunch, and the patter of the citi thi week ha been loud and arrog, or so it must seem to anyon ventur here from san diego to root for the padr. the word on the sidewalk and in the subway is that the padr don't measur up against the yanke. sure, they have lethal start pitcher in kevin brown and andi ashbi, and one of the game' best closer in trevor hoffman, not to mention prolif hitter like toni gwynn and greg vaughn, who is hobbl but still danger. but how is that a match for the yankees' world seri start rotat of david well, orlando hernandez, david cone and andi pettitt, bullpen flamethrow mariano rivera, plu the deepest bat order in basebal? yet the truth is that yanke fan are terrifi the team will crumpl. basebal fan, even yanke fan, can spend a lifetim wait to see a home team of histor calib, and thi yanke team will not reach that sanctifi statu unless it end it record-set season by win the world seri. the doubt keep creep up. the team wa piti at the plate through most of the playoff. tino martinez, the top run produc, ha been in a numb slump. berni william, the american leagu bat champ, hit well in the pennant seri against the cleveland indian, but ha seem distract by person matter. shane spencer, the rooki slug sensat of septemb, hasn't turn out to be the new mr. octob. pettitt ha been struggl sinc august. the curiou thing about thi team, which won more game dure the regular season than ani team in american leagu histori, is how quiet and unobtrus it can be. it sport no domin superstar, no swagger clubhous leader, no one who seem to belong in new york. so when the yanke start to drift on the field, fan tend to fear the team might simpli fade away. until the indian surg temporarili ahead in the playoff, the yanke had face no seriou test of resili all season. new yorker can alreadi tast that ticker-tap parad up broadway. but behind everi mighti cheer at the stadium saturday night will lurk the fear that when the curtain fall on the season, an unherald and unlegendari team from san diego will be the one that is rememb. the last time they were seen on the field at yanke stadium, they were inadvert influenc the outcom of the game that sent the cleveland indian home and the yanke to the world seri. that' not to say the umpir will mess up in the world seri, but they have shown they are emin capabl of interf with the natur progress of postseason game. all right, so ted hendri won't be in the world series; the umpires' collect bargain agreement with the leagu doe not allow an umpir to work both a leagu championship seri and the world seri. joe brinkman won't be here either, even though the agreement doe allow for an umpir to work both a divis seri and the world seri. the three american leagu umpir who are on the six-man world seri crew did work in the first round of the playoff. one of them, richi garcia, will be the crew chief and behind the plate in saturday night' open at yanke stadium. gene budig, the al presid, friday call garcia, a 24-year veteran, one of the league' most respect umpir. but after saturday night, garcia will move to right field sunday night for game 2. now whi doe that combin sound familiar, richi garcia and right field? ah ye, the last time garcia work a post-season seri at yanke stadium, he wa the umpir in game 1 of the leagu championship seri two year ago when a young fan from new jersey no name, please; he ha been over-glorifi enough reach over the fenc and caught derek jeter' fli ball just as toni tarasco, baltimore' right fielder, prepar to catch it. garcia rule no interfer, that it wa a home run, then said oop after watch a televis replay clearli show interfer. too late. the call help the yanke win the first game and set the tone for the seri. even though he made a mistak, you know you have the best out there, a basebal offici, speak on the condit of anonym, said. that knowledg come as small consol to the oriol. budig, too, acknowledg that umpir, like player and manag, aren't perfect. major leagu umpir are skill at what they do, but they are human, he said in a telephon interview. day in and day out they do a veri good job for major leagu basebal. round one and two have been difficult, but that happen from time to time. the umpir were so human in the american leagu playoff that it happen from time to time to time to time. the cleveland indian suffer the brunt of the fallibl of the umpir. we had a highlight reel of umpir get knock down by basebal, gener manag john hart said after the indians' final game against the yanke. the umpir didn't lose the game for us, but we had our share of controversi in two playoff seri with umpir. in the divis seri against boston, brinkman, the plate umpir, wa so bad with hi call on pitch and play at the plate that he immedi provok disput that led to hi eject of mike hargrov, the indians' manag, three pitch into game 2, and dwight gooden, their start pitcher, 19 pitch later. hendri wa right or wrong, depend on one' point of view, for hi noncal of interfer on travi fryman in the 12th inning of game 2 of the alc. that rule went in favor of the indian. littl els did. in game 4, jeter wa steal second in the fifth inning when the on-target throw from sandi alomar jr. hit jim mckean, who jump to tri to get out of the way but instead kick the ball into right field. a bat ball, omar vizquel' line drive, struck hendri in game 6. but the worst call of game 6 wa hendry' on a forc play at second base. hendri call berni william safe, rule that vizquel' foot came off the base befor he caught the ball. member of the yanke indic friday that they, too, thought the call wa wrong. i don't know, william said when ask what he thought, but i'll take it. it wa a big play. but did he think he wa out? i'd rather not comment about that, he said. it will stir a lot of controversi. i don't want to get into that. when a player believ he wa safe, he say so and doesn't worri about ani subsequ controversi. if william wa impli that he thought he wa out, anoth member of the yanke said he had no doubt that william wa out. i wasn't sure at first, thi uniform member of the team said, but when i saw it wa hendri, i said uh-oh. i also thought omar is so smooth you'd think he wouldn't come off the bag. then i saw the replay. he wa out. the game today is faster than it use to be, thi observ said. the umpir have to be sharper. mayb garcia, dale scott and tim tschida from the american leagu, and jerri crawford, dana demuth and mark hirschbeck from the nation leagu, will be as sharp as an 18th centuri french guillotin in these four to seven game. leonard coleman, the nl presid, said he thought hi umpir were first-rat in the divis and leagu seri and ad that he ha three splendid umpir work the world seri. budig said: the world seri crew is proven and first-rat. we have total confid in them. the umpir should let the player make the error and the manag the bad decis. then everyon will talk about the player and manag and not the umpir. a strong sign that thi citi is go bonker for the padr came friday morn when 680 fan agre to shave their head for a radio promot raffl in return for a 1-in-680 chanc at skybox ticket for post-season play. thi wa more a show of support for the team than it wa for the one ticket, said tommi sablan, produc of the jeff and jer show. it wa symbol of the effort of the bald padr toni gwynn, walli joyner, greg vaughn, jim leyritz. about a thousand peopl show up men, women and children. we had 10 barber and 20 hairdress and it took six hour for the line to either get buzz or straight-razor. we were shock at the turnout. but thi is a bandwagon town. `buy the ticket on the day of the concert' type public. you'll see an even bigger bandwagon on monday when they'v won and then hope we play the yanke and it' a real world seri. after the padr beat the brave, 3-0, in game 2 of the nation leagu championship seri on thursday night in atlanta to take a two-gam lead in the four-of-seven-gam seri, san diego fan began gear up for a shot at the world seri in more tradit way. it would be the team' first world seri appear sinc 1984, and in the downtown busi district friday, marque and banner read go padr and a lunch-hour ralli wa attend by sever hundr fan. the padr set an attend record of 2,555,901 thi season, up a half-million from last year and nearli a million and a half from three year ago. it stem in part from an effort by john moor, the padr owner, and larri lucchino, the team' presid, to put famili entertain in the park after they bought the team in decemb 1994. thi is a more diversifi group of fan than i saw in atlanta, lucchino said. their crowd seem yuppifi. we'r proud of our three gener of famili who come to the game. donna mcmahon, a 63-year-old homemak from la jolla, ha been a fan sinc she wa 10 and the pacif coast leagu padr play at lane field near the harbor. she would take a streetcar after school to meet her father, and he would buy bleacher seat. later, she brought her four children to jack murphi stadium for the nation leagu padr when 2,500 peopl wa a crowd. now, she bring her grandchildren to a sold-out qualcomm stadium. there are differ group in the stand, she said, the upper class, the middl class, the busi person, the beer-drink fan, the children, all of the mexican fan from across the border. we are true fan all of us. san diego mayor susan gold agre, while also give credit to the balmi weather. padr fan are a cross-sect from all over the counti, she said. downtown, suburban, rural, east, north, rancher and farmer to high-tech engin, yuppi to the new kid the x gener. a lot from across the border. the padr are extrem popular in tijuana. we do have the perfect weather for a long basebal season. play in the world seri in octob ha got to be better than in new york. carlo carrion, who wa born in san diego and ha been a basebal fan for 25 year, bring hi 10- and 8-year-old son to the stadium. thi is a great chanc to let my children see the player work, carrion said. they can look up to these guy and understand their charact and their work ethic. the padr ticket offic estim that on averag, more than 15,000 fan in the 65,000-seat stadium are latin american from san diego, baja california or the state of sonora. the padr have the first major leagu basebal souvenir store in tijuana. a new shipment of bat arriv for tino martinez on friday, and he massag the handl to make sure they were thin enough, knock on the barrel and listen for a certain sound and swung them slowli again and again. martinez wa so excit about the fresh bat, he react like a littl leaguer who wa wield an aluminum bat for the first time. you were save the world seri tree until now, right? martinez said to the repres from the bat compani. these are from world seri tree, aren't they? martinez could joke about the bat be special design for the world seri becaus the yanke began their quest for a second titl in the past three year when they play host to the san diego padr in game 1 at yanke stadium saturday night. major leaguer player who were watch on televis could not imit david letterman and joke about world seri wood. even though martinez ha struggl with numer bat dure the post-season, he could joke becaus the yanke are still aliv for the titl. martinez is still aliv. for now, martinez, the power hitter who ha mostli been miss in action, could joke around. for now. you alway get a fresh start in the post-season becaus it' game to game, said martinez. if you win, you'v got anoth game the next day so you forget about the bad at-bat. it' easier to do that in post-season becaus your next at-bat could be the biggest at-bat of the season. normal, have martinez at the plate for the biggest at-bat of the season would be a pleas sight to the yanke. but not when the calendar flip to octob. martinez ha experienc anoth frustrat post-season. he is 5 for 30 with 10 strikeout, no homer and onli 1 run bat in for a hitting-starv team that ha bat .229 while still win 7 of 9 post-season game becaus of superior pitch. can the yanke continu to win if martinez, their most valuabl run produc, is a sometim singl hitter? we'v just gotten through two good seri, said paul o'neil. the yanke won those seri. you don't focu on one guy. you focu on win. the whole team won. as much as joe torr talk about martinez need one line-dr hit to get him in a groov, the 30-year-old first baseman is in a career drought in the post-season. sinc join the yanke, martinez is 20 for 107 (.187) with one homer and 4 rbi in 29 post-season game. those are puni statist, especi for a player who ha driven in 381 run in 455 regular season game over the last three year. i would guess that tino would have a great seri, o'neil said. basebal ha a way of even thing out. you have a bad seri, you come back and have a great seri. in the season, that' easier to do. in the post-season, it get tougher. it cannot get much tougher for martinez, who wa drop from fifth to sixth in the order dure the american leagu championship seri against the cleveland indian and will remain in that spot until further notic. martinez ha blame hi pauciti of product on impati and on tri to do too much. he ha sometim flail at poor pitch dure hitter' count of 3-1 and 2-0, instead of work the count, and he ha admit that hi previou failur in the post-season have caus him to pursu the obvious unattain five-run homer. actual, martinez ha alreadi made some alter, and he ha reach base 7 time in hi last 10 plate appear on a doubl, a singl, a hit-by-pitch and 4 walk. it is not enough to pacifi georg steinbrenn, but it is someth for him to cling to. until last night, anyway, when martinez had to face kevin brown, a nasti right-hand who had retir him in 30 of 34 career at-bat. if i wa get good pitch and miss them, then i'd say i have a bad swing work, said martinez. but i'v been swing at bad pitch. right now, i'v just got to be patient and wait. the yanke will wait with him. they have to. in the 1996 world seri, torr start cecil fielder over martinez at first in game 3, 4 and 5. it wa a difficult decis becaus martinez had pace the team in rbi while fielder did not join the yanke until juli 31. but the yanke grab all three game so it work. torr doe not have such an attract replac thi season in lui sojo. so the yanke will stay with martinez, for better or wors, while he tri to stay posit and final produc. it' the world seri, said martinez. you got to go out there and have fun with it. big game are all big game. you want to go out there and enjoy that game and tri to do your best to win that game. you don't think that you might lose that day. chuck knoblauch and tino martinez were as popular as squeege men a week ago, the specul rampant that one or the other or both might be exil if the yankees' histor year crumbl in the post-season. two big hit in the midst of a big inning chang all that saturday night in game 1 of the world seri. the yanke trail san diego, 5-2, in the seventh inning, but knoblauch hit a three-run home run to tie the score, and five batter later, martinez smash a grand slam. the seven-run explos rocket the yanke to a 9-6 victori in the open of the four-of-seven-gam seri, befor 56,712 at yanke stadium. orlando hernandez will pitch against andi ashbi in game 2 sunday night at the stadium. beyond seiz the advantag in the seri, the yanke were abl to neutral the padres' ace, kevin brown, drive him from the mound in the seventh. brown, seen by mani as san diego' best hope for a world seri upset, will not pitch again until game 4, at the earliest. brown wa pitch with a three-run lead after the top of the fifth, when toni gwynn and greg vaughn bang back-to-back homer. one out into the seventh, howev, jorg posada hit a singl, and brown walk ricki lede. brown, who had thrown a whop 64 pitch in the first three inning, went out, and the reliev donn wall came in to face knoblauch. thi is what the yanke have done all season, forc a starter from the game in the middl inning, befor exploit a middl reliev. knoblauch, of cours, had earn notorieti for hi gaff in the game 2 of the american leagu championship seri against cleveland, stand and wait for an interfer call as the ball roll to a stop behind him and the decis run score. the yanke came back to win the seri, however; knoblauch got a repriev and talk about how much the experi had help him. face wall with a one-bal, no-strik count, knoblauch had to duck under a runaway fastbal. two ball, no strike. wall had to throw a strike, knoblauch swung hard and lift a high fli down the left-field line. off the bat, it did not look like much. but it kept carri, vaughn drift back in left and look up, to see the ball disappear into the stand. tie game. yanke stadium shook. knoblauch round the base, cross home plate and thrust both arm into the air, yell to the crowd, like a hype olymp weightlift who had just success hoist a half-ton. he stomp around the dugout, hi helmet on, teammat bang on him happili. when derek jeter singl, nobodi realli notic. wall left the game, and mark langston took over. paul o'neil fli out, and after jeter advanc on a wild pitch, berni william wa intent walk. chili davi drew a walk. base load, onc more, with martinez come to the plate, with exactli one run bat in in hi first 76 career at-bat in leagu championship and world seri game. with the count two ball and two strike, langston threw a pitch near the outsid corner that he thought should have been a strike. instead, garcia call it a ball. langston glare, snap at the return throw. langston and martinez and everyon on the field now understood that with the base load and a 3-2 count, langston would have to throw what player refer to as a cooki a tasti pitch over the middl. martinez ate up thi cooki. the ball soar into the upper deck in right field, lift three year of post-season miseri off the back of the yankees' first baseman, a grand slam. the crowd call out martinez from the dugout again. like knoblauch, martinez pump both arm, and later the crowd would chant hi name, and martinez would wave hi cap. san diego' lead wa long gone. the yanke had taken a 2-0 lead over brown in the second inning, forc him to throw 32 pitch in the second. they load the base with a singl and two walk, and lede, the rooki left fielder who is play becaus none of torre' left fielder have been hit, pull a sink fastbal down the right field line with two out. the fan along the foul line stood, some wave to push the ball fair with the bodi english, and the ball land on the line, skip off the wall as two runner score. the yanke had the earli edg, they had jump on brown, and they had their best pitcher on the mound. san diego' chri gomez led off the second inning with a blooper over shortstop, the ball fall in for a singl. quilvio vera fli to right, gwynn ground out and gomez took second, bring vaughn to the plate. david well got ahead in the count, no ball and two strike, with a change-up and a fastbal, befor tri to run a fastbal insid on vaughn, who hit 50 home run dure the regular season. vaughn attack the pitch: a line drive that land in the second deck, foul all the way, but a frighten mistak. jorg posada, the yankees' catcher, jog to the mound to re-think the strategi, perhap to remind well of the convent wisdom: you must pitch vaughn on the outer edg of the plate. posada return to the plate, call for an outsid fastbal, well threw. vaughn' swing wa short and quick, the ball make a click sound off the bat, like a well-struck golf ball, befor carri over the wall in right-cent field. tie game. well retir the first two batter in the fifth inning, befor jam vera with an insid fastbal. veras' bat snap on contact, but it wa enough to send a looper into short center field, a singl. gwynn step in, have hit a singl in hi first two at-bat, and look for a sign from the third base coach tim flanneri. with a runner on first, he like to tri to pull a ball through the right side of the infield. well fire a fastbal, gwynn turn on the pitch and rip it, a line drive that crash off the face of the upper deck in right field. the padr jump from the dugout, celebr, as well turn away, disgust, ask for a new basebal. he got one, deliv anoth fastbal, and vaughn slug thi deep into the left field stand. two pitch, two home run, the first back-to-back home run allow by well sinc april 30. san diego led, 5-2, and yanke stadium wa silent. it would not stay that way. the moment of truth for chuck knoblauch came in the bottom of the first inning when hi name wa announc at yanke stadium for the first time sinc he neglect to chase down that memor loos ball last wednesday. there were no boo. it wa a veri warm ovat. they like him. they realli like him. knoblauch exhal. knoblauch had emphas befor the game that he wa concern about win and rumbl into the world seri, not about the fan. but it sure made knoblauch feel at home when he realiz that the fan had forgiven him. victori, more than time, had heal the malic toward knoblauch and he could play second base without earplug. when the yanke defeat the indian, 9-5, in game 6 on tuesday night to advanc to their second world seri in three year, knoblauch wa easili the most reliev player on the field. the aw mistak that he had made in game 2 would be forgotten. the yanke had won the pennant, and knoblauch wa celebr as much as anyon. to have them act like that toward me wa tremend, said knoblauch, about the respons that he receiv. it wa a great feel, and it realli help me out. knoblauch wa wear a cap that declar the yanke champion of the american leagu in 1998; champagn drip off the brim as he spoke. he did not look up, but continu to talk about how he had learn a lot by be vilifi after make a mistak that littl leaguer are expect not to make. just to face thing and take it like a man and answer all the question, although they'r tough, knoblauch said. you see what you'r made of when you have to bounc back from someth like that. that' basic what i learn. if the yanke had lost the alc, even some of knoblauch' teammat had said that he would be brand as the villain for fail to pursu the ball that glanc off travi fryman' back while he wa run outsid the baselin. knoblauch had argu with the umpir while the go ahead run score from first and the indian won, 4-1. now knoblauch can watch televis and read the newspap again without get queasi. that' huge for him, david cone said. that' huge for me. i let them back into the game, and that would have been a tough one if they would have come back and beat us. and knobbi, i'm sure he' feel a lot better now. knoblauch, who had two hit in five at-bat, wa work on hi second bottl of champagn five minut after report were allow into the clubhous. he flash the sort of smile that he had not shown too much recent and, now that the yanke are in the world seri, knoblauch should expect to be teas often about hi mistak. mayb if we go all the way, we'll do that, derek jeter said. i don't know what i'll say, but i'll think of someth good. yanke pitch the start pitch enabl the yanke to advanc past cleveland in the american leagu championship seri. david well is 7-1 in hi career in the postseason and he should have an addit edg against a padres' lineup that is gener less effect against left-hand pitch. orlando hernandez ha four terrif pitch, pitch seven shutout inning in the pivot game 4 of the alc and earn the start in game 2 of thi seri. david cone should benefit from six days' worth of rest when he start game 3, as well as be abl to pitch in warm southern california. mariano rivera' stuff might be as good as it ha been all year, and mike stanton continu to be a domin postseason pitcher. reason for concern: the errat andi pettitt, who need a home-pl umpir to call strike on pitch low and away, and jeff nelson, who lost hi command in hi last brief outing. offens there were sign in the alc that the offens is come out of it collect slump chuck knoblauch is get on base consist, derek jeter is back to drive the ball to right field and through the middl, berni william had three hit in game 6, and scott brosiu ha been a consist forc at the bottom of the lineup. but the yanke do have holes: chili davi will be hard-press to catch up to the fastbal of kevin brown and andi ashbi, and tino martinez' postseason funk is a problem. the yanke could use a contribut from jorg posada, who will start in game 1 and 2 and may get a chanc to drive pitch low in the strike zone, where he can hit with power. defens the yanke have the best defens in basebal, excel up the middl with jeter and knoblauch, and at third with brosiu. nobody' realli taken advantag of the fact that william ha a poor arm in center field, but rest assur that ken camin, steve finley and greg vaughn will tri. the indian did expos the fact that the yankees' pitcher have troubl prevent baserunn from steal from second to third base. baserun the yanke run well as they take extra base, particularli paul o'neil, brosiu, jeter and knoblauch go first-to-third; william can make mistak. the yanke probabl won't be abl to steal against kevin brown, who ha an effect slide step, but they could be aggress against andi ashbi, or the combin of sterl hitchcock and jim leyritz. padr hit except for jim leyritz, no one in the san diego lineup is particularli hot or particularli frighten at the moment. toni gwynn hasn't been as consist as he usual is, ken camin and greg vaughn have been streaki. but the padr are a veteran team capabl of put the ball in play, get runner on base and then move them along, and so long as they are get except pitch, that' all they realli need. quilvio vera, the leadoff hitter, is adept at draw walk and steve finley, who ha becom more pull consciou in the last two year, could tri to take aim at the right field stand in yanke stadium. vaughn' power could be a factor if the yankees' pitcher don't jam him enough to keep him from lean over the plate. pitch kevin brown is the best pitcher in thi seri, capabl of win three game if necessari, should padr manag bruce bochi choos to start him in game 1, 4 and 7. but at some point, san diego will need a big outing from either andi ashbi or sterl hitchcock. when ashby' right, he' hit the corner with hi sink fastbal and hi slider, and when hi command is suspect, he get pound. hitchcock use hi split-fing fastbal to great effect against right-hand batter in the first two round of the playoff, but the yankees' left-hand hitter may caus him some concern. san diego' middl relief is the weakest aspect of the team, with randi myer and mark langston from the left side (the stuff of each ha waned). but if a lead can be deliv into the hand of closer trevor hoffman, he'll keep it. defens they mostli catch the ball and avoid mistak, though they are unspectacular. shortstop chri gomez and the second baseman vera are adept at turn doubl play, and camin won a gold glove at third base last year; walli joyner ha good hand at first; the center fielder steve finley is extrem quick in track down base hit and return the ball to the infield. toni gwynn' rang is better toward the right field line, not nearli as good on ball hit in the gap. the yanke will be abl to run on the arm of vaughn in left field. baserun vera can steal base (24) thi year, and finley can in a tight spot, as well. in gener, howev, the padr are a slow, plod team, though camin and vaughn are good at go first-to-third, and gwynn won't make mistak on the base. pitch to the padr quilvio veras: a switch-hitt who ha more power right-handed; should tri to pitch him down-and-in with break ball when he' hit right-hand, jam him with fastbal when he' bat left-hand. steve finley: a left-hand hitter who like to pull the ball. left-hand like david well can beat him with break ball low and outsid. toni gwynn: when he' hot, he' imposs. when he' not hit well, he can be anxiou earli in the count, and he should be fed break ball out of the strike zone. greg vaughn: big-tim power on anyth high and over the plate. becaus he like to pull the ball, you must pitch him on the outer edg, occasion jam him to keep him honest. ken caminiti: more power right-hand, a better hitter left-hand. these day, he' a good lowbal hitter and can be beat by fastbal up in the zone. walli joyner: with runner on base, he'll tri to jump on a fastbal earli in the count. is not a strong hitter and can be jam. chri gomez: like derek jeter, like to hit pitch insid out, to right field and through the middl. he can hit with power if you make a mistak with a break ball. ruben rivera: an impati hitter who will chase pitch out of the strike zone. carlo hernandez: look for the first-pitch fastbal in the upper half of the strike zone. can struggl against break ball. jim leyritz: no appar hole right now, can hit fastbal in and away. best bet is to get ahead in the count and tri to get him to chase break ball. pitch to the yanke chuck knoblauch: hard thrower like to jam him with fastbal becaus he stand on top of the plate, which is whi he get hit so often. derek jeter: sometim he ha a tendenc to chase pitch at hi feet, but if you don't get the ball in far enough, he can hammer the ball over the wall in right. paul o'neill: the yankees' best pure hitter, he sometim will chase fastbal up and away, particularli after there is one strike. berni williams: a switch-hitt who ha troubl resist chest-high fastbal. when he lay off them, he is a much better hitter, and he did thi in the last game of the cleveland seri. chili davis: ha a great eye and will work a pitcher deep into a count, but he can be overpow with fastbal abov hi belt. cheat some now to get hi bat start, make him vulner to off-spe pitch. tino martinez: noth seem right at the moment. is anxiou and chase pitch out of the strike zone when he fall behind in the count, and isn't take advantag of mistak when they'r made. scott brosius: a great break ball hitter, but he can also drive a fastbal a long way when he anticip, as cleveland' charl nagi now know. jorg posada: when bat left-hand, he fare veri poorli against splitter, curvebal and slider. ricki ledee: like all young hitter, he ha a tendenc to expand the strike zone and chase pitch out of the strike zone after fall behind in the count. kevin brown like will attack him aggress. saturday' pitcher kevin brown: best sink fastbal in the game (91-93) mph, a four-seam fastbal of 95-97 mph to throw high in the strike zone, a slider that break down and away from right-hand batter, and a forkbal that dive at 88-89 mph. hold runner well. david wells: aggress, aggress, aggress, challeng hitter with fastbal. hi curvebal can be except, and hi changeup ha improv. throw strikes: allow as mani home run (29) as walk (29), but ha not allow a three-run homer or a grand slam all year. talk about high expect. it' not just the man from tampa who ha them anymor. know their basebal as well as they do, everybodi in the joe torr famili pass up ticket for the division seri and the leagu championship seri as just so much parsley on the plate of life. the pressur wa on to get to the world seri, so i can see all those peopl, torr, the yankees' manag, wa say befor new york went out to play the here-we-ar, let's-go-for-it san diego padr in the stadium saturday night. now that the yanke are in the seri, their florida-bas owner and their fan and they themselv can see noth more appropri than four more victori. anyth less than 125 would feel like empti. but whi should the yanke be ani differ from the six team that alreadi fell off the bu to thi world seri? the gloom and doom in the six other citi will not compar to the letdown that would grip new york and the owner' insati littl heart should the yank come up short. the three-tier playoff system ha practic turn basebal into footbal, where the survival-of-the-fittest mental produc one exalt super bowl champion and a leagu full of chump and loser, condemn to a nether world of parcells-lik demon kick them in their sore spot for etern. the world seri use to be a short and sweet reward for excel, but that wa when there were eight team per leagu, and the winner met in daylight in earli octob. even if the yanke club my poor brooklyn dodger into submiss onc again, well, there wa alway next year. but in 1969, basebal began leagu championship seri, and in 1995 it began a two-lay playoff system. the world seri is still differ, which is whi we should all resist the babbl of post-season record flung at us by the hyperact comput and the hyperact broadcast from the dozen of differ network that carri basebal. the world seri is still a competit between one leagu that encourag pitcher to be athlet and anoth leagu rel devoid of strategi. somehow the playoff leav just about everybodi feel inadequ. think about it. the houston astro are go around feel they cannot perform in the post-season. the texa ranger are sulk becaus they had the best hit in the leagu and could hardli touch yanke pitch when it count. in chicago, the glori of win a special playoff for the wild-card spot and sammi sosa' 66 home run ha been pre-empt. the veri citi that beat the cub for the 1969 eastern titl held a parad for sosa saturday in the canyon where lindbergh and john glenn and the 1969 met were onc hail. speak of indign, there are the red sox, whose occasion qualif for the playoff is mere a signal that noth good can come of it. in atlanta, the team of the '90 ha won exactli one world seri, and now it is up to manag to keep repeat that: the main goal is to get to the seri. thi is a record announc. thi is a record announc. thi is a record announc. in cleveland, the fan had to live with the phrase nineteen forty-eight! be chant at the indian in the bronx as the yanke put the indian out of miseri. that leav the padr as the onli team with virtual noth to lose. thi can be good, or it can be bad. bruce bochi, the manag, a reserv on the 1984 san diego world seri team, ha said: a lot of the player on that team said, look back, we wish we would have had a littl differ attitud instead of just say, `hey, we are in the world series.' and thi year, i think you will see the player out there play to win. torr recal be the underdog in 1996, but he said hi yanke felt they could beat the brave. i am sure that is the way the padr feel right now, that mayb other peopl aren't predict a lot for them, but i am sure they are for themselv, torr said. i think get here is where the pressur is, torr ad. you want to win, but get to the world seri is so tough after play 162 game and get into post-season and then have to fight, bite and scratch and everyth els to get here. torr continued: you don't think about in spring train that we want to go and win the world seri. you want to get to the world seri. then you get there, well, you have play well enough and won enough game, then of cours, we want to win. as far as legitim our season i hate to even think in neg term, but if san diego happen to win the world seri, sure it take a littl bit of the luster off what we have accomplish by get here, but i think that wa our goal, initi. the key word in that sentenc is initi. the yanke built an insati demand for more victori and world seri ticket in the torr famili. while they'r at it, the yanke had better win the whole thing. they are a victim of their own excel.

littl to do with financ and more to do with ideolog, includ environment matter, contracept and nation student test. republican said the presid had been disengag from the process, and they were irk at what they said wa hi swoop in at the 11th hour and push hi educ agenda in an appar success portray of himself as the guardian of that popular topic. democrat counter that the republican-l congress had done noth all year, and cast the republican as extremist for block the president' plea for more money to hire teacher and modern school. in fact, republican bargain said saturday night that they would provid the money if local govern, not washington, could decid how the money would be use. armey wa one of mani who castig the presid for appar disengag, an indirect remind that clinton ha been steep in a sex scandal and is face an impeach inquiri in the hous. the scant number of congression republican who did not leav town for the weekend use the hous floor to press thi same messag. what about the presid? ask rep. tom delay of texa, the major whip. mayb in martha' vineyard? aspen? camp david? where is the presid? i bet the american peopl don't know that he spent 152 day out of the 283 day

congression democrat struck back at the republican, say they have held a slack schedul themselv. rep. georg miller, d-calif., said congress had been in session onli 108 day so far thi year, an unusu abbrevi period and one consum for more than a month by the drive to hold impeach hear on the presid. most american, miller said, had work more than 225 day. they say, `where is the president?' miller

pass seven of it appropri bill, he said, larg becaus of divis split among conserv and moder republican. struggl to meet their fourth deadlin over the feder budget, congression republican and white hous offici wrestl tuesday with their differ over educ, the most polit high-stak element of the budget battl. negoti end a late-night session without resolv disagr over not just educ, but the censu and contracept. these were among the biggest issu that still separ the two side as each tri to formul a messag to take home to voter for the nov. 3 elect. on educ, the issu that presid clinton ha propel to the forefront and on which republican do not want to appear recalcitr, both side have agre to spend more than $1 billion but not on how to spend it. the presid insist that the money be spent to hire 100,000 teacher across the countri so that the averag class can be reduc to 18 student. republican, rail against beltway bureaucrat, say that local school district should decid how the money is spent, whether it be for teacher or comput. as the two side broke tuesday night, white hous chief of staff erskin bowl, the president' top negoti, emerg from the session saying: we don't have a deal. we made some good progress. the biggest issu, still, is the 100,000 teacher. he added: there are still some open issu upon which no agreement ha been reach, but he sound optimist about a session schedul for wednesday morn. i think we'v got a chanc of wrap up tomorrow, he said. the two side remain apart on sever ideolog matter, includ whether to allow feder health plan to cover contracept and whether to allow those few plan with religi affili to refus to cover contracept not onli on religi ground but on moral ground as well. they were also split on how to conduct the censu in 2000, which is one of the thorniest issu. it is not one that move voter, but it is vital to both parti becaus it help determin their rel strength in congress. hous speaker newt gingrich and bowl met for much of the day in the speaker' offic, shuttl in and out of ante-room with their lieuten but give few clue about the nitty-gritti detail of their talk. they have given themselv anoth deadlin of midnight wednesday to wrap up about $500 billion worth of spend item, but they could easili extend that deadlin anoth day or two. they miss have spend bill in place for the oct. 1 start of the fiscal year, provid temporari financ for the feder govern through oct. 9, then oct. 12, then wednesday. some of the other central issu, like financ for the intern monetari fund, were all but nail down, but neither side wa readi to declar a final deal until all the other element of the budget packag were in place. we'r down to split infinit, hous major leader dick armey said of approv money for the imf. as they work through sever issu, republican leader appear to be calcul the differ in their own parti that might sour a final deal when it arriv on the hous floor more of a concern than the senat floor becaus the senat ha fewer differ among it republican and with the white hous. some conserv republican said they were concern over the emerg shape of the final packag, particularli element deal with famili plan and emerg spend. they say the president' propos for emerg spend, on such item as the peacekeep mission in bosnia, fix the year 2000 comput bug and provid relief to american farmer, will break the limit in last year' balanced-budget agreement. the administr said such money would come from correspond cut elsewher in the budget, but conserv say it come from raid the surplu. if republican leader cannot count on their conserv, they will need support from democrat to pass the final packag. and democrat on tuesday express concern over some white hous posit, on issu like the censu and an appar compromis with republican on aid for farmer. rep. david mcintosh, r-ind., a leader of hous conserv, said he believ republican leader were cede too quickli to the white hous. he said that the presid appear to be get hi way on some issu but that what he realli seem to be win wa the war of public relat. the presid is get what he wants; he' control the situat, mcintosh lament. when senat major leader trent lott appear on televis, mcintosh said, it' in reaction to the presid. nonetheless, mcintosh suggest that he could vote for a final accord. most conserv are hold out for a better deal than we'r hear, he said, but we'll probabl give them the vote becaus we don't see a much better altern happen if it goe down. other were distress, particularli about two contracept issu. one would requir feder health plan to cover contracept. the other would bar oversea family-plan organ from lobbi to chang abort law in other countri. rep. tom coburn, r-okla., said he want to see the final languag on the health plan measur. as it pass both the hous and the senat, it allow for health plan with religi affili to declin to offer contracept coverage; coburn want plan to be abl to refus such coverag on moral ground as well. the plan cover five specif type of contracept. coburn said he want two of those depo-provera and intrauterin devic to be elimin from coverag becaus he said they interf with fertil and were therefor consid to caus abort. democrat like rep. nita lowey, d-n.y., who introduc the contracept plan in the hous, said she strongli object to coburn' posit. she said that health plan base their decis on what to offer on profit, not moral. the question is whether the white hous will insist on keep the contracept coverag in the final packag and will oppos the moral except. if the administr allow the moral except, it could alien some hous democrat. hous democrat are also worri about the direct the talk are take on the censu. thi ha alway loom as one of the biggest issu separ democrat and republican. the result of a censu help determin the futur power of the two polit parti. but the fact that the two side are final talk about it now indic that they are cover the full rang of budget matter that need to be resolv. the white hous ha propos buy time on the matter by financ the commerc, state and justic depart onli for five month. the commerc depart contain the censu bureau. white hous offici said thi would put off the nettlesom issu while allow a resolut of the entir spend packag, but hous democrat worri it would be a prelud to give in to republican down the road. republican leader like the idea of postpon a decis but say that financ should be restrict onli for the censu bureau. on sever touchi environment issu that have prompt repeat veto threat from the white hous, the two side appear to be opt for compromis over confront, with sever disput resolv. but a few particularli difficult issu remain under negoti. a compromis wa struck between the white hous and alaskan lawmak on log in the tongass nation forest. but compromis still elud them on the question of build a road through a wilder refug to connect two commun in alaska. a stick point for white hous and congression budget negoti ha been the issu of how the 2000 censu will be conduct, and the white hous is find itself negoti on the issu as much with hous democrat as it is with the hous republican leader. on monday, white hous negoti, led by chief of staff erskin bowl, tri to determin whether democrat would accept a deal to financ for six month the depart of state, justic and commerc, which overse the censu bureau. the deal would put off until next march the contenti issu of whether the next censu would use statist sampl to supplement tradit method of count peopl. bowl told the group of democrat that the hous republican were will to give on a number of outstand issu that were stall final agreement on the budget, but that they were dig in their heel when it came to financ the censu for six month. the democrat met in the offic of minor leader dick gephardt. the rational for the half-year financ is that by next march the suprem court is expect to rule on whether use sampl is legal or constitut. the suprem court ha alreadi agre to review two lower court rule that said sampl would violat feder law. oral argument on the case are set for novemb. but hous democrat balk at the idea of six months' financ for the censu, argu that even if the suprem court allow sampl, the republican would be under no oblig to approv money for a censu that includ sampl. the gener feel among mani democrat wa that even if we won the case, there would be a lot less leverag in march, especi if it wa the onli issu left to be debat, said a hous democrat offici who insist on anonym. democrat contend that now is the time to press the republican, while they want to complet work on the budget and go home to campaign. rep. lucil roybal-allard, d-calif., who attend the meet monday, said, it wa, sort of, thi is where we are. we'v been abl to accomplish great thing, what do you think? we made it veri clear that unless the censu wa includ, along with some other issu, like school construct, the deal wouldn't be accept. statist sampl would allow the censu bureau to estim popul that are difficult to count, and would have the largest effect on the count of african-american in citi and black and hispan in rural area, group that are tradit undercount by the standard mean. republican fear, and democrat hope, that the method would rais the count of peopl live in tradit democrat area, give the parti an advantag when new boundari for elect district are drawn follow the 2000 censu. at monday' meet, the democrat remind administr offici that clinton had promis that he would veto ani legisl that restrict the censu bureau' abil to conduct an accur censu. i can't think of ani way that restrict the censu more than not to fulli fund it, said rep. carolyn maloney, d-ni. the willing of hous democrat, includ gephardt, to press the presid on the issu repres a realiz of their leverag with clinton, who will need all of their support in the come impeach inquiri. gephardt is a major player now, and the ironi is we help make him that, said rep. christoph shay, r-conn., who support the use of sampl in the censu. the democrats' posit also indic how littl trust mani have in the white hous on thi issu. the propos to financ the depart of commerc, justic and state for six month is similar to one reach last novemb between bowl and hous speaker newt gingrich. the idea then wa that hold all three depart hostag in the censu fight would place maximum pressur on all side to work out their differ over sampl. but hous democrat were not consult befor that agreement wa struck and later grumbl about it. at a meet of the democrat caucu tuesday, ms. maloney brief lawmak on deal with the white hous and declar that clinton had promis that he would hold firm on the censu and that she believ him, a particip said. the statement wa greet with laughter. there is a certain level of suspicion becaus there have been time when we have been cut out,said the hous democrat offici. but i have to say, there hasn't been much evid of that, thi time. struggl to meet their fourth deadlin over the feder budget, congression republican and white hous offici wrestl tuesday with their differ over educ, the most polit high-stak element of the budget battl. negoti end a late-night session without resolv disagr over not just educ, but the censu and contracept. these were among the

requir most feder health plan to cover prescript contracept for women, give an unusu victori on capitol hill to advoc of abort right. but the futur of the measur wa in doubt becaus it wa attach to a spend bill that includ a controversi provis regard the feder elect commiss. that provis could scuttl the spend bill, which would financ the treasuri depart and the postal servic and which still must be approv by the hous and senat. the contracept measur would requir the feder health plan, which affect 1.2 million femal feder employe who are of child-bear age, to cover the five method of contracept that have been approv by the food and drug administr for use in thi countri birth control pill, diaphragm, inter-uterin devic, norplant and depo-provera. current, onli 19 percent of feder health plan cover those method. the hous and senat approv the contracept measur earlier thi year. but the oppon of abort were furiou about the approv and persuad republican leader to have negoti reopen discuss on the matter. the cost of contracept ha driven up the out-of-pocket cost of health care for women. and mani male member of congress seem persuad to support coverag of contracept for women, sinc almost all of the 285 feder health plan cover viagra, the male impot drug. thursday, with pressur build to resolv the spend bill befor oct. 9, when temporari financ of the govern expir, the negoti agre to includ the contracept measur in their confer report on the $13.4 billion bill for the treasuri depart and postal servic. rep. nita lowey, d-n.y., who push the contracept measur through the hous, hail thursday' agreement as the first major accomplish by abort right advoc sinc the republican took control of congress in 1994. she said the negoti had agre to includ the measur becaus in an elect year they did not want to be perceiv as oppos contracept or be seen as reject a measur that had pass both the hous and senat. but mani democrat said the were upset that the bill contain a provis that is seen as interf with the independ of the feder elect commiss. that provis would requir a four-vot major among the seven feder elect commission everi four year to retain the gener counsel and staff director. the provis is aim at get rid of lawrenc nobl, the current gener counsel, who ha investig the campaign financ practic of group like the christian coalit. the contracept measur is one of four relat matter that have help stall four spend bill. the three other bill that are stall in part becaus of abortion-rel matter includ the agricultur bill, in which there is a disput over whether the feder food and drug administr should use taxpay money to approv drug like ru-486, which induc abort. the foreign oper bill is also stall over whether to financ intern famili plan program that may also promot abort, while the labor and health bill is delay becaus of a provis that would block access of minor to contracept. address the measur on insur coverag for contracept, helen alvarez, a spokeswoman for the nation confer of cathol bishop, said that the bill wa bad polici. she said contracept had fail to stem the number of abort, teen-ag pregnanc or out-of-wedlock birth. public-relations-wis, it' a good tactic for them, she conced, but in term of social polici, thi is a failur. for the first time in decad, congress and the white hous negoti tax and spend legisl thi year with the budget in surplu. the result wa chao. the lawmak were never abl to agre on a budget resolut the framework into which all the tax and spend bill are suppos to fit. thi had not happen sinc congression budget procedur were establish in 1974. then, without the disciplin of such an overal plan, the senat and the hous could not pass eight of the 13 spend bill need to keep the govern run. so the lawmak had to stay in session more than a week longer than they had hope. final, they lump all eight bill togeth thi week and announc an agreement. but the onli way they could get thi far wa to resort to gimmick. one wa to design $20 billion as emerg expenditur so that program did not have to be cut elsewher to offset the new spend. thi will use up more than one-quart of the anticip budget surplu in the current fiscal year. anoth gimmick extend the tax break for individu retir account to coupl with incom from $100,000 to $150,000. thi will actual rais a small amount of revenu in the next five year the period cover by budget account but it will make the pictur consider wors in later year. as hard as it wa to negoti a budget in the bad old day of budget deficit, say the politician involv, it wa exponenti more difficult thi year. at least in year past, there wa a common goal. as much as they disagre on polici and principl, they were all aim at a reduct in the deficit. thi year, some member of congress want to use the surplu for a big tax cut. other want to pay off the nation debt. other want to spend part of it on medic research, school and weapon for the pentagon. other want to spend larg sum on highway. still other want to continu cut govern spend. and that wa just among the republican. the democrat had their own idea about the budget, and presid clinton laid down hi marker about save the surplu until a way wa found to shore up the social secur system. in budget term, said robert reischauer, a former director of the congression budget offic, thi is like the end of the cold war. there are other differ as well in the way thing were negoti with the budget in a surplu. in 1990, 1993 and 1995, when politician stake their career on strike a budget deal to lower the deficit, the fundament question wa how to divid up the bitter medicin of more tax and less spend. republican, for the most part, oppos tax increas and favor cut spend on social program. democrat want to rais tax, especi on the rich, and protect social spend. in the end, balanc were care drawn. but plenti of politician presid georg bush, to name one lost their job in the process. thi year, with democrat and republican alik claim victori, the burn issu wa how to parcel out the candi. democrat got more money for educ and farm assist. republican got more money for the militari and an extens of popular tax break for busi. some of the $20 billion that will eat into the surplu realli will go for emerg, like relief for victim of hurrican georg. but much of the money, like the $90 million that will pay for six new helicopt for the nation polic in colombia to use in drug interdict, wa design emerg spend simpli becaus there wa no other way to get it into the budget. for the politician, the new way is more fun. it is hard to imagin that anyon will be vote out of offic becaus of thi year' budget. but that did not make it easier to reach an agreement. the other big differ is that the princip fight thi year were not over money at all. they involv delic polici issu like needl exchang, contracept, global warm, immigr and the censu. in congress, there is no consensu on these matter. so the onli way polici could be set wa to wrap them into the giant spend bill. it may be more pleasant to debat polici than money. but it is probabl harder to find a way to split the differ. as long as the surplu last, the lack of disciplin that character the budget-writ thi year is like to continu. thi is distress to those devot to control govern spend. the temptat, said l. ari fleischer, spokesman for the hous way and mean committe, is to grab the loot and spend it. some conserv sound note of discord friday over the feder spend agreement, but they also said they would probabl vote for the $500 billion packag becaus it boost defens spend and provid aid to farmer. howev, no one can vote on the packag just yet, becaus it is not finish. the deal that presid clinton and republican leader hail thursday wa a broad outlin of area of agreement on the final portion of the $1.7 trillion budget, not a written document. that is now be craft by the chairmen of the spend committe and their aid, who said friday that there were still disput that need to be resolv and that the final document could run to more than 3,000 page. for exampl, still unresolv is a disput over whether airlin can creat a peanut-fre zone to protect passeng who are allerg to peanut. hous speaker newt gingrich and other member from georgia, a major peanut-produc state, are fight the propos, which would forc airlin to ban peanut within three row of someon with an allergi. congress gave itself until midnight tuesday to vote on the final bill, agre with presid clinton to a fifth extens of temporari financ to keep the govern open. the budget wa due oct. 1, the start of the new fiscal year. the vote wa initi expect friday, but the bill is nowher near to be written. onli a hand of top-level bargain includ gingrich, senat major leader trent lott and white hous chief of staff erskin bowl were in the room for the final deal. exclud were the committe chairmen and the head of the appropri committe, who now must write the languag that will put the deal into law. almost everyon on capitol hill expect the budget to pass eventu, with the biggest defect come from conserv who object to the $20 billion taken from the surplu to address so-cal emerg and for the package' failur to offer voter a seriou tax cut. the lag time befor the bill is offici close is make some conserv nervou that more member will tri to add provis that will further expand a bill they alreadi consid overli bloat. and some worri that onc the hometown pork that is stuf into the bill is publicli reveal, voter could put pressur on member not to support it. the elect are nov. 3. but sever conserv said that despit these problem, they expect to support the bill anyway. rep. mark souder, r-ind., said: `most of my friend, who are predominantli activist conserv, are split about 50-50. if tax cut were your primari thing, then you'r unhappi, but mani conserv have a mix agenda. my posit is, hold the nose and vote ye. we have no tax cut and far too much spend that i oppos, but that' the natur of compromis. everi member ha a littl differ focu. souder said he like the extra money for defens spend, and he like the price support for farmer. hog farmer in hi district, whose biggest custom were japan and china, had been hit hard by the collaps of asian market. sever republican said that the bill seem skew in favor of the democrat. they cite two reasons: clinton need to curri favor with democrat to shore up support if the hous vote to impeach him, and republican leader fear that if they had stood up to clinton, they might have forc a govern shutdown and republican would be blame. clinton wa buy vote, said rep. david hobson, r-ohio. he wa suck up to the liber democrat so they would support him in impeach. rep. wj. (billi) tauzin, r-la., said the leader seem motiv by a desir to avoid the polit damag they incur from the partial govern shutdown of 1995 and 1996. he also cite the president' need to placat the left by ad costli domest program. the combin of the lesson learn three year ago and the scandal on the president' side yield the inevit result, a budget that lean way to the left, tauzin said. still, he said he would probabl support the bill. it won't be enthusiast, he said. it won't be hold my nose either. i would have prefer to spend more of thi money on a tax cut. i think we would have gotten a tax cut, but for the scandal. if the presid had not been caught up with the scandal, he probabl would have follow the dick morri strategi and move toward the center. gingrich said he recogn that some conserv were wari of the agreement. but he sought to reassur them that the packag serv their interest. he cite a $9 billion increas in defens spend. and he note that the republican had block sever item, includ needle-exchang program in the district of columbia, nation educ test and us. contribut to a unit nation program that pay for famili plan in china, which mani in congress object to becaus china ha a polici of coerc abort and forc steril. gingrich said the agreement wa the best that could be achiev when you have a conserv republican congress and a liber democrat presid. some conserv who had been especi critic were more understand thursday. rep. david mcintosh, r-ind., a leader of conserv in the hous, had denounc the bill earlier as a great societi type of big-spend program. friday, after a meet of republican, he said, our leadership found themselv in a bad situat and did a good job. a few remain outright hostil to the bill, as much for the hasti way in which it wa cobbl togeth as for what it contain. rep. joe barton, r-texa, said: `i'm vote `no' unless someth revolutionari happen between now and tuesday. i think it' the process that give the presid the abil to stonewal until the veri end and then hold us for ransom. the republican leadership in the hous and senat did a good job of limit the highway robberi, but it' still gone too far beyond the spend cap. also angri at the rush endgam wa rep. gene taylor, d-miss., who took to the hous floor and said he could not support the final bill. i'm go to urg my colleagu to vote `no,' taylor said. we have stay here thi long. we can stay a littl bit longer. and i am go to encourag my colleagu to continu to vote no until we are given adequ time to studi the measur that is brought befor us. vote mainli on parti line on a question that ha becom a touchston in the debat over develop and preserv of wilder, the senat on thursday approv a gravel road through remot wildlif habitat in alaska. the road, bare 30 mile long, would slice across the edg of a wildlif refug and wilder area on the aleutian peninsula, where it would connect an isol villag call king cove to a long-rang air strip in the town of cold bay. without the road, it backer say, about 700 resid of king cove must continu to use unreli air and boat servic in emerg, often risk danger wind and sea as they seek medic evacu to anchorag. oppon of the road call the project an unjustifi preced that threaten the season breed ground of protect migratori bird, and they say that improv air or sea servic would be a better altern. the vote thursday, 59-38, wa a victori for the state' congression deleg. but with presid clinton like to veto the measur, the final outcom may depend on whether it sponsor can insert the road propos into a huge spend bill that is like to emerg just befor congress head home for the nov. 3 elect. three republican vote against the bill, and six democrat vote for it. the clinton administr ha repeatedli warn that it will veto a big spend bill if it contain an array of anti-environment provis that are under consider. inde, the white hous seem to be itch for a partisan fight over environment prioriti. but while mani republican in congress still appear reluct to engag in that broad fight, they were will thursday to cast their lot with the senate' two power alaskan, ted steven and frank murkowski, both republican. a companion bill in the hous, sponsor by rep. don young of alaska, also a republican, ha not come to the floor. even sen. john chafe of rhode island, a leader of republican environmentalist, vote for the road. last februari chafee' staff had assembl a score of environment lobbyist in hi offic to plan strategi for oppos the road, environment advoc said thursday. they specul that the senat had chang hi posit out of defer to the power of steven, who as chairman of the appropri committe exert tremend influenc at a time when a dozen spend bill are in their final stage. a chafe aid said chafe vote reluctantli for the road after alaska' senat convinc him of it merit. steven said in angri tone thursday that two-third of alaska' land wa off limit to develop and that vital health servic were be deni to hi state' resid. we can't use it without permiss from some bureaucrat who is compel by extrem environmentalist, he said. they are so extrem that they say thi 330,000-acr izembek refug, the smallest wilder in alaska, is so sacrosanct that it can't move it border 60 feet. but sen. dale bumper, d-ark., call the road project a danger preced. build a road through a wilder in alaska, no matter how short or how long, would be the first time in the nation we have vote deliber to author a road through a wilder area, bumper said. and onc you go down that road, nobodi know where it is go to end. struggl to meet their fourth deadlin over the feder budget, congression republican and white hous offici wrestl tuesday with their differ over educ, stage event to demonstr support for what ha becom the most public and polit high-stak element of the budget battl. negoti met into the night to hash out their disagr over aid for school, the censu and contracept. these were among the biggest issu that still separ the two side as each tri to formul a messag to take home to voter for the nov. 3 elect. on educ, the issu that presid clinton ha propel to the forefront of the talk and on which republican do not want to appear recalcitr, both side have agre to spend more than $1 billion but disagre over how to spend it. the presid insist the money be spent on hire 100,000 teacher across the countri so that the averag class can be reduc to 18 student. republican, rail against beltway bureaucrat, say that local school district should decid how the money is spent, whether it be for teacher or comput. the two side remain apart on sever ideolog matter, includ whether to allow feder health plan to cover contracept and whether to allow those few plan with religi affili to refus to cover contracept not onli on religi ground but on moral ground as well. and they also were split on how to conduct the censu in the year 2000. thi is one of the thorniest issu. it is not one that move voter, but it is vital to both parti becaus it help determin their rel strength in congress. hous speaker newt gingrich and erskin bowl, the president' chief of staff and top negoti, met for much of the day in the speaker' offic, shuttl in and out of ante-room with their lieuten but give few clue about the nitti gritti detail of their talk. they have given themselv anoth deadlin of midnight wednesday to wrap up about $500 billion-worth of spend item, but they could easili extend that deadlin anoth day or two. they miss the oct. 1 start of the fiscal year, provid temporari fund for the feder govern through oct. 9, then oct. 12, then wednesday. some of the other central issu, such as financ for the intern monetari fund, were all but nail down, but neither side wa readi to declar a final deal until all the other element of the budget packag are in place. we'r down to split infinit, rep. dick armey of texa, the republican major leader, said of approv fund for the intern fund. as they work through sever issu, republican leader appear to be calcul the differ in their own parti that might sour a final deal when it arriv on the hous floor more of a concern than on the senat floor becaus the senat ha fewer differ among it republican and with the white hous. some conserv sound note of discord friday over the feder spend agreement, but they also said they would probabl vote for

","Whether to use the 1st surplus in decades for a tax cut, to pay off the national debt, or for new initiatives made the 1998 federal budget negotiations chaotic.The Oct 1 start of the fiscal year was extended 5 times.Major issues were census statistical sampling, federal health plan coverage of contraceptives regardless of religious affiliation, and school aid decisions by the federal gov't or local jurisdictions.Other issues included a Federal Election Commission provision, a road through an Alaskan wildlife refuge, and an airline peanut ban.Committees crafted the budget document after broad agreement was reached when 8 bills were lumped together.","In 1998, for the first time in decades, the US budget negotiators faced a surplus.Both sides said this was harder than a deficit situation, but they finally spent $1.7 trillion.The last seven spending bills were the most difficult and finally were merged into one package.Controversial issues included health insurance paying for contraception, control of new education allocations, an Alaskan wilderness road, whether the 2000 census would include statistical sampling, and establishing an emergency fund.Conservatives felt the results favored the liberals, but both sides were satisfied and glad to finish before Election Day and avoid a government shutdown.","Budget negotiations between the White House and House Republicans were delayed on several issues.At issue were provisions that included requiring Federal Health Insurance providers to provide contraceptives to women as Well as a provision to build a road across a wildlife preserve in Alaska.The contraceptive issue faced an uncertain future while Clinton likely will veto the road.There is disagreement also on how to spend the funding on education.This year's budget discussions also have been hampered because it is the first time since budget procedures were established in 1974 that there has been a surplus, preventing agreement on a budget resolution.","After several deadline extensions, Congressional leaders and the White House agreed on an omnibus spending package, the final portion of the $1.7 trillion budget.It includes more money for education and defense, business tax breaks, and farm aid, as well as funds for Colombia to use in drug interdiction.To offset the new spending, the surplus will be tapped for $20 billion, to the ire of conservatives.This year, without the common goal of reducing the deficit, reaching agreement was very difficult.Policy provisions involving the 2000 census, contraception, and the Alaskan wilderness were also tied to the spending package and were hotly debated."

","Russian President Yeltsin's health was a hot topic in October.First he burned his hand.Next, in Central Asia, he cancelled public appearances and appeared disoriented.The trip was shortened due to a ""respiratory infection"".He was ordered to rest and take antibiotics.He then cancelled his trip to the Asian Summit.Although stoutly defended by his family, many Russians, including former supporters, suspect he is sicker, question his ability to do his job, and want him to resign.He has a history of health problems including heart bypass surgery.The court was to judge on whether he could serve a third term, but he already has said he will not run.","Concern over the health of President Boris Yeltsin has led many Russians to question his ability to govern.He has had multiple bypass surgery and is susceptible to respiratory ailments.Periods of illness have caused him to cancel foreign trips and on some travels, he was unable to attend all official functions.He is politically weakened, leaving others to grapple with Russia's economic crisis.Russia's constitutional court was to hold hearings on whether Yeltsin could seek a third term under their two term limitations since part of his first term was under the Soviet constitution.That appears to be moot point since he has said he will not run again.","President Boris Yeltsin's health has become a matter of great concern to the Russian leadership.The concern began in 1996 when he had a heart attack followed by bypass surgery.Illness has often sidelined him during his seven years in power.He recently cut short a trip to Central Asia because of a respiratory infection and he later canceled two out-of-country summits.This revived questions about his ability to lead Russia through any crisis.Yeltsin refuses to admit he is seriously ill and his condition is kept secret, even the cause for burns on his hands.Russia's leaders are calling for his resignation and question his legal right to seek reelection.","President Boris Yeltsin had a heart attack in 1996, followed by multiple bypass surgery.Doctors say his health is more or less normal but secrecy increases conjecture.The cause of minor burns on his hand were not disclosed.On a trip to Uzbekistan he walked stiffly, stumbled, rambled and seemed confused.Ceremonies were canceled and the trip ended a day early because of his bronchitis and a 99.3F fever.He was treated with antibiotics and ordered to bed but went to the office anyway.Calls that he turn over power were revived.He says he will not run again.He canceled an upcoming trip to Austria and sent PM Primakov in his place to an Asian summit."
1033,"microsoft corp. ha said that materi in an unpublish book by two busi school professor will be a crucial part of it defens in the antitrust trial schedul to begin next week. but judg from an advanc copi of the manuscript, the justic depart and 20 state that are su the softwar giant will find support for their argument in the book as well. to cite one exampl, microsoft contend that it industry-standard window oper system and it internet explor browser are a singl integr product. in it suit, the govern assert that they are two separ product that microsoft bundl togeth to get an unfair edg over it rival, netscap commun corp., in the market for softwar use to brows the internet' world wide web. in compet on internet time: lesson from netscap and it battl with microsoft, the author, michael a. cusumano of the massachusett institut of technology' sloan school of manag and david b. yoffi of the harvard busi school, quot a microsoft execut as say that onli with the third version of microsoft' browser wa it integr with window. microsoft hurri it first browser offer into the market, the book say, in it race to catch up with netscap, then took a more ambiti approach with internet explor 3.0, which wa introduc in august 1996. in that version it chang it softwar design to use program modul, or compon, that could be put togeth and rearragn like build block. in the book, ben slivka, a microsoft gener manag, is quot as say, ie 3.0 wa the key thing becaus we did the component browser, he ad, we realli made internet explor part of the window platform. the time could be legal signific becaus in it suit the govern cite as evid request befor august 1996 by person comput maker that want to load netscape' browser on their machin instead of microsoft' browser. microsoft deni the request, insist it brower and window were a singl, integr product. microsoft' legal team obtain an earli manuscript of the new book last month, by issu a subpoena to a netscap execut who wa given a confidenti copi by the author to review. microsoft ha also sought the transcript of 44 current and former netscap employe interview by the author. a feder judg in boston last week deni microsoft access to that research materi, but the compani may appeal the rule. the new book, publish by the free press imprint of simon &amp; schuster, is be hurri into print so it can be ship within day of the start of the microsoft trial on oct. 19. but alreadi, a few quot from netscap execut have leak out. the author decid to send the complet manuscript to the new york time and three other news organ monday, so that the materi could be read in context. microsoft intend to use materi from the book as evid that netscape' troubl result larg from it own misstep rather than from ani alleg predatori practic by microsoft. the book doe detail where netscap stumbl, shift it strategi too often and run into obstacl in it softwar develop effort. in privat antitrust suit, the argument that the competitor wa hi own worst enemi is an establish defens. but legal expert say that defens may well be far less effect in a feder case in which the govern is seek court-mand chang in microsoft' busi practic rather than the monetari damag that are the goal of plaintiff in privat case. it seem to me that thi debat over netscape' mistak is a total sideshow, said robert litan, a former senior offici in the justic department' antitrust divis, who is now at the brook institut. but microsoft ha a big legal team, and it seem they are work on everi defens they can find. the book quot a former netscap execut, ram shriram, as say the compani bungl a chanc to win a sizabl share of the browser busi from america onlin inc. but that wa a second-ch to do a deal with america onlin, the lead onlin servic. the government' case focus on an earlier deal in march 1996, when america onlin chose internet explor as it prefer browser; in that bargain microsoft agre to place a startup icon for the onlin servic on the main window desktop screen the prime real estat in comput. for a book entitl compet on internet time, it is intrigu that one of it central theme is that netcap got too wed to the notion that the internet revolut would chang everyth quickli. microsoft, by contrast, stuck to it three-year plan horizon that enabl the compani, the author write, to mesh it short-run tactic plan with a broader strateg view of how to win the war. the book quot steve ballmer, microsoft' presid, as say, the fact of the matter is that custom can't take cataclysm chang everi three month. the organ also can't. you can ship product quickli. but you can't say, `oh, we have a radic new strategy' everi three month. the government' antitrust scrutini of microsoft, the world' largest independ softwar compani, ha span republican and democrat administr and involv hundr of govern lawyer and investig. but it ha by no mean been an exampl of consist, coordin public polici. nor, by all account, of polit. instead, like the softwar industri itself, the government' pursuit of microsoft ha taken leap, hit dead end and evolv in way no one could have control or predict back when it start in 1989. it wa in novemb of that year, on a hot afternoon at a computer-industri convent in la vega, nev., that bill gate, microsoft' chairman, look like he'd been drag to the news confer with a senior execut from ibm which at the time domin microsoft and the entir comput industri. the two compani ibm, then the lead maker of person comput and microsoft, the leader in pc oper system softwar were collabor on the design and market of a new oper system call os/2. but microsoft wa also begin to sell a compet product, window. the industri trade press wa full of worri articles: which system wa go to becom the new standard? with gate stand uncomfort at hi side, jame cannavino, an ibm division presid, said that the two compani want to clear the air. os/2 wa the futur, he said. as for window, he ad, it would remain a nich product for under-equip comput. window, he assert, would never receiv all the advanc featur of os/2. gate certainli did not look happi. but he did not disagre. the news confer got littl attent, just a few articl deep insid newspap and trade public. but a few week later, norri washington, a senior antitrust lawyer with the feder trade commiss, happen to read one of those articl, in byte magazin. ibm and microsoft have now defin their unifi vision of graphic oper environ, the articl said, and it look sort of like a us. econom model, divid into lower-, middle- and upper-class product. as washington saw it, ibm and microsoft were collud to divid the operating-system market a potenti violat of antitrust law. soon the ftc staff open an investig of microsoft and ibm and sinc that small first step, microsoft ha been under unrel scrutini from feder antitrust investig for a constantli evolv seri of alleg and charg, month after month, year after year, for the last nine year. now come the antitrust trial schedul to begin on monday, with a multipl of charg woven of thread drawn from more than a dozen differ investig inquiri dure that nine-year span. microsoft, today the most fear compani in the softwar busi and carri a stock-market valu of nearli $234 billion, present a huge and highli visibl antitrust target. yet, while the company' alli ask, what is the clinton administration' polit agenda in go after microsoft? the answer seem to be there is none. in interview, more than a dozen current and former senior antitrust offici whether friend of the govern or of microsoft all say the justic department' antitrust suit is a natur outgrowth of the previou investig. as for polit, all the offici agre that the antitrust divis oper independ of the administration' polit consider. charl rule wa the assist attorney gener who head the antitrust divis dure the bush administr, and he is now a washington lawyer who serv as an advis and advoc for microsoft. when i wa there, rule said of hi justic day, the white hous wa punctili in term of never get involv in whatev we decid to do. there wa no commun between antitrust and other branch of govern. ask if he believ that polici had chang under the clinton administr, he said: not realli. i'v seen noth to suggest it. joel klein head the antitrust divis now, and in an interview deal with hi division' role in the clinton administration' technolog polici, not specif relat to the microsoft case, he said: there is no statutori restrict, but as a practic matter, civil and crimin prosecut are invari carri out without ani polit contact. klein said, by way of exampl, that he might discuss merger case involv militari or aviat industri with the defens depart or transport depart. but never the white hous, he said. for a signific case, we might call the white hous and say `an hour from now we are go to hold a press conference.' the last time there wa ani interfer, he ad, wa the dita beard-itt case. mr. beard, a lobbyist for itt corp., wa accus in 1972 of have written a memo say that a $400,000 donat to the republican nation convent had gone a long way toward settl antitrust suit brought against the compani by the nixon administration' justic depart. the authent of the memo wa never prove, and mr. beard alway deni write it. in ani case, klein say, sinc waterg, it' been immacul. in the case of microsoft, neither presid clinton nor vice presid al gore ha ever volunt a comment. in answer to a question dure a news confer in may, just befor the suit wa file, clinton said: i have taken the view that i should not comment on matter within the justic depart. at thi time, i do not think i should depart from that polici on thi case, even though it obvious will have a big impact on an import sector of our economi. but i have to say, base on what i know to date, i have confid in the way the antitrust divis in the justic depart ha handl the matter. sinc then, clinton ha said noth els about the case, publicli at least. and gore, who gener repres the administr on technolog issu, ha never comment at all. in rule' opinion, the administr would be foolish to involv itself, even if it were polit accept to do so. it would be a littl odd for the administr to push the justic depart in thi suit, he said. it would be a polici mistak and a polit mistak. i would be hard press to explain whi they would do that. take side in the highli charg technolog world is danger, particularli sinc the democrat reli on silicon valley compani for polit donat and support. in fact, the present and former govern offici all said the suit wa simpli a natur extens of the inquiri conduct dure the last nine year. they began at the ftc. soon after washington read that articl in byte, the ftc staff open an investig of the windows-os/2 question. but as ha happen so often in the follow year, turn in the market made the initi inquiri irrelev. microsoft abandon it agreement with ibm, and window quickli grew to be the industri standard, while os/2 remain a cipher. but as that issu fade, onc govern investig began look at microsoft they found other thing that troubl them. in 1991 washington, who still work for the ftc, inform microsoft that the investig wa be expand. the agenc, hi letter said, wa now tri to determin whether microsoft wa use it domin posit in operating-system softwar to stifl competit in other area. that gener idea lie at the heart of the present suit. one former senior ftc offici said the commiss staff had confid in the case but realiz that the reagan-era commission, who had to approv ani suit, might have a differ view. we knew the commiss might have difficulti with a monopol case, the former offici said. they hadn't brought a case in year. and in fact, in 1993 the commiss vote 2-2 on the question of whether to file formal charg. the deadlock serv as a dismiss. then, a few month later, the justic depart decid to pick up the case. it wa farther along than most case we got, recal robert litan, a former senior offici in the justic department' antitrust divis who is now at the brook institut. usual a case would be two or three peopl complain and a few document, he said. but thi wa a fulli research record. they gave us the file and brief us on what they had done. the justic depart lawyer pick up the same thread. the gener idea behind our inquiri, litan said, wa that they should not be allow to use their monopoli in oper system to cement a monopoli in other area. in 1995, microsoft and the govern reach a consent agreement in which the compani promis to stop forc pc maker to buy one copi of a microsoft oper system for everi comput sold instead of one for everi comput on which the oper system, ms-do or window, wa instal. the compani also agre to stop tie the sale of one softwar product to the sale of anoth. the charg in the present suit are similar in mani way. even with the agreement, the govern investig continu. that same year, justic depart investig show up at the offic of netscap commun corp. for the first time to ask question about their next line of inquiri. america onlin had been complain, a senior netscap execut recal, becaus microsoft wa bundl the microsoft network, a compet onlin servic, with window. onc more, market forc overtook the investig. the microsoft network never grew particularli popular while america onlin prosper and grew. but, not surprisingli, new complaint fill the void. in may 1995, ann bingaman, the assist attorney gener who head the antitrust divis, remarked: we get complaint about microsoft all the time. we have becom a kind of microsoft complaint center. and we take them veri serious. in 1996, netscape' first complaint arriv. in a letter to the justic depart, netscap said that microsoft wa use it domin in personal-comput oper system to forc or persuad comput maker to favor microsoft' browser, use to explor the world wide web, over the one market by netscap. the next year the justic depart formal charg microsoft with violat the consent agreement by tie sale of window to instal of the company' web browser on new comput. it seem like a slam-dunk violat of the consent decre, a natur extens of that case, recal litan, who had left the depart by then. a feder district court judg agre, but an appeal court panel overturn that rule thi summer. in the meantim, last may the justic depart and 20 state attorney gener file their new suit against microsoft, which is schedul for trial on monday. it contend that microsoft ha engag in bundl, tie and other predatori behavior similar in mani way to the numer previou alleg and investig of the last nine year. a good part of thi case is just round ii of the case we dealt with in round i, in the earli in the 1990, litan said. or, as the former senior ftc offici put it, there' certainli a common thread that run all the way through here. but through the year that thread ha been twist, pull and spun by hundr of differ hand. the case of unit state vs. microsoft corp., the government' most aggress move against a monopolist in almost 25 year, is play out against a centuri of antitrust law so broadli word and court rule so ambigu that both side are cite the same rule to support their oppos argument. whatev the outcom of the trial, schedul to begin monday in us. district court in washington, an almost certain appeal will leav to the suprem court the task of bring legal order to 100 year of clash antitrust doctrin. the case focus on microsoft' window, the oper system that control about 90 percent of all person comput sold today. the govern say it object is to curb illeg monopolist busi practic that threaten to render larg part of the economi vulner to the vicissitud of a singl compani. microsoft assert that the case is intend to give the govern control over which featur can be ad to window. howev grand the econom stake, the legal disput is narrow. the govern say that microsoft' contract with comput manufactur and with compani that provid access to the internet illeg stifl competit. the contract prohibit manufactur from substitut netscap commun corp.' navig browser for microsoft' internet explor. they also prohibit them from remov from the window main screen, or desktop, link to site on the world wide web run by microsoft or it partner. microsoft' contract with compani that connect peopl to the internet and with busi that sell good and servic on the web requir favor treatment for internet explor over navig in exchang for link on the window desktop. in the wake of the lawsuit, microsoft ha voluntarili drop some of these requir, though it could reinstat them at will. microsoft say that it contract are legal becaus they produc tangibl benefit for custom, includ easier internet access. the justic depart say that the bundl of explor with window 95 and the inclus of the browser as part of window 98 amount to tie, an illeg practic that forc custom of one product to purchas anoth. the contract with manufactur and internet servic are illeg, the govern say, becaus they are intend not onli to creat a monopoli in the browser market but to protect microsoft' exist monopoli in oper system. the latter threat is key, accord to the justic depart. browser have the potenti, like an oper system, to act as a softwar platform on which other program run. so contract intend to drive browser out of the market would also insul the window monopoli. mani antitrust expert say the problem face the justic depart is that the court have provid no clear definit of tie and no clear guidelin for determin when contract are illeg exclusionari. professor lawrenc white of new york univers, who wa chief economist of the justic department' antitrust divis in the earli 1980, say that the court treat tie as an unusu practic when in fact it is ubiquit. no one, he said, would challeng the right of manufactur to tie eras to the tip of pencil, tire to an automobil or button to shirt. hi point, share wide among economist, is that some tie benefit consum if, for exampl, it result in product that are easier to use or enabl a compani to recov develop cost. but tie can be bad if it lock in monopoli power. the court, white say, have not offer enough guidanc for distinguish good tie from bad, which is the nub of the legal disput. microsoft say it need onli to show that bundl window and explor pass what might be call a gross consum benefit test that it offer an immedi benefit, whether or not it caus long-term damag to competit and, therefor, ultim to consum. the justic depart say that microsoft' practic must clear a higher hurdle: yield net consum benefit that are immedi and larg enough to balanc possibl long-term harm to competit. so which test of consum benefit satisfi antitrust law? the simpl answer is that no one know for sure, which is whi both side can reason cite the same case without fear of embarrass. consid a 1985 case, aspen ski co. vs. aspen highland ski corp., and a 1951 case, lorain journal co. vs. unit state. in the first, aspen ski, the owner of three major ski run in aspen, colo. the monopolist had for year sold a ticket in cooper with aspen highland, a competitor, that gave skier access to both companies' run. when aspen ski unilater cancel the agreement, it rival' revenu shrivel and the rival su. the suprem court rule that aspen ski had violat antitrust law becaus there wa no evid it action help consum. in the lorain journal case, the onli local newspap in lorain, ohio, refus to sell advertis to compani that advertis on a new radio station. here, too, the suprem court rule that the exclusionari practic did noth to benefit consum. inde, in aspen ski, the court even forc the monopolist to do busi with it rival, a preced that augur well for the justic depart, which seek to forc microsoft to instal netscape' browser alongsid it own. but charl rule, a legal consult to microsoft, say that in both case the court threw out exclusionari practic onli becaus they offer no consum benefit. the court, he argu, never pounc on practic that result in lower price or better product or servic. nor did the court in either case call for balanc immedi benefit against hypothet long-term harm. rule argu that microsoft' practic produc demonstr consum benefit. besid, he say, unlik the action taken by the lorain journal or aspen ski, microsoft' contract do not prevent consum from instal netscape' browser or from use the web site of microsoft' rival. in truth, though, neither case answer what consum benefit test should appli to product design. in jefferson parish hospit district no. 2 et al. vs. hyde, anoth case cite by both side, the suprem court in 1984 recogn that surgeon and anesthesiologist provid an integr servic. yet, the court said, a hospit with monopoli power would still not be allow to forc surgic patient to use it panel of anesthesiologist if consum want to purchas the two servic separ. that principl could undercut microsoft' defens that the function interdepend of window and explor requir bundl. but microsoft will point to a strong concur opinion that call for a tougher standard for the govern to meet when it alleg tie. microsoft will also draw support from sever court rule that allow ibm to chang the design of it comput in way that made it hard for vendor to attach peripher equip. but perhap microsoft' best argument is that nowher ha the govern identifi a singl case in which the court explicitli call for throw out a tie product on the basi of a balanc test. the court, microsoft will emphas, steer clear of redesign technic sophist product. the justic department' rejoind is to note that the sole purpos of antitrust law is to protect consum, so it make no sens to bless practic that provid a dollar' worth of benefit today but, by stamp out competit, drive price up by $1,000 tomorrow. the justic depart will ask the court to at least insist that monopolist use the least exclusionari mean possibl to achiev whatev servic they provid custom. expert agre that the court will subject microsoft' restrict contract with internet compani to a balanc test. but exactli how the court will decid whether consum are help or hurt is up for grab. a balanc test would have the court weigh the immedi benefit to consum of one-click access to internet site and of featur of a bundl windows-explor packag versu the harm over time of diminish competit in the market for browser and oper system. but a test that make good sens in theori can prove fiendishli difficult to use in practic. balanc test are imposs difficult and arbitrari, said rep. thoma campbel, r-calif., who is a former law professor at stanford univers. the practic effect of balanc is to hand defend like microsoft almost certain victori. microsoft argu and mani antitrust expert agre that the court have in fact gravit away from a balanc test toward a simpler predat test for exclusionari contract. under thi standard, a contract is illeg onli if it is intend to drive out competit and thu to pave the way for a monopolist to rais price later. microsoft will have an easier time defend itself against a charg of predat, which amount to victim it custom, than it would defend itself against a charg that it bundl product doe consum slightli more harm than good. the antitrust record, say william baxter, who head the antitrust divis under presid reagan, is litter with contradictori, ambigu and sometim nonsens verdict. he and other legal expert agre that if noth els, that record leav plenti of legal leeway for the suprem court, should it hear the microsoft case, to stiffen the spine of the antitrust law. the legal tool that the govern is use in it assault on microsoft corp. the sherman antitrust act of 1890 is brief, vagu and malleabl. the combin ha meant that thi bedrock statut of antitrust polici ha been at turn toothless and power over the year, depend on the polit and econom of the day as interpret by the court. sponsor by sen. john sherman, an ohio republican who wa the younger brother of the civil war gener william tecumseh sherman, the act wa pass as a nod to a popular backlash against the rise of the industri trust in oil, steel and railroad. farmer, labor and small-busi owner sizabl vote group resent the trust as vehicl of concentr power. but the trust, larg nation hold corpor, were view by mani other as engin of modern and industri. economist at the time oppos the sherman act, and the law that congress pass wa a vagu word compromis. no one knew what impact it would have, but one senat, quot in matthew josephson' the robber baron, explain that nearli everyon agre that someth must be flung out to appeas the restiv mass. the act' two key provis, section 1 and 2, mention conspiraci, restraint of trade and attempt to monopol. yet while the sherman act is now interpret as the magna carta of competit, it never use the term. after it wa pass, critic of the trust derid the impenetr languag of the sherman act and call it the swiss chees act. but by the earli 1900, the polit climat had chang. the grow antagon for the trust, especi as incom gap widen, wa tap by an avow trustbust, theodor roosevelt, who becam presid in 1901. the sherman act ha alway been an elast piec of social legisl, use to attack perceiv exploit and the aggreg of power, said eleanor fox, a professor at the new york univers law school. the model trust and the princip target of the trustbust wa standard oil. shrewdli, roosevelt made a distinct between good trust, which thrive becaus of their superior effici, and bad trust, which grew not as the result of inevit econom forc but becaus of unfair busi practic. throughout the 1880 and '90, standard oil' rival had complain about the compani and the busi practic of it founder, john d. rockefel. but dure those year, the price of kerosen burn to light the nation' home declin steadili. so standard oil, it could could reason be argu, wa an enterpris monopoli. in the earli 1900, though, standard oil rais price in the unit state to prop up it profit at a time it wa engag in a price war against royal dutch/shel in europ, where standard oil did face genuin competit. when consum were hurt by the standard oil monopoli, popular support for antitrust action against the compani swell, encourag by roosevelt and hi successor, william howard taft. the feder suit against standard oil wa file in 1906, and the suprem court approv the breakup of the compani in 1911. standard oil and the microsoft case, historian observ, have some common theme. both were domin compani of their day, and bill gate, the microsoft chairman, ha been call a modern rockefel. but there is no presidenti involv and there is no real consum dissatisfact in the microsoft case, said ron chernow, author of titan, a best-sel biographi of rockefel. and rockefel, chernow ad, never went through the kind of honeymoon period of widespread public adul and favor press coverag as bill gate ha had. in the summer of 1995, a whiff of revolut wa in the air in silicon valley. the internet offer a new deal in comput, a fresh opportun for entrepreneur to tri to break microsoft corp.' firm grip on the person comput softwar busi. lead the challeng wa netscap commun corp., whose softwar for brows the world wide web had ignit the internet boom. netscap chairman jame clark spoke boldli of attack microsoft head-on. he borrow imageri from the movi star war, refer to microsoft as the death star and netscap as the leader of a rebel allianc. microsoft answer with a vengeanc. it dispatch hundr of programm to work on a compet browser and pour mani million of dollar into market it. it prod comput maker and other to distribut it browser, fold the browser into it industry-domin window oper system and gave the browser away free a campaign intend to cut off their air suppli, as a senior microsoft execut describ it. but not onli competitor like netscap have encount microsoft' forc. microsoft' partner, it corpor custom and profession investor who financ new ventur have all collid with it. a close look at microsoft' no-holds-bar push into the internet softwar busi offer a window into the way the compani use it market muscl to influenc the behavior of virtual everi player in the industri. some of the case recount here figur promin in the suit brought by the justic depart and 20 state, schedul to go to trial thi month, charg that microsoft at time went too far and violat antitrust law. regardless of the legal outcom, previous unreport detail about incid in the suit and the other exampl provid a more complet pictur of microsoft in action. when compaq comput corp. consid load netscape' browser instead of microsoft' on it person comput, microsoft threaten to stop sell it window oper system to compaq. the compani quickli chang it mind. after spyglass inc. began suppli microsoft with it earli browser technolog, microsoft announc that it would give away it browser free. the time came as a rude surpris to it partner spyglass. the compani lost most of it revenu almost overnight, as the technolog, which it had also been licens to compani besid microsoft, suddenli becam avail free. when america onlin inc., which compet fierc with microsoft' onlin servic and electron commerc divis, went shop for browser technolog, microsoft made an offer that wa too good to pass up: if america onlin use microsoft' browser as the main one for it million of subscrib, microsoft would give america onlin prime placement on the desktop screen of all person comput use window. when intel corp. began develop it own internet softwar, microsoft complain. intel, the lead maker of the microprocessor that serv as the electron brain on most person comput run window, pull back. the chip maker decid that it lucr hand-in-glov partnership with microsoft took prioriti. microsoft' reach in comput ha becom so pervas that nearli everi year now, silicon valley' top ventur capitalist meet privat with a team of top microsoft execut to learn about the company' plan. the goal, one ventur investor observ, wa to stay out of the way of the steamrol. microsoft adamantli deni that it ha broken ani law in these or similar situat. the compani play the game of busi hard, and it execut acknowledg that without apolog. ye, microsoft say, rival may suffer and partner may be irrit occasion. but the compani insist it action are guid by it main corpor goal of bring new technolog inexpens and conveni to the million of peopl who use it softwar. most peopl in the comput industri say that live in microsoft' world mean routin make accommod to it. microsoft' power eman from it near-monopoli on the market for person comput oper system, the master control program that run comput. becaus it own the oper system, microsoft is the essenti util of the inform age, said jame moor, presid of geopartn research inc., a technolog consult firm. it act as a kind of gatekeep to the pipelin of comput innov, sit there and decid whether to help some innov or slow it down. for month, microsoft and netscap had talk on and off, circl each other warili. but the event that would defin them as unflinch rival wa a meet on june 21, 1995, in a second-floor confer room at netscape' headquart in mountain view, calif. that meet, accord to the justic depart and 20 state su microsoft, wa the high-tech equival of the stori gather in smoke-fil railroad car that inspir passag of the nation' antitrust law a centuri ago. on that day, they say, microsoft made netscap an illeg offer to divvi up the market for internet brows softwar, a collus pact that netscap reject. microsoft repli that the prosecutor are misinterpret a routin meet in the softwar busi and that the compani ha never tri to divid the browser market. bill gate, microsoft' chairman and princip strategist, did not attend the mountain view gather, but he consult by telephon with the microsoft team. two peopl who did attend that june meet have been name as wit in the trial schedul to begin next week: netscap presid jame barksdal and daniel rosen, microsoft' gener manag of new technolog. in the trial, the govern will contend that microsoft present netscap with an all-or-noth offer, accord to peopl who have been question in the feder investig. reli heavili on note taken in the meet by netscap execut vice presid marc andreessen and on the testimoni of barksdal, prosecutor are expect to assert that the microsoft propos had sever element, both incent and requir. microsoft, accord to the peopl question by the govern, would invest in netscap, take a 15 to 20 percent stake, give netscap technic inform and fine-tun microsoft' oper system so that netscape' softwar would run better on window. in return, the peopl say, netscap would give microsoft a seat on it board, licens it technolog to microsoft, give microsoft advanc knowledg of it product-develop effort and not make a browser for the next gener of the microsoft oper system, window 95, which wa ship two month after the june 1995 meet. and microsoft, the peopl ad, did what it ha alway deni it doe use access to it technolog as a power lever in busi negoti, by offer netscap preferenti access to the window applic program interfac, or api, the link that enabl other companies' program to run smoothli on the window oper system. by turn down the deal, netscap, they say, would not have that prefer access to microsoft technolog a threat that microsoft fierc deni make. barksdal, netscape' 55-year-old chief execut, told a colleagu that the encount with microsoft in june 1995 wa the damnedest meet i'v ever attend in 35 year in busi. had netscap accept microsoft' offer, it would have had microsoft' money and it endors. netscap would have also been free to sell it browser for use in earlier version of window and for use on other oper system like apple' macintosh and unix, a power system use mainli in corpor and research lab. but if we had licens our technolog to microsoft and step asid, the best we could have hope for wa becom a compani with sale of $100 million or so and hope to be bought out by microsoft, said clark, a former comput scientist at stanford univers who found silicon graphic inc., a comput graphic pioneer, befor start netscap. we didn't start netscap for that. for ani compani, a meet with microsoft is often a charg affair. everi comput devic from keyboard to disk drive, and everi softwar program from game to browser, must mesh smoothli with microsoft' window oper system. thi is necessari to make comput reliabl and easier to use, but it also give microsoft it role as the industry' gatekeep. and sinc microsoft itself make all manner of softwar product beyond the oper system, other compani are put in the uneasi posit of requir microsoft' cooper to be abl to compet against it. and in the softwar industri, where everi program is render in the digit code of 1' and 0', the line that divid competit and cooper are often blur. the talk about that line at the microsoft-netscap meet focus on the divis between the oper system the platform, in comput term and the applic program, sometim call solut, that run on top of the oper system. the govern suit state that in sworn testimoni, chri jone, a microsoft manag who attend the meet, admit that microsoft `absolutely' intend to persuad netscap not to compet. microsoft read jones' testimoni veri differ, as evid mainli of the company' clarifi it posit. if netscap stay on the applic or solut side of the oper system, the two compani could be partner, microsoft said. but if netscap tri to becom a player in the platform space, they would compet. microsoft releas portion of the jone deposit in septemb as evid that the govern had quot the microsoft manag out of context. q. do you recal ani discuss about a desir of anybodi on the part of microsoft who wa particip to be abl to persuad or influenc netscap not to compet? a. absolut. but again, persuad in the sens of forc or persuad in the sens of, hey, we think we can have a great busi relationship togeth. later in the deposit, a justic depart lawyer ask jone whether ani of the microsoft execut intend to suggest that there would be ani consequ to netscap or it busi if netscap chose to go in the platform direct you'v describ earlier as oppos to the solut direct. jone replied: the convers wa someth like the following: `we'r in the platform busi. we'r go to invest heavili in thi part of the platform becaus we feel it' critic to our technolog. that' a done deal.' and we'r ask them: `what is your busi? is your busi platform or solut? if it' platform, we'r in the platform busi. we'r competing.' microsoft portray such comment as innocu statement of fact. but to netscap, the same remark could be taken as a warn, if not a threat. thi is becaus internet brows softwar had the potenti to becom an altern platform to the window oper system. the browser, sit on top of the oper system, could supplant window as the main desktop screen on users' machin and the main layer of program for start other softwar applic. in addit, netscape' browser could serv as a power platform for distribut and run java, an internet program languag develop by sun microsystem inc., a microsoft rival. in technic term, netscape' upstart platform could replac microsoft' api as the essenti util of comput. inde, andreessen had boast in public of netscape' ambit to releg microsoft' window to so much softwar plumb underneath the browser. by the june meet, microsoft certainli view netscap as a seriou potenti challeng to window, the corpor crown jewel. on may 26, 1995, in an intern memo, the internet tidal wave, gate wrote: a new competitor `born' on the internet is netscap. their browser is domin with 70 percent usag share, allow them to determin which network extens will catch on. netscape' strategi, gate wrote, wa to move the key api into the browser to commodit the underli oper system. the broader inquiry: govern see arm-twist the feder govern and the state have recent broaden their alleg against microsoft by ad evid that it tri to bulli intel, appl comput inc. and other compani to squelch competit. they say that like the netscap meet the new evid fit a pattern of behavior by microsoft, which ha repeatedli tri to limit competit by strong-arm competitor and partner. one episod that fit the pattern, the prosecutor contend, wa an effort by microsoft to pressur intel to shelv the develop of multimedia and internet softwar and to limit it cooper with netscap. intel' main busi is make the microprocessor chip that act as the electron brain of most of the comput that run the window oper system. inde, the fortun of intel and microsoft are so close align that the two compani are sometim refer to as a singl, power entiti, wintel. but intel also employ hundr of softwar engin, mainli at it intel architectur lab in hillsboro, ore. and while intel and microsoft are partner, they have also had their conflict, typic over the direct and pace at which certain innov should be introduc into the person comput industri, which they domin togeth. feder and state investig have focus on microsoft' strong reaction to work be done by intel' softwar engin a sentiment express in no uncertain term dure a meet at intel' santa clara, calif., headquart on aug. 2, 1995. the contenti session wa attend by sever execut from intel and microsoft, includ gate and intel chairman andrew grove. an intern intel memo state that gate made vagu threat about support intel' competitor and that he wa livid about intel' invest in the internet and want them stop. later, intel did pull back from it multimedia and internet softwar develop. steven mcgeadi, an intel vice presid who attend the august 1995 meet, is schedul to appear as a wit for the govern. microsoft repli that the government' account of meet like those with netscap and intel are fanci distort, creat by use a bias select of document and wit. the government' case, microsoft assert, betray an utter failur to accept the computer-industri realiti that microsoft routin meet with compani to make sure their softwar and equip will work well with window. sometim the talk, microsoft say, go on to includ further level of cooper like licens technolog or a microsoft invest, as the compani discuss with netscap. in the trial, microsoft is expect to argu it advanc in the browser market wa the result of it own busi acumen and netscape' misstep. to document netscape' error, microsoft issu a subpoena last month and obtain the unpublish manuscript of a new book, compet on internet time: lesson from netscap and it battl with microsoft, which is base on hundr of interview with current and former netscap execut. the book doe chronicl the mistak made by netscap. but it author, michael cusumano of the massachusett institut of technology' sloan school of manag and david yoffi of the harvard busi school, think microsoft is hardli blameless. microsoft' take-no-prison strategi backfir, all but invit retali from competitor, the govern and even custom, yoffi said. emphas that he wa offer no legal judgment, yoffi ad, i think microsoft could have achiev 90 percent of what it did without cross the line as much as it did. the spyglass link: reward and peril of a partnership on april 6, 1994, gate and 20 microsoft execut gather for a daylong retreat not far from the company' headquart in redmond, wash. the subject wa the internet and how it might revolution the comput softwar busi. few concret plan were made that day, but microsoft execut insist that a direct wa set. our vision from the outset wa to unit the two world of the window desktop and the internet, said steven sinofski, a microsoft execut who attend the meet. yet microsoft badli trail netscap in the browser field. to hasten it entri, microsoft licens it earli brows softwar from spyglass inc. of napervil, ill. the first meet between the two compani wa initi by spyglass in april 1994. at the time, it wa a tini compani and eager to do a deal with microsoft. spyglass wa select as the commerci license for browser technolog develop by the nation center for supercomput at the univers of illinoi. in the summer of 1994, dougla colbeth, presid of spyglass, met with clark of netscap at o'har intern airport in chicago. the two men talk in the unit airlin red carpet room, reserv for business-class passeng, and colbeth recal clark tell him, we'r go to take microsoft head-on. at the time, colbeth recal think to himself, great, now microsoft will realli want to licens from me. today, he noted: rememb, we were a compani with a coupl dozen peopl and almost no money in the bank. netscap had jim clark, with hi money and reput, and big-tim ventur capit back from silicon valley. netscap had a veri differ agenda. by juli 1994, microsoft had becom quit interest in the spyglass technolog, colbeth say, and the two compani sign their first licens agreement the follow decemb. microsoft, colbeth recal, alway told him that it would eventu fold browser technolog into it oper system, but it time wa acceler by netscape' rapid rise. microsoft wa initi hope to charg for the browser, colbeth said. but on dec. 7, 1995, gate declar that microsoft would not onli deepli integr it browser into window but would give it away. the announc caught the industri, even colbeth, by surpris. at the time, spyglass had licens it technolog to 82 other compani, includ ibm and digit equip, for use in their softwar product a licens revenu stream of about $20 million a year. as a result of microsoft' move, spyglass saw those revenu vanish within a year, as smaller internet softwar compani went out of busi and big custom shift to microsoft' free browser. spyglass slash it payrol and scrambl into new nich of the softwar industri to replac it lost sale, which it succeed in do eventu. whenev you licens technolog to microsoft, you have to understand it can someday build it itself, drop it into the oper system and put you out of that busi, colbeth said. the nonopt compaq: suddenli see the light well into 1996, netscape' share of the browser market continu to rise, while microsoft made littl headway, even though it browser wa free. industri analyst and trade magazin agre that netscape' browser wa the clear technic leader. in april 1996, netscape' navig wa use by 87 percent of peopl brows the web, compar with 4 percent use microsoft' internet explor, accord to zona research. so the biggest person comput maker, compaq, thought it made sens to give custom netscape' browser instead of microsoft'. but microsoft would not stand for that and compaq had no choic but to give in. in june 1996, compaq want not onli to load the more popular netscap browser on it machin but also to remov the icon for microsoft' internet explor, which wa deliv to the comput maker with window 95. microsoft inform compaq that if it remov internet explor, the comput maker would lose it licens for window, said stephen decker, compaq' director of softwar procur, in testimoni to feder investig. the ultimatum from microsoft wa deliv bluntli in a letter head, notic of intent to termin licens agreement. face with be deni the essenti oper system, compaq quickli revers cours and kept the internet explor icon. microsoft assert that window and internet explor are a singl product and that microsoft alon defin what is in the product. noth in it contract, microsoft add, prohibit comput maker from includ compet technolog. while the cutoff letter microsoft sent to compaq seem an unnecessarili hardbal tactic when deal with it largest corpor custom, microsoft chief oper offic bob herbold insist that to take one letter here or one snippet of e-mail there to tri to portray microsoft as an arrog compani is unfair. note that a compaq execut is a wit for microsoft, herbold said, we are total depend on tremend relationship with key compani like compaq. at netscap, howev, the compaq episod wa a watersh. that wa the singular act that got me go to the justic depart, barksdal recal. barksdal said he regard microsoft' tactic of forc compaq to buy it browser as a condit of obtain an essenti product, the window oper system, as an illeg act and absolut proof that microsoft wa a monopolist. after investig the incid, the justic depart and the state agre with barksdal that microsoft wa illeg tie the sale of one product to anoth. microsoft repli that it ha a long histori of ad new featur to it oper system. and from the outset, microsoft say, it intend that window and it internet explor browser would be seamlessli integr, as they are now in window 98. thu, microsoft insist, there is no product-ti violat of antitrust law. in a separ case, a feder appeal court side with microsoft, uphold the principl that the compani could put whatev it want to in it oper system and declar it a singl product. but in june 1996, when compaq want to offer the netscap product instead of microsoft' browser, most industri expert view the browser and oper system as two differ softwar program. it took a long time for the integr strategi to play out, said a former senior microsoft research. back then, integr wa basic bolt a browser onto window. the `balanc act': america onlin toss in towel america onlin chairman stephen case refer to deal with microsoft as a delic balanc act. that balanc swung sharpli from the fall of 1995 to the spring of 1996, when microsoft use the lure of give america onlin a featur place on the window desktop as the ultim bargain chip. to gain access to computing' most covet real estat, america onlin agre to make microsoft' internet explor the main browser for it onlin subscrib, who now number more than 13 million. yet throughout 1995, as microsoft prepar to introduc window 95, the most signific improv ever in it oper system, case wa knock on the door of the justic depart. hi complaint wa that microsoft wa go to place it new onlin servic, microsoft network, a direct competitor to america onlin, promin on the desktop screen of window 95, which wa introduc in august. thi bundl tactic of use the industry-domin oper system to market microsoft network, or msn, case argu, gave microsoft an unfair advantag in the young but fast-grow onlin busi. the justic depart listen and investig. but ultim, the govern decid against take ani action. at america online' headquart in vienna, va., microsoft wa both fear and loath at the time. america onlin had a design microsoft watcher, a young mba. who track it adversary' everi move. abov the desk in hi small, windowless offic wa a pictur of gate. beneath the pictur, in larg block letter, were the word the enemi. though america onlin wa the clear leader in the onlin servic busi, it had ampl reason to worri about an all-out assault by a rival as rich and aggress as microsoft. when he had visit the microsoft headquart a coupl of year earlier, case recal, gate had bluntli assess microsoft' option by say he could buy 20 percent of america onlin, all of it or enter the onlin busi on hi own and buri you. a threat or mere a statement of the fact? a bit of both, case said recent. but he wa mainli articul what everybodi at that meet kind of intuit understood. yet by 1996, microsoft and america onlin found they had reason to cooper. with the explod popular of the internet' world wide web, the convent onlin compani, like america onlin and compuserv, had to provid their custom internet access as well as their own servic. america onlin had it own browser, but to keep pace with the rapidli advanc technolog it made sens to do a deal with netscap or microsoft. for both softwar compani, a deal with america onlin, which had 5 million subscrib at the time, could mean a big surg in browser use and market share. netscap seem the natur partner for america onlin, sinc both compani were microsoft rival. on march 11, america onlin did announc that it would buy netscap technolog, but it wa a standard licens deal base on a payment-for-us formula. the next day, america onlin announc a more signific deal with microsoft make it browser the default technolog the browser america onlin subscrib would use unless they specif ask for netscape' navig. to win the deal, microsoft offer to give america onlin a start-up icon on the window desktop precis the kind of equal treatment on the main window screen that case had ask the justic depart to requir of microsoft. after we agre to it internet explor browser, microsoft allow us to be bundl on the window desktop, case said. it wa an exampl of microsoft' pragmat side. the pragmat decis wa that the paramount corpor goal wa to increas browser market share to protect the mainstay softwar busi. as a result, it new onlin servic, msn, would have to sacrific an import market advantag over it main rival, america onlin. it wa bill' decis, said former msn gener manag russel siegelman, refer to gate. he sent me e-mail on it. he said he didn't think it would hurt msn that much. i disagre with him. to other microsoft execut, gate express a differ view of the like impact on msn. he told senior vice presid brad silverberg that put america onlin on the window desktop would amount to put a bullet through msn' head, accord to a deposit taken by the justic depart. in the antitrust suit, the govern assert that the america onlin deal show how microsoft use the power of it window monopoli to give it an edg in the browser war against netscap. david colburn, a senior vice presid of america onlin who took part in the browser negoti with microsoft, is a wit for the govern. today, microsoft ha overhaul it internet strategi to focu mainli on build popular special-interest web site in field like travel, person financ, automobil retail and news. and it is put these site, along with e-mail and search featur, in an all-in-on site that use the name msncom. i still regard microsoft as a primari threat, case observ. microsoft ha a histori of get it right in the long run, and there' no reason to think it won't in thi busi as well. we will alway be in microsoft' cross hair. the lesson: don't confront a steamrol at netscape' headquart in silicon valley, the strategi today is one of avoid head-to-head competit with microsoft whenev possibl. don't do someth that is in microsoft' path that' the lesson learn, observ clark, the netscap chairman. silicon valley' ventur capitalist, the investor who financ so mani of the nation' high-tech startup, gener follow the netscap formula these day. yet that still leav ampl room to prosper. for while compet directli with microsoft is danger, the softwar industri as a whole is an engin of wealth creation, job gener and technic innov. and there is an ambival side to the ventur community' relationship with microsoft. for if a start-up cannot steer clear of microsoft entir, the favor option is to be bought out by microsoft, which ha scoop up mani fledgl compani as a way of acquir promis technolog and peopl. microsoft understand start-up innov and how to co-opt start-up innov better than ani other high-tech compani, said jame breyer, manag partner of accel partner, a ventur capit firm. as microsoft ha grown, it ha come to be seen not mere as a competitor but as a forc of natur that shape the busi environ, like a weather front. microsoft is incred pervas, said stewart alsop, a partner with new enterpris associ, a ventur capit firm in menlo park, calif. at the board meet of the compani in which hi firm ha invest, two issu alway come up, he said: one is the price of the company' stock, and the other is what microsoft is go to do. in the last few year, microsoft ha offer it guidanc dure almost yearli meet between senior microsoft execut and lead ventur capitalist. the meet are part of microsoft' effort to improv it sometim prickli relat with silicon valley. we work hard to provid clariti about where we'r go and where we'r not go, said greg maffei, microsoft' chief financi offic. last year' confer took place in octob at the quadru offic build on sand hill road in menlo park, the wall street of high-tech ventur invest. maffei led a team of five microsoft execut who appear befor a group of 40 ventur capitalist, one of whom stood and ask the question that seem to be on the mind of mani of hi peers: how do i invest in a compani that stay out of the way of the steamrol? maffei, recal one person who attend the meet, stood up and deliv a brief lectur on busi that microsoft wa like to avoid. hi list includ special softwar for manufactur, human resourc manag, computer-aid design and other. but, thi person note, broad swath of the industri appear to be design as off limit includ new softwar platform that might compet with microsoft' person comput oper system. at one point, ruthann quindlen, a partner with institut ventur partner, lean over to vinod khosla, a co-found of sun microsystem and a partner at the ventur capit firm kleiner perkin caufield &amp; byer, and said quietli, i guess that leav us wash machin and toaster. follow is the text of the first two section of the sherman act, as pass by congress in 1890. as the foundat on which feder antitrust law ha been built, the act ha been amend sever time elev the crime to a feloni, increas the fine and prison term for individu and set fine for corpor convict of violat it. in the case of microsoft, the govern ha invok the sherman act to file a civil suit that seek to chang the company' busi practic, not a crimin suit that seek financi penalti. an act to protect trade and commerc against unlaw restraint and monopolies: section 1. everi contract, combin in the form of trust or otherwis, or conspiraci, in restraint of trade or commerc among the sever state, or with foreign nation, is herebi declar to be illeg. everi person who shall make ani such contract or engag in ani such combin or conspiraci, shall be deem guilti of a misdemeanor, and, on convict thereof, shall be punish by fine not exceed five thousand dollar, or by imprison not exceed one year, or by both said punish, in the discret of the court. section 2. everi person who shall monopol, or attempt to monopol, or combin or conspir with ani other person or person, to monopol ani part of the trade of commerc among the sever state, or with foreign nation, shall be deem guilti of a misdemeanor, and, on convict thereof, shall be punish by fine not exceed five thousand dollar, or by imprison not exceed one year, or by both said punish, in the discret of the court. will it matter to consum that bill gate isn't a nice guy? until last week, most american thought of gate, the chairman of the microsoft corp., as a geniu and innov. a nerd perhap but also a self-styl visionari who almost single-handedli unlock the power of the person comput. monday, howev, in a washington courtroom, the justic depart began paint a differ, darker portrait of gate. in an antitrust suit brought by the depart and 20 state, the man whose compani command a 97 percent share of the market for person comput oper system is be depict as a nixonian schemer who will go to almost ani length to crush hi competit. product innov, the suit argu, is not a suffici weapon for gate. flash back and forth between snippet of gates' videotap deposit and e-mail messag he had sent that contradict hi testimoni, the govern sought to establish a pattern of threat and offer of payment by the microsoft chairman. it also sought to cast gate as an obsess man who fear the tini netscap commun corp. and it potenti threat to hi domin of the market for internet browser, the softwar use to navig the world wide web. gate wa portray by justic depart litig david boi as a schoolyard bulli who ride roughshod over the comput industri with a crude that is in stark contrast to hi popular imag as a benevol dictat and high-technolog guru. accord to a document present by boi, for exampl, gate ask america onlin execut in 1996: how much do we need to pay you to damag netscap? thi is your lucki day. the implic, boi said, wa that the amount wa irrelev, and that microsoft, with it deep pocket and market domin, make as mani offer you can't refus as need to achiev it goal. microsoft offici are close watch market survey for ani hint that the new imag of a bare-knuckl gate might be detract from the company' world-fam brand name, but they insist that the public will continu to draw a distinct between alleg of anticompetit busi tactic and the company' softwar. despit what you'r read in the press, peopl judg us by our product, said mich matthew, head of microsoft' corpor public-rel offic. our experi is that peopl vote with their pocketbook. so far, consum are cast posit vote. last week microsoft report quarterli profit of $1.52 billion, a stun 58 percent increas over the level a year earlier. despit the record profit, some market expert say that if the public come to view gate as a rockefeller-styl robber baron, hi compani and it brand name may suffer. when you have a compani with such a visibl chief execut, the ceo is realli the driver of the brand, said david aaker, a brand market expert at the haa school of busi at the univers of california at berkeley. there is no question thi is go to affect microsoft' brand recognit. alreadi there are earli warn signal, as polit cartoon in newspap across the countri bash gate last week. one show him hold a globe and say, if you don't play my way, i'll take my ball and go home; anoth portray the microsoft chairman stand next to a henchman dangl someon from a window while a microsoft secretari say to a caller, i'm sorri, but mr. gate is busi teach a competitor about window. but some industri analyst believ the new view of a bill gate who know how to play hardbal may not be such a bad thing for hi compani. the he-said, she-said round of e-mail messag be drag out in court case both in washington and in silicon valley, where microsoft is lock in a legal battl with it archriv, sun microsystem inc., is view by some as littl differ from the exagger trash talk that goe on in profession sport. it' like take what charl barkley and michael jordan say to each other on the ball court and turn it into someth more sinist than it realli is, said paul andrew, co-author with stephen mane of gate (doubleday, 1993). inde, there is evid that the darker view of gate and hi compani ha so far taken root onli in the district of columbia and in silicon valley, where the comput industri ha long felt the impact of gates' tactic, and where bitter and distrust of microsoft are deep. in the rest of the countri, gate continu to enjoy great popular. two week ago, while speak befor a crowd of almost 7,000 student at indiana univers, a question who ask about the justic department' suit wa roundli boo. bill gate, whip boy c.1998 ny. time new servic is bill gate a high-tech machiavelli, public enemi no. 1 or a threat to the known univers? all three, judg from the numer polit cartoon that pop up in newspap across the countri last week. from chattanooga to boston, cartoonist took delight in demon gate, who is face an unexpect public relat challeng as microsoft' antitrust trial unfold in washington. other cartoon ran the gamut from the predict (a worker, point to an aquarium in which a larg fish is gobbl up smaller one, say to some visitor, welcom to microsoft' research and develop depart) to the weird (a dweebish man hunch in front of a comput screen stare at the words: our belov leader, mr. gate, is under attack. leav your possess. go to the desert. await the spaceship). and that wa just week one of the trial. stay tune. a feder judg friday push back the start date of the antitrust trial against microsoft corp. by four day, to oct. 19, while also order the compani to compli with the justic department' request to examin microsoft' financi record. microsoft argu that allow an armi of govern attorney to come in and make demand will make it veri difficult for us to remain in busi. but after win assur from govern lawyer that they would make onli narrow, target search of the record, judg thoma penfield jackson of the us. district court for the district of columbia order microsoft to open the databas for perus. microsoft had ask that the trial be delay sever more month to prepar a defens against what it said wa a last minut broaden of the case by the justic depart, which had ad new evid. last month, the govern said that in the process of prepar for the trial it had discov that microsoft tri to persuad appl comput not to market it quicktim multimedia softwar to window custom. on thursday, the justic depart and 20 state ad two new peopl to their wit list to testifi about microsoft deal with appl and with sun microsystem. avi tevanian, a former appl execut, wa ad to the wit list in part to describ microsoft' propos, which microsoft deni ever have made. the other new wit wa jame gosl, a sun execut who led the develop of java, an internet program languag that microsoft see as a potenti threat to the company' domin of the softwar market. the govern is charg that microsoft took illeg step to prevent java from gain wide accept. to counter that, microsoft name two new wit friday, robert muglia, a senior microsoft execut who ha work with sun, and chri engstrom, an execut who handl some of microsoft' deal with appl. at the same time, john warden, microsoft' lawyer, argu that the new alleg had no place in the case. the justic depart, warden told the judg, wa tri to turn thi into someth approxim a plenari monopoli case like the ibm case. it becom clearer and clearer and clearer with each new file that they are tri to turn thi into a broader case, he said. you can't have thi bait-and-switch in which they file a complaint alleg a, b, c, and then talk about the whole alphabet three time over. as a result, warden said, microsoft want, at a minimum, anoth two-week delay, even though a more normal schedul would have the trial start next year. the judg did not respond. instead he enter an order set the oct. 19 trial date. late friday, microsoft enter a formal motion ask for anoth two-week delay. a respons is expect next week. the case of unit state vs. microsoft corp., the government' most aggress move against a monopolist in almost 25 year, is play out against a centuri of antitrust law so broadli word and court rule so ambigu that both side are cite the same rule to support their oppos argument. whatev the outcom of the trial, schedul to begin monday in us. district court in washington, an almost certain appeal will leav to the suprem court the task of bring legal order to 100 year of clash antitrust doctrin. the case focus on microsoft' window, the oper system that control about 90 percent of all person comput sold today. the govern say it object is to curb illeg monopolist busi practic that threaten to render larg part of the economi vulner to the vicissitud of a singl compani. microsoft assert that the case is intend to give the govern control over which featur can be ad to window. howev grand the econom stake, the legal disput is narrow. the govern say that microsoft' contract with comput manufactur and with compani that provid access to the internet illeg stifl competit. the contract prohibit manufactur from substitut netscap commun corp.' navig browser for microsoft' internet explor. they also prohibit them from remov from the window main screen, or desktop, link to site on the world wide web run by microsoft or it partner. microsoft' contract with compani that connect peopl to the internet and with busi that sell good and servic on the web requir favor treatment for internet explor over navig in exchang for link on the window desktop. in the wake of the lawsuit, microsoft ha voluntarili drop some of these requir, though it could reinstat them at will. microsoft say that it contract are legal becaus they produc tangibl benefit for custom, includ easier internet access. the justic depart say that the bundl of explor with window 95 and the inclus of the browser as part of window 98 amount to tie, an illeg practic that forc custom of one product to purchas anoth. the contract with manufactur and internet servic are illeg, the govern say, becaus they are intend not onli to creat a monopoli in the browser market but to protect microsoft' exist monopoli in oper system. the latter threat is key, accord to the justic depart. browser have the potenti, like an oper system, to act as a softwar platform on which other program run. so contract intend to drive browser out of the market would also insul the window monopoli. mani antitrust expert say the problem face the justic depart is that the court have provid no clear definit of tie and no clear guidelin for determin when contract are illeg exclusionari. professor lawrenc white of new york univers, who wa chief economist of the justic department' antitrust divis in the earli 1980, say that the court treat tie as an unusu practic when in fact it is ubiquit. no one, he said, would challeng the right of manufactur to tie eras to the tip of pencil, tire to an automobil or button to shirt. hi point, share wide among economist, is that some tie benefit consum if, for exampl, it result in product that are easier to use or enabl a compani to recov develop cost. but tie can be bad if it lock in monopoli power. the court, white say, have not offer enough guidanc for distinguish good tie from bad, which is the nub of the legal disput. microsoft say it need onli to show that bundl window and explor pass what might be call a gross consum benefit test that it offer an immedi benefit, whether or not it caus long-term damag to competit and, therefor, ultim to consum. the justic depart say that microsoft' practic must clear a higher hurdle: yield net consum benefit that are immedi and larg enough to balanc possibl long-term harm to competit. so which test of consum benefit satisfi antitrust law? the simpl answer is that no one know for sure, which is whi both side can reason cite the same case without fear of embarrass. consid a 1985 case, aspen ski co. vs. aspen highland ski corp., and a 1951 case, lorain journal co. vs. unit state. in the first, aspen ski, the owner of three major ski run in aspen, colo. the monopolist had for year sold a ticket in cooper with aspen highland, a competitor, that gave skier access to both companies' run. when aspen ski unilater cancel the agreement, it rival' revenu shrivel and the rival su. the suprem court rule that aspen ski had violat antitrust law becaus there wa no evid it action help consum. in the lorain journal case, the onli local newspap in lorain, ohio, refus to sell advertis to compani that advertis on a new radio station. here, too, the suprem court rule that the exclusionari practic did noth to benefit consum. inde, in aspen ski, the court even forc the monopolist to do busi with it rival, a preced that augur well for the justic depart, which seek to forc microsoft to instal netscape' browser alongsid it own. but charl rule, a legal consult to microsoft, say that in both case the court threw out exclusionari practic onli becaus they offer no consum benefit. the court, he argu, never pounc on practic that result in lower price or better product or servic. nor did the court in either case call for balanc immedi benefit against hypothet long-term harm. rule argu that microsoft' practic produc demonstr consum benefit. besid, he say, unlik the action taken by the lorain journal or aspen ski, microsoft' contract do not prevent consum from instal netscape' browser or from use the web site of microsoft' rival. in truth, though, neither case answer what consum benefit test should appli to product design. in jefferson parish hospit district no. 2 et al. vs. hyde, anoth case cite by both side, the suprem court in 1984 recogn that surgeon and anesthesiologist provid an integr servic. yet, the court said, a hospit with monopoli power would still not be allow to forc surgic patient to use it panel of anesthesiologist if consum want to purchas the two servic separ. that principl could undercut microsoft' defens that the function interdepend of window and explor requir bundl. but microsoft will point to a strong concur opinion that call for a tougher standard for the govern to meet when it alleg tie. microsoft will also draw support from sever court rule that allow ibm to chang the design of it comput in way that made it hard for vendor to attach peripher equip. but perhap microsoft' best argument is that nowher ha the govern identifi a singl case in which the court explicitli call for throw out a tie product on the basi of a balanc test. the court, microsoft will emphas, steer clear of redesign technic sophist product. the justic department' rejoind is to note that the sole purpos of antitrust law is to protect consum, so it make no sens to bless practic that provid a dollar' worth of benefit today but, by stamp out competit, drive price up by $1,000 tomorrow. the justic depart will ask the court to at least insist that monopolist use the least exclusionari mean possibl to achiev whatev servic they provid custom. expert agre that the court will subject microsoft' restrict contract with internet compani to a balanc test. but exactli how the court will decid whether consum are help or hurt is up for grab. a balanc test would have the court weigh the immedi benefit to consum of one-click access to internet site and of featur of a bundl windows-explor packag versu the harm over time of diminish competit in the market for browser and oper system. but a test that make good sens in theori can prove fiendishli difficult to use in practic. balanc test are imposs difficult and arbitrari, said rep. thoma campbel, r-calif., who is a former law professor at stanford univers. the practic effect of balanc is to hand defend like microsoft almost certain victori. microsoft argu and mani antitrust expert agre that the court have in fact gravit away from a balanc test toward a simpler predat test for exclusionari contract. under thi standard, a contract is illeg onli if it is intend to drive out competit and thu to pave the way for a monopolist to rais price later. microsoft will have an easier time defend itself against a charg of predat, which amount to victim it custom, than it would defend itself against a charg that it bundl product doe consum slightli more harm than good. the antitrust record, say william baxter, who head the antitrust divis under presid reagan, is litter with contradictori, ambigu and sometim nonsens verdict. he and other legal expert agre that if noth els, that record leav plenti of legal leeway for the suprem court, should it hear the microsoft case, to stiffen the spine of the antitrust law. shortli befor the govern file it antitrust suit against microsoft corp. in may, joel klein, the assist attorney gener in charg of the justic department' antitrust divis, met with a silicon valley execut. the execut recal tell klein that unless a case went beyond the internet browser market, it would have littl effect on microsoft' power to stifl competit across the comput industri. klein repli that he understood the comput executive' concern. but he said time wa run short and the strongest evid in hand involv microsoft' battl against netscap commun corp. in the market for the so-cal browser softwar use for navig the internet. thi is a netscap case, the execut recal klein say. but five month later, the case that the govern is bring to trial on monday extend well beyond netscap and the browser war to embrac what it describ in a recent court file as a broad pattern of anti-competit conduct by microsoft. netscap, the govern insist, is still a prime exampl of the pattern but onli one of sever exampl. the 12-person wit list for the justic depart and 20 state su microsoft reflect the new evid ad to the case sinc may. jame barksdal, netscape' presid and chief execut, will appear first, but he will be follow by execut repres a cross section of the nation' high-technolog compani includ intel, ibm, sun microsystem, appl comput, america onlin and intuit. in bring a more ambiti, complic case to trial than the one it file in may, the govern ha chosen a high-risk strategi. the law state that new evid can be ad to a suit after it is file, but not new charg. and so, in hi feder courtroom in washington, u.s.district judg thoma penfield jackson could decid to rule out some of the new evid as rang too far afield from the origin suit. but if the govern win it broaden case, the court-ord remedi would no doubt be far tougher on microsoft. in may, the government' suggest step amount to equal treatment for netscape' browser and microsoft' browser. but the govern recent ask that the judg hold a separ hear on remedi, if it win the case. the remedi under consider now includ more basic chang in microsoft' busi practic perhap even a breakup of the compani intend to loosen microsoft' grip on comput. that would be precis the kind of sweep reform that microsoft' foe would applaud. the govern ha doubl the bet and doubl the stake, said david yoffi, a professor at the harvard busi school who is co-author of the book, compet on internet time: lesson from netscap and it battl with microsoft. meanwhil, in the microsoft camp, the government' strategi is dismiss as a desper act taken after a court rule in june that threaten to undermin the antitrust suit. that rule came in a separ case, involv the interpret of the consent decre that microsoft sign with the justic depart in 1995. in the june rule, a feder appeal court said that microsoft could bundl it browser with it industry-standard window oper system and call them one product. the appeals-court rule would seem to undercut the assert in the government' current antitrust case that the browser and the oper system were two separ product, bundl togeth and given away in an effort to thwart competit in the browser market. with the appeals-court rule in june, the govern lost the heart of it case, said charl rule, a former senior offici in the justic depart, who is now a consult to microsoft. so it ha taken a blunderbuss approach of scrambl to throw everyth it can find even evid the justic depart ha had for year into the gun barrel and see what hit. the june appel rule did shake the prosecut team. but mostli it strengthen the hand of those within the justic depart who had been urg that the case be broaden, accord to peopl who have work on the investig. at the same time, they say, new evid wa come in as the investig move ahead and prosecutor race to meet the acceler trial schedul approv by the court. speed wa a prioriti from the outset, they say. the justic depart and the state file their suit in may to move befor microsoft' new oper system, window 98, wa introduc in june. while not seek to block the releas of window 98, govern lawyer want to get to the the courtroom as earli as possibl as pc maker and comput user adopt thi latest version of microsoft' window oper system, which function as the central nervou system for more than 90 percent of person comput sold. the key alleg, govern lawyer note, have not chang sinc may name, that microsoft illeg use it market power in oper system to defend it monopoli posit and to tri to extend into new market. but the onli thing that wa wrap up in a bow in time for the may file wa the browser, said one person who work on the case. the real game plan wa alway to get a broader case. what is more, one person note, the prosecut team wa not at full strength until shortli befor the suit wa file. david boi, a renown courtroom litig and a former partner at cravath, swain &amp; moor who success defend ibm in it 13-year confront with the govern, wa name as special counsel for the justic depart last decemb. but boi, who left cravath last year, did not start work full-tim for the justic depart until mid-april, becaus he wa still finish privat case for hi own firm, boi &amp; schiller. the antitrust suit file in may lean heavili on the netscap stori, mention microsoft' main rival in the browser market some 130 time in the complaint and a support memorandum. but it also promin mention microsoft' tactic against sun microsystem, creator of java, an internet program languag, and cite it as an exampl of microsoft' behavior. it wa craft as a templat that could be ad to without much stretch, one person involv in the case said. and so, as new evid pile up and seem to fit into a pattern, klein step by step approv the widen of the case, the person said. and that explain, the person continu, how it is that evid that ha been in the hand of the justic depart for year ha been ad to the case sinc may; onli after gather new evid did it becom appar that the older materi fit the pattern of the current case. for exampl, the govern ha ad the content that microsoft pressur intel corp., the big microchip maker and a close partner of microsoft, to curb it develop effort in multimedia and internet softwar becaus they might conflict with microsoft' plan. the govern contend that the arm-twist occur at meet between the two compani three year ago, especi one on aug. 2, 1995, which wa attend by andrew grove, the intel chairman, and bill gate, the microsoft chairman. part of the government' evid in the intel-microsoft episod is copi of the handwritten note taken by steven mcgeadi, an intel vice presid who attend the meet, and a memo written by him on aug. 28, 1995. the memo, still under court seal, said that gate made vagu threat and wa livid about intel' invest in the internet and want them stop. a handwritten note, also under court seal, quot paul maritz, a microsoft execut, as say that netscap is their common enemi and that intel' role should be to fill in stuff in and around microsoft' strategi. these document were sent by intel to the justic department' offic in san francisco in novemb 1995, in respons to a civil investig demand a civil subpoena serv on intel on nov. 10, 1995. on it own, the intel materi wa intrigu, but it becam part of the antitrust suit onli as other evid surfac, one person close to the case said. the govern is contend that microsoft also tri to urg appl to stop sell it quicktim multimedia softwar in the window market and tri to convinc real network inc. to pull back in the market for so-cal stream softwar. the govern case ha also broaden, peopl involv in the case say, as more wit from the industri have been increasingli will to testifi. in the begin, most peopl in the industri believ that the govern would lose and microsoft would retali if they came forward, one person said. but as the strength of our case wa perceiv to improv, more peopl were will to come forward, and thing snowbal. you get intel, it' easier to get appl and so on. ","Business rivals are seeking to break Microsoft Corp.'s monopoly on computer operating systems.The Government and 20 states have filed an anti-trust suit against Microsoft, invoking the Sherman Anti-trust Act of 1890.The suit began with a Microsoft vs Netscape battle over browser software but now extends far beyond that aiming at Microsoft's overall aggressive anti-competitive conduct.The effort is extensive but inconsistent because of the ambiguity of anti-trust laws, especially the Sherman Act.The Government is examining Microsoft's financial records and painting a dark image of its Chairman Bill Gates.An unpublished book may be crucial to the trial.","In 1998 the Justice Department filed a civil suit against Microsoft to change its 9-year pattern of anti-competitive conduct.Bill Gates appears a schemer ready to crush competitors by any means.He uses Microsoft's clout to squelch internet competition.A 1996 Netscape complaint over browsers was central to the case, which grew to include Intel, IBM, Sun, Apple, AOL, and Intuit.Microsoft was ordered to let Justice examine its records and sought a trial delay.An unpublished book provided evidence.The 1890 Sherman Anti-Trust Act centered on Standard Oil and was intended to protect consumers, but its wording is broad and rulings have been ambiguous.","The Justice Department and 20 states filed a suit against Microsoft for violation of the Sherman Act, charging it illegally tried to use its dominance as the provider of Windows, the industry standard operating system, to stifle competition in other areas.At the heart of the case are Microsoft's contracts with computer manufacturers that prohibit them from substituting Netscape's Navigator browser for Microsoft's Internet Explorer, but Justice also alleges Microsoft exhibited a broad pattern of anti-competitive conduct with numerous other software companies.Microsoft says that Windows and its browser is one tool that offers immediate consumer benefit.","The government suit against Microsoft is the most aggressive antitrust case in a quarter century.The heart of the case is the Internet browser battle between Microsoft and Netscape.Microsoft says that its Internet Explorer is an integral part of its Windows system, the industry dominant operating system.Microsoft, it is argued, has told computer manufacturers that if they want Windows, they must forgo Netscape.The Justice Department and 20 states are joined in the action brought under the Sherman Antitrust Act.Microsoft's chairman, Bill Gates, usually seen as a visionary is portrayed in much darker tones in the trial."

could affect lebanon' econom stabil as it recov from the 1975-90 civil war. hariri, 53, the architect of lebanon' multibillion dollar postwar reconstruct program, ha been in power sinc 1992. a billionair businessman who made hi fortun in saudi arabia, hariri is credit with restor econom confid and stabil the nation currenc. the disput appear to be the open salvo of a struggl on how lebanon

Emile Lahoud, president.Lahoud, who promises to clean up a graft-riddled government, is popular and is backed by powerful Syria.It is unclear, though, whether Prime Minister Hariri, in office since 1992 and credited with the country's economic recovery, will continue to head the cabinet.31 of 128 legislators chose not to support him, leaving it to the president to name the next prime minister.Consequently, Hariri withdrew his candidacy, claiming the president acted unconstitutionally when he accepted the mandate to name a prime minister.Hariri's administration was plagued by nepotism.","Army Commander and Maronite Catholic Emile Lahoud was named Lebanon's president for the next 6 years, chosen by outgoing President Hrawi and Syria's Hafez Assad.Traditionally the president is a Maronite, the PM a Sunni, and Speaker of Parliament a Shiite.Election by Parliament is a formality.The constitution was amended to permit senior public servants to be president.Lahoud rebuilt the army and ended militia reign.Walid Jumblatt opposed a military president, fearing a return of surveillance on civilians.PM Rafik Hariri, a businessman who rebuilt the country and economy, refused his delayed re-appointment by Lahoud, who vowed to fight corruption."
