The operative's concern inflamed report British newspaper Tayyib cooperating Saudi US. authority. In August, 1997 article, The Daily Telegraph said Tayyib custody Saudi Arabia since May given intelligence official detail bin Laden's bank account business. The news Tayyib's possible defection, East African operative wrote report apparently intended group's commander, almost made explode.

Fazil since charged embassy attack remains large. The report typed computer seized last year Kenyan authority, according government filing last week US. district court Manhattan. Thus far, US. prosecutor charged least six member bin Laden's organization terrorist activity conspiracy. In one recent filing, said case part based testimony confidential source, suggesting informant agreed testify trial bin Laden associate. The arrangement appears resulted plea bargain source cooperating hope receiving lesser sentence. There indication source yet sentenced seems likely sentencing would take place investigation ensuing trial complete. In affidavit prepared last week, source acknowledged pleading guilty terrorism charge United States said stemmed attack US. target, specifically identified. The source described taking oath allegiance follow bin Laden's order, gave detailed account bin Laden's group, including history inner working. The source told private statement bin Laden al Qaeda member, encouraging attack US. troop citizen stationed Middle East Africa. I either heard statement myself, source said, I read learned al Qaeda member. The government also said court paper source helped identify bin Laden's signature 1996 document urging Muslims kill Americans. Tayyib's whereabouts unknown could reached comment. The Taliban's chief justice accused United States Wednesday looking excuse launch another missile attack war-shattered homeland. And excuse Osama bin Laden, man Washington call Enemy No. 1 blame Aug. 7 bombing US. embassy East Africa, Justice Noor Mohammed Saqib said interview The Associated Press.

They cite Afghan tradition, demand host guarantee guest protection. So far Saqib say evidence bin Laden's involvement terrorist activity. The Taliban refused turn bin Laden United States, say evidence try Islamic law. In 90 percent Afghanistan ruled Taliban harsh brand Islamic justice imposed, including death penalty. We want good relation United States Muslim non-Muslim country, respect way, said. Saqib said inquiry wind Nov. 20 evidence bin Laden case closed least Taliban. Bin Laden sinful man . America silent . given evidence, said. It shameful America seen world reason go bin Laden. The man accused orchestrating US. embassy bombing Tanzania Kenya declared free man Friday Afghanistan, lived year permission hard-line Islamic Taliban militia. The Taliban, control 90 percent Afghanistan, Friday closed three-week inquiry allegation Osama bin Laden waging war terror United States. It's over, America presented evidence, Afghanistan's chief justice, Noor Mohammed Saqib, told The Associated Press interview Supreme Court building Afghan capital, Kabul. Without evidence, bin Laden man without sin. . He free man. The Taliban told bin Laden, however, political activity banned agreed respect that, Taliban information minister said statement Friday. The minister, Amir Khan Muttaqi, also disputed US. assertion bin Laden rich man, saying Saudi dissident foreign asset frozen, claim immediately corroborated. One clear unstated objective last August's raid Afghanistan kill Osama bin Laden many lieutenant possible, administration official acknowledge. According official, White House lawyer conducted secret review month attack concluded operation legal US. international law. The official said raid timed 70 cruise missile would hit bin Laden's camp moment Central Intelligence Agency believed would meeting chief operative. A 1976 executive order bar anyone working US. government plotting carrying assassination. But official said White House legal opinion drafted Afghan strike asserts president authority target infrastructure terrorist group attacking Americans. A top US. counterterrorism official said week infrastructure bin Laden's group mostly human. As said time Aug. 20 strike, objective disrupt training, organization infrastructure bin Laden terrorist network Khost camp, said David C. Leavy, spokesman National Security Council White House. Targeting infrastructure, official acknowledged, also mean destroying leadership terrorist group. Command control enemy justifiable target, Leavy said. Senior administration official said never discussed killing bin Laden planning session. His death, said interview attack, would simply side benefit. US. intelligence official say believe bin Laden camp day attack, appears left unscathed missile hit. Officials said report least one senior lieutenant may died attack, total casualty complex 50 100. Administration spokesman drawn distinction attempting kill specific person like bin Laden attacking group people command terrorist organization. Administration official denied since August raid intended kill bin Laden, Saudi exile charged federal prosecutor leading global war US. interest. He linked Aug. 7 bombing two US. embassy East Africa. But le subtle explanation offered Oct. 13 Defense Secretary William Cohen, said visit Saudi Arabia United States going bin Laden colleague. We quite successful, Cohen continued, sent message. Kenneth Bacon, Pentagon spokesman, said secretary retracted statement. The Los Angeles Times recently reported administration believed legal right use deadly force terrorist leader. Bin Laden's organization significant concern Clinton administration even bombing US. embassy East Africa. Last spring, official said, US. intelligence considered daring raid Afghanistan capture Saudi exile. Officials said roughly time, White House drafted legal justification military attack terrorist leadership. That review, official said, provided legal basis August fire cruise missile meeting believed bin Laden lieutenant would gathered. The review, National Security Council, basis saying operation violate presidential order banning assassination. That ban imposed President Ford 1975, congressional investigator uncovered evidence CIA plotted assassinate Fidel Castro, Cuban leader, others. The order said: No person employed by, acting behalf United States government shall engage in, conspire engage in, assassination. While is, face, sweeping unqualified ban, subject interpretation intense debate year. In 1986, Reagan administration responded terrorist attack US. soldier Germany bombing raid Libya. The target included residence Libyan leader, Moammar Gadhafi. And Gulf War, US. force used powerful bomb attempt kill Saddam Hussein, president Iraq. The legal review conducted White House would appear provide precedent future operation similar circumstance.

6,"He classic small-town prodigy, creativity big-city profiteer. When shot take, invented new one. When one pas to, reconfigured play teammate open. Larry Bird, Indiana countryside inside Boston Garden, luminous exception governing rule. That why, six year retirement National Basketball Association, name basketball's prominent, beginning induction Hall Fame 7,000 Bird watcher Civic Center Friday night. Deservedly enshrined forever exceptional, becomes Bird, exception, case study contentious potentially disastrous labor war. No, really, Bird said, I asked whether troubled likelihood legendary name soon representing symbol greed unsympathetic million. There's always player's name attached thing. I know time I happy it. That would 1988, Celtics wanted compensate Bird $4.9 million bonus push back pain, go savior. Three year later, contract arbitration involving Knicks' Patrick Ewing, agent David Falk would contend NBA conspired Celtics circumvent salary cap, order satisfy Bird. Alan Greenspan, I sure, would agree salary cap convoluted enough give anyone headache, let's say cap exist team negotiating one own. The process unsealing cap re-sign particular player eventually became known making use Larry Bird exception. And stand, onetime exception become expensive rule owner want play anymore. I understand side, said Bird, safely middle, Bird, former exception, Bird, present Indiana Pacers' coach. Without getting exception, I think important player stay place. Important, meant, franchise stability fan identification. You son 7 year old, go 7 17 10 year played, Bird said. A lot people Boston told followed me, time young college. The Bird year numbered three Celtics championship, best player pro basketball's famous team ever had. He Magic Johnson created basketball renaissance began college title showdown Salt Lake City spread worldwide, like infectious smile. They stood pas, team play, decade selflessness given way one selfishness. The NBA Michael Jordan reached greater height anyone imagined could, league suffers sickness soul. If Larry Magic done did, might survive we're go through, said Bill Fitch, Bird's first Celtics coach, who, Bill Walton, stood night that, said, gave closure playing career. The owner, always, exaggerating misery, time, much easier root player. The president union Ewing, one day command player boycott world championship NBA's corporate fingerprint them, next day help television commentary work David Stern's women's annex. Ewing lead fight protect $100 million contract 21-year-olds achieved single playoff victory, linked big payoff agent like friend Falk. The battle waged name salary cap make exception unexceptional, reward everyone Bird. I believe field allowance truly special one, Walton said. But group small. When I growing sport, player got recognition champion, one always made feel good game, sport. That's Larry Magic played, always dreaming special team. It hype, money. That quite case, been. Bird businessman's ball player day arrived, flannel shirt blue-collar ethic. He hired late Bob Woolf, one original heavy-hitting agent, got record rookie contract. Then went turned 29-victory catastrophe 61-victory contender. A rare Bird, honest exception rule. Despite modest encouragement new proposal delivered player owner, National Basketball Association Tuesday canceled first two week regular season, first time league's 51-year history lose game labor dispute. The NBA's deputy commissioner, Russ Granik, announced cancellation nearly three half hour meeting concluded Manhattan hotel. The decision cancel 99 game Nov. 3 Nov. 16 came player association proposed implementation tax system instead hard salary cap, proposal owner said would respond Friday. We tried best today try possible salvage season, said Alonzo Mourning, Miami Heat center. Unfortunately, work out. After 35,001 game without blemish, NBA join National Hockey League, National Football League Major League Baseball lost game labor dispute. Taking account three- four-week period would needed training camp free-agent signing season start, league said would decide two week whether make cancellation. I'm sad disappointed, said NBA commissioner, David Stern. I consider collective failure, I honestly know else could done. I thing I like think best interest game. And I believe is. The decision came side agreed substantive talk since owner imposed lockout player July 1. Seventeen player, including union president Patrick Ewing vice president Mitch Richmond, Herb Williams, Dikemebe Mutombo Ty Corbin, attended meeting along Stern, Granik five member ownership committee Madison Square Garden president Dave Checketts owner Abe Pollin Washington, Gordon Gund Cleveland, Les Alexander Houston Jerry Colangelo Phoenix. The talk featured player association implied bevy concession made owner felt would accommodate league's desire swing revenue pendulum back toward owner. The dispute involves distribution approximately $2 billion league-wide income. The main sticking point owners' insistence salary cap without exception, implementation believe would bring player salaries' line revenue growth. While player discus elimination Larry Bird exception clause allows player secure amount money want re-signing current team address exception taxation proposal. The main point follows: A 50 percent tax would imposed salary earned $18 million, clause would affect player exercised Bird right. For example, player made $20 million, team would forced put $1 million fund would likely distributed low-revenue team. There could provision made player, said Jeffrey Kessler, chief outside counsel union. We want anything would encourage Chicago getting Michael Jordan back. And I think league feel way. The proposal similar luxury tax proposed union 1995 negotiation, would nearly liberal. A salary cap credit would go effect league pay 63 percent revenue salary. Whatever figure number reduces salary cap next year. If figure $29 million salary cap, 29 team would work salary cap $1 million le previous season. But player would assurance salary cap would go least $2 million credit go effect. Also, 63-percent threshold met, reduction annual 20 percent raise would take effect multi-year contract. Players would either get raise 10 percent rate growth league revenue. The union said clearly address league's desire bring salary line revenue. Since owner re-opened current agreement 57.1 percent revenue going toward salary, 63-percent figure would probably come substantially owner agree proposal. Teams would get right first refusal free agent fourth year incoming rookie, meaning player would contractually obligated team first four year deal. Currently, rookie scale three year includes clause enables player exercise Bird right two season clause Kevin Garnett parlayed astronomical $126 million deal last year Minnesota. Finally, player agreed make marijuana banned substance. Details testing negotiated specific discussion took place regarding testing performance-enhancing drug, provision owner included last proposal. In return concession, player want increase minimum salary currently $272,500 creation average salary exception. This would allow every team salary cap able sign one free agent per year average salary currently $2.6 million. We're buoyed fact first time they've decided submit counterproposal, union's executive director, Billy Hunter, said. I know I'm optimistic, I earnestly say look ballplayer eye say made valiant effort. Asked player would finally tested financially cancellation game, Hunter added: It's u blinking. We want reach agreement. We're tired rhetoric, we're tired game-playing. Our position along want accept bad deal. Granik said refund fan would made end calendar month first refund would include monies canceled preseason game. He estimated loss hundred million dollar. I think serious concern whether tax system address kind need economically, added. But there's possibility. Added Stern, We owe fan go back look notion whether tax rate might begin achieve result wanted. It look promising, we're going spend next two day see give favorable response. Though decision cancel game surprising, represent major shift prior labor stalemate. Both side reluctantly hammered deal 1995 start training camp sole notion missing game preserving NBA's perfect record. Tuesday, could come accord. I'd like think last game cancel, Granik said. But unless something else work, there's dramatic breakthrough, I think certainly season that's jeopardy. In decision almost certainly lead first work stoppage National Basketball Association history, league Monday announced cancellation 114 preseason game. Citing stalled negotiation Players Association new collective bargaining agreement, league official said would decide next week whether cancel first week regular season game. While decision expected 10 day, nonetheless sent strong signal owner player probably willing cancel least part regular season order settle labor dispute. Both side agree would take least three week hold abbreviated training camp sign 200 free agent new contract. Privately, official side believe season start scheduled Nov. 3 even December. Unlike Major League Baseball, National Football League National Hockey League, NBA never lost regular-season game labor strife. Since we're even negotiating, conclude likely we're going miss part regular season, deputy commissioner Russ Granik said Monday night. We'll try defer decision last minute, right look good. The two side meet Thursday first official bargaining session since Aug. 6. Commissioner David Stern group owner walked meeting dismissing merit new proposal player. Neither Granik player association executive director Billy Hunter sounded week's meeting would go long way toward signing new agreement precursor playing again. I think choice miss game point, Hunter said. In fact, I think they've intended along. They've locked u out, they've refused negotiate they've given u proposal that's ludicrous. Not side still awaiting outcome arbitration decision due Oct. 18 - Fordham Law School dean John Feerick rule whether 200 player $800 million guaranteed contract paid lockout owner player also making time win public opinion test fans' loyalty canceling game. Monday 11 city throughout country, player holding make-shift press conference training-camp venue, NBA arena gymnasium. Patrick Ewing, union president, several teammate speak SUNY-Purchase Purchase, N.Y., Knicks train season. With training camp originally scheduled open Oct. 6, message player clear: owner would call end lockout, would ready play today. About 100 player expected attend, speak sign autograph fan afterward. I wish would put energy trying negotiate deal rather various thing they've doing, Granik said. The dispute essentially owner player judiciously divvy $2 billion income. It began last year contention owner employee receiving fair share pot. The owner allowed terminate current agreement clause enabled player salary reached 53.8 percent total basketball-related income. The owner say figure currently hovering around 57.1 percent. Though many economic issue need resolved, main point contention since labor agreement expired owner declared lockout July 1 clause allows team pay free agent whatever want, regardless salary-cap rule governing NBA's 29 team. Called Larry Bird exception, created allow Hall Fame Boston Celtics forward re-sign Celtics near end career. Michael Jordan exercised clause last two year Chicago Bulls, earning $30 million per season figure $5 million team allowed spend player. But exorbitant salary paid several unproven star last year $100 million deal sprouting routinely, owner determined swing income pendulum back toward enforcing restricted salary cap hard cap putting ceiling much one player could earn. Last year, player received $1 billion dollar salary benefit made proposal guaranteed increase number 20 percent next four year, Granik said prepared statement. Our proposal would result average player salary $3.1 million minimum salary 10-year veteran $750,000. Unfortunately, union leadership unwilling give serious consideration offered. Hunter labeled claim optimistic projection, shot number new proposal presented player Sept. 25. If left current deal place, would gotten much anyway, added. All we're saying is, we're position accept hard cap. Monday's decision cancel preseason came le two week NBA indefinitely postponed training camp canceled first week exhibition game. Through ticket sale alone, Granik estimated losing exhibition season would cost league $35 million $40 million. Decisions cancellation regular season game expected made next week, added. A league official said game would canceled block one two week, depending upon circumstance regarding negotiation. Thursday's bargaining session suddenly become last hope starting season time. Hurdles could overcome quickly, I reason believe Thursday, Granik said. Added Hunter: Of course expect much get done. When Russ David decide negotiation going real substantive, something happen. What they're banking player going miss paycheck cave November. It's they've ingested something pas. And pass, they'll negotiate. The first substantive talk two month opposing side National Basketball Association's labor dispute came went Thursday without hint settlement. Still, five-hour meeting described cordial league almost like two bull letting little steam player association produced another scheduled round talk next Tuesday. Barring major compromise, enough time preserve full season prevent league losing first regular-season game labor strife November. Russ Granik, NBA's deputy commissioner, said league would wait next week's meeting deciding cancel regular-season game. He also discussed possibility significantly shortened season. We made determination need exact number game order representative season, Granik said. But recognize beyond certain point can't possibly sell fan we're NBA season. Whether's 60 game, 50 game 49 53, we're yet. We month face decision. Perhaps progress involved Thursday conference room midtown Manhattan hotel question-and-answer session league's latest proposal player. Patrick Ewing, union president, vice president Herb Williams Dikembe Mutombo attended meeting union's executive director, Billy Hunter, union lawyer. No owner present, Granik, Commissioner David Stern league's lawyer spent day explaining intricacy two-week-old proposal player. At one point two party broke lunch, Stern Hunter raised voice accused handling constituency poorly, participant meeting said. But two seen shaking hand laughing meeting concluded shortly 3 pm. There venting side, Hunter said. We've placid respectful. Today, took coat inclined take glove little bit. Having done that, I think kind loosened side. Hunter added: Did anybody blink today? They're sort look u kind nuance find course negotiation might, way another, give indication we're mouthing one thing might open something else. We're looking body language, too. I think they're ready make deal. The last formal meeting side Aug. 6 ended Stern owner abruptly marched received proposal player. In critical ruling North American National Basketball Association players' union, arbitrator John Feerick decides Monday whether 200 player guaranteed contract paid lockout. If player win, owner liable dlrs 800 million guaranteed salary, although vowed appeal lose. The league already sued player Feerick's jurisdiction. If win, I think emboldens spirit resolve player, union director Billy Hunter said. But I think anybody celebrating there's guarantee end lockout. It mean pay 200 player, they've indicated u intent file immediate appeal take far order avoid payment. So even rule favor, hollow victory. The player going get paid Nov. 15 circumstance, Hunter said. If owner win, remove last wild card player holding. The side negotiated since last Tuesday, union proposed superstar tax highest contract. The league made counterproposal Friday, asking tax imposed much lower threshold. Hunter dismissed league's latest proposal Friday afternoon, said side would best served awaiting Feerick's ruling. It's unlikely negotiation held week, since union holding meeting NBA player agent advisory committee Las Vegas Wednesday Friday. We've got get sense player are, consider reasonable they're willing order get season commence, Hunter said. The union filed grievance Feerick lockout imposed July 1 owners' announcement June 29 would honor guaranteed deal. In six-day hearing summer, union argued owner protected liable guaranteed salary work stoppage inserting lockout language standard player contract. The Sacramento Kings inserted lockout clause center Olden Polynice's contract 1994, approved league. The union used existence clause argue team protected similarly. Most player due receive first paycheck Nov. 15, although dozen clause entitling paid summer. None received paycheck. The NBA argued tenet labor law allows employer withhold pay employee lockout. The league also called former union director Simon Gourdine testify. He said understanding negotiated old labor agreement 1995 player would paid owner chose reopen agreement impose lockout. More 220 National Basketball Association player guaranteed contract find Monday whether paid management lockout, long-awaited arbitrator's decision may affect leverage league's dispute player major ramification American sports-labor law. But neither player owner counting ruling arbitrator, John Feerick, speed negotiation, especially Feerick find favor player, award could approach $800 million salary. NBA attorney indicated union decision go management, seek vacated appealing US. District Court Manhattan then, necessary, 2nd US. Circuit Court Appeals, process could prevent player getting paid several month. The NBA already canceled first two week regular season labor dispute. The league litigation pending US. District Court Manhattan. If player win ruling, NBA intends renew motion disqualify Feerick. The motion brought last summer ground collective bargaining agreement existed and, therefore, jurisdiction hear matter. If rule favor, I think emboldens spirit resolve player, said Billy Hunter, union executive director. But understand end lockout. It mean pay 200-some player. And still litigation alive may take resolve. At most, hollow victory. Feerick taken full 30 day render decision. Whatever decides, ruling watched carefully. There precedent locked-out athlete paid. During NBA summer lockout 1995, player missed paycheck file grievance. Neither National Hockey League player locked first three month 1994-95 season. The union argued owner protected inserting clause non-payment lockout strike individual player contract. In support argument, union pointed clause individual player contract contained language precluding payment lockout. The league relying basic tenet labor law, hold employee paid strike lockout. A ruling union would significant future negotiation player owner. The deterrent factor lockout employee subject collective bargaining agreement get paid agreement expires unable reach new agreement. If Feerick find favor player, economic incentive guaranteed contract reach agreement quickly. They would essentially paid playing basketball. If Feerick find favor owner, reality paid may spur player reach agreement quickly. But Hunter disputed notion, conference call Friday talked openly entire season's canceled player would back away ultimate goal. I'm concerned, Hunter said. There's demonstration there's going change resolve. After player saw proposal league recent posturing NBA owner, well, I two player call tell me, need be, they'd willing hock everything they've got. Another significant development may thedeparture many player Europe dispute settled, according least two player agent. I think would case-by-case basis, yes, there's already people talking that, said Bill Strickland, member union's agent advisory committee. Steve Kauffman, another member committee, said would explore possibility one client, Nets center Rony Seikaly, would sign professional team Greece. We look void deal team, Kauffman said. But would want right work temporarily could come back honor contract.' Russ Granik, NBA deputy commissioner, said league approved idea players' earning living elsewhere lockout settled. Proposals exchanged last week included concept luxury-tax system player salary appeared reflect first sign progress negotiation since lockout began July 1. But side termed figure other's proposal unacceptable, unclear whether either side willing compromise. I think get carried away possibility yet, Granik said. When explored idea tax system, taking player word wanted make headway. But call first proposal meaningless charitable. They proposed something impact. As stand, can't solution. The owners' goal slow growth player salary relation leaguewide revenue next three year, player want keep earning much possible. As labor battle go, current one National Basketball Association player weird even sport standard. There real possibility most, all, coming season canceled. In union battle interest best paid, make union scale, dominating discussion. And worker, management, considering trying make union disappear. The current arrangement produced unbalanced pay scale immense proportion. Last year player ever received union minimum, $242,000 rookie $272,000 veteran. The number player making $1 million $2 million year middle class, NBA term fell sharply. But Michael Jordan made $33 million. This surprise. Sports entertainment business, unlike movie. Big star get million, get union scale. Over year, NBA effort stem rise salary failed. The important loophole salary cap let team sign free agent whatever willing pay. When adopted, assumed team would pay lot rival could pay. But worked way. In current negotiation, league offered guarantee payroll rise 20 percent next four year, $1 billion $1.2 billion, say open proposal split money way player want, whether raising minimum salary guaranteeing raise veteran. The union say worried middle class, seems determined preserve free market. The league got broadcaster, NBC Time Warner's cable channel, agree pay year's television fee whether game broadcast. (They paid back later year, either reduced fee extra game show.) Owners hoped player would think management willing wait out, come term small part season canceled. But union acting unhurried. It turned aside request negotiation week, saying player meet first. Then issue union suicide, tactic rejected player 1995. The idea player union, would illegal antitrust law owner collude. The sky would limit. That tactic might fail. The court could reject union decertification vote sham, case player may fear team would feel free offer le old union minimum. But player go route, could long time real negotiation get going. Billy Hunter, union's executive director, warned owner week prolonged lockout could destroy league's popularity. That seer said four year ago, baseball's World Series canceled labor trouble. But fan memory relatively short, baseball seems popular ever. With mind, owner player may choose battle month. In critical ruling North American National Basketball Association players' union, arbitrator John Feerick decides Monday whether 200 player guaranteed contract paid lockout. If player win, owner liable dlrs 800 million guaranteed salary, although vowed appeal lose. The league already sued player Feerick's jurisdiction. If win, I think emboldens spirit resolve player, union director Billy Hunter said. But I think anybody celebrating there's guarantee end lockout. It mean pay 200 player, they've indicated u intent file immediate appeal take far order avoid payment. So even rule favor, hollow victory. The player going get paid Nov. 15 circumstance, Hunter said. If owner win, remove last wild card player holding. The side negotiated since last Tuesday, union proposed superstar tax highest contract. The league made counterproposal Friday, asking tax imposed much lower threshold. Hunter dismissed league's latest proposal Friday afternoon, said side would best served awaiting Feerick's ruling. It's unlikely negotiation held week, since union holding meeting NBA player agent advisory committee Las Vegas Wednesday Friday. We've got get sense player are, consider reasonable they're willing order get season commence, Hunter said. The union filed grievance Feerick lockout imposed July 1 owners' announcement June 29 would honor guaranteed deal. In six-day hearing summer, union argued owner protected liable guaranteed salary work stoppage inserting lockout language standard player contract. The Sacramento Kings inserted lockout clause center Olden Polynice's contract 1994, approved league. The union used existence clause argue team protected similarly. Most player due receive first paycheck Nov. 15, although dozen clause entitling paid summer. None received paycheck. The NBA argued tenet labor law allows employer withhold pay employee lockout. The league also called former union director Simon Gourdine testify, Feerick upheld union objection prohibited Gourdine saying whether understanding negotiated old labor agreement 1995 player would paid owner chose reopen agreement impose lockout. Patrick Ewing want sound like striking longshoreman demanding health benefit. I'm going try put dollar cent. But Ewing, president National Basketball Association Players Association, played public-relations game Tuesday expounding theme labor unrest: strong-willed unity short-sighted proposal. On day training camp scheduled begin, player across country held news conference 14 NBA city proclaim ready practice regular season. We want show public we, player, want play, said Ewing, flanked five teammate. Today supposed start training camp. We want practice want season start. But unfortunately, owner locked u season postponed. The owner player scheduled hold first bargaining session since Aug. 6 Thursday Manhattan. Neither side predicting progress toward signing new collective bargaining agreement beginning season scheduled Nov. 3. The league canceled entire 114-game preseason Monday. Next week, consider canceling first-ever regular season game league history. With wide philosophical difference $2 billion annual income distributed, side privately said expect play regular season game December. Billy Hunter, union's executive director, offered glimmer hope. He spoke optimistically potential quick resolution. Standing foot away Ewing, said, I hope owner commissioner gotten message: we're serious deal. I'm prepared make quantum leap. I think we're far off. I think there's lot jockeying, lot rhetoric lot game played. But owner decide want deal, they'll get one. But soon after, began lambasting owners' latest proposal, includes eventual phasing Larry Bird exception clause enables free agent earn unlimited salary current team. That clause represents major rift negotiation. Owners would like implement restrictive salary cap would eventually put ceiling much one player earn. I know going come speedy resolution, Ewing said. They're entrenched want, hard cap. And feel hard cap, player, cannot survive. We would stupid ignorant accept deal. Said Hunter, If go proposal, joke. It's step backwards. I cannot understand it. If intent reach agreement late stage negotiate earnest, wrong way go it. League official respond players' comment. All want fair share feel like they're trying take away u, Ewing said. `There's perception we're strike. It's way around. We've locked out. Besides Ewing, Knicks included former union president Buck Williams, former vice president Herb Williams, Allan Houston John Starks. Marcus Camby also showed briefly. When medium horde closed in, however, third-year forward went look late-arriving teammate inside practice facility. He stopped gym door, locked. They locked u out, said Rockets forward Mario Elie. Everybody's got get corrected. It's u. They're one closed u down. The stalemate elicited talk possibly bringing mediator coming week, Major League Baseball 1994 help solve labor dispute. But player convinced commissioner David Stern owner set testing resolve genuine headway made negotiation. That mean missing paycheck November, something Ewing said player prepared do. Both side still awaiting outcome arbitration decision due Oct. 18. Fordham Law School dean John Feerick rule whether 200 player $800 million guaranteed contract paid lockout. Feerick's decision could give new leverage one side. But player lose arbitration, 400 athlete many extravagant lifestyle tremendous financial obligation allegiance instantly tested. It's like want see strong are, Ewing said. Based proposal we've received, we're strong. So far, seems though NBA dug position, Buck Williams said. I think they're concerned point making deal. He added, We're far apart Grand Canyon right now. The National Basketball Association, embroiled labor dispute player, Tuesday canceled first two week 1998-99 season. It first time league's 51-year history lose regular-season game. The NBA's deputy commissioner, Russ Granik, announced cancellation nearly three half hour meeting concluded Manhattan hotel. The decision cancel 99 game Nov. 3 Nov. 16 came player association proposed implementation tax system instead hard salary cap, proposal owner said would respond Friday. We tried best today try possible salvage season, said Alonzo Mourning, Miami Heat center. Unfortunately, work out. After 35,001 game without blemish, NBA join National Hockey League, National Football League Major League Baseball lost game labor dispute. Taking account three- four-week period would needed training camp free-agent signing season start, league said would decide two week whether make cancellation. I'm sad disappointed, said NBA commissioner, David Stern. I consider collective failure, I honestly know else could done. I thing I like think best interest game. And I believe is. The decision came side agreed substantive talk since owner imposed lockout player July 1. Seventeen player, including union president Patrick Ewing vice president Mitch Richmond, Herb Williams, Dikemebe Mutombo Ty Corbin, attended meeting along Stern, Granik five member ownership committee Madison Square Garden president Dave Checketts owner Abe Pollin Washington, Gordon Gund Cleveland, Les Alexander Houston Jerry Colangelo Phoenix. The talk featured player association implied bevy concession made owner felt would accommodate league's desire swing revenue pendulum back toward owner. The dispute involves distribution approximately $2 billion league-wide income. The main sticking point owners' insistence salary cap without exception, implementation believe would bring player salaries' line revenue growth. While player discus elimination Larry Bird exception clause allows player secure amount money want re-signing current team address exception taxation proposal. The main point follows: A 50 percent tax would imposed salary earned $18 million, clause would affect player exercised Bird right. For example, player made $20 million, team would forced put $1 million fund would likely distributed low-revenue team. There could provision made player, said Jeffrey Kessler, chief outside counsel union. We want anything would encourage Chicago getting Michael Jordan back. And I think league feel way. The proposal similar luxury tax proposed union 1995 negotiation, would nearly liberal. A salary cap credit would go effect league pay 63 percent revenue salary. Whatever figure number reduces salary cap next year. If figure $29 million salary cap, 29 team would work salary cap $1 million le previous season. But player would assurance salary cap would go least $2 million credit go effect. Also, 63-percent threshold met, reduction annual 20 percent raise would take effect multi-year contract. Players would either get raise 10 percent rate growth league revenue. The union said clearly address league's desire bring salary line revenue. Since owner re-opened current agreement 57.1 percent revenue going toward salary, 63-percent figure would probably come substantially owner agree proposal. Teams would get right first refusal free agent fourth year incoming rookie, meaning player would contractually obligated team first four year deal. Currently, rookie scale three year includes clause enables player exercise Bird right two season clause Kevin Garnett parlayed astronomical $126 million deal last year Minnesota. Finally, player agreed make marijuana banned substance. Details testing negotiated specific discussion took place regarding testing performance-enhancing drug, provision owner included last proposal. In return concession, player want increase minimum salary currently $272,500 creation average salary exception. This would allow every team salary cap able sign one free agent per year average salary currently $2.6 million. We're buoyed fact first time they've decided submit counterproposal, union's executive director, Billy Hunter, said. I know I'm optimistic, I earnestly say look ballplayer eye say made valiant effort. Asked player would finally tested financially cancellation game, Hunter added: It's u blinking. We want reach agreement. We're tired rhetoric, we're tired game-playing. Our position along want accept bad deal. Granik said refund fan would made end calendar month first refund would include monies canceled preseason game. He estimated loss hundred million dollar. I think serious concern whether tax system address kind need economically, added. But there's possibility. Added Stern, We owe fan go back look notion whether tax rate might begin achieve result wanted. It look promising, we're going spend next two day see give favorable response. Though decision cancel game surprising, represent major shift prior labor stalemate. Both side reluctantly hammered deal 1995 start training camp sole notion missing game preserving NBA's perfect record. Tuesday, could come accord. I'd like think last game cancel, Granik said. But unless something else work, there's dramatic breakthrough, I think certainly season that's jeopardy. ","The National Basketball Association joined the NHL, the NFL and baseball when it canceled first the preseason games then two weeks of regular season.In litigation that is complicated by a dispute over the distribution of nearly $2 billion in league income, the main sticking point is the owner's insistence on a salary cap without exceptions.Top players are avoiding discussion of the Larry Bird exception, which allows a player to secure any amount he wants in resigning with his current team except as it applies to their taxation proposal.Also pending is an arbiter's decision as to whether players will be paid during the lockout.","The Larry Bird exception has been used to pay some NBA players much more than the salary cap allows.Stalled labor dispute over NBA salaries cancels preseason games and threatens regular season games.NBA owners and players plan meeting, which is unsuccessful.Players submit proposal at next meeting.Owners to respond by Fri.First 2 weeks of the season, 99 games, are cancelled.An arbitrator will decide on Mon. whether or not NBA players with guaranteed salary contracts should be paid during the owners' lockout.As the NBA labor battle goes on, most, if not all, season games may be cancelled.Lesser paid players may suffer if union doesn't survive.","In a dispute over a new collective bargaining agreement the National Basketball Association owners declared a lockout on July 1, 1998.They wanted to discard a clause in the old agreement allowing teams to pay their own free agents whatever they wanted, substituting a hard salary cap.The players wanted to keep earning as much as possible.On Oct. 5 all 114 preseason games were cancelled.The players then proposed a 50% tax on salaries above $18 million that the owners rejected.On Oct. 13 the NBA cancelled the first two weeks of the regular season.By Oct. 21 the entire season seemed in jeopardy in the interests of the best paid.","In a dispute between the owners and NBA players over how to divide the $2 billion in league-wide income, all preseason and the first 99 1998-1999 regular season games were cancelled.The Larry Bird exception, a clause in the old agreement that allowed teams to pay their own free agents any amount, regardless of salary-cap rules, is the major issue.The owners want a restricted salary cap.The players have proposed a superstar tax, and the owners have presented a counter proposal, but negotiations have stalled.Meanwhile, both sides are awaiting a ruling by arbitrator Feerick on whether $800 million in guaranteed salaries will be paid during the lockout."

Still, mere fact Malaysia's experiment yielded positive result guarantee issue come APEC meeting. With Mahathir leading campaign, cause capital control fiery advocate penchant getting skin Westerners. Mahathir outspoken political leader, said Chia Yew Boon, independent analyst Singapore. There way like Clinton Jiang Zemin going able muzzle him, added, referring President Jiang China. Policy-makers United States expressed fear Malaysia's gambit seen successful, economically weakened country region, like Indonesia, might tempted try it.

In fact, Asian currency, like Indonesian rupiah Thai baht, actually rebounded since Malaysia suspended trading currency fixed exchange rate 3.8 ringgit dollar. Analysts liken situation buying insurance policy disaster come gone. More important, capital control slowing much-needed corporate banking reform. The government's rescue Renong, major conglomerate close tie Mahathir, going ahead, though analyst predict government eventually scrap much-criticized plan.

The Philippines, Malaysia Indonesia founding member country ASEAN, also includes Brunei, Laos, Myanmar, Singapore, Thailand Vietnam. Among Asia's leader, Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad notable man bold vision: physical social transformation would push nation forefront world affair. It almost came true. In 17 year prime minister, Mahathir, 72, medical doctor, fostered economic liberalization led world's fastest rate growth. He drove Malaysians productive, embrace high technology begin major investment around world. He created national affirmative-action program allowed country's ethnic Chinese, Malays Indians share improved living standard new sense Malaysian identity pride. This year Mahathir's year triumph, perhaps paving way retirement, inauguration huge public work project impressive gathering foreign leader sportsman. But today, dizzying turnaround, Malaysia Asia's critical list, economy teetering edge disaster stability shaken seems entirely avoidable political cat fight. Last month, Mahathir dismissed arrested deputy heir apparent, Anwar Ibrahim, 51, accusing corruption illegal sex act. The move set street demonstration aroused international condemnation, particularly Anwar's many friend foreign government. One region's stable prosperous nation suddenly uproar. It appears Indonesia, Thailand, Japan South Korea, pressure economic collapse spawned political crisis. In nation, result change leadership. The question is: Is Mahathir next? The answer far clear. Unlike Indonesia, little evidence simmering discontent Malaysia. The ouster former President Suharto Indonesia predicted many people. Almost one seems foreseen eruption here. Malaysia familiar political demonstration. Unlike Indonesians, Malaysians rarely riot. Many people puzzled disturbed encountered water cannon riot police street recent week. What we're seeing unprecedented, said Ambassador John Malott United States. This never happened Malaysia, nobody know going go. You write lot scenario totally uncharted water. Mahathir, confident nation-builder, seems flailing watch legacy crumble. An economy growing 8 percent year last decade headed contraction perhaps 6 percent. Angry frustrated, closed Malaysia international financial market one month ago, turning back foreign investor embraced fueled country's rapid growth. The move intended effect bringing home Malaysian currency, insulating speculator Mahathir blame crisis, giving adrenaline jolt self-contained economy.

The harshness move unleashed surge largely unsuspected discontent mobilized Anwar's motley fellow constituencies: liberal democrat, young professional politically assertive Muslims. For first time decade, Malaysians thousand demonstrated street mosque met tear gas water cannon. Many people beaten hundred detained, although later released. With emergence still-tentative opposition movement, fear expressed one Western diplomat downward spiral suppression breed discontent breed suppression breed discontent. People whisper Mahathir's day may numbered. But venture guess number might be. Given control lever power lack focus leadership opposition, Mahathir could ride storm Anwar's trial proceeds. But struck harsh blow morale nation, sense confidence worked hard build slogan Malaysia Can! In generally decorous nation, depth anger expressed two men called father son disturbing hear. Anwar, say prime minister, despicable sodomist. Mahathir, say former deputy, senile insane. Malaysians, stolidly accepted Mahathir's authoritarian rule mixture gratitude emerging pride, seem stunned. Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad said Friday choosy successor. The man need necessarily religious preoccupied virtuous deed time, national news agency, Bernama, quoted Mahathir saying Friday prayer Al-Falah Mosque northern town Jitra Kedah state.

Under NATO threat end punishing offensive ethnic Albanian separatist Kosovo, President Slobodan Milosevic Yugoslavia ordered unit army back barrack may well avoid attack alliance, military observer diplomat say. Milosevic, one hand excoriated Washington scourge Kosovo yet hand treated key peace Bosnia, acted European Union, NATO United Nations prepared review Monday possible military intervention. Russia stepped warning action dispatched foreign defense minister unusually high-level mission see Yugoslav president Sunday Belgrade. As often, Milosevic appears bowed foreign demand nick time yet still accomplished wanted. This weekend, foreign diplomatic observer Kosovo reported military stand-down taken place province, Milosevic's force waged fierce offensive Albanian rebel. The observer said except segment three brigade, unit Yugoslav army home. The daily report observer mission, made U.S., European Union Russian military expert, one key element helping Washington European capital decide whether Milosevic met demand cease-fire. By putting army back barrack, sending police unit Kosovo ordering end burning looting village, Milosevic may well avoid NATO attack, diplomat Washington said. But time, acknowledge NATO looked way, enjoyed three-month license overwhelm Kosovo Liberation Army rebel army fighting independence Kosovo ethnic Albanian majority terrorize rural civilian population support it. His military operation created 250,000 refugee, Clinton administration gearing take care winter variety relief organization. US. official said expected Richard Holbrooke, US. envoy dealt Milosevic negotiating end war Bosnia, meet Monday discus political plan Kosovo. The heart disagreement Kosovo Serbia, Yugoslavia's principal republic, insists keeping Kosovo province, ethnic Albanians chafed Milosevic's repression since stripped province virtual autonomy 1989, seek independence. The West, fearing precedent independence Kosovo would set conflict world, trying mediate middle course. In essence, diplomat said believed plan Holbrooke present Milosevic call three-year interim period leading status fairly close pre-1989 autonomy arrangement. Since Kosovo conflict flared March, critic Washington's policy toward Milosevic argue able choreograph every move suit goal: pushing Albanian population submission impunity. The United States ally waited four month cleaned clock Kosovo Liberation Army, said Morton Abramowitz, head International Crisis Group, policy analysis organization, taken three week discus military action, result 500 Albanian village destroyed. Administration official acknowledge NATO failed live earlier threat June strike Serbia, Milosevic took advantage indecision plunged ahead artillery tank offensive lightly armed guerrilla force, whose bedrock popular support helped win effective control large swath Kosovo territory, including key road. While that, Milosevic skillfully managed key requirement Washington: made sure war spill neighboring Albania Macedonia, fragile country traditionally volatile area. All along, biggest fear Washington Kosovo conflict would engulf neighboring country encourage Albania ethnic Albanian population Macedonia join cause. Such possibility raised specter new Balkans conflict three year peace secured Bosnia. Milosevic catered Washington's concern conflict contained. The Yugoslav army mined Kosovo's border Macedonia Albania, ensuring refugee could escape limiting route arm supply rebel. The Yugoslav leader also understood Washington unsure deal disorganized Albanian political leadership Kosovo unbending Kosovo Liberation Army, whose main chief hardened emigre returned Switzerland Germany. For example, Holbrooke persuaded Milosevic meet May Ibrahim Rugova, top Albanian political leader Kosovo, encounter turned little photo opportunity. For procedural breakthrough, Holbrooke recommended lifting ban foreign investment Serbia put place month before. After meeting Rugova, Milosevic stepped military operation Kosovo, forcing Washington reverse carry investment ban. In late June, Holbrooke met two self-styled Kosovo guerrilla commander province's western town Junik broke contact. Clinton administration official said time concerned NATO intervention would bolster separatist force. To try put best face situation, Washington worked Moscow get Milosevic accept presence international monitor would patrol Kosovo report military action. The monitor slow getting organized. By August, Yugoslav army, backed Serbian special police, full swing rebel burning looting village process, monitor found difficult gain access fighting. They drove roadblock, knew something going sound smoke, could precise. In recent day tank artillery withdrawn, access improved, monitor say. But area central Kosovo around Likovac Gornje Obrinje monitor ruled limit land mine road. The mine believed planted guerrilla. Gornje Obrinje site massacre 18 ethnic Albanian woman, child elderly people Sept. 26. A British reporter walked across field village Sunday said 10 mortar shell, apparently Serbian police Yugoslav army, fired village early Sunday afternoon. The Yugoslav army police force responsible vast majority atrocity Kosovo conflict, said report New York-based group Human Rights Watch, released Sunday. The report said rebel also violated law war taking civilian hostage carrying summary execution. But violation guerrilla lesser scale government abuse, author report, Fred Abrahams, concluded. The report focused called watershed conflict attack police force three ethnic Albanian village late February early March Drenica region central Kosovo. At least 83 people, including 24 woman child, killed attack, involved helicopter, artillery armored personnel carrier. In Yugoslav capital, Belgrade, four-hour drive north rolling countryside Kosovo's capital Pristina, Milosevic remains politically secure. That part, domestic critic say, diplomat like Holbrooke head U.N.refugee agency, Sadako Ogata, insist going see him, thus enhancing stature. The American envoy Richard Holbrooke met President Slobodan Milosevic Yugoslavia Monday night according American diplomat told take step pull back military Kosovo Province face NATO attack. Milosevic also told, diplomat said, insure roughly 250,000 ethnic Albanian refugee forced flee home fighting last six month allowed return home. Most refugee reluctant return many Serb police officer destroyed home village remain neighborhood. After delivering sternest message far Milosevic Kosovo conflict, Holbrooke said news conference NATO's military plan attacking Serbia moving ahead serious, intense sustained basis. Holbrooke's mission Milosevic described American diplomat die trip, added, We're serious juncture. Shortly Holbrooke's meeting Milosevic, Yugoslav leader issued defiant statement Serbian television said threat aggression outlined Holbrooke represented criminal act. Milosevic, rarely comment meeting foreign diplomat whose tough word cast unusually ominous tone, also said Holbrooke's position constituted support Albanian terrorist Albanian people. Milosevic apparently accusing Holbrooke supporting ethnic Albanian guerrilla Kosovo Liberation Army, fighting make Serbian province Kosovo independent nation. The Yugoslav leader added seven day skirmish military action. An American diplomat familiar theme Holbrooke planned stress Milosevic said expectation American envoy would walk Monday night agreement. Rather, point underscore Yugoslav leader make explicit expected him. It quite ultimatum, diplomat said, matter step taken show compliance. The essence Holbrooke's demand centered issue outlined United Nations Security Council resolution two week ago. The resolution ordered Milosevic withdraw extra army police force sent Kosovo deal guerrilla send back base military force normally stationed province. So far, American diplomat said, Milosevic withdrawn troop field barrack. Such move essential, American diplomat said, create conducive atmosphere possible negotiation future status province. The UN. resolution also call political solution. Holbrooke US. ambassador Macedonia, Christopher Hill, discussed Milosevic political document drawn State Department call broad autonomy Kosovo. Milosevic withdrew autonomy 1989 began campaign Serb nationalism. The countryside central Kosovo eerily silent since last Thursday. The sound artillery thud mortar round noticeably absent coil white smoke signified burning village vanished green hill valley. Police checkpoint relaxed area sealed time last week Yugoslav army open patrol diplomatic monitor United States, European Union Russia. These monitor, many former military officer, reported Yugoslav army stood seen virtually military action since late last week. There sporadic shooting, monitor reported. But superficial calm good enough Serb military capacity resume fighting quickly, NATO military officer said Monday. The officer added cease-fire Kosovo pretty much enacted. He also said trend toward compliance positive. The interior ministry police must also reduce presence around village refugee fled confidence return, military officer said. Some interior ministry police officer left province, enough, added. On question badly damaged KLA Yugoslav army's three-month offensive, NATO officer said, It's fair assessment KLA dismantled destroyed. Holbrooke's first stop Monday Brussels, met secretary-general NATO, Javier Solana.

Hunger malnutrition Cambodia reaching crisis level comparable effect famine North Korea, UN. World Food Program representative said Tuesday. Though North Korea suffering simple lack food, faltering economy Cambodia combined weak health care education causing similar level malnutrition child, said Ken Davies, WFP's country director. There enough rice. The problem people poor access it. The problem poverty, Davies said. The WFP currently supporting 1.7 million hungry Cambodians 15 percent population food-for-work direct assistance program, Davies said fear still plenty getting enough eat every day. The problem bad little worse North Korea, Davies said. The situation much worse people recognize. According recent WFP survey, 49 percent Cambodian child age 5 stunted lack food 20 percent suffer acute malnutrition. By comparison, similar survey North Korean child 7 found 65 percent stunted 16 percent suffer acute malnutrition. Cambodia produced rice surplus export last two year expects another year, WFP statistic show 25 percent rice-growing area account 75 percent surplus. The majority Cambodian farmer producing enough keep family fed increasingly saddled debt incurred run reserve harvest, Davies said. Money-lenders rural Cambodia typically charge 100 percent interest, must paid rice harvest time, giving many farmer handicapped start next crop season. Poor sanitation, lack health care ignorance modern child rearing problem left mostly unaddressed under-funded health education sector Cambodia exacerbated food security problem, Davies said. Davies urged new government substantially increase annual expenditure health, education rural development first step long-term solution Cambodia's food crisis. The poverty getting worse right situation malnutrition child crisis, Davies said. Cambodia typically earmark half annual budget defense security. In 1998 budget, education allocated 6.5 percent, health 4.4 percent rural development 0.2 percent. Actual disbursement three ministry often 60 70 percent budgeted amount annual revenue fall short expectation, according aid worker. A 1999 budget draft proposed reduction health ministry's allotment, caused outcry September health official UN. World Health Program. The draft later readjusted provide unprecedented 33 percent increase health spending. North Korea entering fourth winter chronic food shortage people malnourished risk dying normally curable illness, senior Red Cross official said Tuesday. The official warned international complacency hostility toward North Korea food crisis stretch isolated communist country show little willingness adopt far-reaching change revive ruined economy. Humanitarian suffering cannot routine part world, said Margareta Wahlstrom, Red Cross' undersecretary disaster relief, returned Beijing Tuesday week inspecting aid agency's operation North Korea. She Red Cross official saw ravage North Korea's slow-motion famine: electricity supplied half capital, Pyongyang, time; elderly looking swollen, sign long-term hunger; generation child stunted, 10-year-olds looking like 6-year-olds 5-year-olds like 2-year-olds. Everywhere, bakery government ministry, people served noodle cake made soybean mixed acorn, grass herb, Red Cross president Astrid Heiberg said. Heiberg likened additive cattle food noted doctor reported rise stomach illness mixture. This really part daily life, said. You would give child elderly mother knowing would get cramp stomach diarrhea unless stomach moaning. Three year flood drought started 1995 devastated North Korea's collective farming planned economy, already teetering loss Soviet bloc trading partner. With good money barter buy foreign supply, country lack sufficient fertilizer crop, fuel part machinery. The Red Cross inspector saw soldier people harvesting cabbage, winter's main vegetable. The grain harvest finished UN. estimate little improved last year's: 3 million ton, enough meet two-thirds need North Korea's 22 million people. As long, harsh winter begin, doctor confirm official statistic show widespread malnutrition, tuberculosis rise hunger-weakened patient unable recover operation sickness, Heiberg said. Doctors worry respiratory illness common winter may take toll weakened population, said. One 10-bed hospital countryside keeping three patient time food care more, said Heiberg.

It sent 18 athlete official Winter Olympics Nagano, Japan, February. Naewoe run South Korea's main government intelligence agency specializes monitoring communist news medium. Three year flood drought started 1995 devastated North Korea's collective farming planned economy, forcing country rely outside aid feed 23 million people. Famine-threatened North Korea's harvest better year last could worse, senior UN. aid official said Saturday. North Korea need minimum 4.5 million 5 million ton grain feed 23 million people, managed last year harvest 2.8 million ton, Namanga Ngongi, deputy head World Food Program said. Although hard figure yet available, prospect year harvest better, Ngongi told reporter Beijing visiting North Korea. It may worse last year. Poor harvest, economic collapse three year flood drought, produced chronic food shortage North Korea left heavily reliant foreign aid. Fertilizer lacking, fuel power tractor farm machinery, meaning planting harvesting must done hand. Every year get worse, Ngongi said. But despite need food aid, Ngongi said government month ago cut number county WFP access 171 145, reducing number people get aid 6.7 million 5.8 million. Most receiving WFP aid child aged 6 month 6 year. Ngongi said government cited security concern notably lack peace treaty rival South Korea decision. The government said ban would temporary, Ngongi added. Ngongi, spent four day inspecting WFP relief effort North Korea, said people generally looked better visit last year. But also said could see large part population weak. Everybody consuming low level. So may severely malnourished, well nourished all, said. US. official toured hardest-hit region North Korea summer said 2 million people may died famine. Ngongi said saw malnourished child said 10 11 year old, appeared 4 5 year old. About 30 percent child one primary school visited class. A lot child weak come school, said. But Ngongi said foreign food aid saved life. A lot people alive today thanks international community's support, said. A congressman visited remote part North Korea last week said Saturday food health situation desperate deteriorating, million North Koreans might starved death last year. The congressman, Tony Hall, D-Ohio, longtime interest world hunger, passed Tokyo return United States showed photograph taken North Korean child patchy hair, protruding bone, open sore sign severe malnutrition. Hall also brought back bag official called substitute food distributed government food station: dried leaf straw, coarse even cattle would normally turn away. They grind powder make noodle, Hall said. The noodle nutrition indigestible, leaving people holding aching stomach, said. North Korea admitted facing serious economic difficulty, sharply diverging assessment serious are. Some visitor United Nations organization said food situation seems bit better year two ago. Hall said divergence might arisen North Korean capital, Pyongyang, life seem slightly better three previous trip North Korea. But rural area foreigner often allowed visit, added, overall situation worse ever. Based visit four hospital, Hall also emphasized public health care declined sharply. In one hospital, assistant holding patient surgeon conducted stomach operation without electric light anesthesia. Ordinary North Koreans suffering, part, government's hard-line policy alienated would-be donor aid agency. The United Nations repeatedly appealed relief aid North Korea, latest appeal raised le one-third target. In September, Doctors Without Borders announced pulling staff 13 North Korea feared aid going politically connected rather needy. North Korea release mortality figure health statistic, Hall said United Nations gathered would soon release data indicating 30 percent North Korean child age 2 acutely malnourished 67 percent child physically stunted. Hall said thought overall least 1 million people died total probably closer 3 million. In indication seriousness professional demographer view situation, US. Bureau Census recently published estimate suggesting North Korea's population peaked 1995 21.55 million since fallen 21.23 million year. That would decline 320,000 three year, period North Korea's population would expected grow 925,000 people, based population growth rate early 1990s. Nicholas Eberstadt, American specialist North Korean population figure, say simply enough hard information estimate death toll famine. But note one political tidbit: North Korea's constitution stipulates one delegate country's people's assembly every 30,000 citizen. This year's assembly expand previous one did, rather 687 delegate, previous assembly held 1990. While Eberstadt counsel caution, could mean North Korea's population, eight year expected add several million people, back 20.6 million people fewer. The United States supplying grain North Korea, strain growing secret underground complex North expert worry may heart new nuclear weapon program. The United States warned last week agreed framework basis relation North Korea jeopardy unless North let American expert visit underground complex resolve doubt. North Korea said show complex Washington promise complex nuclear one, pay vilifying u impairing prestige. Washington refuse pay, North Korea warning standoff could lead agreement fall apart. Their shameless wicked demand open infringement upon sovereignty wanton interference internal affair, declared North Korea's leading newspaper, Rodong Sinmun. More five year severe food shortage near-total breakdown public health system led devastating malnutrition North Korea probably left entire generation child physically mentally impaired, new study international aid group found. The study, first scientific nutritional survey North Korea, confirms disturbing report international aid worker, past year gained increasing access population highly isolated secretive country. Among shocking finding, researcher World Food Program, Unicef European Union found that, long-term food shortage, staggering 62 percent child 7 year old suffer stunted growth. They discovered that, despite huge international food aid program past three year, severe malnutrition widespread among toddler crucial stage brain development, suggesting generation's physical mental ability develop normally loss never recovered. Separately, international medical worker group like Red Cross, begun document effect food shortage severely compounded breakdown public health service. Even basic water purification system stand idle lack essential ingredient like chlorine, Red Cross worker say, leaving vast number people severe diarrhea unable absorb completely little food have. As North Korean dictatorship slowly, often grudgingly, granted increased access international aid group last six month, increasingly clear saddening picture hunger haas emerged result large formal study informal survey observation foreign aid agency. Past assessment magnitude disaster country 23 million considered flawed based interview small number North Korean refugee fled China. And researcher aid worker ground North Korea seen evidence cannibalism starving child dying roadside description surfaced lurid refugee report find many way equally disturbing: A population withering nearly decade chronic hunger, people weakened malnutrition cold stomach flu quickly turn lethal, future generation irretrievably lost. Now last hard fact situation grave, said Judith Cheng-Hopkins, regional director Asia World Food Program, taken part research. To famine slow motion. People cope year year, probably lot drop off. But totality hard gauge. For three week fall, crew led foreign scientist finally permitted fan across North Korea conduct first random sample nutritional survey child, providing far solid data crisis. They found 62 percent child 7 stunted growth, symptom long-term malnutrition. Thirty percent 1-year-olds suffered moderate severe malnutrition. This mean high likelihood impaired mental physical development, nervous system matures dramatically essential first year. The researcher said available scientific data suggest 10 year ago, malnutrition rare North Korea. Even situation improves, unlikely improve degree country fully recover saw, said Judit Katona-Apte, senior program adviser World Food Program. People small well developed otherwise somewhat limited mental capacity. Likewise, Red Cross representative year tested water supply 840 hospital clinic operate, found one water suitable human consumption, said Sten Swedlund, head Red Cross delegation North Korea. But course drink choice, said recent trip Beijing. There close relationship problem caused lack food health sector that's bad shape. Virtually child 7 malnourished also diarrhea, said. None aid group able study issue hunger-related death, North Koreans released relevant figure, although expert agree probably one million perhaps many three million died prematurely since food shortage began. But public health expert say number perished might difficult tally case, death probably quick starvation, immune system weakened year hunger, common cold easily give way lethal pneumonia ordinary bout infectious diarrhea prof fatal. Still, disturbing clues: In one limited study conducted World Food Program group last year 4,000 child hand-picked government, 10 percent parent dead. In fall's independent nutritional survey, 18 team expert sent eight North Korea's nine province looked 1,800 rural urban child seven. In addition finding 62 percent child stunted growth, team found 16 percent child suffering acute malnutrition underweight height, sign severely underfed time study. That figure higher country East Asia put North Korea among world's worst 10 country term malnutrition. While 16 percent figure quite bad India Bangladesh, worst world 18 percent malnutrition rate, expert say North Korea's number way understates problem. In India Bangladesh, pocket severe poverty alternate pocket relative plenty, North Korea whole country degree underfed. Even war-torn country, famine pocket, Dr. Katona-Apte said. It's hard think another country that's affected way. The survey result especially sobering since researcher studied child 7, group received nearly food donated abroad. After three year food donation, many foreign aid worker country remarked child nursery kindergarten looking better older sibling failing. So month ago, World Food Program began providing elementary school high nutrition biscuit child aged 7 12. We reason believe many people suffering elderly neglected age group getting weaker weaker, Swedlund said. There 100 Westerners living Pyongyang, capital city, many say long-term hunger readily apparent there. If walk street Pyongyang ask child old is, usually three year, Swedlund said. She may 7 look 3 4. Dr. Katona-Apte, nutrition expert worked Bangladesh Sudan, said shocked first visited North Korean kindergarten last year. There two child sitting desk obviously severely malnourished thin patchy hair, said. And sitting working. This accepted normal! They school, really hospitalized placed nutritional rehabilitation. If saw refugee camp, would recommend immediate intervention. But severely depleted public health hospital system, option exist, others said. Many Korean doctor know diagnose treat malnutrition; seen decade. And, case, hospital lack food proper nutritional supplement. Swedlund said hospital lacked medicine, glass replace broken window colder inside out, received coal since 1994. He said even hospital, sanitation water purification system virtually nonexistent, country lack chlorine purification fuel run water pump. He said next year, Red Cross would start address problem, spending $3.5 food hospital patient $1 million water treatment. With option, vast number North Koreans resorted eating substitute food, hard cake noodle made mix nutritional plant, like soybean sweet potato, combined indigestible filler, like cornstalk straw. This constitutes 40 percent food intake, Swedlund said. It's becoming regular part food basket. Doctors North Korea say many people suffer stomachache eating partly indigestible material, said, added, If hungry, fill stomach. Although North Koreans date food problem series flood drought mid-1990's, foreign researcher worked North Korea say medical record childhood growth pattern indicate hunger began several year linked collapse Soviet Union, long North Korea's main supplier food, fuel fertilizer. North Korea mountainous country, le 20 percent arable land. It food importer decade, mostly former Soviet Union, also China. The country come grip fact part structural problem can't blamed weather anymore, Ms. Cheng-Hopkins said. Still, others praised normally rigid secretive government slowly loosening restriction. Swedlund said three year country, international Red Cross, collaborates North Korean Red Cross, found official increasingly responsive doctor willing share medical record bring problem. Travel still restricted. There 100 county, home 30 percent population, aid group access therefore refused provide food medical supply. Still, number county open worker increased steadily, freedom move improved. Ms. Cheng-Hopkins said half follow-up inspection unannounced, noted researcher nutritional survey allowed select village visit enter home random. Workers Red Cross World Food Program said observed extreme scene people dying acute starvation believe would occurring frequently. I seen acute starvation like I seen Bangladesh, Dr. Katona-Apte said. But mean can't exist. We're still really limited see. Swedlund said unlikely county still closed foreigner markedly different open one. And surmised closed county might harbor pocket death devastation, said accepted North Korea's explanation excluded area national security reason. One thing I've learned important national security issue North Koreans, said Swedlund, retired admiral Swedish Navy. And I really think area important standpoint, added, going map closed area describing Western intelligence expert know military installation there. He also rejected notion North Korean military stealing donated food, charge leveled organization Doctors Without Borders, angrily pulled North Korea last summer protest many restriction group working there. Now aid group say starting get somewhat better cooperation North Koreans, hope repeat nutrition survey every 6 12 month. And still analyzing tantalizing findings: Boys twice likely suffer stunted growth girl, every child whose mother dead malnourished. A generation North Korean child already scarred life, said Astrid Heiberg, president International Federation Red Cross Red Crescent Societies, interview Beijing trip North Korea. We need continue mobilize resource prevent even greater catastrophe. The founder South Korea's largest conglomerate plan visit native North Korea next week gift 501 cattle, company official said Thursday. The visit delayed month dispute 500 cattle donated Chung Ju-yung, founder Hyundai group, trip North June. North Korea claimed 71 cattle died Seoul government agent force-fed indigestible vinyl strip lump rope shipping North. Calling North's claim nonsense, Seoul's Ministry National Unification ordered Hyundai check thousand cattle raised ranch west coast. The ministry later acknowledged lump rope found stomach cattle ranch, said material kill animal donated North Korea. It blamed death stress caused long shipment truck North. The South Korean government said would authorize second shipment cattle unless North retracted accusation. On Thursday, South Korean Unification Minister Kang In-duk said North Korea sent letter Hyundai last week, saying misunderstanding southern authority issue dead cattle cleared. Kang said North's letter cleared stumbling block Hyundai's additional cattle donation. During visit, Chung expected reach agreement detail Hyundai's plan start sightseeing tour scenic mountain North. The tour, originally scheduled begin September, delayed cost, security matter. Hyundai hope send ship 2,000 tourist week four-day tour Diamond Mountain North's east coast beginning November. Animosity distrust two Koreas run deep. The Korean state separated communist North capitalist South 1945. They fought three-year war early 1950s. Years food shortage stunted growth million North Korean child, two-thirds child age seven suffering malnourishment, UN. expert said Wednesday. Several year flooding drought coupled economic downturn heavily damaged North Korea's crop production capacity import food closed, communist nation. A survey carried September October also showed 16 percent child North Korea acutely malnourished, body weight low height. That figure, reflects ongoing shortage, exceeded Asia Bangladesh, India Sri Lanka. Eighteen team, headed foreign official World Food Program, UN. Children's Fund European Union, carried study. They measured weight height 1,800 North Korean child infant age seven home randomly selected area aid agency access. Those area cover around 70 percent population. It first technically sound survey problem, UNICEF official Kirsi Madi told reporter. The alarming finding toddler aged one two, 30 percent acutely malnourished. At age, malnutrition permanently impair physical intellectual growth, said Judy Cheng-Hopkins, WFP director region. Children North Korea's three largest city Pyongyang, Wonsan Nampo better counterpart elsewhere, 11 percent acutely malnourished. Boys almost twice badly affected girl.

24,"This Newt Gingrich supposed well. The planning. The strategy. The big picture. The vision. His vision brought GOP majority Congress 1994 made first Republican House Speaker 40 year. But admission, Gingrich's vision seems blurred time around, costing Republicans net five seat Tuesday's election leaving party's narrow governing majority even narrower. The disappointing election result also left Gingrich open fractious challenge post speaker. Members aide said Wednesday fury speaker bubbled overnight member trying organize slate candidate replace Gingrich leadership team House Republicans convene Nov. 18 select leader next year. As Rep. Mark Sanford, R-S.C., put it, When company's stock price go down, usually CEO get fired. Top Republican aide, speaking anonymously, even blunter. People angry last night, one aide said. Today mixture seething dismay. It's ugly. And Newt know it. His career line. Another aide said, Most people really angry Newt, one know it. But dipping toe water seeing temperature is. A possible slate could contain name Reps. Robert L. Livingston Louisiana replace Gingrich, Steve Largent Oklahoma replace Dick Armey Texas majority leader, Jennifer Dunn Washington replace John A. Boehner Ohio conference chairman. Rep. David M. McIntosh Indiana also said considering run speaker, clear whether would part slate. Rep. Tom DeLay Texas, majority whip, said secure. Armey bluntly acknowledged scramble going wing oust leadership. Told Nightline Republicans head, Armey replied: They're welcome they're big enough take it. Publicly, Gingrich expressed confidence keeping job speaker. But grim-faced last 24 hour closeted Wednesday top strategist making call shore support among member. He look like victim accident, said Rep. Peter King, R-N.Y., support Gingrich. He's somber tone. The question, always Gingrich, many member prepared rebel leadership. In past, couple dozen member openly expressed dissatisfaction him, coup attempt last year fizzled lack support. I'm hoping people understand need serious reassessment year, said Rep. Charles T. Canady, R-Fla., said hoped challenge speaker 1996 election, Republicans also lost seat. The reality this: Our majority keep shrinking, Canady said. If shrink more, gone. But Gingrich built support among moderate, perceived election repudiation conservative. Rep. Sherwood L. Boehlert, R-Utah, said result showed right direction party. To maintain majority, we've got moderate view, Boehlert said. Thomas Mann, Congressional scholar Brookings Institution, said moderate supported Gingrich part appealing alternative emerged. They know see broader world prepared moderate make sense, Mann said. Newt's gone way support moderate. He's nurtured relationship them. But Mann others said anger building Gingrich several reason, including signing budget deal last month seemed capitulate President Clinton, offering clear legislative agenda Republicans communicating clear political message. We defined hate said Rep. Mark Souder, R-Ind. But voter sophisticated that, Republicans better something say we're going. The anger grew last day speaker approved $10-million anti-Clinton advertising campaign allowed Democrats turn election referendum Gingrich, never nearly popular public Clinton been. As slowly absorbing implication loss, speaker seemed unable news conference Wednesday morning pinpoint party suffered net drop five seat House. As late Tuesday afternoon, predicting net pickup 10 30. Until look better, I frankly understand thing happened yesterday, said, I'm sure anybody else country either. But said Republicans maniacally focused basic message cutting tax, saving Social Security preventing drug abuse, campaigned aggressively theme. He contrasted lack focus year Contract With America proved successful 1994. People thought stood something pretty big, said. But Gingrich also seemed aware mounting concern leadership, repeatedly casting election result victory leadership team Republicans stayed majority three election row first time 70 year. He also suggested would challenge little support. The people normally quoted people would fact take party narrower base, Gingrich said, referring periodic eruption concern among conservative leadership. I'd like see plan confident last 60 day would successful share it. An intense struggle control House underway, Rep. Bob Livingston conducting telephone campaign replace Rep. Newt Gingrich speaker Gingrich fighting counter-campaign given member pause ousting him. At time, small band Republicans vowed Thursday would vote re-elect Gingrich circumstance, move that, Republicans' shrunken House majority, could tie party knot month could throw speakership Democrat. Rep. Matt Salmon, R-Ariz., said: I personally made decision I cannot vote Newt Gingrich speaker January, six others told feel way, seven people not, take six deadlock vote. Fury speaker boiled since Tuesday's election, Republicans suffered net loss five seat House. They blamed Gingrich, party's chief strategist. But many already angry said failure articulate clear message party going election messy budget process gave President Clinton political edge contradicted Republican principle fiscal conservativism containing massive amount pork spending. House Republicans meet Nov. 18 vote secret ballot leader. Whoever win party's nomination speaker stand election full House January. Even Gingrich win secret ballot, could denied re-election speaker January Salmon least five others refuse vote him. Because Republicans control House 12 seat, would take six vote Gingrich deny majority allow Democrats potentially elect one speaker. With chaotic unacceptable prospect looming, Livingston told Gingrich step aside good party, according Republican official. The official said Livingston spoke Gingrich shortly disastrous election return also election, reflecting Livingston's earlier displeasure speaker budget process. Several Republicans said Livingston, chairman Appropriations Committee one member stature stand speaker, Gingrich working phone Thursday struggle vote. Livingston said nothing publicly challenge Gingrich, several member aide said Thursday would announce intention, possibly soon Friday, determined could win. He 'til duck row, right lot people still loyal speaker, said aide Republican who, like many others, trying straddle line fealty speaker may retain power encouragement challenger offer salve embattled party. Stunned Democratic resurgence mid-term election, congressional Republicans tore Wednesday blame failure make traditional opposition party gain off-year election. The soul-searching recrimination possibility congressional leadership challenge came election result showed Republicans unable increase 55-45 hold Senate Democrats picked five seat House. The Democratic surge marked first time since 1934 president's party gained seat midterm election, whittled Republican House majority mere six vote. The Democratic victory even remarkable political year marked months-long scandal President Clinton's affair Monica Lewinsky. The Republicans' new 223-211 majority (assuming Democrat leading Oregon hold win), one independent, amounted smallest congressional majority since Republican-controlled Congress 1953, last time Republicans controlled House captured 1994. With attention shifting House Judiciary Committee impeachment inquiry, Rep. Henry Hyde told fellow Republicans panel conference call Wednesday witness Republicans likely call would independent counsel, Kenneth Starr. Hyde, chairman, told lawmaker hoped committee vote possible article impeachment Thanksgiving, act would take issue hand put Gingrich's. Committee Democrats declined comment Wednesday could discus Hyde's plan among themselves. Trying put best face result, Speaker Newt Gingrich said Marietta, Ga., Republicans still held onto House three election row first time since election 1932. But furious rank file Republicans burned phone line other, discussing whether mount leadership challenge chamber next week. We've got reach southern white male running Washington Republican Party, said Rep. Joe Scarborough, conservative Florida. He said Republicans year left without accomplishment run on. We need agenda first all, said. We went entire calendar year without agenda. Rep. Chris Shays, moderate Connecticut called election devastating loss said simply, There going major change leadership. All segment party want see change. At White House, Clinton called election result vindication party's policy. If look result, said, clear unambiguous. The American people want business, concern, child, family, future addressed here. That's messag e election wa.

In public statement released Wednesday, Hyde said The Committee continues clear constituional duty complete work fair expeditious manner. Our duty changed becasue constitution changed. But Sen. Robert Torricelli, D-N.J., said election result guaranteed impeachment fail. I think serious effort remove President Clinton office effectively over, said. It simply Newt Gingrich Trent Lott decide exit strategy. From side aisle, Rep. Rick Lazio, Long Island Republican, said, The inquiry wrapped expeditiously, fairly ought resolved immediate future. For past year, Republicans struggled keep control House 228-207 majority find consensus among party's competing faction. With number reduced, Republican leadership need carry tortuous balancing act unite hard-core conservative faction want aggressive social agenda bloc moderate want party return center. Any small Republican faction enormous leverage. The new arithmetic House may even lead Democrats' moderate Republicans' forming ad hoc majority issue, taking control away Republican leader. Already seeing possibility, Rep. Peter King Long Island, N.Y., said northeastern Republicans would strengthened. It give u much leverage leadership make easier protect New York, said. It's going weaken position strident conservative anti-northeast conservative. Just two week ago, Gingrich foreseen election gain ranging 10 seat 40.

I mean I totally underestimated degree people would get sick 24-hour-a day talk television talk radio degree whole scandal became sort disgusting sheer repetition, said. And result I think probably underestimated need really aggressively push much stronger message cutting tax saving Social Security, winning war drug, reforming education national defense. Majority Leader Sen. Trent Lott Mississippi also admitted mistake, saying party presented clear enough message final 96 hour campaign. He also conceded Congress' final scramble pas $500 billion budget bill hurt party. One lesson Republicans need listen carefully people need clear understanding concise message apply across nation, said Washington. Both Lott Gingrich said Republicans would put emphasis next year tax-cutting shoring Social Security system. Even two leader spoke, angry rank-and-file lawmaker making phone call trying ass whether mount challenge Republican leader steered Congress since Republican's assumed control four year ago.

And Gingrich gone way identify Republican campaign's last-minute ad blitz attacking President Clinton, caucus know responsible. Gingrich faced uprising before, foiling coup attempt disgruntled conservative leadership team summer 1997. Any move remove remains long-shot. But House leadership election set mid-November, Republicans said time dissatisfaction caucus crossed ideological line moderate like Shays well. We got shellacked, said Rep.

A week White House congressional Democrats disavowed war Speaker Newt Gingrich, James Carville, President Clinton's former campaign strategist chief outside defender, put forth new battle cry Wednesday: He muzzled. Not that, Carville went beyond customary denunciation Gingrich Republicans and, interview, trained fire leader party sufficiently aggressive four week Election Day. My sense frustration I believe Democrats much better chance much better anyone expects, Carville said. And I think anyone's emerging try pull together. Everybody ought pushing, leadership Congress, White House, DNC. We ought hammer Gingrich every day. How take Congress back make case people running it? I never heard strategy like that. Sounding increasingly agitated, went on: The people left activated election Democrats. The right wing, they're bouncing wall. They're going vote. Rep. Dick Gephardt, minority leader, complained Erskine Bowles, White House chief staff, Carville appeared NBC News program Meet Press Sept. 27 declared, Cpl. Cue Ball Carville rolling battle Newt Gingrich. The concern among House Democrats, one expressed White House official well, Carville's vitriol would make Democrats appear overly partisan could especially damaging Democrats marginal district want appear easy president. But Wednesday, Carville anything timid. If Gephardt people think they've quieted down, said, I'm quieted. Carville said told official White House, Don't waste breath calling telling say this. Carville insisted would rather battle Republicans fellow Democrats. If want fight me, can, said. I'm going fight Republicans. Yet could help ridicule party. Asked describe Democrats' strategy election, Carville said, If one, one's shared me. Just four year ago, good bet Newt Gingrich would pivotal figure US. politics turn millennium. Seemingly overnight taken moribund minority party turned pumped-up, issue-driven House majority. With promise balance budget, end welfare represent conservative social value, appeared rearranged political map Congress Ronald Reagan done presidency. But Gingrich's leadership shaky even maintains hold speaker's office, danger marginalization. A change dramatic suggests something far profound miscalculation election tactic. What looked like one major realignments US. political history might turn nothing temporary shift. The Gingrich revolution fueled anger, revolt white working-class Americans perceived Democratic bias favor black minority, middle-class rejection politics big government big deficit. They resentment Ronald Reagan exploited successfully. But old political habit moribund Republican leadership allowed Democrats retain control Congress throughout 1980s, turned Reagan's economic program undisciplined tax-cutting spree created prosperity along huge budget gap. Gingrich's attention-grabbing rhetoric, energy talent political organization finally took Reagan's formula success congressional election 1994. But power, ran head Bill Clinton, whose political instinct even better. The president co-opted part Contract With America, particularly balanced budget welfare reform. He adapted Republican social message call thing like school uniform television rating system, symbolized responsibility parental control without supporting government intrusion private life. The Republican right's genuine contempt Clinton based part well-known flaw president's character. But mainly reaction ease diverted supposed flood tide revolution. They expected genuine success Gingrich's first year office would lead still larger victory minimal government tax, unfettered free enterprise return conservative Christian value. But public happy led another direction, focus concern aging baby boomer health care Social Security. The government seen enemy issue budgetary looked like potential ally. Back 1994, party stunned sudden change congressional fortune may overestimated meant. In particular may realized quickly good economic time, drop crime national welfare reform could blunt power race US. politics. The Democrats become literally minority party white voter resentfully identified policy city, black immigrant. But last week union worker Catholics returned Democratic fold. Without race wedge issue, solid black Democratic vote became powerful advantage key state. Blacks, woman Latinos angry Republican anti-immigration initiative winning coalition California, North Carolina New York. The speaker right say election expected. There may indeed Republican majority America, appears resemble Republicanism Dwight Eisenhower rather Newt Gingrich pro-business, wary debt inherent distaste bringing messy social issue like abortion. The Republicans begun talking compassionate conservatism politics inclusion may peddling political mush, peddled victory Tuesday. The congressional Republican Party's long sojourn wilderness House minority may left accustomed opposition figure for, attached politics anger make sense nation mood moderation. Gingrich suggested mistake let Republicans drift along politics impeachment almost maniacally focused thing like tax cut. But looking maniacal got trouble first place. Winning control Congress many year tough Gingrich 1994. But ten time tougher forge politics depend rage. House Speaker Newt Gingrich, orchestrated Republican revolution recent year overseeing impeachment inquiry President Clinton, driven office Friday party swiftly turned unexpected loss Tuesday's midterm election. Catching virtually everyone Capitol Hill surprise, Gingrich announced Friday night two conference call Republicans would seek re-election Speaker Nov. 18 vote would leave Congress altogether term expires January. This give u chance purge poison system, Gingrich said, according party aide listened one call. Gingrich's resignation stunning reversal one combative personally confrontational politician America. He made name decade ago bringing one Democratic speaker, Jim Wright, continued assaultive style Tuesday's election last-minute commercial reminding voter Clinton scandal. His reflexive pugilistic response evident even Friday night. In second conference call, according several people listened, Gingrich blamed House conservative downfall. Although revolutionary zeal harnessed take control Congress 1994, become bitter critic last two year tumultuous speakership. Friday night called cannibal blackmailed quitting. Rep. Michael P. Forbes, R-N.Y., said: Newt said marginalized Republican Party engaged cannibalism. He said, `Refer clips.' He's blaming others. Another Republican described conference call way: He started statesmanlike, could see anger building. When someone asked leaving, said, `A handful member blackmailed conference.' He said, `They're hateful.' And said, `They're cannibals.' Gingrich announced move hour Rep. Robert L. Livingston Louisiana announced running speaker, putting forward pragmatist manager. After Gingrich call, Rep. Bill Archer Texas announced considering run speaker. Livingston Archer chairman two powerful committee House. In statement Gingrich said, The Republican conference need unified, time move forward. He said hoped colleague would pick successor reconcile discipline, work together communicate effectively. Referring wife, told colleague resigning Congress Marianne I tired. We need time get know again. He also acknowledged knack bringing negative attention party. If I stay, told colleague Friday night, controversial nature would overshadow success might have, understatement recalled suggestion two year ago forced shutdown government miffed sit back Air Force One trip President Clinton. According another Republican took note, Gingrich said resignation: There lot bitterness amongst member. So long I around, I always target news medium, would mean would never able get message out. Clinton said: Newt Gingrich worthy adversary leading Republican Party majority House joining great national debate best prepare America 21st century. Despite profound difference, I appreciate time able work together national interest, especially Speaker Gingrich's strong support America's continuing leadership freedom, peace prosperity world. Many Republicans took opportunity portray Gingrich visionary. Rep. Sherwood Boehlert New York said first conference call, shock surprise strong expression appreciation leading u Promised Land. His supporter said Gingrich vote win election nominate speaker, conducted secret ballot. But, agreed, party's slim, six-vote majority meant every vote would battle. Kenneth Duberstein, former official Reagan administration, said, I doubt vote speaker, I'm sure vote govern. He said deep rift party, Gingrich would able implement plan. In unusually biting reaction, Rep. Dick Gephardt Missouri, Democratic leader, said hoped Gingrich's resignation would clear fierce partisan air fostered. I hope whoever succeeds Newt Gingrich speaker immediately begin process repairing damage wrought institution last four year, Gephardt said. House Republicans predicted Gingrich's resignation would set wide-ranging hectic scramble replace anticipated. There lot pretender throne test water, said Boehlert, supported Gingrich re-election speaker. There shortage candidate. The presidential campaign 2000 began Wednesday, like not. The millennial election fought political playing field whose rough outline, exact boundary, drawn voter Tuesday's election, delivered crushing disappointment giddy hope Republicans unexpected elixir recently ailing Democrats. President Clinton called astonishing triumph issue investigation said Democrats many major victory clear message. Republicans agreed. Of course next 18 month bring many surprise many reversal fortune. But election result offered important guideline. Tuesday great day Vice President Al Gore, least three reason. He worked furiously successfully last ten day balloting persuade Democratic loyalist stay home sulk, appearing behalf fewer 224 candidate, according office. A moderate within spectrum party, watched moderate win crucial election, notably California gubernatorial race, Lt. Gov. Gray Davis, cautious pragmatist like Gore, smashing victory. The return even break Senate Democratic gain five House Representatives also made impeachment President Clinton le likely. And better shape Clinton term end, better chance Gore, sidekick six year now, stand presidential nomination process and, ultimately, election. But California voter also complicated nominating process set Gore strategist work tactic uncomplicate it, consider state absolutely central presidential aspiration. In referendum 1996, California adopted primary system Republicans, Democrats independent voter would receive ballot, candidate party listed. That violates rule major party, measure ballot Tuesday, Proposition 3, would rescinded 1996 change. But failed, raising possibility California's March 7 primary mere political popularity poll, convention delegate chosen caucus convention nightmare. Tuesday bad day Republican right. High-profile right-winger lost across country, Attorney General Dan Lungren California governor's race Sen. Lauch Faircloth, denied re-election North Carolina, Rep. Mark Neumann Wisconsin, failed Senate race despite huge spending advantage Sen. Russell Feingold, Ellen Sauerbrey Maryland, proved unable second try prevail unpopular Democratic governor, Parris Glendening. Both conservative moderate party said Republicans get back basic. Even Speaker Newt Gingrich conceded result sober every Republican called new strategic thinking. If make referendum president 67 per cent approval rating, tried do, surprised election go you, said Gov. Tom Ridge Pennsylvania, moderate whose promoter mention weekly possible vice-presidential nominee. Sen. John McCain Arizona, conservative tends steer away divisive social issue, re-election 68 per cent vote. He studying possibility presidential race, Republican nominee hope win, said interview Wednesday, congressional Republicans leader need learn lesson. I hope debacle wake-up call people, said. You've got something smaller government, better education, something. We're seen party that's everything. Polls taken late year's campaign bore McCain out. They showed Republicans longer identified issue electoral bread butter, low tax law order. Tuesday also fresh demonstration, anyone needed one, political utility pitching tent big enough almost everyone. Black politician North Carolina, Maryland California reported fear indifferent black turnout proved groundless. Black vote proved indispensable considerable number hard-pressed Democratic candidate, especially felt interest directly threatened. The figure Hispanic voting, assembled exit poll candidates' precinct analysis, showed dramatic difference. In California, outgoing Republican governor, Pete Wilson, played anti-immigration card vengeance, major Democratic candidate Davis Sen. Barbara Boxer, re-election trailing early poll cleaned among Hispanic voter. He took 78 percent, 72. But Bush brother, Jeb Florida George W. Texas, took half Hispanic vote highly successful gubernatorial campaign. So McCain. Jeb Bush married Hispanic woman, brother speak Spanish fluently frequently, Senator McCain long espoused Hispanic cause. Both George W. Bush McCain draw strength, decide run, proven ability appeal Hispanic voter, well general electoral strength. George W. Bush took 69 percent vote Texas, Democrat sat governor's chair four year ago, second-largest bloc electoral vote. Florida fourth-largest. Governor Bush Texas uttered rallying cry moderate. A leader compassionate conservative, said victory speech, erase gender gap open Republican party new face new voice. But figure right saw thing differently. James Dobson, leading religious broadcaster, said Republicans fared poorly Gingrich Sen. Trent Lott Mississippi, majority leader, caved president budget de-emphasized social issue abortion flag desecration. He called explicitly ouster Gingrich. Likewise, millionaire publisher Steve Forbes, another probable candidate 2000, said leadership lot answer for. Tuesday proved potency education issue, suggested emerge major theme 2000 campaign. Clinton, limited involvement campaign, Gore, extensive participation, stressed Democratic program build school hire teacher. Almost quarter California voter almost twice many voter California state named education pressing concern. Elsewhere, Democrats governorship Alabama South Carolina odds, partly emphasizing rivals' opposition lottery help pay school. In Iowa, Democrat elected governor first time since 1969 platform featured dilapidated condition state's school promise remedy it. Tuesday demonstrated overriding importance money modern American politics. Feingold, one principal backer campaign-finance reform, survived fight another day, opponent reform. And return House race, showing six 401 member sought re-election won, underlined hard is, present system, challenger raise enough money compete effectively. The difficulty raising money may doom many would-be presidential candidacy. Gore need, Bush, Forbes former Gov. Lamar Alexander Tennessee. But many others will? Finally, Tuesday delivered indecisive message impeachment. Close two-thirds voter nationwide told exit pollster intended send message Clinton, made clear response question disliked House inquiry president's alleged misdeed wanted see end. In two state, Kansas Nebraska, majority voter say favored even congressional censure Clinton, much milder form punishment advocated many Clinton backer. Some Republicans said privately hearing Clinton matter, Democrats began talking deal, equivalent plea bargain would bring matter early close. Nevertheless, Republican member House Judiciary Committee said needed press ahead Constitutional process House set motion. Among taking view Rep. Bob Barr Georgia, fierce foe president, Rep. Mary Bono California, whose tone muted. But Rep. David Dreier California, incoming Rules Committee chairman, said election played role ensuring one u desire drag out. Stunned Democratic resurgence mid-term election, congressional Republicans tore Wednesday blame failure make traditional opposition party gain off-year election. The soul-searching recrimination possibility congressional leadership challenge came election result showed Republicans unable increase 55-45 hold Senate Democrats picked five seat House. The Democratic surge marked first time since 1934 president's party gained seat midterm election, whittled Republican House majority mere six vote. The Democratic victory even remarkable political year marked months-long scandal President Clinton's affair Monica Lewinsky. The Republicans' new 223-211 majority (assuming Democrat leading Oregon hold win), one independent, amounted smallest congressional majority since Republican-controlled Congress 1953, last time Republicans controlled House captured 1994. With attention shifting House Judiciary Committee impeachment inquiry, Rep. Henry Hyde told fellow Republicans panel conference call Wednesday witness Republicans likely call would independent counsel, Kenneth Starr. Hyde, chairman, told lawmaker hoped committee vote possible article impeachment Thanksgiving, act would take issue hand put Gingrich's. Committee Democrats declined comment Wednesday could discus Hyde's plan among themselves. Trying put best face result, Speaker Newt Gingrich said Marietta, Ga., Republicans still held onto House three election row first time since election 1932. But furious rank file Republicans burned phone line other, discussing whether mount leadership challenge chamber next week. We've got reach southern white male running Washington Republican Party, said Rep. Joe Scarborough, conservative Florida. He said Republicans year left without accomplishment run on. We need agenda first all, said. We went entire calendar year without agenda. Rep. Chris Shays, moderate Connecticut called election devastating loss said simply, There going major change leadership. All segment party want see change. At White House, Clinton called election result vindication party's policy. If look result, said, clear unambiguous. The American people want business, concern, child, family, future addressed here. That's message election wa. One first difficult question facing Congress proceed impeachment inquiry face public resistance removing Clinton office, Republican majority slim almost certain 218 vote required impeachment cannot assembled. In public statement released Wednesday, Hyde said The Committee continues clear constitutional duty complete work fair expeditious manner. Our duty changed constitution changed. But Sen. Robert Torricelli, D-N.J., said election result guaranteed impeachment fail. I think serious effort remove President Clinton office effectively over, said. It simply Newt Gingrich Trent Lott decide exit strategy. From side aisle, Rep. Rick Lazio, Long Island Republican, said, The inquiry wrapped expeditiously, fairly ought resolved immediate future. For past year, Republicans struggled keep control House 228 seat find consensus among party's competing faction. With number reduced, Republican leadership need carry tortuous balancing act unite hard-core conservative faction want aggressive social agenda bloc moderate want party return center. The Democrats held 206 seat, one held indepenndent. Any small Republican faction enormous leverage. The new arithmetic House may even lead Democrats' moderate Republicans' forming ad hoc majority issue, taking control away Republican leader. Already seeing possibility, Rep. Peter King Long Island, N.Y., said northeastern Republicans would strengthened. It give u much leverage leadership make easier protect New York, said. It's going weaken position strident conservative anti-northeast conservative. Just two week ago, Gingrich foreseen election gain ranging 10 seat 40. Seeming uncharacteristically uncertain Wednesday, said trouble accounting result. Things happening none u fully understand--neither party judgment, said. Taking share blame party's loss, Georgia Republican said misjudged public would recoil Clinton scandal amplified modern medium world scandal would drown Republican theme. I mean I totally underestimated degree people would get sick 24-hour-a day talk television talk radio degree whole scandal became sort disgusting sheer repetition, said. And result I think probably underestimated need really aggressively push much stronger message cutting tax saving Social Security, winning war drug, reforming education national defense. Majority Leader Sen. Trent Lott Mississippi also admitted mistake, saying party presented clear enough message final 96 hour campaign. He also conceded Congress' final scramble pas $500 billion budget bill hurt party. One lesson Republicans need listen carefully people need clear understanding concise message apply across nation, said Washington. Both Lott Gingrich said Republicans would put emphasis next year tax-cutting shoring Social Security system. Even two leader spoke, angry rank-and-file lawmaker making phone call trying ass whether mount challenge Republican leader steered Congress since Republican's assumed control four year ago. One senior Republican staffer said House become tinderbox intrigue. Scarborough said, The long distance charge Washington office probably going roof today. Everybody's calling everybody. Everybody recognizes something's terribly wrong direction Washington Republicans Republican governor well New York, Massachusetts, Florida Texas. And Gingrich gone way identify Republican campaign's last-minute ad blitz attacking President Clinton, caucus know responsible. Gingrich faced uprising before, foiling coup attempt disgruntled conservative leadership team summer 1997. Any move remove remains long-shot. But House leadership election set mid-November, Republicans said time dissatisfaction caucus crossed ideological line moderate like Shays well. We got shellacked, said Rep. Christopher Cannon, conservative Utah. We beat agenda. Republicans discussing possible challenge Gingrich, second-in-command, Rep. Dick Armey, member senior leadership team. Some envisioning trying run entire new ticket headed Rep. Bob Livingston, Appropriations Committee chairman Louisiana including Rep. Steve Largent, Oklahoma conservative. Asked whether Tuesday's election result could cost speakership, Gingrich said, I'm particularly concerned. Republicans close said expected anger dissipate. In Senate, leadership race take place early December, Republicans talking mounting challenge mid-level leadership figure. Several senator expressed particular pique toward re-election chairman, Senator Mitch McConnell Kentucky, poured party dollar much time trying defeat Democratic champion campaign finance overhaul, Russell Feingold Wisconsin. Feingold close race. Some lawmaker Wednesday approached Sen. Chuck Hagel Nebraska see would replace McConnell. Hagel confirmed talked eight senator, considering whether challenge McConnell. Hagel lambasted Republican leadership election outcome. This big loss u, said. We squandered historic opportunity last night. To break even loss. Most incumbent coasted victory Tuesday night. But returning. Five House Republicans defeated: Vince Snowbarger Kansas, Bill Redmond New Mexico, Jon Fox Pennsylvania, Mike Pappas New Jersey, Rick White Washington. One Democrat also lost re-election bid Rep. Jay Johnson Wisconsin. The new House member include 17 Republicans least 22 Democrats. David Wu, Democrat leading Molly Bordonaro, Republican race one House seat Oregon, final victory announcement expected Friday absentee ballot counted. Unlike self-proclaimed revolutionary Republican class 1994, many newly elected member career politician rose rank local state government. Three Democrats son former lawmaker, Mark Udall Colorado, son Morris Udall represented Arizona; Tom Udall New Mexico, son Udall brother, Stewart, former congressman secretary Interior, Charlie Gonzalez, Texas seat father, Henry. A struggle control House way, Rep. Robert Livingston conducting telephone campaign could lead running Newt Gingrich speaker. But Gingrich's counter-campaign given member pause ousting him. At time, small band Republicans vowed Thursday would vote re-elect Gingrich circumstance, move that, Republicans' shrunken House majority, could tie party knot month. Rep. Matt Salmon, R-Ariz., said: I personally made decision I cannot vote Newt Gingrich speaker January, six others told feel way, seven people not, take six deadlock vote. Fury speaker boiled since Tuesday's election, Republicans suffered net loss five seat House. They blamed Gingrich, party's chief strategist. But many already angry said failure articulate clear message party going election messy budget process gave President Clinton political edge contradicted Republican principle fiscal conservativism containing massive amount spending local project. House Republicans meet Nov. 18 vote secret ballot leader. Whoever win Republican nomination speaker must stand election full House January. Even Gingrich win secret ballot, could denied re-election speaker January Salmon least five others refuse vote him. Because Republicans control House 12 seat, would take six vote Gingrich deny majority. With chaotic unacceptable prospect looming, Livingston told Gingrich step aside good party, Republican official said. The official said Livingston spoke Gingrich shortly election return also election, reflecting Livingston's earlier displeasure speaker budget process. Several Republicans said Livingston, chairman Appropriations Committee one member stature stand speaker, Gingrich working phone Thursday struggle vote. Livingston said nothing publicly challenge Gingrich, several member aide said Thursday would announce intention, possibly soon Friday, determined could win. Rep. Peter King, R-N.Y., one several member spoke Livingston Thursday. He told he's making number phone call, he's gotten positive response running speaker, he'll decide within next 48 hour, King said. He till duck row, right lot people still loyal speaker, said aide Republican who, like many others, trying straddle line fealty speaker may retain power encouragement challenger offer salve embattled party. Many Republicans immediately blamed Gingrich party's loss Tuesday. Talk quickly emerged next day slate candidate oppose Gingrich lieutenant. The list possible candidate leadership position included Rep.e Steve Largent Oklahoma, talked Livingston Thursday challenging Gingrich, Republican official said, speaking condition name reported. Those official said Largent told Livingston wanted run ticket would challenge Rep. Dick Armey, majority leader. But, official said Livingston challenge Gingrich, Largent would run speaker instead. Other name floated Wednesday leadership post. They included Reps. David McIntosh Indiana speaker Jennifer Dunn Washington conference chairman. Added mix Thursday name Rep. Christopher Cox, California conservative. As sign uncertainty prevailing among House member Thursday, Rep. Henry Hyde, chairman Judiciary Committee one House's venerable member, rebuffed chance endorse Gingrich speaker. Hyde said Gingrich bore responsibility party's loss Tuesday. Leadership take credit thing go right, said. They ought take blame thing go wrong. Asked Gingrich remain speaker, Hyde said: I rather think will, remains seen. The energy many vented publicly Wednesday anger toward Gingrich seemed devoted Thursday intense internal political calculation whether Livingston could succeed toppling Gingrich whether succeed. While many support veteran understands House shown shrewd political skill managing massive federal budget, others reviving image Louisianan hot-head gave party bad name government shutdown two year ago tends toward arm-flailing heated moment. One conservative leader said ally reservation Livingston obsessed trying keep social issue budget process. The budget, said, vehicle conservative year add restriction federal money abortion thing can't get Senate past presidential veto. If Livingston challenger, I doubt cause rallying real conservative Congress. Some moderate said prepared support him. Rep. Marge Roukema, R-N.J., said, I would amenable Livingston. Still, cautioned, I'm Newt. But wrong sit seriously look option. Ken Johnson, aide Rep. WJ. (Billy) Tauzin, R-La., said bos emblematic confusion among broad base House Republicans. Billy loyal Speaker Gingrich Dick Armey, he's still loyal them, also want hear say committing next election, Johnson said. Everyone asking question: Can refocus message re-energize base without re-aligning leadership? Salmon said refusal support Gingrich matter based Gingrich's track record one failed strategy another, including impeachment process pork-laden budget. With challenge way, Gingrich trying show member responsive concern. After election night portrayed Republicans victorious even lost seat, next day took responsibility loss. In another move, Gingrich indicated willing cede control party's congressional campaign committee, allowing whole House select member. Gingrich also making strong personal appeal Republicans. Said one top House aide: He'll get support. How much? Only vote-counters know. ","Speaker of the House Newt Gingrich has announced that he will not seek re-election to the post when the vote comes up on November 18th.He also announced that he would be leaving the House when his current term as Speaker expires in January.This announcement comes on the heels of a poor Republican showing in the mid-term elections.Although the Republicans retained a majority in the House, the Margin of Republican control shrank in the face of Democratic gains.Gingrich had been seen as the man who led the Republicans our of the doldrums into control of the House and the Senate.","Most Democrats, except for former Clinton strategist James Carville, were hesitant to attack Speaker Newt Gingrich as the 1998 elections approached.Republicans were expected to add to their majority in Congress.However, Republicans lost seats in both the House and Senate.Republicans became disenchanted with the Gingrich ""vision"" and blamed him for the losses.An active campaign began to replace Gingrich as Speaker with Louisiana Congressman Robert Livingston as the main actor.After a losing struggle to maintain his position, Gingrich resigned as Speaker.House Republicans then turned their attention to impeachment proceedings of President Clinton.","The 1998 election ended the political career of Newt Gingrich, who had become Speaker in 1994, leading a conservative, issue-driven, GOP majority.In Oct Democrats were urged to go after him.Although both houses retained a narrowed GOP majority, Newt, with his combativeness and Impeachment-fixation, was blamed for the failures by both wings of his party.The 1998 winners were Gore, Clinton, and moderates.Newt's issues seemed dead in the booming economy and old Democratic loyalists ignored Clinton's morals and returned to the fold.As fellow Republicans jockeyed for his positions, Newt resigned as Speaker on Nov 6 and also decided to leave his House seat.","James Carville complained that fellow Democrats didn't join his war against Speaker Newt Gingrich leading up to the congressional elections of 1998.Gingrich had led the impeachment inquiry against President Clinton in the House.When, contrary to all predictions, the Democrats gained five seats in the House and held their own in the Senate, Republicans enlisted in Carville's cause, blaming Gingrich for the election results.Gingrich battled fiercely as Rep. Livingston rallied forces against him, but ultimately Gingrich accepted defeat agreeing to cede the speakership and his seat in the House.He blamed his defeat on blackmail by Republican cannibals."
26,"America Online verge agreeing purchase Netscape Communications Corp., Internet pioneer center government's antitrust suit Microsoft Corp., executive involved talk said Sunday. The proposed deal complex, three-way transaction involving AOL, Netscape Sun Microsystems Inc. AOL, leading on-line service 14 million subscriber, would acquire Netscape's popular site World Wide Web software business. AOL would also enter joint marketing development partnership Sun Microsystems strengthen Netscape's business selling large corporation heavy-duty software needed serve Web page Internet technology many thousand user time. The purchase, exchange AOL share Netscape stock, valued roughly $4 billion. A completed deal could announced soon Monday morning. But executive involved talk cautioned Sunday night detail remained negotiated. The Netscape deal, consummated, would realign three business forefront modern economy on-line service, Internet software electronic commerce. It would strengthen two Microsoft's leading rival, AOL Sun Microsystems. At time, however, would end independent existence Netscape, Internet software maker regarded serious challenger Microsoft's dominance personal computer software market. Netscape, founded 1994, struggled last 18 month assault Microsoft. Its Navigator runaway leader market browser software used navigate World Wide Web. But Microsoft, responding Internet revolution, entered market aggressively, quickly matching quality Netscape's technology bundling Microsoft browser, Internet Explorer, industry-standard Windows operating system giving away free. Eventually, Microsoft's browser technology caught Netscape's. Earlier year, Netscape announced layoff started distributing Navigator free well, Microsoft steadily gained browser market. Since then, Netscape focused mainly two business advertising transaction fee Netcenter Web site selling industrial-strength software corporation building Internet site conduct electronic commerce. AOL belief expertise increase revenue Netscape's Web site and, helped Sun's programmer vast corporate sale force, accelerate Netscape's software sale well, executive involved negotiation said. Among large corporation, Sun's version Unix, Solaris, among popular operating system powerful computer run Netscape's server software. The much smaller Netscape would placed wing AOL Sun Microsystems. The three company combined revenue $12.4 billion last year. Microsoft, comparison, revenue $14 billion. This deal would insure fundamental element Netscape survive within bigger company drive technology forward, said David B. Yoffie, professor Harvard business school co-author Michael A. Cusumano Massachusetts Institute Technology recent book, Competing Internet Time: Lessons Netscape Its Battle Microsoft. The impact deal, any, government's antitrust suit Microsoft uncertain. It appear support key theme Microsoft's defense namely, operates fast-moving industry corporate alliance shift time. Thus, Microsoft argues, antitrust policy tread gently. But deal, government official insist, direct effect current case. No matter much alliance shift, affect central fact Microsoft's monopoly used abused market power protect monopoly, said David Boies, Justice Department's lead trial lawyer Microsoft case. Executives representing Netscape, AOL Sun Microsystems government witness Microsoft trial. And serious merger talk Netscape Chief Executive Officer James Barksdale AOL Chairman Steve Case began month ago, start Microsoft trial, according people close talk. Industry analyst suggest company may emboldened take stronger anti-Microsoft step based partly perception antitrust case would weaken Microsoft. And representative Kleiner Perkins Caufield &AMP; Byers, Silicon Valley venture capital firm regarded power broker among Microsoft's rival, sit board Netscape, Sun AOL. Still, executive involved talk said timing proposed deal unrelated antitrust trial. Nor it, one person noted, regarded single-minded attempt circle wagon Microsoft. Indeed, AOL, according one person close talk, plan keep Microsoft's Internet Explorer browser default choice on-line service. One government's allegation antitrust suit Microsoft Netscape main browser AOL Microsoft used Windows monopoly bargaining chip. To win browser deal, Microsoft offered AOL prime real estate Windows desktop, main screen 90 percent personal computer sold today. Staying Microsoft's browser seen proof AOL still regard placement Windows desktop crucial, well careful step avoid undermining one allegation government's case. For AOL, Netscape purchase would accelerate evolution toward Internet. At present, flagship on-line service hybrid proprietary service, added gateway World Wide Web. In addition, consumer subscribe AOL's dial-up service, also Web site, aol.com, attracts 24 million visitor month, according Media Metrix/Relevant Knowledge, market research firm. Its big Web site offer wide range information, entertainment, Internet chat e-mail, leading example all-in-one site become known portal. Netscape's Netcenter traffic slipped bit recent month, 16 million visitor month, it, too, major portal. Together, huge player intensifying portal battle viewer resulting advertising revenue. Yahoo current leader among portal site 25 million monthly visitor, Microsoft's site attracts 20 million month. Though known new-media company consumer, AOL also interested boosting electronic commerce business Netscape purchase. AOL recently done work Eastman Kodak, American Greetings company, promoting product on-line subscriber also building Internet infrastructure software conduct electronic commerce. AOL note projection like recent one Forrester Research Inc., predicted worldwide Internet commerce could reach high $3.2 trillion 2003, 5 percent global sale. Sun Microsystems, analyst say, could strong partner AOL market Internet commerce software. Sun corporate software company sale force several thousand. As move increasingly Internet technology, AOL prove excellent partner Sun term developing using Sun's Java, Internet programming language. And Netscape's browser longer generates revenue own, distribution channel Java technology. Having Netscape's browser safely hand friendly company strategic importance Sun, since Microsoft owns alternative browser market. AOL expected pay little, any, premium Netscape's stock price Friday, executive close deal said, since Netscape share doubled last month. In last week alone, Netscape's stock jumped $12, nearly 45 percent, following report discussing possible partnership AOL. The stock closed Friday $39.1875, $2625. AOL's share gained $1.50 Friday, closing $84875. Envisioning thoroughly networked world World Wide Web limitless marketplace information, entertainment, product service, America Online Inc. Tuesday laid detail agreement buy Netscape Communications Corporation $4.2 billion. By moving quickly toward company recently come see inevitable convergence technology medium, America Online hope secure solid lead battle already joined giant like Microsoft Corp. International Business Machines Corp. transform greater part cyberspace vast virtual mall. Part vision rest alliance Sun Microsystems America Online negotiated part deal. Sun brings cyber-savvy sale force effort but, even importantly, strong technology partner developing Netscape's industrial-strength software running Internet site. Sun indeed technology heavyweight. It owns Java programming language specially designed Internet application, Solaris, among popular commercial operating system powerful computer big corporation use serve Internet service like World Wide Web, e-mail retail transaction. It also manufacture highly respected line powerful computer based microprocessor chip. But America Online big Internet player compete real potential gold mine lie road, perhaps five year away, people venture line information shopping personal computer inexpensive Internet appliance costing $200 each, maybe included free part subscription service, cellular phone now. Today, wired remains comparatively elitist activity estimated 25 percent American household access Internet last year, 5 percent household bought merchandise line. But executive America Online Netscape hope deal accelerate timetable day Net ubiquitous, people tap World Wide Web appliance-like device, pager, cell phone, television set-top box computer routinely use telephone today. A new generation Internet device able deliver service anywhere key part deal long run, said Stephen M. Case, 40, chairman America Online. For present, however, idea make America Online, nation's leading online service, standard way get onto Internet, executive explained. Netscape, Internet pioneer, crucial part effort, said. There assurance vision technological future prove accurate or, even doe, America Online-Netscape combination lead way. Still, long-range game plan help explain brought America Online Netscape together. And ability companies' executive sell vision Netscape's whiz-kid programmer particular determine whether merger succeeds. Netscape's headquarters Mountain View, Calif., likely become prime target Silicon Valley headhunter. As case software company, Netscape's key asset talented programmer, many code hacker may reluctant work America Online, still reputation middle-brow service catering online newcomer, known derisively newbie. Stock option financial incentive tailored try keep Netscape employee board. But people want change world, we've got clear joining America Online, along Sun component, really bigger opportunity u, said Marc Andreessen, 26-year-old cofounder Netscape led team young programmer supercomputing center University Illinois Silicon Valley start Internet software company 1994. This ought preeminent Internet company next decade, Andreessen declared, speaking cell phone streetcorner Palo Alto, Calif. For part, Andreessen, Netscape executive vice president, become Netscape's chief technology officer next three four month, merger completed. His new job America Online yet determined, likely chief technology officer combined company well, America Online executive said. Already, according one Netscape board member, Andreessen delivered 12-page single-spaced memorandum Case, setting view technological road map new company follow future, emphasizing opportunity electronic commerce environment people linked Internet. Netscape, populated computing sophisticate, America Online, known on-ramp Internet technologically challenged, seem corporate odd couple. But two company, executive explained, evolving toward year. In telephone interview America Online's headquarters Dulles, Va., Case described Netscape enterprise morphed company dependent sale software used browse World Wide Web Microsoft's cross-hairs business relied advertising revenue popular Netcenter Web site selling software corporation handle electronic commerce. The Netscape transformation largely reaction Microsoft's competitive assault browser business central element government's antitrust suit Microsoft. Microsoft bundled browser industry-standard Windows operating system, gave away browser free. The government alleges step part pattern anticompetitive practice, Microsoft maintains move intended mainly benefit consumer. Early year, laying worker suffering large loss last year, Netscape announced would also distribute browser free. It seems stabilized business around new model. Netscape announced Tuesday earned $2.7 million revenue $162 million fourth fiscal quarter, ended September. Yet America Online also changed last couple year, moving well beyond reputation online service beginner. It Internet chat service run all-in-one site Web, known portal, includes e-mail, Internet searching, news, entertainment online shopping. America Online really changed closed online service novice user Internet medium technology company diverse set brand, Andreessen said. These two company moving direction, fit good one. America Online Inc. want become next Microsoft two promising information-age field Microsoft Corp. another company Internet medium business electronic commerce. With proposed purchase Netscape Communications Corp., AOL, nation's largest dial-up online service 14 million subscriber, hope take significant step toward ambitious goal. If $4 billion deal completed company reached final agreement Monday night AOL would acquire leading Internet brand enlarge wired audience absorbing million regularly visit Netscape's popular NetCenter site World Wide Web. Acquiring Netscape would really enhance America Online's role premier Internet medium company, said James F. Moore, president Geopartners Inc., consulting firm. America Online assembling kind audience number convince people Internet becoming mainstream medium. In new medium business, traditional medium like television newspaper, eyeball translate advertising revenue. But really intrigue medium executive consumer marketer new medium news, entertainment service rendered computer code is inherently two-way medium people interact tap key click mouse button The interaction advertiser marketer want see, course, buying. And potential exploiting instant, direct connection consumer fueled recent optimism electronic commerce. Today, company selling everything book baby clothes Internet. Most company progressed beyond experimentation stage, handful encouraging success story like Amazon.com, on-line bookstore. By 2003, Forrester Research Inc., whose business analyzing trend cyberspace, project Internet commerce could reach $3.2 trillion, 5 percent sale worldwide. AOL forefront convergence medium commerce converge, integration reflected lineage leader. Steve Case, chairman, new-product manager Pepsico's Pizza Hut chain, Robert Pittman, president, former MTV executive. Microsoft also investing heavily new medium electronic commerce. It online service, MSN, competes AOL, well information-and commerce Web site focus travel, car real estate. It also owns Sidewalk, network local site list movie, restaurant store city around country including Seattle New York. Its MSNBC Internet news service half joint venture NBC. Microsoft expected formidable competitor media-and-commerce business. It shortage bright people money rival. Besides deep pocket, Microsoft built-in advantage computer-based medium Windows operating system run 90 percent personal computer sold today. Its control Windows desktop give valuable piece commercial real estate information age. In theory, least, owning desktop screen help Microsoft steer consumer online offering issue key government's antitrust suit Microsoft. But far, Microsoft started slowly field Internet medium electronic commerce. Microsoft may want to, dominate new market, said Richard Shaffer, principal Technologic Partners, research firm. America Online recognizes big opportunity emerging growth business like electronic commerce instead trying take Microsoft head-on. Still, Netscape deal completed, AOL also find software business way never past. Netscape known pioneer commercial development software used navigate World Wide Web. Microsoft saw browser software direct threat industry dominance pursued market aggressively, bundling browser Windows giving away free tactic challenged government. But Netscape longer generates revenue browser, also distributes free, sale heavy-duty software sold corporation. Much software used technological back office electronic commerce used building Web site processing transaction. A surprising element proposed deal AOL intends hold onto Netscape's corporate software business instead selling established software company. America Online credibility market, observed Michael A. Cusumano, professor Massachusetts Institute Technology's Sloan School Management. Executives close AOL explain decision need provide full-line offering electronic commerce, corporate Web site computer screen consumer. But AOL decided need help preserve strengthen Netscape's corporate software business. To that, brought Sun Microsystems Inc. side deal, complicated transaction considerably. AOL, according executive close proposed deal, Netscape, joint marketing development partnership Sun. As part deal, AOL agree purchase $300 million worth Sun's computer service, Sun apparently agree purchase sizeable amount Netscape software, Sun's sale force must sell. Still, AOL Sun longer-term objective well one promise place direct conflict Microsoft. For nearly year, William J. Raduchel, Sun's chief strategist, working closely AOL, according Sun executive. A former Harvard economics professor taught Scott McNealy, Sun chairman, Raduchel focused Sun's Internet programming technology, called Java Jini, seen potential threat Microsoft's dominance. By combining Sun's technology prowess AOL's powerful consumer brand, Sun executive say, potential kind end-run around Microsoft's grip desktop computing. In research laboratory, Sun working stripped-down network computer simple-to-use information appliance, could cost little $200 given away part subscription service. The concept AOL's Internet medium electronic commerce service could delivered many home today many people still shun expense difficulty using personal computer. The appliance would mainly receiver screen, computing power residing vast central computer serving information user request tapping button. Sun's technological specialty kind centralized network computing. If long-term AOL-Sun vision ever materialized certainly three-to-five year bet, least could give company boost technological independence Microsoft. Microsoft Corp. argued federal court Monday proposed acquisition Netscape Communications Corp. America Online seriously undermined government's antitrust suit software giant. From legal standpoint, proposed deal pull rug government, William Neukom, Microsoft's senior vice president legal affair, said Monday morning courthouse step. The reasoning behind assertion, Microsoft say, proposed deal demonstrates Netscape larger software industry healthy vibrant even illegal anti-competitive practice alleged government's suit. But David Boies, government's lead attorney, said irrelevant. Whatever deal end end deal going remove obstacle Microsoft placed path competition industry, said. Michael Lacovara, Microsoft lawyer questioning government witness, economist Frederick Warren-Boulton, suggested trial Monday proposed acquisition undermined Warren-Boulton's argument, Microsoft seems headed toward obtaining monopoly Internet browser software match one apparently hold operating system. After all, 22 percent Americans use Internet reach America Online. And present AOL us Microsoft's Web browser, Internet Explorer, service's default choice. In exchange that, Microsoft place AOL advertisement Internet link Windows 98. Lacovara asked witness whether, AOL's service contract expires January, would expect AOL continue distribute Microsoft software. Yes, Warren-Boulton responded. It clear AOL's incentive changed proposed merger Netscape. He noted America Online official said need among online service featured Windows forced accept Microsoft term establishing Internet Explorer default choice. Lacovara asked Warren-Boulton question lay entire cross-examination witness Microsoft's larger assertion Monday proposed Netscape-AOL deal. Surely combination, asked, tell something nature competition software industry? Warren-Boulton's answer probably one Lacovara after. To extent potential merger result Microsoft's action exclusive contract action, said, unfortunate see disappearance firm like Netscape, brightest, newest star. Warren-Boulton's purpose stand government establish Microsoft monopoly operating-system software; 90 percent world's computer use Microsoft operating system. That foundation government's case since federal antitrust law forbids certain behavior monopolist would legal firm face healthy competition. Through repeated, often circumlocutious questioning, Lacovara tried make case Microsoft's overwhelming market share ephemeral. The software industry vibrant fast moving, suggested, Microsoft could toppled position moment point view company encourages among employee. On Friday Monday, Lacovara repeatedly pointed company placing operating system market, software company principally Microsoft's greatest rival writing software new system. But Warren-Boulton argued existence fringe competitor operating system market mean way Microsoft monopoly power. On Monday afternoon, Lacovara made issue success Apple Computer Co. selling new iMac computer. He entered evidence Apple news release issued last month showing, among thing, 12.5 percent people buying Apple's new iMac computer previously owned Windows machine. Apple computer use different operating system, Mac-OS. The outcome Microsoft antitrust case may long way off, one thing already clear: This first major e-mail trial. The government's prosecution Microsoft Corp.'s defense, striking degree, legal campaign waged electronic message. The human testimony often pale next e-mail evidence. On stand videotaped testimony, people questioned shrug, mumble forget. The e-mail alive idea competitive zeal, punctuated profanity exclamation point. The second week trial ended prosecutor frustrated lengthy cross-examination Microsoft's lead lawyer left time government show several hour videotaped deposition Bill Gates, Microsoft chairman. With new witness, executive Apple Computer Inc., taking stand Monday, uncertain Gates tape played. The Justice Department 20 state suing Microsoft believe tape strengthen case show Gates saying involved plan take government alleges illegal step stifle competition Internet software market. The Gates videotape, said David Boies, Justice Department's trial lawyer, offer opportunity judge Gates' credibility. But Gates credibility gap, one, becomes issue videotape taped remark compared contrasted e-mail wrote received. The e-mail record, government insists, show Gates waist-deep plotting anti-competitive deal bullying tactic denies professes never heard taped deposition. If machination central government's case, summon Gates trial? The government need put Gates stand, e-mail memoranda, Stephen Houck, lawyer state, told court. The Microsoft legal team month preparing e-mail defense. First, Microsoft argues, anything look damaging taken context. I urge honor, John Warden, Microsoft's lead lawyer, told Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson, view considerable skepticism crazy quilt e-mail fragment seem form core government's case. But Microsoft also mounted e-mail counterattack, culled million message obtained subpoena competitor pretrial discovery. Warden's cross-examination ritual present government witness internal e-mail company pose declaration question. These interrogation two refrains: Isn't true company exactly accusing Microsoft doing, true Microsoft prevailed predatory monopolist superior technology? Microsoft accused trying prod company stay way. So last week, example, Warden produced e-mail Stephen Case, chairman America Online, suggesting partnership Netscape Communications Corp. company would focus respective strength. That division labor, Case wrote, would best way achieve goal Marc Andreessen, Netscape's cofounder, described earlier e-mail beating Beast From Redmond want see u dead reference Microsoft's headquarters Redmond, Wash. Printouts e-mail another form written communication. By 1920s, typewriter became common, typed memoranda started used court case. From 1950s 1980s, legal expert say, explosion documentation fueled new technology electric typewriter, photocopying fax machine, personal computer. And e-mail, add, played important role legal inquiry year, like Iran-contra case 1980s e-mail found Oliver North's computer proved crucial. But Microsoft case result sweeping government antitrust investigation high-technology company e-mail supplanted telephone common instrument communication. E-mail revolutionized investigation kind, one senior Justice Department official said. While investigation, Microsoft handed government estimated 30 million document, mostly e-mail. In trial, two side submitted 3,000 exhibit, mainly e-mail. And e-mail, people often communicate frankly informally writing letter report tap out, punch button gone cyberspace. But e-mail communication documentary evidence, legal case provides rich, contemporaneous record people thinking planning time. It sharp contrast formal oral testimony, often coached lawyer crafted selective memory. The e-mail record certainly make I-don't-recall line response harder sustain, said Robert Litan, former senior official Justice Department's antitrust division Brookings Institution. It also powerful ammunition pointing contradiction testimony. And government attacking Gates' credibility videotaped deposition, taken three day August. The government offered glimpse strategy first day trial. It showed brief clip point deposition Gates asked meeting June 21, 1995, which, government alleges, Microsoft offered divide browser market Netscape make investment company, chief rival market. In taped deposition, Gates say recalled asked one subordinate whether thought made sense invest Netscape. He said asked June 1995 meeting replied, I see something made sense. But e-mail May 31, 1995, Gates urged alliance Netscape. We could even pay money part deal, wrote, buying piece something. The contradiction Gates' deposition e-mail, though, speak issue whether Microsoft made illegal offer Netscape. To sure, Microsoft said e-mail communication count most. But e-mail look bad get record, end Microsoft's lawyer going spend much trial trying explain away, said Stephen Axinn, leading antitrust litigator firm Axinn, Veltrop &AMP; Harkrider New York.

America Online verge agreeing purchase Netscape Communications Corp., Internet pioneer center government's antitrust suit Microsoft Corp., executive involved talk said Sunday. The proposed deal complex, three-way transaction involving AOL, Netscape Sun Microsystems Inc. AOL, leading on-line service 14 million subscriber, would acquire Netscape's popular site World Wide Web software business. But part deal, AOL would also enter joint marketing development partnership Sun Microsystems strengthen Netscape's business selling large corporation heavy-duty software needed serve Web page Internet technology many thousand user time. The purchase, exchange AOL share Netscape stock, valued roughly $4 billion. A completed deal could announced soon Monday morning. But executive involved talk cautioned Sunday night detail remained negotiated. The Netscape deal, consummated, would realign three business forefront modern economy on-line service, Internet software electronic commerce. It would strengthen two Microsoft's leading rival, AOL Sun Microsystems. At time, however, would subsume Netscape, Internet software maker regarded serious challenger Microsoft's dominance personal computer software market. Netscape, founded 1994, struggled last 18 month assault Microsoft. Its Navigator runaway leader market browser software used navigate World Wide Web. But Microsoft, responding Internet revolution, entered market aggressively, quickly matching quality Netscape's technology bundling Microsoft browser, Internet Explorer, industry-standard Windows operating system giving away free. Earlier year, Netscape announced layoff started distributing Navigator free well, Microsoft steadily gained browser market. Since then, Netscape focused mainly two business advertising transaction fee Netcenter Web site selling industrial-strength software corporation building Internet site conduct electronic commerce. AOL belief expertise increase revenue Netscape's Web site and, helped Sun's programmer vast corporate sale force, accelerate Netscape's software sale well, executive involved negotiation said. Sun's version Unix, Solaris, among popular operating system large, powerful computer run Netscape's server software. This deal would insure fundamental element Netscape survive within bigger company drive technology forward, said David B. Yoffie, professor Harvard business school co-author Michael A. Cusumano Massachusetts Institute Technology recent book, Competing Internet Time: Lessons Netscape Its Battle Microsoft. The impact deal, any, government's antitrust suit Microsoft uncertain. It appear support key theme Microsoft's defense namely, operates fast-moving industry corporate alliance shift time. Thus, Microsoft argues, antitrust policy tread gently. But deal, government official insist, direct effect current case. No matter much alliance shift, affect central fact Microsoft's monopoly used abused market power protect monopoly, said David Boies, Justice Department's lead trial lawyer Microsoft case. Executives representing Netscape, AOL Sun Microsystems government witness Microsoft trial. And serious merger talk Netscape Chief Executive Officer James Barksdale AOL Chairman Steve Case began month ago, start Microsoft trial, according people close talk. Industry analyst suggest company may emboldened take stronger anti-Microsoft step based partly perception antitrust case would weaken Microsoft. And representative Kleiner Perkins Caufield &AMP; Byers, Silicon Valley venture capital firm regarded power broker among Microsoft's rival, sit board Netscape, Sun AOL. Stock price vaulted record level Monday, furthering recovery recently two month ago seemed nearly unthinkable. I thought serious correction since 1990, I never thought wrote bull market over, said Byron Wien, US. equity strategist Morgan Stanley Dean Witter &AMP; Co. Now seems behind u. The Dow Jones industrial average rose 214.72 point, 2.34 percent, 9,37427. The record first since July 17, Dow closed 9,33797. Since Aug. 31, Dow stood 7,539.07 steep slide, blue-chip gauge risen 24 percent. For year, Dow 18.54 percent chance rising 20 percent fourth consecutive year, something never accomplished before. Broader average also climbed. The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock index set record, rising 24.66 point, 2.12 percent, 1,18821.

And Russell 2000 index smaller-company issue gained 3.86 point, nearly 1 percent, 39815. Monday's action energized daily record number merger acquisition valued $1 billion more. The merger announcement prompted investor change estimate much company worth also indicated coming decline outstanding share stock. This may supply-demand story, demand stock rising supply stock reduced one company another merges, said Hugh Johnson, chief investment officer First Albany Corp. The flow money mutual fund fairly strong, pressure manager put money work. Two deal seemed catalyst broad swath stock. News Bankers Trust may close accepting $8.9 billion offer Deutsche Bank Germany heightened interest financial-services bank stock. And word America Online may acquire Netscape Communications $4 billion stock powered Internet technology stock even loftier valuation. Among financial company, JP. Morgan gained 6 1/16, 115 11/16. American Express 4 3/8, 108 15/16. Merrill Lynch jumped 4 3/8, 76. And Donaldson, Lufkin &AMP; Jenrette rose 3 9/16, 42}. Netscape active stock Monday, gaining 2}, 41 15/16. America Online gained 4 3/8, 89\. Other Internet stock also surged, analyst said group, seen meteoric gain recent week, ripe steep correction. Yahoo Amazon.com became $200 stock Monday. Yahoo rose 30 7/16, 221 7/16. And Amazon.com gained 37 3/8, 218. The performance Internet stock unsettling sign, Wien said. Still, more-established technology share also good day. IBM rose 7, 166 5/8. Microsoft jumped 5 9/16, 119 3/16. And Intel closed 113 9/16, 1{. After Monday's big price move, Wien said according calculation, stock 10 percent overvalued. By contrast, middle July market 20 percent overvalued, said. Nonetheless, market's recovery, buttressed three cut interest rate Federal Reserve Board, left many longtime Wall Street hand grasping historical parallel. At point new ground, said Laszlo Birinyi, head market research firm. At beginning year, I said target Dow 10,000 end 1998. If anyone asked market went look like corrective blip, I would said new target would 9,000. I surprised 10,000 figure came back table year. The New York Times said editorial Wednesday, Nov. 25: America Online's effort acquire Netscape set partnership Sun Microsystems reminder rapidly corporate landscape change fast-moving technical field. But lessen need Justice Department vigorously pursue antitrust suit Microsoft, dominant player software. The department presented solid evidence Microsoft used monopoly operating system muscle rival partner head competition software realm. The Internet risen quickly information medium four year ago, book The Road Ahead, Bill Gates scarcely mention it. In addition, couple year ago America Online, world's biggest online service, much trouble getting rid bug system widely derided America On Hold. Now Microsoft moved aggressively Internet Justice Department accusing predatory behavior, America Online rocketed forward make deal Internet player. In antitrust suit Microsoft, federal government charge company illegally bundled browser Windows operating system smother Netscape's chance marketing browser. Now corridor outside antitrust trial Microsoft's lawyer maintain Netscape found new partner America Online need protection government. But could easily argued Microsoft bludgeoned Netscape dissolution, forcing distress sale America Online. Nor clear customer America Online choose Netscape's browser vehicle buying selling Internet. Even newly musclebound form, America Online remains dependent Microsoft's good favorable placement AOL icon main desktop screen. It may that, year hence, America Online, Netscape Sun put together alternative mean Internet telephone line, cable like. But day, fairness requires Justice Department action insure Microsoft use current position thwart consumer choice. Only company know get product consumer incentive innovate turn Internet revolutionary medium promise be. ","As the government continued to press its anti-trust suit against Microsoft, AOL has begun negotiations to purchase Netscape.Netscape is at the heart of the antitrust suit.Netscape alleges that Microsoft marketing practices, packaging its Internet Explorer in its operating system denied market opportunities to Netscape.The AOL deal, a three-way negotiation between AOL, Sun Microsystems and Netscape, would combined three Microsoft rivals.AOL is counting on the Netscape purchase to allow it to expand its internet Market by helping business operate on the internet in an effort to join Media and technology.","In a bid to become a leader in the lucrative cyberspace economy, AOL will buy Netscape and set up a partnership with Sun.The venture will let AOL offer corporations end-to-end services, including servers, software, and accessibility to consumers.Eventually, AOL hopes to capitalize on the production of cheap devices offering Internet access to more homes.News of the deal helped push the Dow Jones to a new high.Meanwhile, Microsoft, accused by the Justice Department of using its operating system dominance to squelch competition in the browser market, claims the deal shows the software industry is healthy and that Netscape needs no government protection.","As the U.S. government pressed its antitrust case against Microsoft Corp. in November 1998, America Online (AOL) proposed an alliance with Netscape Communications and Sun Microsystems.The three-pronged deal promised to provide on-line services, Internet software and electronic commerce.AOL was to buy Netscape and forge a partnership with Sun, benefiting all three and giving technological independence from Microsoft.Microsoft lawyers argued unconvincingly that AOL's purchase of Netscape would undermine the government's antitrust case, based in large part on Netscape's complaint.It remained to be seen whether AOL could achieve a vast virtual mall.","America Online became the leading force in cyberspace for individuals to exchange e-mail and check the latest news.AOL saw a bright day ahead as a company that could provide online services, Internet software, and electronic commerce.To position itself better in this growing market, AOL sought to buy Netscape and work an alliance with Sun Microsystems.Netscape has faltered because of the ubiquity of the Microsoft Windows operating system requiring its browser.Microsoft argued that a vibrant technology market and rising stock prices undercut antitrust charges against it.At the trial the government presented thousands of e-mails supporting its case."

When world's finance minister central banker gathered last year Hong Kong, nervously congratulated containing least moment nasty financial brush fire Asia. In year's time, many predicted hallway chatter, trouble Thailand Indonesia would look like replay Mexico 1995 rough bump road world enjoying remarkable prosperity. Talk bad market call. Twelve month later, financial mandarin clog Washington limousine glide endless reception annual meeting International Monetary Fund World Bank, everything could gone wrong world economy has: worst downturn Japan since World War II, economic meltdown Russia, depression Indonesia plunging 100 million people poverty line, deep fear happens next Latin America. What make year's IMF meeting remarkable, though, harshest criticism directed monetary fund itself, and, extension, US. Treasury, viewed power behind IMF. This year, place confident prediction, mutual recrimination. Arguments breaking whether true culprit crony capitalist weakened leader like Russian President Boris Yeltsin, huge investor poured money world's emerging market reckless abandon mid-1990s panicked past twelve month. Whatever reason, one reality prevails: Hundreds billion dollar fled economy four continent seeking safest haven possible, often United States money returning anytime soon. And subtext every seminar capital flow every conclave nervous minister painfully blunt questions: Can stopped? Or world headed global recession? Fifty-three year ago IMF created Bretton Woods conference sought stabilize world economy secure peace World War II. Now attack side, charged worsening bad situation misjudging economics, politically tone-deaf volatile capital world, Jakarta, Indonesia, Moscow. For first time, disturbing question whether institution still capable, financially politically, containing kind economic contagion caught world unaware. Once, IMF's critic largely found Africa South Asia, fund often viewed arrogant; today include Wall Street's biggest player top official powerful economy Asia Europe. Only including former Secretary State George Schultz member Congress increasingly suspicious international institution talking scrapping IMF altogether. But almost everyone talking creating new financial architecture old one clearly cannot: smother financial wildfire leap around globe. President Clinton, British Prime Minister Tony Blair leader, month silence, edged debate, case wresting issue first time finance minister central bank. Their fear, adviser say, 15 month financial turmoil threatening political stability. Such concern turned year's meeting tumbled mass worry groping short long-term solution. The Japanese, French, Southeast Asians arriving Washington different diagnosis went wrong, different solution set right. The United States set plan, mix suggestion force disclosure financial data country around world impose American-style financial standard regulation. Meanwhile, ideological argument breaking whether world slow long march toward free open market strategy pressed Clinton administration past six year. Others argue unwise start rebuilding hospital patient still operating table. Last year standard answer u given came this: `We IMF World Bank, know best,' Indonesian Foreign Minister Ali Alatas said breakfast Washington day, reflecting crisis turned 30 year astounding growth country overnight depression. Then said everything went wrong fault, said. But now, I think people know much problem came outside, need something better. And IMF beginning fight back, awkward role institution dominated PhD. economist unaccustomed openly challenged. Every place turn read story, came in, made thing worse, said Stanley Fischer, deputy managing director fund, born Northern Rhodesia Zambia became chairman Massachusetts Institute Technology's economics department taking job put center financial storm. We frequently get blame, well-deserved, said. But politically convenient government around world cry, `The IMF made u it,' pin mistake u. That's fine. We'd rather loved, we'd like effective. MISCALCULATIONS, POLITICS AND SAFETY NETS On steaming January day, Michel Camdessus, IMF's top official, slipped Jakarta private residence President Suharto sat four-hour meeting tick off, line line, huge reform Indonesia would implement return ten billion dollar emergency aid. Two previous deal collapsed Suharto ignored fund's condition, Camdessus insisted strike deal directly Suharto, Asia's longest-serving leader. It meeting men knew different world power politics: Suharto rose general central Java, Camdessus detonated mine Algeria French army entering French Treasury way becoming head France's central bank. It there, senior IMF official recalled. He told dismantle national airplane project, clove monopoly, distribution monopoly. At one point, Camdessus looked impassive Suharto said, You see mean family, reference vast investment country's key industry. He said, `I called child, understand.' But within month, exchange Jakarta came symbolize IMF's twin troubles: Its inability understand reckon national politics country need radical reform, focus economic stabilization rather social cost action. Suharto intention fulfilling agreement. It wa, one former Cabinet member said, delaying move obvious everyone except Camdessus. Perhaps one reason IMF sometimes appears tone-deaf senior staff almost entirely composed PhD. economist. There official deep experience international politics, much le complexity Javanese culture work Indonesia. Historically, expert politics security gravitated United Nations, development expert World Bank, economist IMF creating dangerous gap crisis like one. As result, fund rudimentary understanding would happen demand met Indonesia's state monopoly quickly dissolved. While system lined pocket Suhartos friend, also distributed food, gasoline staple country stretch 3,000 mile thousand island. To help balance budget, fund demanded quick end expensive subsidy keep price food gasoline artificially low. But that, combined huge currency devaluation sparked crisis, resulted high price shortage fueled riot continue day, million Indonesians lose job. The IMF unintentionally, official insist also sped Suharto's resignation, insisting elimination crony capitalism, code word removing Suharto family center economy. Ultimately, may prove Indonesia's salvation, new government contain rioting ethnic Chinese minority whose money desperately needed save country's fast-shrinking economy. It worth noting, Fischer said week, program Asia Indonesia, Korea Thailand took hold change government. Nonetheless, Indonesia experience revived argument IMF focused stabilizing bank currency, preventing capital flight freeing market, blind social cost action. Among toughest critic sister institution, World Bank, whose main charge alleviating poverty. You've seen tension almost every day, one senior World Bank official said recently. The bank gone extraordinary length recent month differentiate role fund, announce tripling aid poorest country hit economic chaos. Even UN. Secretary General Kofi Annan joined argument, warning speech Harvard recently globalization succeed, must succeed poor rich alike. It must deliver right le rich. It must harnessed cause capital alone, development prosperity poorest world. IMF official say changing strategy see exacting great social cost. It's difficult formula get exactly right, Fischer said August, Russia teetering IMF sending $4.8 billion aid rapidly wasted. You need enough discipline send right message market keep investor fleeing. But need enough leeway keep people suffering otherwise would. In recent month, noted, IMF allowed spending sustain subsidy basic good longer period Indonesia, Korea elsewhere. There new flexibility IMF senior Indonesian official concluded recently. It lot better. A US. PAWN, OR A RUNAWAY AGENCY? The Clinton administration admits IMF many failing, many display year. But insists world gone global financial crisis without IMF century result 1930s. I doubt situation past year would much worse greater devaluation, default, contagion, greater trade dislocation without program agreed IMF finance provided, Deputy Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers told Congress last week. Many Republicans Democrats unconvinced. Even though Senate overwhelmingly approved $18 billion contribution fund help fight new crisis, House defeated measure two week ago. The fund's last hope getting money, free nearly $100 billion contribution nation waiting United States act, come House Senate try resolve budget difference conference committee next 10 day. A rejection, Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin insists, would send message around world United States turning back one institution charged restoring economic stability. Everywhere else world, though, politician businessmen insist one biggest problem IMF that, contrary view Congress, act US. Treasury's lap dog. Ask Jakarta Moscow, response same: The IMF never venture far without looking back approving nod master. When United States weighs in, however, IMF called rescue country deep trouble. Only IMF US. Treasury leverage extract commitment return billion aid. In theory, US. influence limited: It 18.5 percent vote fund. Germany, Japan, France Britain 5 percent each. But practice United States usually get way, exercising influence behind scene, often interaction Fischer Summers. The two met Fischer MIT faculty Summers graduate student taking one class, later becoming colleague MIT. Each served chief economist World Bank. It Summers instrumental placing Fischer fund's no. 2 job, day talk constantly. It's usually warm relationship, Fischer said summer. Remember, job cannot turn outsider advice can't call chief economist Wall Street firm, even many academic friend, many issue confidential. The Treasury's relation Camdessus often strained play role world diplomat, traveling globe trying coax along political leader. The tension obvious start Asia crisis. The fund made little secret displeasure United States offering direct aid Thailand, major US. ally, sign support confidence. Mindful backlash Congress Mexico bailed US. money, last thing Treasury planned do. Summers, turn, thought fund forcing Thais implement reform commitment rigorously enough disclose true financial picture. Within US. government dissension: The State Defense Departments felt United States Thailand, backed Treasury asked would like pony aid budget. There conflict. When Japan used last IMF meeting propose setting $100 billion Asia Fund one would exclude United States would probably offer aid much relaxed condition IMF doe. Rubin called Camdessus breakfast one morning told Japanese proposal would undercut IMF's authority. We've dispute Michel, Rubin reported aide returned orange juice croissant. One shot back: And 8 am. Camdessus backed Rubin's insistence walked away money Asia could used. Japan say back similar proposal weekend, time $30 billion fund. Camdessus also rankled US. official statement amounted cheerleading reassure market sometimes face fact. In June, Russia way collapse, Camdessus declared contrary market commentator imagining slow collapse Russia's economy, crisis. This major development. The bailouts Russia South Korea prime example Washington muscle IMF's turf soon major US. strategic interest involved. Last Christmas, South Korea slipped within day running hard currency pay debt December, sent secret envoy, Kim Kihwan, work rescue package. I bother going IMF, Kim recalled recently. I called Summers' office Treasury home Seoul, flew Washington went directly there. I knew would get done. Within day Treasury dispatched David Lipton, experienced veteran emergency bailouts, leaving post undersecretary international affair month, shadow IMF staff's negotiation government Seoul. Fischer displeased. To make negotiation effective, clear authority negotiating, said. WHO LOST RUSSIA? The pattern repeated summer, United States raced put together $17 billion package Russia. The IMF's staff Moscow declared Russia needed money needed enact policy would restore confidence investor. The Americans Germans came different conclusion. Soon after, US. official gathered White House situation room consider might happen Russia ruble devalued market reform collapsed push IMF come emergency money. So fund began assembling last-ditch program prop country resisted reform plan seven year. Camdessus, though, still hesitant, questioning whether IMF risk scarce resource Russia. We pull Michel along, senior Treasury official recalled. As turned out, Camdessus' instinct right approach championed Rubin Summers proved disastrously wrong. The first installment payment $4.8 billion wasted, propping currency long enough, word one IMF official, let oligarch get money country. Then Yeltsin reversed commitment, let ruble devalue anyway, began printing money abandon fired virtually every reformer government resulting collapse IMF agreement indefinite suspension aid program. Now, inside IMF Capitol Hill, recrimination lost Russia. Publicly, Fischer argues apology owed attempted Russia. But IMF official complain privately let Rubin Summers run roughshod them, striking deal fell apart within week Russian parliament rebelled Yeltsin backed away commitment. Summers responds United States took calculated risk vastly better Russia succeed succeed. The Russian collapse touched new round economic contagion, investor fleeing Latin America, triggering huge loss hedge fund like Long Term Capital, Greenwich, Conn., investment firm needed rescued Wall Street powerhouse whose money invested. Russia turning point, said Robert Hormats, vice chairman Goldman, Sachs &AMP; Co. It made world realize country fail, even IMF Treasury intercede. And changed perception risk.

Primakov may opposed wildly unpopular currency control. He may worried plan would would set panic buying dollar, depressing ruble. Or may simply trying keep distance Maslyukov's plan Russia try wrangle next disbursement, $4.3 billion, International Monetary Fund. The particular could modified, many people following maneuvering say believe represents basic thrust government's thinking.

Calls Soviet-style control part plan drafted First Deputy Prime Minister Yuri Maslyukov leaked press apparently created rift within Cabinet. The plan drew heavy criticism Zadornov, Gerashchenko called idea banning foreign currency sale mad idea.

In season crashing bank, plunging ruble, bouncing paycheck, failing cropsand rotating government, maybe ultimate insult. But nation bore Tolstoy Chekhov, still regard well-written letter labor love, buckling little week, longer wish good health Baba Anya Omsk. The Post Office broke. In 60 country's 89 statelike region, 1,000 mail car sidetracked, many stuffed 18 ton letter, newspaper parcel. The state Railway Ministry refuse carry mail Post Office make good 210 million ruble old bill $13 million today's dollar, $35 million dollar six week ago. Air mail, amount one every four five letter, also suspended one Moscow's major airport week, Post Office coughed 5 million ruble old bill. A second airport still demanding 3 million ruble past-due debt. So much mail backed post office Moscow elsewhere simply stopped accepting out-of-town mail, except area easily reached truck. Delivery schedule fallen week, perhaps month, behind. The situation really extraordinary, said Vladimir Sherekhov, deputy chief mail service administration government's Communications Committee. We've never anything like before. Maybe Post Office lucky. Extraordinary rule elsewhere Russia.

Earlier week, official said Russia's Arctic shipping route may close next month half nation's icebreaker disrepair money fix them. The oldest ship ancient nickname Granny. Such anecdotal evidence Russia losing wheel, like one old, ill-maintained Volga sedan, everywhere. But oddly, real sign public distress particularly common, perhaps system rarely seems shed part big postal system. If US. Postal Service increasingly pipeline sweepstakes notice bill, Russian Post Office still hold special place national conversation. Russians still write letter other, frequently fervently, many remote region get news mail. Millions use mail ship canned good provision needy relative friend faraway area, especially vital service winter. And last year, Post Office become vehicle growing mail-order trade book, clothes catalog item readily available outside big city. Exactly rumbled halt dispute. What clear Post Office Railway Ministry suffer ail every Russian venture, private public alike: Nobody pay bill. The state Railway Ministry complains continually stiffed customer believe railroad honor-bound carry freight whether paid not. The government specified nearly 40 category freight railroad must carry next nothing. Among biggest deadbeat power ministry military interior department pay Soviet time feel little need pay now. It's psychology formed socialist period, said Tatiana Pashkova, deputy spokeswoman ministry, situation exists Post Office. We've dispute long time. Always try understand difference. But can't carry cargo free. No kidding, say Post Office: It, too, owed 200 million ruble government agency, barred raising rate even though freight cost outstripping revenue. Moreover, Post Office also required government carry form mail, pension check, reduced rate. Officials state Communications Department say also suspect ulterior motive railroads' actions: struggle dominate thriving mail-order business. Here's competition u railroad delivery parcel, I think decision made railroad mainly explained competition, Sherekhov said. They blame u carrying commercial cargo instead mail. The Railways Ministry's spokeswoman, Ms. Pashkova, said commercial cargo indeed problem, railroad know Post Office already gotten cash transport package. The railroad still waiting share money, said. In meantime, situation come boil. In late September railroad cut mail service Moscow, effectively decapitating postal system forcing official draft fleet truck move letter city. Hundreds empty full rail car clogged local yard point moving car position unloading become difficult. At last count, 39 loaded car awaiting service one yard. And customer getting angry. We've gotten kind complaint, said Viktor Salikov, deputy Communications Department's mail shipping center. People even coming u, searching mail sent week ago.

The antenna must fully deployed order Zarya's manual docking system work; system needed next summer, official said. The problem Zarya battery; astronaut took replacement part. The 36-foot, 25,000-pound Unity, first American-made component, serve connecting passageway, vestibule, future module. It crucial Zarya Unity joined; could connected robot arm, NASA would sent two spacewalking astronaut manually fit together. In all, three spacewalks planned Endeavour's 12-day flight, hook electrical connection two module install handrail tool future crew. The joined module released Endeavour work completed. NASA estimate 43 launch 159 spacewalks needed mission assemble entire orbiting complex. Once completed, 16-nation space station mass 1 million pound, longer football field, house seven astronaut cosmonaut. For second day row, astronaut boarded space shuttle Endeavour Friday liftoff NASA's first space station construction flight. Let's go this, said commander Robert Cabana. Amen, replied launch controller. Rain cloudy sky threat. But NASA confident master alarm Endeavour's cockpit would behave; went 4{ minute go countdown Thursday, forcing delay. NASA five minute le day launch Endeavour order meet first space station part, put orbit two week ago Russians. The shuttle contains second station component. The master alarm blared red light flashed shuttle lift early Thursday. By time controller traced problem momentary drop hydraulic pressure decided press ahead, late missed cutoff second two. Sure, frustrating, said Bill Readdy, shuttle program director veteran shuttle commander. But thing right. We thing book, we're going cut corner even mean shaving second two. The six astronaut crawled shuttle, two threw hand. Cabana held thumb index finger half-inch apart: We close. The problem confined one Endeavour's three hydraulic pressure unit. The pressure dropped long enough trigger alarm, evidently sensitive switch, returned normal. NASA engineer spent day examining problem, found nothing wrong system confident would reoccur. Endeavour's flight already year late cash crunch Russia, one NASA's partner building international space station. The one-day delay cost NASA $600000, mostly fuel overtime pay. Aboard Endeavour American-made connecting passageway named Unity. The astronaut use shuttle robot arm capture Russian space station piece attach Unity. Then, two spacewalker hook electrical connection cable two cylinder, attach handrail tool future crew. Until alarm sounded, looked though weather would problem. Rain cloud moved Atlantic 1{ hour liftoff, drifted away minute spare. Secretary State Madeleine Albright dignitary around world gathered drizzle see Endeavour crew off. Here 16 country cooperating venture future, said Albright, expected back Friday's attempt. This good investment. The planet's daring construction job began Friday shuttle Endeavour carried orbit six astronaut first U.S.-built part international space station expected cost $100 billion. After last-minute alarm shuttle forced postponement early Thursday, launch went flawlessly 3:36 Friday morning, right schedule. The night sky clear, moon full. With roar, Endeavour made fiery ascent briefly turned Florida coastline night day. More five minute 500 mile later, spaceship's main engine could still seen distance, twinkling like new star. On 12-day flight, Endeavour's astronaut locate Russian part already orbit, grasp shuttle's robot arm attach new US. module. Wielding tool hundred mile Earth, working methodically cold void, astronaut starting five-year assembly likely make construction Pyramids great cathedral look like child's play. Construction station, research facility, require estimated 160 space walk, which, safety reason, always done two people. When complete, international space station, dominated solar power array, cover area equal two football field. Modules interconnected laboratory living quarter seven astronaut form habitat equal two 747 jetliner. The station's battery alone, lined up, would extend half-mile. The project entail high risk, technical difficulty putting together unforgiving environment space, along danger inherent flying space shuttle construction site. The work complicated international politics worry money. The Russians, whose participation partnership clinched post-Cold War deal five year ago, wild card. Moscow's economic political woe left Western official unsure ability willingness come share money technology. At time, station's cost rising, critic among scientist worry appetite money consume federal financing. The project's total cost subject debate, credible estimate put price assembly operation decade, station's estimated lifetime, $110 billion. Of that, American taxpayer spend roughly $96 billion, project's 15 foreign partner $14 billion. The station intended grand laboratory where, environment weightlessness, investigator develop new material new drug explore physiology's remaining mystery, part human may someday know adapt long space flight world. Friday, case, little heard project praise. Great show, Endeavour, mission control Houston radioed six astronaut shuttle went orbit. At Florida spaceport, Secretary State Madeleine Albright lauded launching team new venture. That truly, truly fantastic, told team liftoff. And important, added, many nation working together kind issue 21st century going concerned with. So congratulation you, secretary said. Stupendous work. The main cargo Thursday Unity module, first U.S.-built station part. Small compared giant come three dozen shuttle flight assembly, unit 18 foot long, weighs 13 ton serve connecting hub module. Saturday, one astronaut, Lt. Col. Nancy Currie Army, shuttle's robot arm hoist Unity payload bay secure Endeavour's docking system, moving unit horizontal vertical position. Then, Sunday, astronaut rendezvous module known Zarya, Sunrise, Russia launched orbit Kazakhstan Nov. 20. Financed United States built Russia, Zarya, 41 foot long, kind tugboat embryonic station, furnishing power propulsion well communication rendezvous ability. When Endeavour's payload bay within 10 foot Zarya, Colonel Currie reach robot arm pull Russian module position Unity. The mechanical arm never moved anything big. Zarya, completely weightless space, 21 ton mass. If mishandled, crush kill. As Col. Currie hold Zarya steady, Endeavour's commander, Col. Robert Cabana Marine Corps, veteran three space flight, nudge shuttle forward join two station piece together. When mated special attachment, Zarya Unity form station's first element, 63 foot long 78 foot wide tip solar array. Starting Monday, pair space-walking astronaut hook electrical connection data cable unit, attach antenna install tool handrail future visitor. The builder Col. Jerry Ross Air Force, 50, Dr. James Newman, 42, physicist. Their series three space walk continue Wednesday end Saturday, Dec. 12. As construction go outside, astronaut inside Endeavour busy making preparation enter new station connecting tunnel docking system. Next Thursday, crew enter embryonic station first time, installing portable fan light. Friday enter, prepare arrival 1999 next major element, first one built financed Russia. The astronaut Endeavour pilot, Maj. Frederick Sturckow Marine Corps, mission specialist, Sergei Krikalev Russian Space Agency. After separating new outpost, crew bring Endeavour back Kennedy Space Center Dec. 15, mission length shy 12 day. Gretchen McClain, NASA's director Washington international space station, said interview overall cost actually small individual Americans. Over lifetime, said, annual cost equal pizza soft drink nation's 96 million taxpayer. US. cost construction, added, $24 billion, operation year 2012 $10.4 billion, total $34.4 billion. Most expert outside agency consider figure ridiculously low ignores many billion dollar spent early development work well cost numerous shuttle flight, run $800 million apiece. Following series intricate maneuver skillful use space shuttle Endeavour's robot arm, astronaut Sunday joined first two many segment form international space station. The shuttle crew six snared Russian-made Zarya control module chasing around Earth ever-closing orbit throughout day. Less hour rendezvous 240 mile Earth shortly 6 p.m., Lt. Col. Nancy Currie Army deftly used 50-foot arm grab 40,000-pound cylinder craft passed Russia slowly pull toward shuttle. Seeing Zarya close, Col. Robert Cabana Marines, shuttle commander, confirmed two antenna failed deploy module following launch Kazakhstan Nov. 20. There earlier indication antenna, used later station manually assist spacecraft docking, extended. Currie took almost two hour painstakingly move Zarya American-made Unity docking port positioned Endeavour's cargo bay. When two piece aligned within inch one another, Cabana fired small thruster rocket raised shuttle, allowing module clamp together. The two station piece, together measuring 77 foot end end combined mass 70,000 pound, first 100 major component united space next five year form orbiting outpost would weigh almost million pound span area size two football field. More 40 additional mission US. shuttle Russian rocket used haul component supply orbit, astronaut nation spend almost 1,800 hour spacewalks assemble entire structure. The spece station expected cost partnership 16 nation $40 billion construct. Bringing piece together first step mating them. A pair astronaut make three spacewalks week, first Monday, hook electrical communication cable, remove cover, attach handrail perform task get module work one unit. The difficult part Sunday's mating $240 million Zarya $300 million Unity bringing together shuttle caught Russian unit. Currie use Canadian-built robot arm place Zarya top Unity without able see piece joined. Unity, raised Endeavour's cargo bay Saturday, large blocked Currie's view mating fixture shuttle's window. She used view remote camera computerized vision system built arm estimate relative position two large segment. The computerized system examined marking module, computed relationship one another using mark displayed result laptop computer. We've never done anything like before, Currie said flight, adding practiced difficult maneuver 100 time last two year. The flight Endeavour, took Cape Canaveral, Fla., last Friday, gone according plan early Sunday, mission control ordered shuttle change orbit slightly avoid piece space debris. Air Force space debris tracker noted shuttle pas within 1.6 mile spent stage American booster rocket launched last month. Although considered safe distance, shuttle controller decided widen separation five mile extra precaution. Endeavour astronaut closed Sunday capture first piece international space station, Russian-made Zarya control module connected Unity chamber aboard shuttle. Stacking two giant cylinder 240 mile Earth considered difficult part mission. The job fell Nancy Currie, shuttle crane operator deftly hoisted repositioned Unity cargo bay Saturday. The two station piece big 77 foot tip one tip combined mass 70,000 pound Currie crewmates going rely computerized vision system camera view, rather direct line sight. Such blind docking never attempted before. Mission Control gave astronaut plenty time task. The main thing I've tried last two year working flight make sure time. We margin everything, said flight director Bob Castle. Before beginning final approach Zarya Russian Sunrise shuttle's six astronaut steer clear chunk rocket launched last month California. Mission Control ordered pilot fire shuttle thruster put extra three mile Endeavour space junk, putting Endeavour total five mile orbiting debris. The smaller gap would probably little close comfort, Mission Control said. The bigger worry, far, Endeavour's pursuit capture Zarya, coupling Unity. The shuttle's 50-foot robot arm never assigned handle object massive 44,000-pound Zarya, power propulsion module launched Kazakhstan Nov. 20. It provide necessary electricity steering fledgling space station permanent control module launched next summer. The 36-foot, 25,000-pound Unity serve connecting passageway, vestibule, future module. In case Zarya Unity could connected robot arm, two spacewalking astronaut would manually fit together. The astronaut would going anyway Monday attach electrical connector cable two component. In all, three spacewalks planned Endeavour's 12-day flight. NASA estimate 43 launch 159 spacewalks needed mission assemble entire orbiting complex. Once completed, 16-nation space station mass 1 million pound, longer football field, house seven astronaut cosmonaut. Endeavour's astronaut connected first two building block international space station Sunday, creating seven-story tower shuttle cargo bay. It first time Russian-built Zarya control module made-in-America Unity chamber ever touched. It looked perfect and, hopefully, long-lasting fit. We capture Zarya, commander Robert Cabana announced moment two piece came together. Congratulations crew good ship Endeavour, replied Mission Control. That's terrific. The 240-mile-high construction job began two hour earlier Nancy Currie's capture Zarya (Russian Sunrise) using shuttle robot arm. We're halfway home, Cabana said. Then came hard part: stacking two giant cylinder cargo bay. The two station piece big 77 foot tip one tip combined mass 70,000 pound Currie crewmates rely computerized vision system camera view, rather direct line sight. This first time blind docking ever attempted. Currie positioned solar-winged Zarya, still end shuttle robot arm, several inch directly Unity. It slow going; wanted needed perfect alignment. Once sure it, Cabana fired Endeavour's thruster, brief burst raised shuttle thereby Unity enough docking mechanism two station component snap together. The historical moment occurred South Pacific. It took several try, however, Zarya Unity pulled tightly together. The docking ring would retract properly; Mission Control quickly traced problem attached robot arm asked crew release hold docked Zarya. That trick. The union intended last station's 15-year lifetime set stage spacewalk two astronaut Monday attach electrical connector cable two component. Mission Control thought Sunday's work might take hour longer planned gave six astronaut plenty time task. But everything occurred le supposed to, aside piece space junk strayed close. Before beginning final approach Zarya, six astronaut steer clear chunk rocket launched last month California. Mission Control ordered pilot fire shuttle thruster put extra three mile Endeavour space junk, putting Endeavour total five mile orbiting debris. The smaller gap would probably little close comfort, Mission Control said. The bigger worry, far, Endeavour's pursuit capture Zarya, coupling Unity. The shuttle's 50-foot robot arm never handled object massive 41-foot, 44,000-pound Zarya, power propulsion module launched Kazakstan Nov. 20. It provide necessary electricity steering fledgling space station permanent control module launched next summer. Minutes Zarya's capture, Cabana called two antenna module still undeployed Russian flight controller feared. The antenna must fully deployed order Zarya's manual docking system work; system needed next summer, official said. The problem Zarya battery; astronaut took replacement part. The 36-foot, 25,000-pound Unity, first American-made component, serve connecting passageway, vestibule, future module. It crucial Zarya Unity joined; could connected robot arm, NASA would sent two spacewalking astronaut manually fit together. In all, three spacewalks planned Endeavour's 12-day flight, hook electrical connection two module install handrail tool future crew. The joined module released Endeavour work completed. NASA estimate 43 launch 159 spacewalks needed mission assemble entire orbiting complex. Once completed, 16-nation space station mass 1 million pound, longer football field, house seven astronaut cosmonaut. A last-minute alarm forced NASA halt Thursday's launching space shuttle Endeavour, mission start assembling international space station. Another attempt Endeavour crew six astronaut scheduled Friday 3:36 am. This first time three year, 19 flight, shuttle countdown stopped spaceship fueled crew aboard craft ready go. The uncommon delay prompted frown furrowed brow here, although official stressed entirely warranted. We want err conservative side, Ralph Roe, launch director Kennedy Space Center, said news conference sudden halt countdown 19 second liftoff. Everything going smoothly rare nighttime launching, set 3:58 Thursday morning. The weather, forecast iffy, turned fine, sky alight nearly full moon. But length so-called launching window wa, planned, unusually short 10 minute. That brevity result Endeavour's rendezvous space-station part Russia put orbit last month. The show-stopper arose four minute liftoff computer space shuttle set master alarm. Controllers studied data discovered momentary pressure drop one hydraulic system control movement shuttle's engine rudder flight surface. Officials eventually decided pressure drop insignificant, resolved press ahead. But late: time run one procedure needed keep shuttle's fuel supercold. So countdown aborted 19 second blastoff. The six astronaut began emerge shuttle hour later ultimately headed bed rest another attempt early Friday. ","On Friday the shuttle Endeavor carried six astronauts into orbit to start building an international space station.The launch occurred after Russia and U.S. officials agreed not to delay the flight in order to orbit closer to MIR, and after a last-minute alarm forced a postponement.On Sunday astronauts joining the Russian-made Zarya control module cylinder with the American-made module to form a 70,000 pounds mass 77 feet long.NASA estimates 43 more launches and 159 more space walks are needed to assemble the complex.When completed the 16-nation space station will be longer than a football field.It will be used to study adaptation to space flight.","Russia and NASA jointly decided against a Russian cost-cutting proposal to orbit the 2nd space station, a 16-country cooperative project, closer to Mir, citing complexity, risk, and bad sun angles.After 5 years of assembly, the research station will house 7 people.A 12-day shuttle mission will attach the US Unity module to the Russian Zarya, already in orbit.Thursday's launch was delayed by a pressure drop.A 2nd attempt Friday was perfect.Unity was attached to Zarya in a blind docking using cameras and computer images.Electrical and cable connections come next.Unity will serve as a passageway for future modules.Two Zarya antennas failed to deploy.","After discarding a suggested change of orbit, the Russian Space Agency went ahead with plans to launch its Zarya module of the international space station on Nov. 20, 1998.Although delayed for a day, U.S. plans to launch the space shuttle Endeavour carrying the U.S. module Unity and six astronauts were carried out on Dec. 4.The astronauts' job was to connect Unity with the already-orbiting Zarya as the first step in assembling 100 major components of the planned space station.Using the shuttle's 50-foot robot arm, the two modules were joined setting the stage for a spacewalk by two astronauts the next day to attach electrical connectors and cables.","The International Space Station when completed will have a million pound mass and be longer than a football field.It will house up to seven space explorers.The initial assembly of space station components involves linking the US Unity, carried into space by the shuttle Endeavour, with the Russian Zarya.The Russians had asked for a different launch profile in order to be able to transfer equipment from its MIR station, but that was not possible.Endeavour astronauts successfully completed the complicated maneuvers to join the two space objects.NASA estimates that 43 more launches will be required to completely assemble the 16-nation space station."
33,"Making first collective decision monetary policy, 11 European nation launching common currency Jan. 1 cut interest rate Thursday surprise move market confidence. Ten 11 country joining European economic union dropped key interest rate 3 percent, Portugal making significant plunge, 3.75 percent. Austria made smallest cut, 3.2 percent. The exception Italy, cut 4 3.5 percent. It expected drop common rate time euro launched. Unifying interest rate critical step laying groundwork monetary union, analyst generally expected rate settle around level Germany's, 3.3 percent cut, 3 percent. However, interest rate level become contentious political issue center-left government Germany France pushing rate cut help spur growth combat unemployment, stuck 10.9 percent nation adopting euro. The head European Central Bank set monetary policy euro nation, Wim Duisenberg, Thursday suggested government reform rigid labor market create job, pressure cut rate. The remark Brussels cut made gave hint rate drop imminent, made clear resistance political pressure strong ever. So strong, fact, Dutch Finance Minister Gerrit Zalm said feared bank would delay decision. What feared that, order prove independence, ECB would go analysis would wait longer, would nonsensical, Zalm said. Hans Tietmeyer, run German Bundesbank ECB modeled, hinted rate cut designed boost confidence new currency, dampened global economic crisis Europe's worsening outlook. The coordinated rate cut could lead reduction current pessimism reduction financial market turbulence, Tietmeyer said. The cut seemed desired impact. Frankfurt's main index closed 2.1 percent, France's 1.8 percent. The cut also boosted market Spain, Belgium, Italy even Britain, among nation launching euro. The reaction is, `Oh good, they're little bit prop euro economy.' But confidence taken quite hit across Europe recently, I think action ECB needed next year, maybe 2.5 percent, James Mitchell, senior London-based strategist Nomura. An economist Banque Bruxelles Lambert, Liesbeth Van de Craen, said cut timely. We clearly headed slowdown, said. Until recently, Europe's economy held relatively well damage Asia Russia's economic crisis unstable financial market. But two day ago, Duisenberg painted bleakest picture yet Europe's economy, warning growth likely slow 2.5 percent next year earlier expectation 3 percent. The rate cut may help. By making cheaper borrow money, rate cut lead investment new business, making le worthwhile save inducing people spend. That expands economy. The 11 country launching euro Austria, Belgium, Ireland, Italy, Finland, France, Germany, Luxembourg, Netherlands, Spain Portugal. Wim Duisenberg, head new European Central Bank, said interview published Wednesday step completing half term earlier agreed. I hoped ask question. The answer no, Duisenberg told Le Monde daily, asked would step four year job. Duisenberg named spring head new European Central Bank, govern policy euro, new single currency go effect Jan. 1. France surprised euro partner proposing central banker, Jean-Claude Trichet, last minute job Duisenberg expected secure easily. Although elected easily, Duisenberg agreed step four year eight year term although since said gentleman's agreement exists.

The two announcement show introduction currency, euro, reshaping Europe's financial landscape, requiring Europeans think Continental rather national term finance business. And suggested exchange authority Paris, ruffled announcement July strategic alliance London Stock Exchange Deutsche Borse Frankfurt, abandoned effort set rival market also seeking gain initiative organizing Nov. 27 gathering. Some doubt remained, however, timing technicality French entry alliance. Foreign Minister Dominique Strauss-Kahn said, Paris joining alliance creation January 1999 joint company. However, official London Frankfurt welcomed idea principle declined say whether timing arrangement far advanced Strauss-Kahn implied. I'm afraid I can't confirm anything like that, spokeswoman London Stock Exchange said. The appearance well ahead reality point, said American banker, spoke condition anonymity. Not that, notion Europe-wide exchange raise technical question compatibility trading system also regulation governing stock market operation country use euro beginning January.

Now friend co-worker Italian, French, Greek, Spanish, German, even Russian. You feel everywhere. The street jammed foreigner. Not tourist people live work here. Baby-boomers Europe often describe 1968 generation, weaned protest social turmoil convulsed European society 30 year ago. Less dramatic equally significant 1968 law guaranteeing freedom movement within six country Common Market. A Frenchman could work Holland, Italian could work Germany without permit. Back economist dourly predicted huge migration, particularly unskilled laborer moving southern country prosperous north. Actually, huge industry like steel shrank 1970s '80s, job opportunity working-class Europeans. There 15 country within European Union, small percentage citizen moved country, according estimate prepared Eurostat. Those mostly find job service industry waiter, maid garbage collector. There still legal barrier preventing doctor, lawyer academic finding work country. So far European Union profitably put use white-collar business executive eagerly followed career opportunity across national border, time zone language barrier.

Now European unification TV time; seeped people's unconscious. Even people care politics recognize face Tony Blair Jacques Chirac. Ten year ago, people did. According European Union, Britain twice many EU citizen France, country highest concentration resident European country. According estimate based survey prepared Eurostat, nearly third resident tiny Luxembourg, low unemployment high standard living, European country.

Paradoxically, perhaps, Britain, one major European nation held joining euro, widely viewed nerve center new cosmopolitanism, headquarters New Europeans banker business executive drawn London's financial district, flexible bureaucracy universality English language. Perhaps surprisingly, London also serf example another le obvious aspect European cosmopolitanism breakdown certain social barrier. Studying abroad privilege reserved son daughter Europe's elite.

Juergen Schrempp, head Daimler, started car mechanic, noted Stephen Szabo, professor European Affairs Johns Hopkins University School International Studies Washington. That would unthinkable Germany 20 year ago. Social mobility, moreover, fueled movement. When people transfer another country, find easier shed psychological cultural trapping home. I could never kind job I I stayed Paris, Routier explained. France still hierarchical. Bosses want know went school, father doe. In London, none matter long make money. Many Britons still view country weighed heavy class distinction. For example, Tony Smith, 36, editor several Portuguese magazine Lisbon, seized opportunity study Vienna 14 year ago, never looked back. He lived Europe, fluent Portuguese, Spanish, German, French Serbo-Croatian. His father, car mechanic, traveled Britain 1992. Smith said could never succeeded well stayed home.

In Germany, example, business people pushing ahead change pulling politician along behind kicking screaming, Szabo said. They looking larger market feel competitive pressure globalization. Politicians responding domestic constituency. They answering international one. In surprise move, nation adopting new European currency, euro, dropped key interest rate Thursday, effectively setting rate adopted throughout euro zone Jan. 1. Ten 11 country adopting euro dropped interest rate 3 percent. Italy dropped 3.5 percent 4 percent. The coordinated move key step preparing economic union. Setting common interest rate particularly contentious issue center-left government Germany France pressed lower rate help boost growth cut unemployment, stubborn 10.9 percent euro zone.

There cynicism conclusion, clear-eyed compassionate acknowledgment thing are, quality honestly termed wisdom, Miller, novelist, wrote. We grateful handed u generous measure. Saramago learned award Thursday Frankfurt airport, preparing fly home via Madrid Lanzarote Canary Islands attending Frankfurt Book Fair. Earlier week, participated round-table Portuguese writer topic, Why I still Communist. He immediately returned fair received cheer bouquet rose. I personally happy myself, said. I also happy country. Later told news conference: The Portuguese language wait 100 year this. There way mean protecting language become museum, something alive. The writer's role protect work it. The award also celebrated Lisbon, President Jorge Sampaio described recognition Portuguese culture, local Communist leader, Carlos Carvalho, saw credit party. As member party, noted solemnly, Saramago make great contribution ideal struggle social change. The laureate's fiction, though, never overtly political. Saramago, whose body work includes poetry, essay, play journal well 10 novel, unusual emerged major literary figure age 60. His novel since translated 30 language, selling particularly well Portugal, Brazil, Spain, Italy Germany. While well known United States, novel always critically well received there. For late blooming, though, Saramago long dreamed becoming writer. Born family rural laborer raised Lisbon, forced poverty leave school teen-ager learn trade car mechanic. Yet managed publish small novel age 25. Later, found work Lisbon publishing company, oppressive censorial atmosphere Salazar dictatorship discouraged writing. It Portugal's April 1974 revolution Saramago felt free find voice. A member Portuguese Communist Party since 1969, served editor Lisbon newspaper, Diario de Noticias, 18-month period left looked likely seize power Portugal. But anti-Communist backlash November 1975 forced newspaper began translating French text Portuguese make end meet. In late 1970s, also turned novel, publishing three succession 1977, 1978 1980. But 1982, Baltasar Blimunda (Memorial Convento Portuguese), achieved international breakthrough. This rich, multifaceted polysemous text time historical, social individual perspective, Swedish Academy noted Thursday. The insight wealth imagination give expression characteristic Saramago's work whole. Set 18th-century Portugal Inquisition, book tell baroque effort war veteran, Baltasar, visionary, Blimunda, escape heaven aboard flying machine powered human will captured hypersensory Blimunda. This fantastic story take place real background tortuous construction massive Mafra Convent thousand men held grip Inquisition. When novel published United States 1987, Irving Howe acclaimed brilliant The New York Times Book Review. Mr. Saramago constantly present voice European skepticism, connoisseur irony, Howe wrote. I think I hear prose echo Enlightenment sensibility, caustic shrewd. In next novel, The Year Death Ricardo Reis, also homage great Portuguese poet Fernando Pessoa, appears ghost, Saramago set story early year Salazar dictatorship, tale following romantic sexual misadventure poet-physician. Writing The New York Times, Herbert Mitgang called rare, old-fashioned novel lyrical, symbolic meditative. Saramago, whose sense literary freedom evident unconventional punctuation conflicting use tense, sought different form freedom The Stone Raft, imago confusion unleashed Iberian peninsula suddenly break free rest Europe begin drifting toward New World threatens collide Azores. To delight Britons, Gibraltar left behind. Unsurprisingly, bitter satire, The Gospel According Jesus Christ, proved controversial, God shown using innocently human Jesus create religion spawned violence intolerance. When Lisbon jury picked book Portugal's entry 1992 European literary prize, country's conservative government vetoed choice blasphemous. It Saramago decided leave small, crowded apartment Lisbon relative solitude Lanzarote. The History Siege Lisbon, published United States last year, whimsical tale set motion decision humble proofreader publishing house insert word key passage standard history Portugal. With lunatic creative act, Edmund White put The New York Times Book Review, totally derails national saga affirming crusader fact help liberate 12th-century Lisbon Moorish occupation. White ended July 1997 review prescient remark. Word Saramago overdue Nobel Prize, noted. No candidate better claim lasting recognition novelist. With recent publication Blindness United States, Saramago's latest novel, Todos o Nomes, All Names still awaits translation English. In tradition Andre Gide Julian Green, though, embarked journal. The fourth volume Cadernos de Lanzarote published Lisbon. Saramago receive Nobel Prize, worth equivalent $967,500 year, ceremony Stockholm Dec. 10. Three American pharmacologist awarded Nobel Prize Monday surprising discovery natural production gas, nitric oxide, mediate wide variety bodily action. Those include widening blood vessel, helping regulate blood pressure, initiating erection, battling infection, preventing formation blood clot acting signal molecule nervous system. The prize, physiology medicine, went Dr. Robert Furchgott, 82, State University New York Brooklyn; Dr. Louis Ignarro, 57, University California Los Angeles, Dr. Ferid Murad, 62, University Texas Medical School Houston. The announcement significant phase discovery two Monday's winner meeting 1986 elicited avalanche research activity many different laboratory around world, said Nobel committee Karolinska Institute Stockholm, make award. Its citation said research led new treatment treating heart lung disease, shock impotence. Ignarro discovered principle led use Viagra anti-impotency drug, said Dr. Sten Orrenius, professor toxicology Karolinska Institute. Nitric oxide start process blood vessel penis widen produce erection. Nitric oxide, chemical relative anesthetic gas nitrous oxide, better known common air pollutant formed nitrogen burn, automobile exhaust fume. But scientist know distributed widely body. The discovery honored Monday made largely 1980s time scientist knew bacteria produced nitric oxide think important animal human. The award committee said first discovery gas act signal molecule organism. The discovery startling nitric oxide totally different known signal molecule unstable converted nitrate nitrite within 10 second. Recipients Nobel Prize, including lobbied for year, often profess surprise learning award. This year's winner refreshingly candid. Furchgott said planned sleep late Monday, holiday, awakened 5:30 home Hewlett, NY. He said knew previous Nobel prize winner nominated award, still somewhat surprised receive it. I guess I good friend voting, Furchgott said. He said could get back sleep. Murad said pondered odds thought maybe I could win prize, maybe couple year. He described award culmination career said happens, incredible. Ignarro traveling Italy. Dr. Gerald Levey, dean UCLA, said actually anticipated day four year now. The three 1998 winner never worked together, talked lot shop talk meeting, Furchgott said. Dr. Valentin Fuster, president American Heart Association head cardiology Mt. Sinai Hospital Manhattan, said discovery nitric oxide function one important history cardiovascular medicine. Doctors learned prize-winning research heart disease, endothelium, inner lining artery, make le nitric oxide. Drugs like nitroglycerine, however, help replenish store nitric oxide. Now, drug company trying develop powerful heart drug based newer knowledge nitric oxide's role signal molecule. Researchers also learned nitric oxide produced endothelium rapidly spread cell membrane underlying muscle cell artery. Then shut muscle contraction artery, thus widening reducing blood pressure. Inhalation nitric oxide gas saved life people certain lung disease, particularly infant developed dangerously high pulmonary blood pressure. But regulating amount nitric oxygen inhaled critical much lethal. Nitric oxide play harmful role collapse circulatory system, shock, resulting overwhelming microbial infection. Bacteria release product cause white blood cell release enormous amount nitric oxide. As result, blood pressure drop. Scientists trying develop drug block production nitric oxide infection. White blood cell also play role attacking cancerous cell. The gas also induce type programmed cell death known apoptosis. Scientists studying nitric oxide's effect immune system stop growth cancer. They also exploring nitric oxide's possible role regulating body temperature. Doctors measuring production nitric oxide lung intestine diagnose number ailment, including asthma colitis, studying role menstruation. Nitric oxide formed nerve cell spread rapidly direction activate cell vicinity influence many function, like behavior mobility intestinal tract. Nitric oxide also studied role smell memory. Nitric oxide's role still unfolding; scientist written thousand scientific paper recent year started journal, Nitric Oxide. The Nobel committee cited Furchgott performing 1980 ingenious experiment showed drug, acetylcholine, widened blood vessel inner layer, endothelium, intact. Furchgott concluded blood vessel widen endothelial cell produce signal molecule called EDRF, endothelium-derived relaxing factor, relaxes smooth muscle cell blood vessel. Furchgott's finding led quest identify factor, citation said. (OPTIONAL TRIM CAN BEGIN HERE) The citation refer accident Furchgott's laboratory played major role discovery. In 1995, Annual Review Pharmacology Toxicology, Furchgott wrote May 5, 1978, first series planned experiment artery rabbit, technician follow direction correctly. The technician performed one step experiment instead supposed wash drug used earlier phase experiment. Furchgott expected artery would contract. Instead, relaxed. It first time seen drug study produce reaction, used insight plan additional experiment. Furchgott omitted technician's name paper another 1996 Journal American Medical Association. On Monday, said David Davidson technician. (OPTIONAL TRIM ENDS HERE) The committee cited Ignarro concluding 1986, brilliant series analysis conducted independently Furchgott, EDRF identical nitric oxide. Furchgott said Ignarro made announcement symposium 1986 Mayo Clinic Rochester, Minn., paper published 1998. Murad cited work conducted year worked University Virginia Charlottesville, Stanford University Palo Alto, Calif., Abbott Laboratories Illinois. Murad said felt fortunate heard Furchgott report early work EDRF 1980. Murad showed gas could regulate important cellular function studied nitroglycerin related heart drug led release nitric oxide. (OPTIONAL TRIM CAN BEGIN HERE) In early training Case Western Reserve University Cleveland, Murad worked laboratory Dr. Theodore Rall, also trained another Nobel prize winner, Dr. Alfred Gilman University Texas Southwestern Dallas. Gilman said interview believed Rall, retired living Charlottesville, Va., first scientist trained two Nobel Prize winner. In addition, Rall worked Dr. Earl Sutherland, also Nobel Prize. In early reseach year, Murad worked chemical known cyclic guanosine monophosphate, later turned critical nitric oxide story. Murad's trainee referred early work dumping experiment could laboratory time crudely add various hormone agent slice tissue, cell culture. It took year develop refined technique led understanding nitric oxide's many role body. But many year, scientific community skeptical ability free radical like nitric oxide activate enzyme, Murad said 1996 Furchgott shared Albert Lasker basic medical research award. (OPTIONAL TRIM ENDS HERE) The Nobel Prizes created Alfred Nobel, whose invention dynamite involved use nitroglycerine. The award committee noted odd twist year's award. When Nobel developed chest pain heart disease, said, refused take nitroglycerine doctor prescribed knew caused headache. Nobel dismissed nitroglycerine's benefit relief chest pain. Nobel died 1896. The prize three scientist share worth $938,000. When Alfred Nobel wrote direction establishing literature prize name, chose unclear word scratched letter. Questions prize engaged piqued literary world ever since. A new chapter mystery written Thursday, Swedish Academy announces year's winner world's prestigious prize writer. The prize focus intense medium attention Swedish capital clamor journalist generally drowns question: Why world care much literary choice handful people quiet remote country? Does Nobel Prize really recognize best? When asked question, Swedish Academy permanent secretary Sture Allen smiled said Look list prizewinners! The answer obscures much clarifies. On one hand, Nobel Prize recognized world-renowned writer Isaac Bashevis Singer brought little-known wonder light, Wislawa Szymborska. But prize arguably also honored mediocre, heaping attention would fairly served obscurity. Among winner first prize 1901, Sully Prudhomme.

What, exactly, meant ideal** unclear Academy's choice reflected confusion. The Academy chosen interpret word apply work ranging good-hearted charm Szymborska's poetry crushing hopelessness Samuel Beckett's writing. When Nobel wrote word ideal Swedish idealisk** superimposed last couple letter previous one. Allen curious understand Nobel's thought engaged forensic expert try find earlier letter were. The expert succeeded point. He found first word Nobel wrote idealirad, word exist. Despite inclarity around edge, Allen said confident Academy's choice bolster Nobel's core idea literature would basis kind progress. About year's choice, say that: Academy bound keep deliberation secret. But observer love speculate might win, even who's shortlist prize, year worth 7.6 million kronor (about dlrs 974,000).

There Portuguse author, like Fernando Pessoa, whose work would justify 1,000 Nobels Speaking packed press coference Madrid, Saramago joked heard prize German air hostess Frankfurt airport waited flight home Spain's Canary Islands. The news left 75-year-old writer choice leave airport return city's book fair meet press public. At moment I moon returning book fair thing I worried whole thing error, said Saramago. Dismissing Vatican paper's disapproval Thursday achievment, Saramago, known atheist, quipped aware Pope among jury, I prize. The Vatican easily upset, said Saramago, I think Vatican keep mind prayer leave people alone. Meanwhile Portugal, Saramago scheduled arrive Tuesday, delight Swedish Academy's award Saramago reflected daily paper, even country's three daily sport paper ample space event. The two leading daily, Publico Diario de Noticias, gave entire front page Saramago. Lisbon City Hall rushed poster saying Congratulations Jose Saramago hung around capital night. Saramago born poor, illiterate family Azinhaga, small town near Lisbon. He never finished university continued study part-time supporting metalworker. Nothing life would led one think I'd win Nobel Prize, said Saramago. I born win Nobel. I book I 18. His first novel, published 1947 Terra Pecado, Country Sin tale peasant moral crisis. For next 18 year, Saramago, communist opposed 41-year conservative dictatorship Antonio Salazar, published travel poetry book worked journalist. He returned fiction Salazar's regime toppled military uprising 1974. Since 1980s, work translated 20 language. Regarding future, Saramago said book currently working called The Cavern deal modern version myth Plato cave. Three American researcher Monday Nobel Medicine Prize discovering nitric oxide act signal molecule cardiovascular system, breakthrough application ranging hardening artery impotence. The prestigious prize went Robert F. Furchgott, Louis J. Ignarro Ferid Murad. Furchgott pharmacologist State University New York Brooklyn, Ignarro University California-Los Angeles Murad University Texas Medical School Houston. The citation Karolinska Institute said senation simple, common air pollutant (nitric oxide), formed nitrogen burn . could exert important function organism. Because research, know today nitric oxide act signal molecule nervous system, weapon infection regulator blood pressure. Signal transmission gas produced one cell, penetrates membrane regulates function another cell represents entirely new principle, citation said. Understanding nitric oxide transmits signal sparked research wide range new drug, including used treatment heart problem, artherosclerosis, shock impotence. The prize amount 7.6 million kronor (dlrs 978,000) divided equally among three. Last year, prize went Stanley B. Prusiner University California San Francisco discovery prion, rogue protein identified causing Mad Cow Disease. Winners generally known outside medical community, although list laureate contains familiar name including Ivan Pavlov, tuberculosis pioneer Robert Koch, DNA researcher Francis Crick James Watson. Generally, researcher made discovery sound small paper carry large consequence. Among well-known name receive prize David Baltimore, although shared prize 1975, long becoming one world's visible AIDS researcher.

Netanyahu sent clear message deluding betting Israel (to) change anti-peace stand give illusion, paper said. Lebanon's peace talk Israel also suspended two year pending progress Syrian-Israeli negotiation. The independent An-Nahar newspaper quoted Lebanese Prime Minister Rafik Hariri asking, Does Israeli government really want peace trying delude world? In front page comment, Sahar Baasiri, said The mere announcement (Sharon) lead negotiation (with Arabs) tantamount disaster. Ariel Sharon, hawkish former general tipped Israel's next foreign minister, said interview published Sunday get job, shake hand Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat. Sharon, opposes ceding West Bank land Palestinians, considered government's No. 2 post. In it, would pivotal figure reaching final peace settlement Palestinians. Even I appointed foreign minister run negotiation, I shake Yasser Arafat's hand, Sharon quoted saying Yediot Ahronot daily. The newspaper said Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu close making decision appointment. Netanyahu acting foreign minister since post vacated January David Levy, moderate opposed Netanyahu's hardline negotiating strategy Palestinians. Sharon's appointment would signal toughening Israel's position could strain relation Arab neighbor. Sharon general led Israel's 1982 invasion Lebanon, former housing minister strengthened Jewish settlement territory Israel captured Syria, Jordan Egypt 1967 Mideast war. Sharon told Haaretz newspaper would accept foreign minister's job allowed act strengthen country. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu appointed Ariel Sharon, hawkish former defense minister, Israeli foreign minister Friday effort placate far right move closer turning West Bank land Palestinians. With appointment, Sharon, 70, ardent advocate Jewish settlement West Bank, expected quell domestic opposition concession Netanyahu supposedly prepared make peace summit conference Washington area next week. For month, Sharon, currently minister national infrastructure, maintained redeploying Israeli troop additional 9 percent West Bank would national disaster. In assuming role foreign minister, however, would forced abandon public opposition Netanyahu's decision withdraw another 13 percent Palestinian territory even vote accord. Sharon drawn directly issue, since Netanyahu appointed direct final status talk Palestinians, would follow signing interim peace agreement. Last week Sharon told Israeli newspaper that, negotiation not, would never shake hand Yasser Arafat, Palestinian leader, long disdained. Palestinian leader Israeli leftist divided reaction, similar way. Some professed aghast, some, like Nabil Sha'ath, Palestinian transportation minister, said willing forget history Sharon's appointment provided Netanyahu political backbone sign deal. In Washington, White House State Department official pledged work closely Sharon emphasized personnel Israeli government internal affair. Arik Sharon fitting person state Israel position foreign minister, Netanyahu said, using nickname. He brings rich experience, creativity, proven working ability I think well know wound damage war well fruit peace. Sharon never hidden belief, continued, word influenced way redeployment carried extent. In nod Sharon, Netanyahu decided new location nature reserve would constitute 3 percent West Bank land. It supposed Judean desert near Israel's eastern border, Sharon argued would pose strategic security risk. Instead, decided Thursday nature reserve would instead slope Hebron hill, much closer existing Jewish settlement. Many Israeli political observer believe Netanyahu eviscerated right-wing opposition appointment, signaling genuinely intends bring home peace agreement. Who right wing Sharon foreign ministry negotiating Palestinians? asked Uzi Benziman, editorial board member newspaper Haaretz author critical biography Sharon. It settler real hard-liners comprise 15 percent public opinion. So really quite intelligent move, suggesting Netanyahu mean business trying get agreement. But Palestinians took news hard, read differently. I think clear-cut message Bibi, Saeb Erekat, lead negotiator Palestinians, said, using Netanyahu's nickname. I imagine people try explain Netanyahu's intention trying get support right. What trying make peace right wing expense making peace u. It mean want continue path non-negotiations, want continue prime minister cost. Sharon declined interviewed Friday appointment must still approved Cabinet Tuesday, approval expected. An aide, Raanan Gisin, said Sharon accepted position could stem tide dangerous development contribute fighting risk facing Israel. A retired general fought every Israeli war, Sharon, 70, leading figure Likud Party done much battle Likud prime minister. At recent party convention, said Netanyahu know right hand left, prime minister dismissed Friday comment made height political argument. And Netanyahu first formed Cabinet 1996, fact give Sharon senior position caused 11th-hour crisis swearing-in ceremony. Sharon retreated family farm Negev, David Levy, named foreign minister, said would serve unless Sharon given post. Netanyahu created Cabinet job, minister infrastructure, especially Sharon. Levy resigned January lengthy power struggle prime minister, since Netanyahu serving foreign minister. Sharon, member old guard, complicated political past, highlighted string military victory, checkered, many, indirect role, defense minister, Lebanese Christian Phalangist massacre unarmed civilian Sabra Shatila refugee camp Lebanon 1982. Many Israelis, even despise politics, see strong, experienced figure know mind capable moderate power. Friday afternoon, right-wing political establishment nearly universally applauded appointment. Uzi Landau, Likud hard-liner, said relieved hear confirmed rumor week. I feel safe negotiation Minister Sharon directly involved, said Landau, head Parliament's security foreign affair committee. Undoubtedly facilitate situation prime minister show right Arik Sharon identified program, therefore live it. Right announcement made, leader National Religious Party, threatened bring government, changed combative tone. They emerged mollified meeting Netanyahu late Thursday, saying would leave government intact. Still, would connect change heart nomination Sharon. Appointing Sharon political step like much, said Shaul Yahalom, minister transportation leader National Religious Party. But effect see peace agreement. Our concern whether 160 Jewish settlement endangered. The appointment Sharon come backdrop violence erupted week. Friday, 19-year-old Israeli soldier, Michal Adato, stabbed death Palestinian man got bus hometown, settlement Tomer Jordan Valley. Netanyahu reported received sympathy note Arafat, condemned attack. Also Friday, continuing clash Palestinian youth soldier divided city Hebron, 32 Palestinians lightly injured rubber bullet funeral Palestinian protester shot dead Thursday. After Netanyahu made announcement Friday, Israeli reporter introduced question stating Netanyahu diminished political threat right wing appointing Sharon. Are willing sign that? Netanyahu said. I know that. I know one thing dependent vote one two people never know be. He referring razor-thin majority parliament analyst perceive key motivator appointing Sharon. More anything else, reflects political weakness Netanyahu, said Yaron Ezrahi, leading intellectual critic prime minister. He recognized next redeployment inevitable want seen contributing wave political violence would follow failure. But domestic political power carry big decision own. The New York Times said editorial Saturday, Oct. 10: Just day heading United States critical negotiation Palestinian leader, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu jolted Middle East peace effort appointment Ariel Sharon Israeli foreign minister. The optimistic reading Sharon, long implacable foe Palestinians, prepared make peace sell Israelis opposed. Unfortunately, also capable wrecking entire peace effort. Much depend whether Netanyahu control strong-willed aide, goal eluded Israeli leader. Like political typhoon, Sharon roared across Israeli life better three decade brilliant military commander, reckless defense minister ardent conservative, often leaving destruction wake. He still bear burden role massacre hundred Palestinians Christian militiaman Lebanon 1982. An Israeli inquiry found indirectly responsible killing Sabra Shatila refugee camp. As leader conservative wing Likud party, Sharon help Netanyahu hold together shaky Cabinet potentially decisive negotiation Yasser Arafat, Palestinian leader. That fine Sharon willing play constructive role peace talk himself. But behavior likely first impulse man famously said would never shake hand Arafat. Since Netanyahu designated Sharon chief negotiator, new foreign minister soon opportunity act responsibly. The first order business two side get together next week outside Washington wrap negotiation withdrawal Israeli force West Bank coupled security guarantee Palestinians. Sharon show statesmanship helping Netanyahu close deal, even though opposed Israeli settler whose cause Sharon long championed. Success talk would clear way last difficult negotiation permanent settlement, including shape status Palestinian state future Jerusalem. If Sharon ever hope overcome shame Sabra Shatila, must become force peace Middle East.

Ariel Sharon's appointment Israeli foreign minister serf bullet mercy Middle East peace process, official Syrian newspaper said Saturday. In Beirut, Lebanese newspaper denounced appointment disaster peace. Many Arabs know Sharon role Israel's 1982 invasion Lebanon. An Israeli tribunal looking invasion found indirectly responsible massacre hundred Palestinian refugee pro-Israeli Christian Lebanese militiaman two Beirut camp. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu named Sharon foreign minister Friday, effectively putting hard-liner charge negotiating Israel's final border Palestinians. The appointment bullet mercy (peace) process, stopped track, said Tishrin newspaper, often speaks Syrian government. It said Netanyahu sent clear message deluding thinking Israel change anti-peace stand. Syrian-Israeli peace talk broke two year ago. Syria previous Israeli government reached informal agreement full withdrawal Golan Heights, Israel captured Syria 1967. But Netanyahu's government rejected agreement, saying never completed. Lebanon's peace talk Israel also suspended two year pending progress Syrian-Israeli negotiation. The independent An-Nahar newspaper quoted Lebanese Prime Minister Rafik Hariri saying: Sharon's appointment make Lebanon world state ask: Does Israeli government really want peace trying delude world? An-Nahar's columnist, Sahar Baasiri, said front-page comment: `The mere announcement (Sharon) lead negotiation (with Arabs) tantamount disaster. The man hero Arab defeats; firmest believer expansion land Israel resolving Palestinian problem expense Jordan. He liar, Baasiri wrote. The conservative Ad-Diyar newspaper said front-page comment: The history Ariel Sharon known. He called burning Beirut, annexing Golan, occupying (West) Bank slaughtering displacing Arabs everywhere. Ariel Sharon law degree, fancy farmer. But three decade role Israeli public life unapologetic warrior, first battlefield later bare-knuckled combat domestic partisan politics. With blunt tongue, barrel chest bar-scrapper's demeanor, Sharon 70 many critic caricature right-wing intransigence. To equally numerous admirer living symbol unrelenting dedication Israel's national survival. Still conveying physical vigor within impressively expanding frame, remains pugnacious fault. Both friend foe would agree new foreign minister natural diplomat. A Zionist underground operative teen-ager infantry commander wounded 1948 war independence, Sharon fought, fought memorably, virtually every major military engagement country's history. He commanded legendary armored division crossed seized control Sinai 1967 Arab-Israeli war. He returned active service three-month retirement lead Israel's badly outgunned armored division victory, Sinai, war 1973. As defense minister 982, Sharon led Israel's invasion Lebanon, defying international condemnation unrelenting artillery assault Beirut neighborhood Palestinian refugee camp believed Israeli high command Palestine Liberation Organization redoubt. To some, Israel abroad, Sharon's Lebanese incursion forever associated massacre Lebanese Christian Phalangists, ally Israelis, reported 460 unarmed Palestinians Sabra Shatila refugee camp. In official inquiry Jerusalem subsequent libel trial brought New York, Sharon seen effectively refuted charge knew condoned Phalangists' attack beforehand. But government investigating commission held failure prevent killing constituted ground dismissal Defense Ministry. Since 1982 invasion, Israel mired unpopular open-ended occupation southern Lebanon, operation constant casualty among young inductee Sharon still often blamed. To many Israelis, however, Lebanese incursion ultimately risk worth taking, succeeded crushing PLO militarily driving force far Israel's border. The PLO's defeat Sharon's hand Lebanon led eventually renunciation armed warfare Israel embrace peace negotiation process Sharon Foreign Minister responsible. In civilian life proved savvy political operator military strategist, helping break Labor's hold Knesset making indispensable binding force within successive fractious Likud coalition.

45,"Whether talk Exxon Mobil lead merger business combination, America's economic history already rewritten. In energy business like financial service, telecommunication automobile, global competition technology made unthinkable combination practical, even necessary. Oil company like Exxon Corp. Mobil Corp. additional pressure, one unthinkable le two decade ago. Crude oil price fallen sharply, plunging 40 percent year level, adjusted inflation, seen since first oil embargo 25 year ago. As such, oil company, spent year cutting cost, desperate saving order continue operating profitably low price. Exxon Mobil two largest, strongest competitor emerge nation's famous antitrust case, 1911 breakup John D. Rockefeller's Standard Oil Trust. Now face Royal Dutch/Shell Group larger either them. They also confront British Petroleum PLC made far potent United States agreement summer buy Amoco Corp. $48.2 billion. Industry executive say deal scale inevitable. Executives company return call Thursday comment talk, unclear Thursday night outcome might be. But Exxon Mobil agree become one, antitrust regulator likely cautious putting back together much long ago broke apart. Even so, oil industry analyst contend improved efficiency combining giant energy company would lower cost concentrated ownership gas station refinery would raise them. The ultimate beneficiary consumer, said Daniel Yergin, chairman Cambridge Energy Research Associates. If Exxon Mobil ultimately combine, cost could prove heaviest energy industry employee. Analysts say 80,000 global employee Exxon, based Irving, Texas, 40,000 Mobil, Fairfax, Va., thousand would likely lose job. Exxon, Lee R. Raymond, Mobil, Lucio A. Noto, chief executive preoccupied humbling accommodation low oil price made necessary. Oil company everybody's favorite target trust-busting era early century Arab oil embargo 1970s. Now seem especially vulnerable demand weakens much world, especially economically troubled Asia, weighing already depressed price. They're pitiful, helpless giant, said Ronald Chernow, author Titan, biography John D. Rockefeller, Standard Oil's founder. As such, giant compelled continue cutting cost spreading risk huge, expensive international project needed develop oil reserve needed next century. Mobil, $58.4 billion sale last year, might seem large enough undertake anything. But competing right develop huge natural gas field Turkmenistan, former Soviet republic, Mobil unable match Shell's offer build pipeline $1 billion more. Oil company decided cannot count rebound oil price revive fortune time soon. Earlier month, Energy Department predicted collapse Asian demand would continue depress oil price nearly decade, much $5.50 barrel year 2000. And Thursday, Organization Petroleum Exporting Countries put March decision extending oil production cutback prop price. Moreover, improving technology exploration production opening new region development added already huge supply oil hand now. In response, many energy company already begun new wave cutback staff operation. To reduce cost, company like Mobil forming partnership stop short full merger. Two year ago, Mobil agreed combine European refining marketing operation British Petroleum's, resulting annual saving $500 million. Shell Texaco formed refining partnership United States. In face partnership, said Amy Jaffe, energy analyst James A. Baker III Institute Public Policy Houston, Exxon, compete? Though Mobil Exxon might high concentration gas station certain area United States, analyst say far competition pump oil price collapsed 1980s. Thousands convenience store also sell gasoline produced variety refining company, foreign national oil company, like Venezuela's, sell supply acquired company like Citgo. Under Noto, Mobil hunting way becoming large lean enough survive. He took lead deal British Petroleum considered buying smaller company. And made clear corporate personal pride would never block deal. In European agreement British Petroleum, Mobil's red flying horse come front many gas station, green yellow BP logo gone up. As major oil company team up, said John Hervey, analyst Donaldson Lufkin &AMP; Jenrette, If price right, ego get way. In past, Mobil reportedly talk British Petroleum combination, well talk Amoco forming American refining venture. The company also interested Conoco Inc. DuPont Co. began looking divest oil gas business. But deal reached. More recently, speculation Wall Street Mobil talking Chevron Corp. British Petroleum purchase Amoco put pressure Noto seek deal, Hervey said. I think whole thing would started British Petroleum pulled trigger, said. The British Petroleum-Amoco deal, progressing quickly since August announcement towards expected $2 billion annual saving, put even company large Exxon spot. There, Raymond far concentrated making operation efficient finding ally. Though Royal Dutch/Shell's financial resource greater Exxon's, analyst say Exxon still size soundness absorb company Mobil's size. Only largest oil company afford take advantage today's best opportunity. Finding new field deep water coast West Africa Gulf Mexico require platform costing $1 billion more. Producing oil state former Soviet Union taken time money many investor anticipated. In September, Noto among American executive invited Saudi leader visiting Washington greatly step investment country, too. Noto spent 1977 1985 Saudi Arabia himself, building Mobil operation including huge refinery. But new partnership Saudis might require Mobil's connection Exxon's capital. Back Standard Oil organized operation state, Exxon Standard Oil New Jersey, Mobil Standard Oil New York. Even Standard Oil monopoly broken up, remained several year building Manhattan. Chernow, Rockefeller biographer, noted two piece Standard Oil trust already likely united. British Petroleum bought Standard Oil Ohio 1970s, Amoco Standard Oil Indiana. The break-up Standard Oil resulting competition often cited precedent current antitrust action Microsoft. Chernow see reason allowing Exxon acquisition Mobil go suggest leniency Microsoft. Exxon would obviously larger leading competitor, way Microsoft is, said. In energy business today, added, large dinosaur stalk particular jungle. The board Exxon Corp. Mobil Corp. expected meet Tuesday consider possible merger agreement would form world's largest oil company, source close negotiation said Friday. The source, spoke condition anonymity, said prospect good completing agreement. Exxon Mobil confirmed Friday discussing way combine. They cautioned, however, agreement reached assurance would reach one. The statement sent stock company surging, suggesting investor believe company combine. Shares Exxon, biggest US. oil company, rose $1.6875, 2.3 percent, $74375. Shares Mobil, No. 2 US. oil company, rose $7.625, 9.7 percent, $86. Some analyst said two giant reached agreement, likely form takeover Exxon Mobil. Exxon far larger financially stronger. Analysts predicted would huge cut duplicate staff company, employ 122,700 people. Adam Sieminski, oil analyst BT Alex. Brown, said company would probably make cut save $3 billion $5 billion year. Sieminski analyst said Exxon would offer premium 15 20 percent price prior Monday, serious speculation Exxon takeover Mobil first circulated sent Mobil share sharply. They said transaction would probably exchange Mobil share Exxon share. Based Mobil's $75.25 share price week ago, takeover company would worth $70 billion. The merger discussion come backdrop particularly severe pressure Lucio Noto, chairman, president chief executive Mobil, find new reserve oil natural gas keep big project profitable time deep decline crude oil price. This one intelligent chief executive business man considerable ability inherited serious structural problem company, said J. Robin West, chairman Petroleum Finance Co., consulting group energy industry based Washington. He said Mobil's prime asset include Arun natural gas field Indonesia, one largest world, contributed one-third Mobil's profit year beginning run down. The field, production since 1977, supply liquefied natural gas Japan Korea. Although Mobil Noto moved quickly cut cost muscle way promising new area Kazakhstan, partner joint venture develop huge Tengiz oil field, payoff venture many year away. Other company face similar strain. The challenge replace crown jewel grow increasingly competitive environment, West said. Noto shy sitting company British Petroleum Amoco year see combination made sense. Although Exxon chairman Lee Raymond head much stronger bigger company Mobil, immune strain global petroleum business. Those strain intensified year Russia's economic collapse raised risk Exxon's extensive exploration venture country. Exxon also follower leader huge project deep offshore field, major find made near West Africa Gulf Mexico. News Exxon Mobil, two giant energy patch, merger talk last week biggest sign yet corporate marriage back vogue. Even combination came light, deal-making fast furious. On Monday alone, $40.4 billion corporate acquisition either announced declared imminent. Driving resurgence merger roaring stock market, recognition major corporation getting harder increase revenue internally growing confidence among market player economy plunge recession next year. There also industry-specific issue, like low crude-oil price driving oil giant one another's arm. But investor, mega-marriages real money made. Rather, among smaller company, whose still-depressed stock price luring bigger acquirer stock near peak. If Exxon buy Mobil close current price, deal month total value $140 billion April's peak $244 billion three time volume September, stock market falling. Which industry likely witness merger? Tom Burnett, director Merger Insight, institutional investment advisory firm New York, say deal certainty energy, suffering low crude-oil price. Burnett also say health care executive finding tougher ever lift earnings. But smaller company may better way play takeover game. Charles LaLoggia, editor Special Situation Investor newsletter Potomac, Md., said: Some premium high-profile merger great anymore. The value small-cap stock. Another reason deal involving smaller-cap candidate le likely incur wrath antitrust regulator. LaLoggia reckons odds picking takeover winner increase investor focus company already partially owned another. In energy sector, Houston Exploration qualifies, says; oil gas driller 66 percent owned Keyspan Energy. He also belief deal imminent among drug chain supermarket. Longs Drug Stores Drug Emporium, say, remain acquisition candidate, though neither controlled another concern. In supermarket, LaLoggia like Great Atlantic &AMP; Pacific Tea Co., 55 percent owned Tengelmann Group Germany. Another pick Smart Final, operator warehouse-style store 55 percent owned US. subsidiary Groupe Casino, France's largest supermarket chain. Both A&AMP;P Smart Final trading book value, LaLoggia said. Takeovers typically occur book value. Finally, recommends National Presto Industries, maker housewares electrical appliance, trading near $39, close low year. The company $30 share cash balance sheet, debt dividend yield 5 percent. After last month's announced acquisition Rubbermaid Newell Co., LaLoggia think National Presto could find acquirer's cross-hairs. It new high Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock Nasdaq composite index Friday anticipation new wave merger general rush investor join equity rebound pushed stock up.

Internet computer stock also rallied, helped part announcement Tuesday America Online's purchase Netscape Communications three-way deal involving Sun Microsystems. At time, Germany's Deutsche Bank Bankers Trust scheduled formally announce merger Monday. There question merger euphoria headline, said Hugh Johnson, chief investment officer First Albany Corp.

Long-term short-term yield slipped lower week despite new economic data indicated economy stronger third quarter expected seems moving along good pace current quarter. This small recovery face stronger growth probably new inflation number show price check analyst still forecasting economy begin slow next year. Many analyst noted eight-week stock market rally, Nasdaq composite index jumped 42 percent, investor buying even though major financial problem around world including slumping Asia, weakening Latin America troubled Russia resolved. Johnson said thought investor, inspired Federal Reserve's three interest rate cut two month new stimulus package Japan, assume problem solved. Investors looking valley like see, said. But worry financial crisis, began Thailand July 1997 intensified effective default Russia August, go away quickly. It seems every financial crisis, everybody get impression storm passed, Johnson said. But never easy. Exxon Corp. Mobil Corp. held discussion combining business operation, person involved talk said Wednesday. It unclear Wednesday whether talk continuing. If company merge, would create largest US. company term revenue. A possible merger reported separately The Financial Times London Bloomberg News. The reported talk Exxon, whose annual revenue exceeds Wal-Mart General Electric, Mobil, No. 2 US. oil company, come oil price sunk lowest almost 12 year. A combined company would bigger Royal Dutch/Shell Group, world's largest oil company revenue. Financial term discussion could determined Wednesday. Neither Exxon Mobil would comment. Any union would reunite two part John D. Rockefeller's Standard Oil Trust, broken Supreme Court 1911. Exxon known Standard Oil New Jersey, Mobil consisted two companies: Standard Oil New York Vacuum Oil. Both Exxon, market value $176.7 billion, Mobil, market value $61.1 billion, history fiercely independence. Both already cut back staff made lean order survive long period oil price low. But particularly unsettling year oil industry, little prospect crude oil price recover soon. Consequently, chief executive oil company swallow pride look suitable partner. This summer, British Petroleum announced $48.2 billion agreement buy Amoco Corp., creating world's third-largest oil company prompting analyst predict even widespread consolidation. It showed megamergers doable, said Adam Sieminski, analyst BT Alex. Brown. He added, however, combination Exxon Mobil would easy match Mobil known proud company said past would want merge. Exxon, added, well run company like grow business. He added head company, Lee Raymond, chairman Exxon, based Irving, Texas, Lucio Noto, chairman, president chief executive Mobil, based Fairfax, Va., different personality. It easy, said combining two far-flung company, vast network refinery gas station overlap United States Europe. If offer enough money make anything happen, added. Both company pressure find new field oil help survive long term. Like oil company, hoped quickly tap vast reserve Russia. Even though prepared spend billion, held back political economic crisis Russia great reluctance Russian official oil company give control vast field. Thus fall back exploration area deep water Gulf Mexico West Africa. Such exploration expensive, even large field found often take platform costing $1 billion bring oil production. Oil price pressure year, falling 40 percent $20-a-barrel level growing inventory petroleum declining Asian demand caused economic crisis there. On Wednesday, crude oil January delivery fell 29 cent, 2.6 percent, $11.86 barrel New York Mercantile Exchange, close 12-year low $11.42 reached June 15. Members Organization Petroleum Exporting Countries oil-producing nation, notably Mexico, tried stem price drop pledge cut back production. But pledge always honored, rally oil market year proven short-lived. OPEC member Wednesday continued discussion extending production cutback, agreement expected early Thursday. In spring, OPEC agreed reduce production 2.6 million barrel day, 3 percent daily world supply 74 million barrel. The main result agreement appears keep oil price falling $10 barrel. Washington regulator said Wednesday notified Exxon-Mobil discussion. The Federal Trade Commission still reviewing British Petroleum's pending purchase Amoco. An Exxon-Mobil deal would certain receive several months' worth scrutiny commission, would review much industry merger would control. Analysts investment banker split logic possible merger. Some pointed difficulty company could face combined. If asked Exxon needed bigger, answer probably no, said Garfield Miller, president Aegis Energy Advisors Corp., small independent investment bank based New York. It hard say anything particular gain. In particular, Miller said, two company enormous similarity domestic refining marketing business. They really overlap quite bit, said. You really wonder benefit redundancy. Another investment banker energy business, speaking condition anonymity, also questioned rationale discussed merger. When look BP-Amoco deal, rationalize it, banker said. But none reason apply Exxon-Mobil deal. But Amy Jaffe, energy research analyst James A. Baker III Institute Public Policy, said combination two company would logical, part would give greater influence bidding project Middle Eastern country. This deal make sense, Ms. Jaffe said. With combined company, project would big. In addition, Ms. Jaffe said, merger would provide company new oil gas asset area world little influence. There lot complimentary asset redundant, said. She said Exxon, example, strong presence Angola, Mobil not. And Mobil significant asset Caspian Sea Nigeria, Exxon weak. Exxon Mobil, nation's two largest oil company, confirmed Friday discussing possible merger, antitrust lawyer, industry analyst government official predicted deal would require sale important large piece new corporate behemoth. Those divestiture would reshape industry already undergoing broad transformation low price oil. But merger corporate combination also beginning create new regulatory climate among antitrust official, one may prove particularly challenging Exxon Mobil. Although company confirmed discussing possibility merger, person close discussion said board Exxon Mobil expected meet Tuesday consider agreement. Shares surged New York Stock Exchange. Oil exploration drilling interest would necessarily present antitrust problem Exxon-Mobil merger competition area brisk. But retailing marketing operation, Exxon-Mobil combination would like Ford merging General Motors, Macy's Gimbels, said Stephen Axinn, antitrust lawyer New York represented Texaco acquisition Getty decade ago. In United States, deal would come purview Federal Trade Commission, Clinton administration examined large corporate merger vigor seen since 1970s. The agency blocked number proposed merger, $4 billion combination Staples Office Depot, two largest office supply discounter, two deal involving four largest drug wholesaler. On hand approved big merger, Boeing's $14 billion acquisition McDonnell Douglas. The agency's analysis Exxon-Mobil combination, senior official said Friday, turn might resemble John D. Rockefeller's Standard Oil trust dismantled Supreme Court 1911. The big antitrust issue whether, merger alliance, able get competition one another back, particularly background BP-Amoco Shell-Texaco, said Eleanor M. Fox, professor New York University School Law antitrust expert. It may looking consolidation world level looked like consolidation national level 100 year ago. The Federal Trade Commission recently approved significant joint venture Shell Texaco venture agreed sell refinery divest retailing operation Hawaii California. It also considering proposed $54 billion merger British Petroleum Amoco re-examine combination light new talk Exxon Mobil. In past, two merger involving industry, government considered together deciding deal them, said Terry Calvani, former commissioner Federal Trade Commission whose client include Chevron. But coming aftermath Shell-Texaco BP-Amoco deal, combination Exxon Mobil, significantly overlapping retail refinery business United States Europe, pose question antitrust official confronted since 1980s. It's real test case, said Frederick Leuffer, senior energy analyst Bear Stearns. If FTC let one go without major divesting, everything would fair game. Why GM merge Ford? While 1911 breakup Standard Oil viewed Washington official industry executive ancient history, Exxon Mobil become dominant rival retailing refining market, production lubricant petrochemical. Leuffer said believed divestiture necessary case could large deal-breakers. Other analyst lawyer, disagreeing required divestiture could kill deal, said company would nonetheless shed significant operation expected challenge raised broad spectrum constituent, including competitor, customer state official. These absolute obstacle, said John Hervey, analyst Donaldson Lufkin &AMP; Jenrette. In past, two big oil company merged, aggressive attorney general state almost always become involved raising question high visibility local gas station. When state attorney general drive see four station corner two Mobil Exxon, certain raise question, Axinn said. Exxon Mobil significant concentration retailing marketing concern Northeast, Southwest West Coast, also big refining operation. Because two company involved everything exploration shipping refining retailing, meaning deal consumer take month regulator sort out. The regulator examining transaction would dissect business, determine whether market global, national local, determine whether combined entity high concentration business area. Experts agreed regulator likely permit Exxon Mobil keep exploratory oil production business area already highly competitive merger would result higher price. Hervey said market already fragmented combined market share major American European oil company 17 percent. They downsized, cut back re-engineered. So 900 remaining blue-collar worker Mobil's largest domestic refinery, 1,500 decade ago, heard last week company discussing possible merger Exxon, like siren warning already suspect valve might blow. I think terrible thing, said Dick Mabry, refinery operator, emerged plant's artificial twilight main gate 12-hour shift ended 4:30 Sunday morning. He stopped rub eye rimmed red, topic bedtime could delayed. It's revival Standard Oil Company. It's going put 20 30 thousand people work. I think Justice Department step stop it. Ernest Lewis, whose overall bore Big E patch appropriate scale, added uh-huh's. The latest evidence thing heading hulked right nearby, said, glancing new power plant likely operated outside company without union man refinery's generator. But Mobil Corp. sold, Lewis said, noting gain company stock holding, buyer solid large Exxon Corp. might least evil. If merged Chevron, we'd Moron, added. A growing American economy make billionaire someone unproven idea Internet marketing still sloughing worker older industry, petroleum much any. Those point tote board Beaumont plant's brick headquarters, say show already handled 171 million barrel 130 million planned full year. But number matter even one like 89.9, 88.9, even 81.9, nearby gas station lowest price, inflation, since Depression. Which Mobil Exxon considering combining world's largest oil company. Some people close talk cautioned deal would considered board least Tuesday, maybe Wednesday. And why, beginning last Wednesday evening, phone home Jimmy Herrington, president Oil, Chemical Atomic Workers Local 4-243 rang without stop. No, know merger talk television, said Herrington, also work full-time producing lubricant. He asked Mobil manager, meeting earlier month, rumor, said heard nothing. Oil industry analyst say first target combined company's effort cut billion dollar annual cost would office staff professional, like geologist engineer, field. One company's accountant could almost work two. But crew fully expect Exxon buyer would ask yet whether refinery could turn crude oil gasoline, motor oil product even fewer people. Union leader raise prospect Exxon would sell refinery. Antitrust regulator, say, bound notice Exxon refinery hour's drive one direction three hour other, along Gulf Mexico crescent form petrochemical industry's home. The Beaumont plant, steaming, humming chemistry set lining Neches River Gulf, become prime provider livelihood since built almost spray nearby Spindletop gusher. With mounting overtime stretch shift 16 hour more, worker regularly make $55,000 $65,000 year. People go retire there, Herrington said, drove around plant's fenced periphery. Lewis, 17th year, third-generation employee. But nephew laboring exception. The worker streaming plant dawn mostly balding going gray, sign full generation refinery concerned get rid worker attract them. The cutback have, far, come attrition, retirement often encouraged incentive. But plywood sheet covering window of fast food place gas station around Herrington's union hall advertise best time long gone. His member chafe expert come Wall Street question justification every person's job. In tiring dangerous task, question elimination relief laborer favor covering vacation sickness overtime (although like extra pay, say plant become safer years). They complain growing number outside contractor taking formerly unionized task. But many worker choosing invest least retirement saving Mobil stock, 1990s ethos gaining. Some share credit plant's management efficiency measure agree necessary true job security. Some take attitude every company always sale. They concerned feel it, said Sam Salim, one electrical plant worker whose future uncertain. But fork $60 billion? I'd look over. With Mobil executive saying little possible now, call Sunday local plant manager company spokesman elicit peep. Union leader, however, already squawking. I believe creating new monopoly way prop industry, said Robert Wages, former refinery operator union's president, telephone Saturday. Nevertheless, admirable foresight union negotiated clause last November's three-year contract extension guaranteeing company buyer would keep term. Many member, typically came work high school, already molding oil companies' latest exploit case study fit rapacious MBA's. They're biggest, said Bobby Whisneant, assistant operator gasoline lubrication oil unit, referring Exxon. He coming, early Sunday morning, plant gate whose white canopy seems borrowed self-service station. So go buy second biggest. That's one way get rid competition. I hope something like 80 buying company scrapping them. Or something like Robber Baron era century before, said Mabry, another operator. Didn't teacher teach u school Standard Oil Company would never come back? Remember that? said, looking friend, Lewis, Big E, agreement. But I better shut up. I still work Mobil. Used to, Lewis said. Exxon Corp. Mobil Corp. held discussion combining business operation, person involved talk said Wednesday. It unclear Wednesday whether talk continuing.

Any union would reunite two part John D. Rockefeller's Standard Oil Trust, broken Supreme Court 1911. Exxon known Standard Oil New Jersey, Mobil consisted two companies: Standard Oil New York Vacuum Oil. As oil price plummeted level last seen mid-1980s, oil company pressure cut cost. Exxon, market value $176.7 billion, Mobil, market value $61.1 billion, history fiercely independent, already cut back staff made lean survive even prolonged period low oil price.

Still, boggles mind accept notion hardship driving profitable Big Oil either merge, British Petroleum Amoco already agreed do, least consider prospect, Exxon Mobil doing. Still, Big Oil small oil getting squeezed low petroleum price high capital cost exploration. Given exotic locale promising, untapped field, seems unlikely exploration get cheaper. And West Texas crude trading around $12 barrel, seems safe bet oil selling $100 barrel turn century price analyst early 1980s predicting would reach. Philip K. Verleger Jr., publisher Petroleum Economics Monthly senior adviser Brattle Group, Cambridge, Mass., consulting firm, spent time late last week talking Mobil, Exxon changing dynamic oil business. Following excerpt conversation: Q. (italics)There lot focus antitrust aspect Exxon-Mobil deal. Do see problems?(end italic) A. Let say right I think done deal. I think far that. But happen, I see many problem. BP Amoco perfect end-to-end merger, one little overlap company merging with. Exxon-Mobil come close. The first issue competition local market.

46,"The raw passion House Democrats hesitate bellow You resign! You resign! Speaker-elect Robert Livingston called House floor President Clinton quit White House face certain impeachment. Shockingly, stunningly, Livingston that. He quit one breathtaking utterance, flicking trump card onto heap impeachment angst festering eye debating chamber. In one strategem leading fellow House Republicans, Livingston's decision struck Congress like verbal bomb. Stunned Democrats saw fury vaporized upon instant. They stand, almost staggering foot, join Republicans prolonged, emotional ovation Livingston undeniable self-sacrifice. As stood, Democrats sensed Livingston suddenly closed trap president defender. For, impeachment issue set move Senate, Livingston, whose marital indiscretion public obvious misery, chose show question political leader's resignation much play tumult-tossed city. I must set example I hope President Clinton follow, Livingston declared, flabbergasting attending impeachment debate nation watching beyond. Livingston walked floor like sheriff bullet-pocked political High Noon, discarding leadership badge wrested earlier speaker-casualty, Newt Gingrich. In corridor beyond, doorman shouted police officer: Livingston resigned! What? What? came reply officer, obviously thought momentous announcement would Clinton's impeachment, Livingston's political self-immolation. Just so, Democrats, already deep bone-raw exhaustion long fight save president, grasped bearing. It surrender developing sexual McCarthyism! declared Rep. Jerrold Nadler, D-N.Y., leading presidential defender trying rally Democrats around argument Livingston resign President Clinton quit fire. But Republicans surging fore strength Livingston's announcement, fighting tear rose salute ultimate political role model grueling impeachment process roared final minute debate. For longer good enough make mistake, confirm mistake take consequence mistake, said Tom DeLay, Republican whip, hand shaking, eye tearing addressed House sought drive example Livingston way Pennsylvania Avenue. He understood debate honor, duty, integrity truth, said DeLay arguing one swift blow, Livingston demonstrated far better speaker Clinton president. With something political elan president showed initiating Iraq attack impeachment loomed, House Republicans, battered public opinion poll, found rocket's red glare own. I hurt deeply beg forgiveness, Livingston told House, nation family announced retreat. Only moment before, Democrats openly hissed man Livingston firmly read judgment upon president: Sir, done great damage nation past year. Presidential resignation order, continued, came shout You resign! You resign! And Livingston closed circle career, stunned place collective breath disbelief somehow almost threatened reduce dark historic issue House impeachment president matter anticlimax. They must succeed, David Bonior, Democratic whip said Republicans given task refocusing day misdeed president, departure speaker. We debate impeachment distracted that, declared. The way stop vicious cycle, Bonior cried floor, refuse give it, whether Bill Clinton Bob Livingston. But House still reeling frenzied day fateful vote presidency approached notion resignation licked capital city like flame forest. Rejecting last-minute Democratic attempt soften action censure, House Representatives moved impeach President William Jefferson Clinton perjury Saturday call Senate try him, convict remove office. But even vote, Republicans pressed another line attack, demanding Clinton's resignation. Rep. Robert Livingston, nominated speaker last month party, startled House announced would run speaker would resign House 21 year service. He urged president heal wound created. You, sir, may resign post. Angry Democrats booed shouted, You resign! Livingston continued, I challenge fashion I willing heed word. Apologizing extramarital affair revealed two day ago, said, I believe I fine job. But I cannot job kind leader I would like current circumstance. Then bolted House chamber, nearly knocking reporter member down. (The House voted 228-206 approve first article impeachment, accusing Clinton committing perjury federal grand jury. The vote announced 1:24 pm. EST, leaving 42nd president face trial Senate whether removed office.) Clinton rejected advice immediately. His spokesman, Joe Lockhart, said, The president intention resigning. By calling Livingston reconsider, president argued broadly resignation fire. Perhaps speaking case, Lockhart said, It would wrong give insidious politics personal destruction. Unless Clinton change course, would second impeachment president 209-year history Republic, first since Andrew Johnson acquitted 1868. Sen. Trent Lott Mississippi, majority leader, insisted bargaining censure prevent starting. But Senate could halt trial later part deal. Considering degree partisanship displayed Saturday, assembling two-thirds majority required Constitution conviction unlikely. Sixty-seven vote would required, 55 Republicans Senate, along 45 Democrats. Four article impeachment House charged Clinton perjury lying affair Monica Lewinsky federal grand jury Aug. 17. He also charged perjury Paula Jones sexual harassment suit, obstruction justice abuse power. The Republican argument, over, Clinton lied denying sexual relation Ms. Lewinsky. Rep. Dick Armey Texas, majority leader, said, A nation law cannot ruled person break law. Rep. Nancy Johnson Connecticut said: There justice without truth. That profoundly so, perjury matter. Rep. Gerald Kleczka Wisconsin began Democrats' argument saying, What president wrong, personally morally, act threaten democracy thus rise level impeachable offense defined founding father Constitution. Rep. Charles Schumer, New York's senator-elect, said: The rule law requires punishment fit crime. Allow u vote censure. Saturday's vote penultimate step serious conflict Congress president since Richard M. Nixon resigned face impeachment certain conviction Aug. 9, 1974. But case spun 1972 break-in Democratic headquarters Watergate complex, one began murky land deal Arkansas 1978. Through effort Kenneth Starr, independent counsel law enacted wake Watergate, investigation spread examine Clinton's affair White House intern. All year preoccupied capital despite immense disconnect public opinion; since scandal became public January, poll shown public opposed impeachment wanted inquiry brought end. Even Friday night, 13-hour debate, CBS News Poll 548 people showed 38 percent wanted representative vote impeachment; 58 percent wanted vote. The conflict enters uncharted sea, since Nixon resignation cut matter short Johnson trial occurred different America, nuclear weapon cable television public opinion poll. But capital still rife confident speculation. Some guessed, hoped, result recent poll, showed increase support resignation way spare nation trial Ms. Lewinsky Linda Tripp would star witness, would weaken Clinton's resolve. Others thought Republicans, seeing dismal number poll party's standing United States, would first blink. With majority Senate, power end trial time Senate receives notice impeachment day convenes, Jan. 6, next day. But Clinton focused poll, CBS News survey showed 64 percent still approve handling job president, resignation could almost immediately subject criminal prosecution. And Republicans steadfastly ignored poll year, confronted directly Saturday. Representative JC. Watts Oklahoma, newly elected chairman Republican caucus, said: What's popular always right. You say poll this. Polls measure changing feeling, steadfast principle. Polls would rejected Ten Commandments. Polls would embraced slavery ridiculed women's right. You say must draw close. I say must draw line right wrong, tiny fine line executive fountain pen, big fat lead No. 2 pencil. And must every kid America see it. The point whether president prevail, whether truth prevail. Last weekend, Judiciary Committee recommended four article impeachment, Clinton's side still hoped prevail help 20 30 Republican moderate uncommitted. As week wore on, almost broke president. One not, Rep. Christopher Shays Connecticut, said Saturday: After Judge Starr's report Congress September, presentation Judiciary Committee November, I concluded impeachable offense proven, proven offense impeachable. But president's continued failure come grip action, sincerity argument member Judiciary Committee side aisle, change heart conviction member side aisle originally opposed impeachment support it, strong powerful opinion many constituent oppose position wanted president impeached caused rethink position. He added: Yesterday morning, I visited president, I concluded original position correct one, me. I believe impeachable offense proven, proven offense impeachable. But Rep. Tom DeLay Texas, led Republican effort force Clinton office, dismissed argument moral relativism. He began praising Livingston: There greater American mind, least today, Bob Livingston, understood debate about. It honor decency integrity truth; everything honor country. It also debate relativism v. absolute truth. He continued, The president's defender said president morally reprehensible, reckless, violated trust American people, lessened esteem office president dishonored office entrusted him, rise level impeachment. Rep. Jose Serrano New York said, My constituent hate Bill Clinton; love they're praying right moment. You may vote today impeach him, American people. And let tell something, I grew public housing project South Bronx. I see bunch bully I see them. The bully get theirs, going get yours, too. Rep. Henry Hyde Illinois, Judiciary Committee chairman brought charge House floor, said Congress American people needed distinguish private act infidelity public act public official. In Clinton's case, said, House dealing serial violator oath chief law-enforcement officer. He said Senate could innovative creative deciding best punish Clinton, House bound Constitution move ahead article impeachment. Justice important humble among u, Hyde said. Equal justice law that's we're fighting for. Democrats, reading Constitution, voiced diametrically opposite conclusion, attacked fairness proceeding culminated Saturday. We're losing track distinction sin crime, said Rep. Jerrold Nadler, D-NY. We're lowering standard impeachment. What president done great dangerous offense republic. Democrats also criticized Republicans impeaching Clinton moment US. troop waged war Iraq. Six day Christmas troop battle, lame-duck Congress rushing overthrow commander chief, said Rep. David Bonior Michigan, second-ranking House Democrat. The ghost Watergate hung House chamber. One Republican cited parallel charge House Judiciary Committee brought Nixon 25 year ago, count committee brought House floor affirmation Saturday. Nixon cheated. He cheated electoral system, said Rep. Lindsey Graham, South Carolina Republican Judiciary Committee. And now, Graham said, full House voting impeach Clinton believe committed crime result cheating judicial system. But day's debate firmly rooted Clinton's effort conceal sexual affair Monica Lewinsky. Rep. Bob Barr, Georgia Republican Judiciary Committee one Clinton's fiercest critic, held copy US. Criminal Code, Judiciary Committee's report impeachment inquiry and, finally, Constitution, defending decision impeach president. Today, rely three pillar society: law itself, evidence Constitution, said Barr. There joy upholding law, Watts said. If cannot see lawlessness, child cannot recognize it. How tell child honesty best policy demand policy? But Democrats assailed premise Republican majority built impeachment case Clinton. Rep. John Conyers Jr. Michigan, ranking Democrat Judiciary Committee, assailed four article impeachment, count count, unfounded evidence failing rise impeachment. He saved savage scorn final count, abuse power. The majority simply tried dress perjury count Watergate abuse-of-power language, Conyers said. Rep. Bob Livingston, confessed colleague Thursday night had adulterous affair, stunned House chamber Saturday morning saying impeachment debate President Clinton would serve speaker would quit Congress six month. He urged president follow example quit, too. But White House, call Clinton's resignation derided Republican strategy, president sent spokesman driveway urge Livingston reconsider resignation. Livingston stood well House served two decade called Clinton resign office rather force trial Senate, drawing boo colleague cat-calls quit instead. He that. I must set example I hope President Clinton follow, Livingston announced shocked silent chamber act left Republican Party total chaos hour vote impeach Clinton. The decision also left party leaderless eve opening 106th Congress, Republicans must govern one narrowest majority history. Several Republicans, including Rep. Tom DeLay Texas, majority whip, somberly welcomed news, suggesting relieved excruciating embarrassment. In lauding Livingston's move, DeLay said, He understood debate honor decency integrity truth, everything honor country. But Democrats said aghast, many including Clinton called Livingston reconsider decision. Mr. Livingston's resignation wrong, declared Rep. Jerrold Nadler, D-NY. It surrender developing sexual McCarthyism. Are going new test someone want run public office ever adulterer? He called country distinguish sin crime. White House press secretary Joe Lockhart said Clinton disappointed news Livingston's plan wished would reconsider. Lockhart said president firmly belief politics personal destruction town country come end. He reaffirmed Clinton would resign, saying: The president going what's best interest country. It would wrong give insidious politics personal destruction. Livingston's announced resignation stunning disclosure process could result president's removal office. The speaker second line presidency, vice president. Newt Gingrich, outgoing speaker, driven post Republicans lost five seat November election, technically remains speaker Jan. 6, Livingston's election ratified new Congress. But Gingrich removed daily operation House extraordinary session begun dismantle office. Livingston's decision said driven part anger group dozen conservative party disillusioned withheld news affair them. They threatened withhold vote election January would formally make speaker. He also concerned pain caused family disclosure, member said. They added that, lost many party, example would set president offering resign post now. DeLay, No. 3 House Republican leadership, expected fill power vacuum least temporarily, deed title, party regroups find new speaker. Many member quickly rallied around Rep. Dennis Hastert Illinois. Hastert, one DeLay's deputy whip well respected among colleague, promoted candidate majority leader last month, never mounted campaign. Rep. Dick Armey Texas precariously held majority-leader post last month considered likely candidate speaker. He expected manage reorganization, Republican leader set Jan. 4. Livingston met privately closest adviser Friday impeachment debate unfolded. Some colleague believed made mistake disclosing Thursday night House moving divisive debate impeachment occasion strayed marriage. He told Republican leader late Thursday afternoon Hustler magazine going expose affair early next year. Some leader urged keep quiet, wife, Bonnie, encouraged tell colleague immediately, despite momentous vote nearing floor. At point Thursday night, Roll Call, newspaper Capitol Hill, reported Web site Livingston going admit affair going offer resign. In closed-door meeting fellow Republicans, admit affair made offer step down, receiving three standing ovation instead. Thursday night, Livingston stated would intimidated effort exploit past. But Friday removed public action night drew closest adviser confidence. His aide said Saturday clue wa contemplating, member aware plan. Asked advance word, Rep. JC. Watts Oklahoma, newly elected member Republican leadership, said: I idea. Asked internal party pressure Livingston resign, Rep. Harold Rogers, R-Ky., said: I know wa, added, There member critical it. As leader tried Saturday hold party together House floor, Republicans stuck prepared script floor favor impeaching president. But began expressing anguish. Rep. Henry Hyde, R-Ill., admitted adulterous affair earlier year, said Livingston's resignation: Those u sinner must feel wretched today. Something going repeatedly stopped, confusion private act infidelity public act. To much applause, Hyde declared: Congress business intruding private act. Republicans, indeed Livingston himself, made distinction Clinton's sexual indiscretion Livingston's, saying Clinton lied private act therefore abused legal system power. As Livingston said statement Thursday: These indiscretion employee staff I never asked testify oath them. Democrats hoped Livingston's seemingly drastic action would wake House poisoned atmosphere become might prompt Republicans reconsider impeachment Clinton. Rep. Paul Kanjorski, D-Pa., said, We starting offer sacrificial lamb whatever terrible disease is. In stirring speech applauded even Republicans, Rep. Dick Gephardt Missouri, Democratic leader, praised Livingston worthy, good honorable man said resignation grave mistake. It's terrible capitulation negative political force consuming political system country, Gephardt said, adding event last day showed life imitates farce. We need stop destroying imperfect people unattainable altar public morality, said, urging colleague step back abyss reject resignation, impeachment vicious self-righteousness. The New York Times said editorial Sunday, Dec. 20: The Republicans' drive partisan impeachment based soley party-line voting power rather sense proportion produced unexpected sideshow resignation Rep. Bob Livingston role future speaker House. Analysts side struggle President Clinton's future point Livingston's downfall evidence generalized breakdown legislative civility Capitol Hill. Democrats see moral symmetry, depicting Livingston victim sexual puritanism wielding Clinton. But one thing one fall Livingston's invitation use resignation model resolving crisis White House. Livingston's statement rocked Congress, shake foundation somber constitutional process underway. By lying oath, Clinton made necessary House consider impeachment. The evidence convinced Americans president censured, removed office. Livingston allowed GOP partisan block censure House. The result Saturday's expected impeachment vote, Livingston's unexpected announcement, mission Senate remains same. It must resist Republicans want short-circuit constitutional process demand resignation, must use upcoming Senate trial forum finding censure commensurate president's personal dishonesty offense law. These require stern punishment removal office. In undertaking work, Senate must also reassure American people decisive wisdom core messy-looking political system melted down. In distempered time, shining opportunity Senate. Its member pride Republic's fire wall presidential excess popular partisan passion sometimes seize House Representatives. No one predict whether Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott rise defining challenge career whether surrender mean streak acquired 16 grumpy year minority member House. We would like see Lott reach starring role history. Lott's growling response question censure encouraging. He may right Constitution requires convene trial, nothing document prevents speedily guiding Senate toward censure negotiation. Indeed, simple majority vote 45 Democrats plus 6 cooperating Republicans end Senate trial time, clearing way introduction kind censure resolution suggested former Sen. Bob Dole. In intriguing report NBC, Tim Russert described discussion among bipartisan group senator censure would involve form presidential confession, fine joint congressional request Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr prosecute Clinton court. If Lott refuse allow bipartisan search censure, burden fall upon respected member like Joseph Lieberman Democratic side Orrin Hatch Republicans. Through cooperation, guide Senate toward punishment fix Clinton history president lied oath, avoids taint partisan vengeance associated House impeachment vote. The Senate's historic reputation prudence requires find appropriate punishment personally weak president damaged rule law, threatened stability government. House Speaker-elect Robert L. Livingston presented fresh note shock impeachment debate President Clinton Thursday night Republican leader forced admit Republican colleague carried adulterous affair past. It suddenly come attention individual working together medium investigating personal background effort find indiscretion may exploitable party eve upcoming historic vote impeachment, Livingston declared statement appearing shocked House Republican conference head disclosure surfaced news report. After hearing admission closed session, Livingston's colleague gave standing ovation support said question resigning never arisen. My fate hand, Livingston told Republicans, according lawmaker present. The debate president's fate would go forward, Republicans later insisted, drawing distinction speaker-elect's revelation sex-and-mendacity scandal put Clinton brink impeachment. The president charged impeachment resolution perjury abuse power attempt hide sexual indiscretion. Democrats offered immediate comment, Republicans braced hear Livingston's admission alluded debate Friday Democrats decried investigation president basically partisan unfair rummaging sex life. Livingston, saying sought spiritual counseling received forgiveness family, noted several time told reporter campaign become speaker I running speaker, sainthood. He added, There reason word. During 33-year marriage wife, Bonnie, I occasion strayed marriage, nearly cost marriage family, Livingston said brief prepared statement. But attempted draw contrast allegation president, asserting: I want assure everyone indiscretion employee staff I never asked testify oath them. The disclosure speaker-elect's marital infidelity, disclosed Rollcall, Capitol Hill newspaper, sent new jolt uncertainty among lawmaker prepared momentous debate president's admitted misbehavior office whether impeached tried Senate. Rep. Henry Hyde, Republican chairman House Judiciary Committee bring impeachment charge president, previously cited magazine extra-marital affair past. Then, Thursday night, Republicans voiced suspicion Democratic defender president instigated medium investigation effort embarrass Clinton's principal accuser. But proof offered Republicans left conference, facing uncertainty debate already promised bare-knuckled partisanship. Livingston left conference surrounded Capitol police, taking question waiting reporter. His chief leadership aide immediately rallied support. Some would rather struggle constitutional question continue try twist debate unseemly investigation private life, said Rep. Dick Armey, Republican majority leader. In report internet Thursday night, Rollcall disclose source made oblique reference Hustler, sex magazine. Larry Flint, publisher Hustler, earlier year advertised offer $1 million bounty information e member Congress guilty sexual indiscretion. It break heart we're subject human frailty, said Asa Hutchinson, R-Ark., left conference. This comfortable circumstance anyone, added, insisting president speaker-elect presented two separate issue. We've got duty Constitution. It gotten point drastic action may necessary. You know movie Ebola virus outbreak, guy sterile suit come in, seal area completely irradiate it? They may Washington. Just eradicate u start scratch. In few, short day managed make term surreal, bizarre, split-screen America, shocking, runaway train politics personal destruction useless cliche. We longer govern here. We roll around gutter wondering who's next sexual auto-de-fe. On Saturday morning, surreal, shocking, bizarre, split-screen image Bob Livingston, speaker-elect, stepping marital infidelity revealed. We pawn chessboard, Livingston said, asking president resign resigning himself. Livingston's rabid pursuit president, even hoped hide dirty laundry, made avatar hypocrisy capital rotting hypocrisy. On Thursday night, Livingston first confessed sin Republicans hope keeping hold post, colleague gave standing ovation. And made surprise announcement Saturday, Republicans gave another ovation stepped deliver encomium lost speaker. One's self-esteem get utterly crushed time like this, sighed Henry Hyde, another tormenter president also admit succumbed temptation. Tom DeLay, jagged-edge exterminator may next-up speaker roundelay, choked up, praising greatness Livingston understanding debate relativism versus absolute truth. What could relative Republican hidden lot affair trying impeach president lying his? Spurred Larry Flynt's bounty sinnuendo, city braced craziness. The Ship Fools reached cruising speed Friday evening, frightening scene Republicans crazed hatred president railroading impeachment even though United States war Iraq, even though House chamber mostly empty, even though Republicans huddled glass house issue sex lie, even though White House still pitching tent planning sleigh ride Winter Wonderland press party Monday. (The White House keeping journalist quarantined outside year, encouraged bring kid. To soak cozy family atmosphere, doubt. Why Republicans obsessed, everyone right mind agrees impeachment outlandishly over-the-top punishment Clinton self-destructive course country? Because genuinely hate president. They think he's dishonest, immoral, issue-stealing, selfish child '60s. They think they're going pay political price this, do, care. It might great time see lot combovers, great time see lot stature. The House debate history. It hideous version The McLaughlin Group. While Republicans tried draw distinction Clinton perjured himself, ignored president lured Starr-Jones attorney team testifying Monica Lewinsky. Ordinarily one would feel sorry Livingston. But Republicans brought sexual doomsday machine focusing single-mindedly Clinton's sex life. The Republicans determined high-tech lynching engaged wacky role reversal. Many Republican hawk argued Bill Clinton bombing Saddam, claiming timing suspicious, even though hammered bombing five week ago. In incredibly unseemly display, Trent Lott, majority leader, former Bush national security adviser Brent Scowcroft Bush Secretary State Lawrence Eagleburger chimed attack. There's much hate here. And I hate it. We debate impeachment distracted that, minority whip, Rep. David Bonior, Democrat Michigan, said Saturday's House debate, leaped impossible goal. It would taken kaleidoscopic television screen capture constantly shifting image competing center stage: impeachment, Iraq, resignation Rep. Robert Livingston, response White House. The month leading impeachment President Clinton become series televised anticlimax, hour vote made lack drama. There hardly enough shorthand term split screen cover activity. All network cable channel carried moment unexpectedly set tone, Livingston, Louisiana Republican, announced debate would become House speaker. The commentator set carry congressional ratification inevitable vote, suddenly plugged-in reporter caught guard. As Tim Russert said Tom Brokaw NBC, Tom, knock u over. In echo chamber television news often becomes, shared mantra weightier early morning. For second time American history president would impeached, went standard line. Yet despite pundit speculating politician telegraphing every move, one hinted Livingston resignation. The announcement wa, Brokaw put it, least partly political ploy, repercussion immediate. Reporters began gathering word Capitol Hill candidate speaker's job, conversation moved next stage political tug war. The Republicans used Livingston's resignation say president resign, too; Democrats immediately countered idea president would stay Livingston well. That led one less-expected split screen day, bad choice. While Congress debating, CNN showed anti-aircraft fire Baghdad one box. In other, Joe Lockhart, Clinton's press secretary, stood White House driveway telling reporter president would like Livingston reconsider decision. There stateliness House television usually offer, one reason purely visual. Keep mind control picture, Dan Rather said CBS, explaining television camera Congress provided House, individual network. There way roam zoom reaction shot, political convention. But sense history decorum last long CBS. At noon, vote, CBS went football game, becoming network leave news coverage. CBS' corporate decision try way meant Rather would break update Washington. I'll see soon, said signed complete coverage, looking like trouper. But position news anchor day. He later announced impeachment vote split screen football game progress upper part screen. On network cable channel, vote literally happened background. As TV screen toted number electronically-cast vote, member Congress milled around chatted floor. Even brief Democratic walkout motion consider censure defeated thoroughly forecast. As Democrats straggled step Congress, looked curiously undramatic television, though probably made better still photograph place. And vote progress, jockeying speaker's job heated up. We already presumptive leader, Gwen Ifill NBC News said midafternoon, naming Rep. Dennis Hassert, R-Ill., also cited network likely candidate. If political military action intruded, might obvious debate House floor sent message vast division politics morality, signaling deep cultural fissure crisis opened. The impeachment, said Rep. Tom DeLay, R-Texas, debate relativism v. absolute truth. Rep. Jerrold Nadler, D-N.Y., contended Congress lost distinction sin crime, argued sexual McCarthyism become prominent. And backdrop revelation adultery led Livingston's resignation, Rep. Dick Gephardt, minority leader, declared politics personal destruction end. But jabbering political posturing continued, reporter raced cover president's statement impeachment latest briefing Pentagon, little time focus profound cultural message beneath rhetorical flourish. Bob Livingston, incoming speaker House, took public role Friday debate unfolded whether impeach President Clinton. His previous 24 hour visible month since party nominated speaker perhaps excruciating public career: He spent day chaotic procedural wrangle term Friday's debate; ended telling Republican colleague had extramarital affair 20-year tenure Congress. His disclosure followed investigation Larry Flynt, publisher Hustler, sex magazine, said Friday news conference Beverly Hills, Calif., publication learned Livingston had adulterous affair last 10 year. Flynt said earlier year wanted expose hypocrisy Washington investigating Clinton October offered $1 million anyone could prove had affair member Congress. He said Friday larger investigation, published perhaps soon January, would reveal described indiscretion several Republicans. He said connection White House hired investigative firm based Washington made former employee FBI CIA. He would confirm whether firm Terry Lenzner's Investigative Group Inc., done work president's private lawyer. Livingston unavailable reporter Friday. He spent time Friday morning sprawled chair back House chamber, listening debate whether impeach Clinton lying sexual indiscretion. Several colleague knelt Livingston's knee, whispered patted back. He spent day private office chamber, avoiding gauntlet reporter lay wait House regular office across street. The word aide Navy awarded contract worth million dollar ship built Louisiana district Avondale Shipyards. During Friday's debate, handful Democrats made oblique allusion human failure. For example, Rep. John Lewis, D-Ga., said: Let sin cast first stone. Who, among u sinned? But one said Livingston's disclosure mild Democratic attempt exploit would influence vote impeachment. Rather, House floor hallway chitchat, Livingston's conduct seemed last thing either Republicans Democrats wanted talk about. Bob Livingston first-rate human being, said Rep. David Obey, D-Wis., worked closely sparred Livingston Appropriations Committee, interview. I repeat nun taught St. James long time ago: We would hell lot better looking soul rather trying evaluate somebody else's. None u business even opinion it. Even conservative Republicans seemed ready overlook disclosure. We're going say, `Bob, can't speaker violated vow wife,' said Rep. Lindsey Graham, R-SC. Like many, including Livingston, Graham distinguished Livingston's conduct Clinton's saying president trampled legal system whereas Livingston's behavior strictly private. Despite Flynt's claim, many Republicans blamed Clinton administration smearing Livingston, although offered evidence. This happening own, said Rep. Dana Rohrabacher, R- Calif. The thing certain uncertainty. The smart money shout President Clinton never resign, concurs. The smart money argues Senate could muster 67 vote would needed remove wounded president office, would require defection 12 Democrats Republicans stand him. The smart money insists someone cut deal end this. Maybe so. But smarter money whisper, Remember. Remember everyone Washington, including Rep. Henry Hyde, R-Ill., chairman Judiciary Committee, said House would never, ever, treat impeachment partisan issue. Wrong. Remember pundit predicted Democratic loss midterm election, opposite happened, said impeachment dead. Twice wrong. And remember New Year nation may travel road never traveled before. One president, Andrew Johnson Tennessee, tried Senate, course. But happened different country one 37 state, primitive communication, simple economy based largely agriculture, minimal commitment abroad. In toxic politics century's end Washington, inconceivable become commonplace. The wholly unanticipated announcement Saturday morning Rep. Robert Livingston, R-La., would serve speaker would resign Congress, following equally unanticipated disclosure Thursday night several extramarital affair, deepened capital's profound sense insecurity. The deadly sweep scythe neo-puritanism appears unstoppable, least moment, Livingston's forthcoming resignation increase pressure president likewise. You've set u example, leader House Republican majority, Rep. Dick Armey Texas, told Livingston Saturday. The example principle come power. The Democrats made opposite point, arguing Livingston case showed wrong savage people personal pecaddillos. One transcendently important thing remains same: Although surrounded judicial trapping presided chief justice, trial president political process, power residing hand elective politician. In addition narrow legal issue guilt innocence, weigh consideration party, nation's future, individual political well-being almost anything else care weigh reaching verdict. The longer took, numerous call resignation would probably be. Even Saturday's epochal roll-calls, four ten Americans interviewed latest New York Times/CBS News Poll said thought president step indicted, despite fact large majority voiced disapproval impeachment proceeding. What lie behind seeming contradiction, course, fear Clinton, country him, would incapacitated. No one took Andrew Johnson seriously escaped conviction single vote. But Clinton, man powerful whose whole life series comeback, already embarked effort show nation's business. Richard Nixon clawed way back respectability leaving White House one thought could; Clinton intends re-establish authority still office. He one great advantage: Two-thirds American public continues voice approval political stewardship, whatever think man. The president press hard, despite much-reduced leverage, deal censure. Indeed, fine piece political irony one could ask for, already sought enlist former Sen. Bob Dole, Republican defeated 1996, emissary Senate majority. The number unpromising: help six Republicans, 45 Democrats could end trial time pas censure resolution House would surely take up. There enough Republican moderate sometime party-buckers make plausible target. But Republican leader Senate, Trent Lott Mississippi, made unwillingness take president's word plainly evident recent day, determined fight trial-aborting arrangement. It clear Clinton's reputation stained forever, matter Senate doe. The spot out. History remember man coveted glowing legacy impresario economic growth, Moses pointed way 21st century, second president ever impeached, first ousted. That harsh word, impeachment, cling name surely Teapot Dome cling Harding's Depression Hoover's. But alone suffered grievous injury political avalanche shaken loose disclosure Clinton's sexual relationship former White House intern, Monica Lewinsky. The Republicans' public support shriveled 40 percent new Times/CBS News poll, lowest level 14 year, could go lower fact impeachment sink in. Journalists seen many jackal, indifferent whatever personal suffering national angst may cause long get story, none concerned accuracy. In fact, whole political culture 1990s, criminalization political conduct seeming indifference important national international issue, fallen disrepute ordinary Americans. The last week seemed crystallize long-term decline political civility. Republicans called Clinton liar, even committing American pilot sky Iraq, Democrats accused rival conducting political lynching political coup d'etat. Bipartisanship may biggest victim all. Party line Saturday's roll call held firm leg iron. Almost Republicans opposed impeachment exclusively legal principle least partly special political circumstance Democratic majority Rep. Constance Morella's district Maryland suburb Washington, example, gratitude Rep. Peter King, R-N.Y., Clinton's peacemaking Ireland. It hard see emerged reputation enhanced, except perhaps Hillary Rodham Clinton, staunch face deception. If threat dire prediction uttered House Democrats recent day taken face value, nation entering upon Era Bad Feelings, polar opposite second Era Good Feelings, similar 1820s, Clinton hoped preside over. Rep. Tom Sawyer, D-Ohio, compared Clinton Friday Sir Thomas More, executed treason 1535 religious belief. He quoted More's word admonition today: What hunted action thought heart. It long road opened. God help statesman walk road. But amidst loose talk permanent damage institution that, remember: Things change startling speed modern American politics, institution American government proved extraordinarily resilient. President Nixon, almost universally agreed 1974, weakened American presidency many decade come. Nobody said eight year Ronald Reagan, 15 year later. In end, people meant nothing. Bob Livingston clearer that. His mind mind follower closed. Even bombing continued Iraq Americans coast coast clamoring alternative impeachment, even adulterous past flushed grotesque invasion privacy inevitably followed relentlessly prurient pursuit president, even country began contemplate destructive effect lengthy bitter Senate trial, speaker-designate arrogantly stupidly proclaimed: Let u disregard outside influence. The radical Hill would hear nothing echo fanaticism. Impeach! Impeach! And continued even stunning announcement Saturday morning Livingston would quit House. Dismayed partisan stampede, Dick Gephardt, Democratic leader, warned impeachment debate Friday: In effort uphold Constitution, trampling Constitution. David Bonior, Democratic whip, said: This wrong. It unfair. It unjust. At time event world challenge home demand stand united, censure one solution bring u together. To colleague across aisle, I say let go obsession. Listen American people. But voice reason would heard. Livingston right-wing colleague, Tom DeLays, Henry Hydes, Bob Barrs, mission destruction would denied. Ordinary Americans could cry wanted. They could protest demonstrate, send fax E-mails. It matter. The right march democracy run. Rep. Thomas Barrett, Democrat Wisconsin, tried remind Republican colleague Constitution allow remove president office can't stand him. He wa, course, ignored. The Republicans pay huge price brazen, utterly partisan attempt drag president White House defiance of people. The party's contempt voter arrogantly quite adequately summed Alan Simpson, former senator Wyoming, said: The attention span Americans movie coming next month whether quarterly report stock change. If voter dope Mr. Simpson think are, come 2000 everyone forgotten impeachment crisis. But Rep. Robert Menendez, D-N.J., probably closer truth said, I warn colleague reap bitter harvest unfair partisan seed sow today. One many strange event past couple week way virtually previously undecided Republicans, so-called moderate, surrendered independence lined like lackey follow right wing's lead. All proclaimed loudly voting principle, fact exercise mass cowardice, exemplified Rep. John McHugh upstate New York. McHugh announced Tuesday would vote impeachment. But decision based principle, odd way expressing it. The Washington Post said McHugh appeared stomach Senate conviction removal president office. Of colleague Senate, McHugh said, I, one, would accept, even welcome, mercy. In word, let Senate heavy constitutional lifting. McHugh may wished loud mercy, clearly frightened right-winger House cast compassionate vote himself. The GOP longer conceal party extremist, right-wing absolutist, party step political cultural orientation Americans. Bob Livingston may leaving, arrogant comment still serve party's slogan. Let u disregard outside influence. Let u disregard people. ","During the Clinton impeachment debate in the House, Speaker-elect Bob Livingston declared that he would set an example for the president and resign from Congress over revelations of his marital infidelities.Republican demands that the president also resign were rejected by Democrats who also said that Livingston should not quit and that the Speaker-elect's resignation was, in the words of Jerrold Nadler (D-N.Y), ""a surrender to sexual McCarthyism"".With the House vote to impeach, the president will face a Senate trial, but it is unlikely that 67 members will vote for conviction.The trial could be mercifully shortened, however, by a vote of censure.","As impeachment proceedings in the House approached a climax, House members were stunned by an admission from House Speaker elect Livingston that he was guilty of an adulterous affair.The admission follows disclosures by Hustler published Larry Flynn, who had offered one million dollars to anyone who could provide such information on a House or Senate member.Livingston's admission was met with a standing ovation by House members, as was his subsequent resignation.In resigning, Livingston called on President Clinton to do the same.Political pundits see the whole process as driven by partisan politics.","House Speaker-elect Robert L. Livingston was forced to admit to his Republican colleagues his past adultery.This was forced by an investigation by Larry Flynt.When Livingston called for Clinton to quit, House Democrats yelled, ""You resign""!Stunningly, he did.TV commentators were caught off guard.Livingston put pressure on Clinton to follow his example.The House moved to impeach Clinton and called on the Senate to try him.Livingston's downfall was said to show a breakdown in legislative civility.Those who want impeachment were called radicals and fanatics.Livingston's pursuit of Clinton was characterized as ""rabid"", showing his own hypocrisy.","House Speaker-elect Robert Livingston shocked his Republican colleagues in the midst of a Clinton impeachment debate by admitting to adulterous affairs during his Congressional tenure.He later urged Clinton to follow his example and resign that increased the fury of the impeachment debate.The House moved to impeach the President for perjury and called on the Senate to try him, convict him and remove him from office.Some who believe the debate shows the fanatical, partisan, and hateful side of Republican behavior, advise the Senate only to censure Clinton and thus avoid partisan vengeance.The issue deepens a cultural fissure and a sense of uncertainty."

The head space agency United States, Russia, Japan Canada, along European Space Agency, met Moscow Saturday discus project, Interfax news agency reported. The space agency head agreed schedule future meeting holding scientific conference project somewhere Europe, unspecified date. Also Saturday, head Russia's Mission Control, Vladimir Lobachev, quoted saying Russia would take lead role managing international space station first five year. Previously, space official said station would jointly controlled Moscow Houston, US. space agency NASA taking lead role. According Interfax, Lobachev said made sense Russia control project Russian-built Zarya Russian-built service module would perform life support navigational function station's first five year. Furthermore, Russian engineer experienced job NASA official aware this, said. The space station expected cost least dlrs 40 billion, United States expected pay dlrs 24 billion. Russia's financing problem delayed initial launch year, critic said station amount expensive way NASA keep Russia's beleaguered space program alive. The station serve orbital home visiting astronaut cosmonaut least 15 year.

Russian space expert making final preparation Thursday Baikonur rocket base launch first component multibillion dollar international space station year delay. Built Russian company launched atop Russian booster rocket, 24-ton Zarya (Sunrise) control cargo module U.S.-funded component station. It serve space tugboat early stage project, providing propulsion, power communication. The unmanned launch, set 9:40 Moscow time (0640 GMT) Friday Baikonur Kazakhstan, delayed one year mainly cash-strapped Russian space agency's failure complete another part station. After year discussing, planning replanning, launch hardware, Gretchen McClain, deputy associate administrator new station, said news conference earlier week. We ready begin project bring u millennium woman men living working space permanently. Russian official added traditional note superstition. It Russian tradition preface launch . advance statement. I would like knock wood, rather common Russian tradition, said Alexander Krasnov, deputy chief Russian Space Agency's manned flight department. The station, involving 16 nation United States Russia playing biggest role, consist 100 element take 45 assembly flight complete. It due completed 2004. The station weigh 500 ton (more million pound) expected cost least dlrs 40 billion, United States planning pay dlrs 21 billion. It serve orbital home visiting astronaut cosmonaut 20 year. Zarya fly alone two week rendezvous American space shuttle Endeavor, launched Dec. 3 carrying Unity connecting module. The shuttle crew attach two module together three space walk, using Endeavors robot arm. The 12.4-meter (41.2-feet) Zarya hold 6 ton fuel 16 tank capable flying independently 430 day. Its control system consists 36 thruster two large engine major orbital change. It launched three-stage heavy-lift Proton booster rocket would put Zarya orbit le 10 minute blastoff. In ensuing day, ground controller gradually adjust orbit preparation meeting Endeavor. The space station inhabitable early 2000, following launch Russian crew module set blast next July August. Russia repeatedly failed meet deadline constructing crew module, putting whole project behind schedule. Having lost hope getting promised government fund, Russian space agency sold early research time station NASA dlrs 60 million complete segment. Agency chief Yuri Koptev said taking part new station hope beleaguered Russian space industry, whose funding collapsed since Soviet collapse. The project would allow Russia keep 80,000 job next 15 year. Koptev assailed Russian space engineer continue insist money put Russia's battered 12-year old Mir space station extend lifetime instead committing fund new space outpost. The choice determined emotion. Some people glued one thing (Mir) care rest, Koptev said recent news conference. We must proceed understanding would take u future, allow u preserve industry. The Russian Khrunichev company earned dlrs 200 million building Zarya, whose design based earlier Soviet spacecraft, including Mir's six module. WASHINGTON NASA Russian Space Agency agreed set aside last-minute Russian request launch international space station orbit closer Mir, official announced Friday. While putting new station closer Russia's 12-year-old Mir station would make easier transfer equipment supply old outpost new one, request came late acted on, said Randy Brinkley, NASA's space station program manager. NASA surprised last week Russia's prime station contractor proposed orbital position change two-and-a-half week launch first part new station. Delaying Nov. 20 flight 10 hour match orbit would forced similar shift subsequent assembly flight, resulted potentially unfavorable sun angle solar-powered station, engineer said. We mutually concluded would prudent make change, Brinkley said news conference held Johnson Space Center Houston. It added technical complexity risk mission justified. The decision, followed frank candid discussion two partner, imposed United States, said. The conclusion mutual, Brinkley said. Both side concluded make sense. The Russians, struggling find money space program nation economic collapse, said wanted transfer thousand pound newer equipment scientific instrument Mir economy move. However, critic questioned Russians' motif, wondering requested orbital change part plan delay decommissioning destruction Mir, Russians agreed next summer. The Russians little money United States partner international station fear money spent Mir prevent Russia meeting obligation new project. The Mir competes international space station critical resource funding, Brinkley said. NASA consider idea salvaging Mir's research equipment use international space station, said, interfere assembling new station. The United States 15 nation plan begin building new station orbit next week Russians launch module supply power propulsion early stage five-year construction period. The space shuttle Endeavor follow Dec. 3 second station part, U.S.-built connecting passageway attache first module. The first piece international space station orbiting Earth Friday, sprouting antenna unfolding solar power panel awaited segment, eventually grow largest orbital laboratory history. The module, called Zarya Russian term meaning sunrise dawn, took flawless ride space atop three-stage Russian Proton booster rocket lifted 1:40 am. Eastern time Baikonur cosmodrome Kazakhstan. The launching witnessed head space agency 16 nation sponsoring station, cost least $40 billion build next five year. Zarya, built Russia $240 million United States, joined two week first American module, docking hub called Unity. The space shuttle Endeavour take Dec. 3 rendezvous Zarya attach two unit. This followed 43 flight American Russian rocket carrying 100 part assembled space form 900,000-pound research station housing seven astronaut. Daniel Goldin, administrator NASA, said news conference following launching, Now 44 launch go, 1,000 hour space walk countless problem. But partner nation trusting working together, said, international space station going reality. Even new space station coming together, question continue fate Russia's existing space laboratory, 12-year-old Mir. Because collapse Russian economy, doubt Russia produce enough rocket equipment support project led Russia promise would abandon Mir destroy station next summer. However, recent week Russian official lobbying find way extend Mir's life. According report news agency Reuters, President Boris Yeltsin's space adviser, Yevgeny Shaposhnikov, said Friday preparing number proposal extending Mir's life past year 2000. Support option growing recent week among Russian space official, astronaut nationalist, see Mir symbol Russian achievement space. James Van Laak, NASA's deputy manager operation space station, said Friday agency received formal proposal extending Mir's life. NASA would find proposal unacceptable measurable impact international space station, Van Laak said telephone interview Johnson Space Center Houston, No one objection Mir keeping operational Russians find way support project, demonstrate can. Yuri Koptev, head Russian Space Agency, said launching Zarya, 42,000-pound space tugboat supply power propulsion early stage station construction, needed vindication troubled Russian space program. The Russian space industry alive well perfectly able fulfill commitment international space station, Koptev said. A Russian Proton booster rocket carried first part international space station orbit Friday, heralding start new era international space colonization. Russian space official others cheered ground control announced capsule separated booster rocket reached first orbit 200 kilometer (125 mile) Earth. Success, shouted one exultant official 10 minute giant rocket blasted entered orbit. The head space agency 16 nation participating project watched lift-off distance 5 kilometer (3 miles). Strategic Rocket Forces troop prepared launch underground bunker avoid poisoning highly toxic rocket fuel. Russian US. official said launch flawless module performed well initial test. They cautioned much work remains done get ambitious space station project working. Now 44 launch go, 1,000 hour space walk countless problem, trust mutual respect . international space station going reality, NASA chief Daniel Goldin told press conference launch. His Russian counterpart, Yuri Koptev, said launch vital vindication troubled Russian space industry, proving could play major role space operation. Today made truly epoch-making step carry project. The Russian space industry alive well perfectly able fulfill commitment international space station, said. The launch went smoothly, rocket soaring cloudy sky central Asian steppe. The huge roar rocket reverberated dozen kilometer (miles) across empty plain around base. The mood launch pad tense launch, space official worker anxiously making last-minute check ensure problem. Solar power panel module successfully deployed shortly reached first orbit system working normally, official said. The launch Russian cargo module, delayed year, usher new era cooperation among former space-race rival. Space official expressed optimism cooperation would promote world stability following end Cold War. We still contradiction, still combat missile aimed other, predominant trend state cooperation thing together, said Yuri Semyonov Russia's Energia space company. The 12.4-meter (41.2-feet) Zarya, Sunrise, launched three-stage Proton booster rocket. Zarya designed serve space tugboat early stage project, providing propulsion, power communication. Engineers finished final preparation early Friday liftoff 24-ton module. The rocket blasted cloudy sky strong wind, disappeared behind cloud 40 second later. The international space station, U.S.-led successor Russia's beleaguered Mir, involves 16 nation due completed 2004. It consist 100 element take 45 assembly flight complete. Russia's crucial participation hampered country's financial problem. The launch first segment postponed repeatedly, mainly chronically broke Russian space agency afford complete another part station go later. Zarya fly alone two week rendezvous American space shuttle Endeavor, launched Dec. 3 carrying Unity connecting module. The space station inhabitable least early 2000, following launch Russian crew module set blast next July August.

Russia repeatedly failed meet deadline constructing crew module, putting whole project behind schedule. Having lost hope getting promised government fund, Russian space agency sold research time station NASA dlrs 60 million complete segment. Russia rent Baikonur launching pad Kazakstan. Endeavour astronaut closed Sunday capture first piece international space station, Russian-made Zarya control module connected Unity chamber aboard shuttle. Stacking two giant cylinder 240 mile Earth considered difficult part mission. The job fell Nancy Currie, shuttle crane operator deftly hoisted repositioned Unity cargo bay Saturday. The two station piece big 77 foot tip one tip combined mass 70,000 pound Currie crewmates going rely computerized vision system camera view, rather direct line sight. Such blind docking never attempted before. Mission Control gave astronaut plenty time task. The main thing I've tried last two year working flight make sure time. We margin everything, said flight director Bob Castle. Before beginning final approach Zarya Russian Sunrise shuttle's six astronaut steer clear chunk rocket launched last month California. Mission Control ordered pilot fire shuttle thruster put extra three mile Endeavour space junk, putting Endeavour total five mile orbiting debris. The smaller gap would probably little close comfort, Mission Control said. The bigger worry, far, Endeavour's pursuit capture Zarya, coupling Unity. The shuttle's 50-foot robot arm never assigned handle object massive 44,000-pound Zarya, power propulsion module launched Kazakhstan Nov. 20. It provide necessary electricity steering fledgling space station permanent control module launched next summer. The 36-foot, 25,000-pound Unity serve connecting passageway, vestibule, future module. In case Zarya Unity could connected robot arm, two spacewalking astronaut would manually fit together. The astronaut would going anyway Monday attach electrical connector cable two component. In all, three spacewalks planned Endeavour's 12-day flight. NASA estimate 43 launch 159 spacewalks needed mission assemble entire orbiting complex. Once completed, 16-nation space station mass 1 million pound, longer football field, house seven astronaut cosmonaut. Two astronaut ventured back another spacewalk Wednesday attach antenna international space station construction nearly 250 mile Earth. For second time week, Jerry Ross James Newman floated hatch shuttle Endeavour work seven-story, 35-ton station taking shape open cargo bay. Their No. 1 priority attach two 100-pound antenna Unity, American-made side space station. Their job, time permitting, trickier: trying open stuck antenna Zarya, Russian-built control module. The planned seven-hour spacewalk nearly difficult crucial Monday night's outing, Ross Newman hooked 40 electrical connection Zarya Unity. The plan called men lug two suitcase-size antenna halfway Unity install opposite side 36-foot cylinder. Once activated, antenna provide direct, virtually uninterrupted communication link Unity NASA's Mission Control. Otherwise, US. flight controller would rely sporadic coverage provided Russian ground station. The electronic computer hookup antenna made inside Unity Thursday, entire crew enters orbiting station first time. Other spacewalking chore Ross Newman Wednesday evening included erecting sunshade computer mounted outside Unity. Mission Control decided spacewalk let Newman take crack unjamming Zarya antenna. Flight controller urged caution. The antenna rolled spool, engineer worried 3-foot strip might pop open enough force hurt got close. Newman 10-foot grappling hook job. The antenna one two failed open properly following Zarya's Nov. 20 launch Kazakstan. One spacewalk planned Endeavour's 12-day mission: On Saturday, Ross Newman conduct photo survey take sack tool used future station visitor. Newman also may try unjam Zarya antenna. This sixth spacewalk Ross 18-year NASA career, American, third Newman. ",NASA and the Russian Space Agency readied the first part of an international space station for launch from Baikonur base.They decided not to change the orbit of the Zarya module as Russia had requested.Zarya's Nov. 20 launch was a success.The Zarya module orbited Earth for 2 weeks before a rendezvous with U.S. shuttle Endeavor to join it to the Unity module.It was tweaked and working well.It will serve as a space tugboat.The first 2 building blocks of the international space station were successfully joined by Endeavor astronauts in the shuttle's open cargo bay.Endeavor astronauts made 2 of 3 planned spacewalks to work on the space station modules.,"Russia launched the first piece of the international space station into orbit a year after the originally scheduled date.The launch follows a last minute Russian request to change the orbit of the space station to put it closer to Mir.This request was set aside.Two weeks later, the U.S. carried the Unity chamber into orbit.U.S. astronauts aboard the Endeavor shuttle then joined the Unity chamber to the Russian Zarya control module.The resulting 7 story structure appeared to be a perfect fit.In a subsequent second space walk, the astronauts were to install antennas on the Unity chamber as well as to attempt to unjam a Russian antenna.","Jerry Ross and James Newman spacewalked to attach antennas to Unity, the American half of the first stage of the 16-nation space station.Unity will be a connecting passageway for other modules.The other portion of the fledgling station, the Russian- built and launched Zarya module, will provide power and propulsion to the facility.The successful launch of Zarya, which had been delayed over a year due to funding woes, was hailed by the Russian Space Agency head as proof that the Russian space industry ""is perfectly able to fulfill all of its commitments on the international space station"".Russia is scheduled to launch the crew module next year.","After a year's delay Russia launched the first unit of the international space station, then pushed it to a higher orbit.Zarya will provide propulsion, power, and comms.US shuttle Endeavour made a blind docking with Zarya.Two spacewalks made electrical connections with Unity, which will serve as a passageway, attached its antennas and attempted to open a stuck Zarya antenna.A Russian cost-cutting proposal to orbit the station closer to Mir jointly vetoed.Russia promised to destroy Mir but now wants to extend its life.Russia sold early research time on the station to NASA to pay construction costs but claims the management lead for 1st 5 years."

The Latin American leader must gauge need unpopular reform public finance, including austerity package risk social unrest political upheaval. A joint declaration signed Sunday ancient port city Douro River northern Portugal. Diplomats said consensus form final statement.

Latin America's leader favor creating kind regulatory system global financial transaction would place control speculator, like measure slow internatioal flow money. They also want reform allow international financial institution head crisis rather react rescue package. International institution must active tackling crisis like recent one . contribute stability, Portuguese Foreign Minister Jaime Gama said. Countries progressive policy penalized, given incentive, Gama added reference Latin American nations' effort modernize economy. Brazil, continent's largest economy potential bulwark creeping recession, waiting news dlrs 30 billion bailout package International Monetary Fund. The president World Bank InterAmerican Development Bank also expected talk. The move US. Federal Reserve cut interest rate Thursday revived Latin America's financial market, analyst expected reprieve short-lived deep concern continent's economic health. The recent economic trouble stemmed part structural weakness Latin American economy. A strike waged state employee Colombia government austerity package offer glimpse trouble could arise tough reform introduced. Brazil drafting austerity package hit public spending, especially social security. Brazilian official ended four day meeting representative International Monetary Fund Tuesday without living public pledge announce concrete measure reduce government deficit. In Washington, Pedro Parente, executive secretary Brazilian Finance Ministry, offered detail Brazil's plan raising primary account surplus next three year. With five day go gubernatorial runoff Sunday, neither President Fernando Henrique Cardoso, Brasilia, said government planned achieve saving. Important ally Cardoso lagging behind three key state, despite government promise, market analyst expect announcement election. Instead, strategy Brasilia Washington appeared focus reassuring market work cutting deficit going forward, without providing fodder opponent domestic election. The discussion continue objective reaching agreement soon detailed program, said joint statement IMF Brazilian Finance Ministry. Because Brazil's enormous deficit, collapse emerging market hit nation particularly hard, draining foreign currency reserve pushing economy toward recession. Finance official Washington around world fear collapse Brazil, size link economy, would worsen financial instability throughout hemisphere. With 160 million people, Brazil represents world's ninth-largest economy financial engine Latin America. Throughout day, government official met Cardoso Brasilia expected fine-tune three-year austerity package Cardoso discus congressional party leader Wednesday morning. In Brasilia, official said among measure considered tax increase financial transaction, three-tenths percent two-tenths percent, extending Fiscal Stabilization Fund, set aside 20 percent tax collected presidential discretionary spending. The fund expired 1999. Speaking Washington, Parente said Brazil would aim toward surplus 2.6 percent 1999, 2.8 percent 2000 3 percent 2001. It already announced, end IMF's annual meeting Washington two week ago Brazil would reach primary account surplus 2.5 percent 3 percent qualify IMF aid. The primary account cover government expense, without interest payment debt. Ernest Brown, senior economist Latin America Morgan Stanley Dean Witter, said sign Brazilian government IMF moving closer aid package reassuring, expect much reassurance next week. I call `We pope' scenario, Brown said. You're going hear pope, maybe see white smoke rising, said, figure pope election. The United States preparing commit US. taxpayer fund part lending program least $30 billion try insulate Brazil, rest Latin America, worst effect financial turmoil circling globe, according US. foreign official assembling program. Details US. contribution, expected total several billion dollar direct aid loan guarantee, yet negotiated. But several congressional leader alerted likelihood administration would act Congress recess. This early warning administration reflects memory Congress erupted objection hearing 1995 President Clinton committed $20 billion US. fund bailout Mexico. But administration official said last week early sounding indicate member Congress deeply concerned preventing economic collapse Latin America would resound United States, thus expect objection. The timing aid package Brazil originally expected within next day complicated unexpected delay cropped dealing Brazilian government. The government President Fernando Henrique Cardoso face politically risky gubernatorial election Sunday, may well determine whether Brazil execute austerity program key condition loan concurrently negotiating International Monetary Fund. The biggest role rescue program Brazil taken International Monetary Fund, said last week would contribute least $15 billion appears pressure United States even more. Another $9 billion come World Bank Inter-American Development Bank, remainder United States major industrial nation. Germany Japan, though, reluctant take part, one US. official noted, suggesting Latin America chiefly Washington's problem, own. So far, US. official working behind scene organize aid package said nothing public detail plan direct contribution Brazil. Brazil important economic well-being region, United States international community, u much focused seeing helpful, Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin said Friday. But wide-ranging interview global economic turmoil, Rubin declined say strategy would pursue dealing Brazil's problem insisted decision made United States might contribute. But discussed Brazil opportunity engage kind preventive financial diplomacy President Clinton advocated speech IMF World Bank three week ago. At time, Clinton argued monetary fund provide contingent finance help country ward global financial contagion rather wait disaster strike. Direct US. aid Brazil would clearly send symbolic message: year trying manage financial crisis monetary fund, United States ready put limited amount capital risk prevent havoc Brazil stop chaos spreading Argentina, Mexico country major US. trading partner. That would change strategy. So far, United States operated almost entirely international financial institution, chiefly IMF But would also risky move President Clinton, economically politically. Even though Congress objected $20 billion US. fund committed bailout Mexico, turned $12 billion ultimately needed, since paid back, interest. But Rubin noted Friday different environment now. Other administration official say believe would objection Congress direct US. participation Brazil bailout. I think lot people Congress scared death what's happening market, could happen district, White House official said last week, say much long vote it. By acting soon stabilize Latin America, administration hoping capitalize two week relative calm late-summer panic engulfed Russia and, height, led outflow billion dollar day Brazil, fear would next country forced devalue currency. Whether calm mark beginning turnaround another pause wildfire erupted since Thailand's currency crisis July 1997 matter considerable debate. But many expert cite confluence several event reassured jittery investor around world: two successive interest-rate cut United States, Japan's long-delayed move prop banking system $500 billion taxpayer fund, steady strengthening currency Thailand, Indonesia South Korea, first sign investor may preparing return. Always circumspect come commenting publicly market, Rubin acknowledged last several week number significant, positive development. But former trader, burned 26-year career many false market rally, warned serious issue remain take time world work way repeatedly called serious international financial disruption last 50 year. In fact, Rubin's aide clearly nervous possibility another outbreak could set new round panic, made virtually impossible many emerging-market country borrow money world market. Brazil Japan two obvious tinderbox, said Jeffrey Garten, dean Yale School Management, served undersecretary commerce international affair Clinton's first term. In Brazil, issue whether package coming together really big enough deal exploding debt problem. And Japan question whether real reform go along money. But spending 18 month negotiation Japanese, Rubin clearly sens United States little leverage Tokyo; problem chiefly rooted political gridlock, lack resource. In Brazil, though, United States better chance buying time influencing economic reform program, long appear dictating term publicly Cardoso team. But demonstrating economic support probably require tapping Exchange Stabilization Fund, created Roosevelt administration help stabilize dollar. The money Rubin's control, presidential approval, reached circumvent congressional objection aiding Mexico 1995. But reaction strong time Congress restricted tapping fund international bailouts Rubin extraordinarily cautious ever since. He committed $3 billion second line defense emergency aid program Indonesia South Korea last year, money ultimately dispersed either country. US. official said South Korea need extra help, collapse Suharto government Indonesia changed political scene would risky offer direct US. aid. In bailout Russia whose economy collapsed President Boris Yeltsin abandoned agreement reform economy dismissed leading reformer United States offered direct help. Those event set panicked exit investor emerging market, greatly worsened Brazil's trouble. So far, Brazilian official successfully calmed market constantly talking forthcoming aid program IMF, convincing speculator would dangerous bet country. But time, Brazilian official maintained pose really need cash certainly hurry get it. US. official top official IMF clearly nervous, worried longer negotiation drag on, greater risk Brazil caught another round market turmoil. The Brazilians want everyone think control, said investment banker involved talk. But fact there's still real risk sometime next 18 month government going forced devalue currency, pegged dollar, adjusts 7.5 percent year carefully controlled fall. To prevent sudden devaluation, Brazilian government raise interest rate 50 percent, choking credit company. Meanwhile, country slipping recession. The aid would buy time Brazilians, contingent Cardoso's success persuading legislature end huge deficit, chiefly unpopular cut social spending. The first deputy managing director International Monetary Fund, Stanley Fischer, spent Friday Brazil review country's austerity plan, expected announced Sunday's election international package, avoid appearance global lender dictating condition Brazil. Brazil lot, Fischer said last week leaving trip. In return, I expect international community make large contribution.

It activity Yongbyon prompted United States negotiate 1994 accord promising development two light-water reactor fuel-oil shipment North Korea would halt nuclear weapon development. At time, North Korea believed made enough plutonium one two atomic bomb. The Yongbyon complex, house 500-megawatt laboratory nuclear reactor, frozen 1994 accord. Kim said Friday one new facility already operating construction operational four six year. We estimate reactor go on-line 2002 2003, enabling production enough plutonium build one nuclear weapon within six 12 month, Kim said. North Korea would able make sufficient plutonium make eight 10 nuclear weapon every year that. North Korea said underground construction civilian use nuclear-related. It offered open facility US. inspector, say Washington must pay compensation facility proven civilian use. President Clinton made unusual, direct appeal North Korea Saturday set aside nuclear ambition favor strengthening tie South Korea United States. The appeal came meeting reporter also counseled patience Iraq's refusal comply request weapon inspector.

I ask North Koreans think this, said, arguing Kim's policy engagement North presented great opportunity. Nothing could ever put hole ground would give North Koreans much advantage, much power, much wealth, much happiness ship going full people here. The Clinton administration fear construction site may evidence North Korea abandoned 1994 pledge United States give nuclear weapon program exchange billion dollar aid.

Lately, sign danger intensified, Clinton said address airman here, standing gunmetal gray F-16 A-10 parked nose-to-nose. So must remain vigilant. And thanks you, are. For eagerness talk information-age economic danger like quicksilver currency flow, Clinton returned five-day trip Japan South Korea old-style regional military threat posed North Korea. The subject consumed meeting President Kim Dae-jung South Korea Saturday formed backdrop visit troop Sunday. It's kind tense around here, said John Kelley, 26-year-old airman Wisconsin, describing life base. You know four minute away missile. In speech, Clinton pointed recent North Korean missile test, incursion south mysterious underground site may nuclear weapon installation sign potential threat. And compared North Korea Iraq, saying North Korea also major concern chemical biological weapon. Until North Korea fully commits constructive role peninsula, said, must remain ready.

On first two day South Korea, Clinton also held roundtable discussion business leader hear prescription putting nation's economy back track. Economics security Clinton's twin theme five-day Asia trip began Japan. Clinton acknowledged US. intelligence official yet certain underground construction project North Korea nuclear related. But said North risk closing door cooperation refuse US. inspection site. It raise strong suspicion, Clinton said joint news conference Kim Blue House, presidential mansion overlooking capital. We need access it. The foundation US. effort ease North Korea's decades-long hostility toward South 1994 agreed framework North halted nuclear weapon program exchange Western commitment build modern nuclear energy source there. That deal would shattered suspect site turned clandestine nuclear project. Kim, moved South Korea sunshine policy engaging North Korea cultural economic front, firm saying government support Clinton nuclear issue. In meeting week Pyongyang, North Korean capital, US. official rebuffed request see suspicious site, American intelligence official fear could secret effort revive North's nuclear weapon program. We must require full access way ascertain nature purpose construction site, Kim said. If is, fact, proven nuclear related, demand immediate close down. He also said North must limit missile development, citing great shock Japan North Koreans test-fired missile way Aug. 31. US. spy satellite photo show thousand worker digging massive complex. US. special envoy Charles Kartman Friday retracted assessment made Thursday compelling evidence North Korea building underground nuclear facility. In statement distributed US. embassy today, Kartman said instead, There strong information make u suspicious, lack conclusive evidence intended purpose underground site nuclear related and, so, type nuclear facility might be. Kim said government would support US. effort resolve nuclear question. The North Koreans denied underground construction site nuclear purpose, proposed dlrs 300 million payment allowing inspection. Clinton rejected idea compensation. Directing remark North Korea, Clinton noted significance new tourism deal bringing South Koreans North cruise ship arrangement touted Kim sign North may opening 1950s Korean War enemy.

On darker note, mentioned recent tension Asian steel export United States, skyrocketed year great cost domestic US. steelmaker. Japanese steel biggest problem, South Korean steel export also rise. Clinton said US. economy could tolerate increased import concentrated industry, result Asian economy begin recover. We sensitive price basically erase entire sector US. economy, Clinton said. North Korea agreed receive US. delegation next month discus American concern construction vast underground complex widely feared house nuclear weapon program, State Department said Wednesday. The delegation, led Charles Kartman, press access site, American intelligence agency believe could centerpiece effort revive frozen nuclear arm program. We've made clear North Koreans attempt North Korea pursue nuclear weapon development program would unacceptable, State Department spokesman, James Rubin, said. The talk Pyongyang, capital, added, aimed completely satisfying US. concern suspect construction. American intelligence agency fear building complex could effort break four-year-old pact North Korea pledged give nuclear-weapons program exchange billion dollar aid United States, South Korea Japan. American official said spy satellite recently photographed thousand North Koreans around huge site 25 mile northeast Yongbyon, nuclear center North Korea believed stockpiled enough plutonium 1994 accord build six bomb. Although explained exactly government building complex, North Korean official denied would used develop nuclear weapon. The official North Korean press agency said last week government building civilian underground structure `doubt' cannot cast suggested American official would allowed inspect complex pressed access. If US. side persists inspecting underground structure, press agency said, show them. Rubin said United States received formal assurance Kartman, American special envoy Korean nuclear issue, delegation would allowed inspect site trip, begin Nov. 16. We beginning discussion demand access, Rubin said. The history U.S.-North Korea discussion involves usually lengthy discussion process agreement requirement. So expecting walk one day able access next. The trip announced sign grow relative warming relation United States North Korea. Representatives United States, China two Koreas met recently Geneva agreed step reduce tension Korean Peninsula. In September United States pledged provide additional 300,000 ton grain North Korea, year crippled severe food shortage. In addition White House disclosed United States would provide heavy fuel oil promised North Korea 1994 agreement, despite concern North Korea may intend revive nuclear program. American official said activity near Yongbyon may yet technically violated accord, evidence North Korea begun pouring cement new reactor reprocessing plant convert nuclear waste bomb-grade plutonium. This city always kept unwritten list foreign leader dictator, unfriendly authoritarian consistently annoying ally think make enormous contribution peace, security America's agenda taking early retirement, minimum. In 1950s, leftist leader Iran Guatamala made Top 10, '60s populated Diem Sukarno Southeast Asians. President Richard M. Nixon adviser infamously agreed secret meeting '70s best way deal government Salvador Allende Gossens Chile make economy scream. Diplomatic etiquette, though, usually discouraged shouting America's enemy list White House rooftop. After all, foreign policy personality, right? But last week, driven frustration, anxiety, perhaps lure sounding tough camera, Clinton administration piped up, twice. In different situation, opposite corner world, United States spoke loudly can't find stick. Sunday, hour called attack Iraq, Clinton finally volunteered obvious, focus US. policy toward Iraq removal President Saddam Hussein Clinton called supporting force change Iraq. No matter covert effort failed miserably. The bigger surprise came Monday, polite-to-a-fault Al Gore used visit Malaysia Asian economic summit meeting throw US. support behind protester calling reformasi, code word street Kuala Lumpur dumping Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamed. He long burr Washington's side, denouncing America, currency trader Jews. He recently imprisoned Western-thinking finance minister, Anwar Ibrahim, suddenly become Asia's visible jailed dissident. But Mahathir Saddam, long shot. Gore's aide insist speech call reform, demand Mahathir step down. But interpreted way. The New Zealanders called megaphone diplomacy. The Malaysian government called disgusting interference internal affair. Predictably, executive several US. company flocked Kuala Lumpur told Malaysians Gore rude, assuring Washington uttered word needed said. Whatever wisdom Gore's word, raised question take day world's powerful nation begin publicly suggesting time nettlesome leader go. Because official list, real criterion getting it. Some leader mysteriously escape mention, like Kim Jong Il North Korea. President Clinton spending weekend Korean Peninsula, staring across demilitarized zone dangerous state everyone suspect attempting break 1994 agreement freeze nuclear weapon project, return billion Western energy aid. Yet Washington never called starving North Koreans revolt Kim's repressive regime. His government, taking page Saddam playbook, suggested last week United States really want look mountain tunnel Pentagon belief nuclear installation making, write check another $300 million. No one even called Kim's removal when, month ago, lobbed three-stage missile Japan show knew how. The rule calling end regime pretty murky, said Richard Feinberg, professor University California San Diego served Clinton administration's first term. When really want push someone out, country part larger strategic concern time. But country usually great strategic weight another matter call change leadership Beijing Moscow help kind domestic opposition point to. Clinton's call Saddam's ouster last weekend created barely ripple because, all, proven murderer avid stockpiler anthrax plutonium (even Brent Scowcroft, President George Bush's national security adviser, insisted last week Saddam nowadays simply irritant, annoyance, pest problem, threat region moment). Mahathir, however, far complex case. He's prime example opposing Washington's political economic agenda interconnected world move leader list authoritarian Washington tolerates list authoritarian outlived usefulness. Like Asian strongman Ferdinand Marcos Philippines Suharto Indonesia come mind useful fear Malaysia would become communist domino. But also seemed eminently tolerable long Cold War over. He never accused enormous corruption. He turned country model competitiveness, Malaysia became exemplar big emerging market Clinton's Commerce Department touted thing went sour last year. Sure, always prickly. But terrorist killer US. company flocked country, say want stay iron control political discourse stronger neighboring Singapore. Just summer, US. Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin paid ostensibly friendly, strained, visit made reference human right. That changed Ibrahim arrested beaten jail. He long advocate Western-style solution economic turmoil openness, freedom protest movement Mahathir surfaced jail. Gore leapt opportunity particularly striking because, case Indonesia earlier year, took administration month come conclusion President Suharto go. He went.

50,"It surprising scene three month ago Dennis Rivera, one New York City's left-leaning labor leader, singing praise Sen. Alfonse M. D'Amato. Rivera, president largest union New York City, praised D'Amato persuading Trent Lott, Senate majority leader, support legislation financed health coverage hundred thousand uninsured child. It looked Rivera's politically potent union might endorse D'Amato minimum stay neutral year's US. Senate race New York. But Monday, Rivera's 150,000-member union, 1199, National Health Human Service Employees union, endorsed Rep. Charles E. Schumer, D-N.Y., thereby risked D'Amato's wrath. The endorsement risky, labor leader acknowledge, angering powerful senator could make far le responsive labor's need union turn help future re-elected. Although may seem illogical, two word go far explain Rivera's union backed Schumer: Monica Lewinsky. Largely result Lewinsky scandal, Democrats say suddenly fear Republicans gain filibuster-proof, 60-seat majority Senate, Republicans 55 seat Democrats' 45. For labor leader like Rivera, notion strong Republican majority nightmare. That fear helped push New York union Schumer's column, even though D'Amato long courted them. Those union include teamsters' joint council New York City District Council 37, umbrella group representing 120,000 municipal employee. Labor leader say fear filibuster-proof Republican majority, Senate would push anti-union legislation, like recently defeated Republican proposal curb labor's political spending cut financing National Labor Relations Board. We worried legislation allow labor movement survive next century, Rivera said. Alarmed Democrats lose Senate seat California, Illinois, Wisconsin, Nevada South Carolina, Rivera's union concluded worth backing Schumer. The decision, Rivera emphasized repeatedly, personal based national consideration. Unfortunately, leadership Republican Party national level person Newt Gingrich Trent Lott necessarily culture Republicans Northeast, said. They're far conservative, far anti-labor, far anti-worker, far pro-business. We fear Democratic Party face irrelevance United States Senate go 41 seat. Trying avoid rupture D'Amato, Rivera praised effective senator. The endorsement could boon Schumer. Rivera's union teachers' union labor's strongest political operation New York. In addition, Schumer get thousand dollar local well use renowned phone bank, make 50,000 political call day. A spokesman D'Amato said, Al D'Amato's proud he's endorsed 100 union federation local, representing 400,000 working men woman, he'll continue effort behalf working middle class family. His labor endorsement include New York City Patrolmen's Benevolent Association New York State Building Construction Trades Council. Besides backing 1199, Schumer also received endorsement 1199's parent union, Service Employees International Union, 350,000 member New York State.

The convention packed Town Hall, new group aim make service employee power reckoned bringing together dozen union local forge common political legislative strategy. Earlier year, 1199 merged service employee, part agreement, Rivera became head service employee New York State. Nearly 60 year behind time, House voted Friday condemn Nazi-Soviet nonaggression pact 1939. The measure, nonbinding resolution, brought floor Rep. John Shimkus, R-Ill. He Lithuanian descent, pocket Lithuanians hometown Collinsville want try highlight support Baltic states' past effort Soviet repression. Shimkus' measure example member Congress spending time stand idle wait Republican leader reach agreement spending bill White House, thus avoiding government shutdown allowing go home campaign November election. With time hand, many Republicans using House floor personal stage elicit vote topic boast folk back home. Most matter little chance finding way law, member hope turn advantage Election Day. There plenty item whose sponsor hope attract attention. These tend special-interest matter member hope escape scrutiny rush leave town. The sponsor measure added advantage impeachment inquiry, preoccupying Congress, news medium public giving cover move pet cause quietly gigantic omnibus package Congress eventually present Clinton signing. These quieter measure include one proposed Mississippi's two senator, Trent Lott Thad Cochran, Republicans. They want agriculture export credit buy chicken Russia, bought chicken cannot pay them. The chicken Mississippi. Democrats little influence Republican-controlled Congress. But Democrats close enough Republican leader, Republican goal, measure taken seriously. These include Rep.

House leader allowed measure brought floor way appease conservative member, believe shortchanged budget process. It passed House vote 224-200 almost chance becoming law. The Senate plan take up, Clinton would almost certainly veto it. But Rep. Tom Coburn, R-Okla., said vote like important put sponsors' ideological foe record opposing something sound reasonable, opposition used Nov. 3 election. It voice mail message Dr. Marilyn Rymer, neurologist Kansas City, Mo., would routinely delete, even registered Democrat. Speaker Newt Gingrich's office, said, calling discus national leadership award. Dr. Rymer acclaim director prominent stroke-treatment center, proposition seemed particularly grand. When returned call, said told would also named honorary chairman elite committee advise Gingrich legislation. Too good true? Well, Dr. Rymer would pay way committee actually meet, honorary committee chairman, discovered, would member committee composed entirely honorary chairman. And oh, speaker wanted donation $500 $1,000 help effort, according transcript similar chat another doctor, elect bigger Republican majority House Representatives. With approach midterm election next month, turn National Republican Congressional Committee, support candidate House, sponsoring similar call ten thousand small-business owner, including doctor. With fund-raising program, committee say amassed $62 million election. But campaign finance watchdog say solicitation mark new departure political fund raising, one call akin practice marketing company like Publishers' Clearing House hook consumer vision million-dollar windfall induce subscribe magazine. By citing speaker promising celebrity influence, say, call bait-and-switch scheme seize attention people might otherwise hang up. Dr. Rymer say incensed. So Dr. Stanley Turecki, child family psychiatrist New York vote independent also called. I absolutely outraged, said. Anybody else would would fall category consumer fraud. Kenneth Gross, Washington lawyer specializes election law represents Democratic Republican client, said, I never heard particular device.

The call, however, placed aide Gingrich, office anyone Washington. They made people headset computer home InfoCision Management Corp., telemarketing firm Congressional committee client Akron, Ohio. On Web page, InfoCision say 1,400 employee operate 1,584 telephone line 9 phone center. Every word script approved client, company say Web site. Every conceivable objection scripted powerful rebuttal. Besides telemarketing business, said Jamie Blair, supervisor center, specialize helping Republican Party conservative political group. However far Gingrich, telemarketers instructed answer return call with: Republican Congressional Committee, Newt Gingrich's office. May I help you? A doctor Kansas City, Mo., registered Republican declined named, dialed Gingrich number (888-484-1644) left answering machine secretly recorded ensuing discussion, legal Missouri. We asked contact behalf speaker, say woman picked call identified Nancy. He right aggressively pushing legislation cut tax much half, he's also interested legislation cut capital gain single rate 15 percent. To assure passage legislation, speaker want increase Republican majority, say, adding, To help u that, speaker pulling together group individual inviting honorary chairman advisory council. Nancy continues: There correspondence speaker, conference call. It's great way get input thought legislation concern you. Or maybe survey questionnaire. Later, Nancy says: As member committee, would receiving speaker national leadership award, really quite honor. And honest, asking chairman could help effort increase majority one-time contribution $500 $1,000. Now would used nationwide medium campaign Newt undertaken target seat really need. And someone I'm sure would also benefit this, could I tell speaker could count help? The doctor demur. I registered, know, Republican Kansas, tell Nancy. Probably I something would go representative. Then doctor try ascertain Nancy located. Is congressman Gingrich's office I'm talking to? doctor asks. The speaker's office, say Nancy. This speaker's office. That I'm talking to, say doctor, double-checking. Uh-huh, Nancy reply. The law prohibits political fund-raising call federal office. Vice President Al Gore Justice Department investigation fund-raising call allegedly made office 1996 presidential campaign. But call made anywhere else, including campaign office. Harris said call way related speaker's OFFICIAL office. He added: What important call get routed. People interested award speaker's good name whether call get routed Washington Ohio. Turecki disagrees. I see basic sleaze, said. The last time George Voinovich ran office, re-election Ohio's governor 72 percent vote, stunning even optimistic supporter setting 20th-century record victory margin Ohio politics. This year, Voinovich, Republican barred seeking third term, running again, time Senate seat held John Glenn, Democrat retiring. And expect Voinovich repeat electoral benchmark four year ago, politician party generally acknowledge well positioned increase Republican majority Senate. That prevented Voinovich's Democratic opponent, Mary Boyle, undertaking vigorous campaign. Ms. Boyle, former commissioner Cuyahoga County, encompasses Cleveland, crisscrossing nation's seventh-most populous state describes grass-roots campaign that, operating comparative shoestring, nonetheless attracted side nationally known Democrats President Clinton foremost among campaign trail. Glenn, former astronaut preparing return space month age 77, made endorsement Senate race. Like many candidate year, Ms. Boyle, 55, campaigning hard issue education, seeking portray Voinovich, 61, lackluster steward allowed state's school decline. He promised education governor, said Ms. Boyle. But seven half year failed student state. Her role campaign, said, remind people state Ohio George Voinovich made promise deliver it. Specifically, discus decision last year Ohio Supreme Court cited wide disparity quality state's school ruled unconstitutional formula funding them. She also attacked Republican opponent supporting proposal raise state's sale tax one percent. Under plan, half additional fund would used school improvement remainder earmarked reducing property tax. That statewide ballot initiative last May proved wildly unpopular, 80 percent voter opposing it. While topic tax education hot one political season Ohio, clear Ms. Boyle's emphasis helped campaign. Despite narrowing opinion poll, still trailing Voinovich 15 percentage point poll much 20 point others. There also sharp fund-raising disparity. Ms. Boyle, running first statewide race widespread union support, raised nearly $2 million far, far le nearly $7 million Voinovich taken in. Also, Voinovich, former lieutenant governor, statewide ballot five time last 20 year thus better-known candidate. The electoral dynamic Ohio also aiding Voinovich. The northern half state, history industrial, unionized city, tradition voting largely Democratic candidate, southern tier state considered conservative typically lean Republican. But Voinovich Ms. Boyle share home terrain, depriving Ms. Boyle geographic advantage often accompanies Democratic candidate. Indeed, boy, Voinovich delivered newspaper Boyle home working-class Collinwood section Cleveland. And Voinovich, former mayor Cleveland, developed reputation moderate Republican work well Democrats. Voinovich, campaigning vigorously himself, keeping full schedule official duty, assuming role experienced, elected official. If I get Senate, I probably know domestic policy member Senate, said interview Wednesday Canton, sandwiched ribbon-cutting ceremony fund-raising reception vacuum cleaner museum. As mayor, I nose rubbed problem urban America fairly successful dealing them. And, governor, I dealt problem Medicaid, welfare education. I'm person United States president National League Cities chairman National Governors Association. To opponent's charge record education, Voinovich dismissive. I'm probably Republican United States endorsed Ohio Education Association National Education Association, said, adding Ms. Boyle member state Legislature period cited Supreme Court ruling. Mary Boyle vice chairman Ways Means Committee member Democratic leadership year, Voinovich said. They nothing fix building, nothing technology urban school district. Ms. Boyle, yet begun run campaign commercial television, said status underdog allowed focused, intense. Pausing campaign fund-raising breakfast former Democratic Sen. Bill Bradley New Jersey Wednesday, Ms. Boyle said: This marathon pretty much uphill. But now, we're last three mile. It's tough race. In cocoon loyal wealthy supporter, President Clinton said Friday must live consequence mistake, although contended Democrats take pride achievement presidency take heart possibility. Clinton stopped apologizing conduct Monica Lewinsky, taken making glancing, time humble, reference it, moving attack Republican Congress indifferent Americans' need. He Friday series fund-raisers. In one deft sentence, acknowledged personal pain claiming credit country's economic strength, making compact appeal sympathy support appearance earlier day Cleveland. After thanking gathered donor kind personal thing said him, president declared, If I again, every day, I would heartbeat, see America today compared six year ago. As applause died away, Clinton continued, I want understand, too, live consequence mistake life. He added chuckle: Most u live quite public way. But nobody get life free. To music saxophone hammered dulcimer, Clinton raised $200,000 lunch private home Cleveland Democratic Senate candidate Ohio, Mary Boyle. Then flew Philadelphia raise half million dollar Democratic Party. By midsummer, president's aide delighted persuaded condense fund-raising remark 10 minute policy point partisan jabbing. But trouble grown mid-term election approached, free-form remark become longer. In Cleveland Friday, spoke 26 minute Friday evening spoke almost 20 minute. These fund-raising visit fallen pattern since Clinton's videotaped grand jury testimony Aug. 17. He lauded, applauded embraced host donor. Mr. President, friend today, said Tony George, host Cleveland event, offering refrain played similar role. But Cleveland elsewhere, protester scattered along president's motorcade route reminder call resignation impeachment, mockery heaping upon presidency. At rally president outside city hall Friday night group Teamsters chanted, two year. Clinton's motorcade route lined downtown hundred people, carrying supportive condemnatory sign. After impromptu shopping trip, greeted shout We love you, Clinton told donor beginning impassioned reprise Cleveland speech: I even mind protester, that's American way. But, added, preferred minority, seemed case. As rode Cleveland, Clinton passed billboard local radio station, WNCX. Lovin', touchin', squeezin', read, word superimposed cartoon president arm Ms. Lewinsky's shoulder, Washington Monument beside them. The president left aide Friday respond directly latest gusher grand jury disclosure Washington. Instead, remark, Clinton spoke pride record urgency addressing international economic crisis need struggling farmer schoolchildren. As typically partisan audience, also walked political calculation mid-term election. Clinton said Cleveland Republicans bragged privately prospect. They tell me, `Oh, we're going well, Mr. President, mid-terms much money do,' Democrats turned re-elect Clinton would return poll off-year. That argument, course, would also insulate Clinton blame depressing Democratic vote. But often go that, saying predicament could actually help Democrats. Lower-income Democratic voter, said, might bother vote typical election. The people good enough serve event today, they've got lot hassle life, said. But, said, adversity friend, overcome apathy focus u issue here. What issue, Clinton said, achievement agenda Republicans' record, described harshly. What done? asked Cleveland. They killed minimum wage increase 12 million Americans. They killed campaign finance reform. They killed tobacco reform legislation. White House official gay Democrats, concerned nation's largest gay lesbian political organization endorse Sen. Alfonse D'Amato re-election, intensely lobbying group try shift support Democratic challenger, Rep. Charles Schumer.

But privately, organization official gay activist party monitoring debate say group likely endorse D'Amato, Republican seeking fourth term. They also raised possibility group would endorse candidate, remain neutral.

In election year, Reps. David Price Julia Carson would little common Democrats relatively safe seat. Price centrist represented high-tech district North Carolina 2 last 12 year, political scientist taught Duke Yale. Mrs. Carson, fairly liberal, House freshman worked way politics grass root, reared poverty. But party official opened election year high hope recapturing House beginning worry Democratic incumbent like Price Mrs. Carson share something else: greater-than-expected peril Election Day. As many congressional race, biggest variable White House scandal, injected fear uncertainty campaign around country. Other Democratic incumbent Republican official cite locked contest competitive expected include Reps. Corrine Brown Florida, Vic Snyder Arkansas, Lois Capps Ellen Tauscher California, Martin Frost Texas, Melvin Watt North Carolina, John LaFalce New York Sander Levin Michigan. Here North Carolina's 4th Congressional District, Price, acknowledging poll showed tight race, said: This swing district sensitive tide trend. It's something think lot connection president's trouble. The effort Price Mrs. Carson contain Lewinsky debacle opponents' attempt capitalize offer important clue suggesting Clinton's problem influencing conduct race around country. Many Democrats straddling line seems shift bit every new scandal-related disclosure: want appear close president whose conduct embarrasses them, yet, sensing possibility public backlash Republicans, weighing word carefully wary hopping impeachment bandwagon. And publicly Democrats express confidence scandal little impact them, campaign preparing worst placing greater emphasis ever behind-the-efforts prod core constituency vote. In reflection uncertainty Clinton scandal cast even among Republicans, challenger Price Carson district political novice seeking office first time differing strategies: Tom Roberg, computer executive Raleigh taking Price, broadcast television commercial exploiting scandal. Tom Roberg called Bill Clinton's resignation, narrator say. This time silent, Price. Where stand? But Indianapolis, Gary Hofmeister, conservative jeweler challenging Mrs. Carson Indiana's 10th Congressional District, taking subtle approach: rather mention scandal directly, note often Julia vote Clinton almost 100 percent time. Asked much raising scandal directly, Hofmeister said: Don't murder somebody they're process committing suicide. There would danger went overboard. The best evidence discomfort Price Mrs. Carson asked separate interview whether would want Clinton campaign district, said would impossible late date White House schedule visit. What sudden schedule change? Both paused, squirmed bit mustered answer hardly affirmative. Given president's popularity, I doubt hurt me, Mrs. Carson said. And Price? I think would good idea, said. I've never president campaign here, I want start time although eagerly welcoming Erskine Bowles, president's chief staff popular native son North Carolina, stump Sunday.) Making strategy stump complicated anecdotal evidence run counter Democratic fear Republican hope. In three day campaign stop North Carolina Indianapolis, scandal rarely raised voter courted candidate either party. When reporter asked it, many voter said appalled Clinton's behavior, hard time relating decision way vote congressional election five week. As Hofmeister walked parking lot outside gun knife show Indiana National Guard Armory Indianapolis last Sunday, Billy Derringer, 57-year-old machinist retired disability, called express outrage million dollar spent investigate Clinton. It's pathetic spend money, said Derringer, identified independent. It gotten far. Hofmeister tried best make Republicans' case. There rule law, said. Mrs. Carson said hoped Democrats swing voter alike would become fed Lewinsky inquiry issue might even help her. To end, proudly informs audience voted making public report delivered House Kenneth Starr, Whitewater independent counsel. I one 63 member Congress voted putting filth Internet, said, adding Starr's inquiry cruel hoax term fiscal responsibility accountability. The Carson campaign counting voter like Timothy Daly, 38-year-old real estate executive voted Republican two year ago favor Mrs. Carson. I'm pulling Democratic ticket I'm tired it: right side Republican Party playing politics, Daly said. We'd like see go people's business. Back 4th District, Price reason worried. He first elected House 1986 but, four-term incumbent, ousted Republican sweep 1994 (only win seat back two year later). In addition, district redrawn last year include large Durham section voter know well. Determined midterm casualty Clinton again, Price say waging vigorous get-out-the-vote ground campaign career. Rather engage Roberg Clinton scandal, Price begun broadcasting television commercial emphasizes central issue: education. The congressman's adviser say intentionally produced advertisement appears decidedly nonpolitical feature school child play effort break television clutter scandal. But Price campaign also weapon holding reserve, event Roberg appears riding Clinton scandal advantage: incumbent's adviser say would timid running commercial underscoring earned divinity degree getting doctorate political science. At coffee voter wealthy enclave Raleigh night, Roberg opened remark asserting Clinton lost moral authority lead. Yet none assembled asked scandal; concerned state's plan build highway near neighborhood. The last time George Voinovich ran office, re-election Ohio's governor 72 percent vote, stunning even optimistic supporter setting 20th-century record victory margin Ohio politics. This year, Voinovich, Republican barred seeking third term, running again, time Senate seat held John Glenn, Democrat retiring. And expect Voinovich repeat electoral benchmark four year ago, politician party generally acknowledge well positioned increase Republican majority Senate. That prevented Voinovich's Democratic opponent, Mary Boyle, undertaking vigorous campaign. Ms. Boyle, former commissioner Cuyahoga County, encompasses Cleveland, crisscrossing nation's seventh-most populous state describes grass-roots campaign that, operating comparative shoestring, nonetheless attracted side nationally known Democrats President Clinton foremost among campaign trail. Glenn, former astronaut preparing return space month age 77, made endorsement Senate race. Like many candidate year, Ms. Boyle, 55, campaigning hard issue education, seeking portray Voinovich, 61, lackluster steward allowed state's school decline. He promised education governor, said Ms. Boyle. But seven half year failed student state. Her role campaign, said, remind people state Ohio George Voinovich made promise deliver it. Specifically, discus decision last year Ohio Supreme Court cited wide disparity quality state's school ruled unconstitutional formula funding them. She also attacked Republican opponent supporting proposal raise state's sale tax one percent. Under plan, half additional fund would used school improvement remainder earmarked reducing property tax. That statewide ballot initiative last May proved wildly unpopular, 80 percent voter opposing it. While topic tax education hot one political season Ohio, clear Ms. Boyle's emphasis helped campaign. Despite narrowing opinion poll, still trailing Voinovich 10 percentage point poll much 18 point others. There also sharp fund-raising disparity. Ms. Boyle, running first statewide race widespread union support, raised nearly $2 million far, far le nearly $7 million Voinovich taken in. Also, Voinovich, former lieutenant governor, statewide ballot five time last 20 year thus better-known candidate. The electoral dynamic Ohio also aiding Voinovich. The northern half state, history industrial, unionized city, tradition voting largely Democratic candidate, southern tier state considered conservative typically lean Republican. But Voinovich Ms. Boyle share home terrain, depriving Ms. Boyle geographic advantage often accompanies Democratic candidate. Indeed, boy, Voinovich delivered newspaper Boyle home working-class Collinwood section Cleveland. And Voinovich, former mayor Cleveland, developed reputation moderate Republican work well Democrats. Voinovich, campaigning vigorously himself, keeping full schedule official duty, assuming role experienced, elected official. If I get Senate, I probably know domestic policy member Senate, said interview Wednesday Canton, sandwiched ribbon-cutting ceremony fund-raising reception vacuum cleaner museum. As mayor, I nose rubbed problem urban America fairly successful dealing them. And, governor, I dealt problem Medicaid, welfare education. I'm person United States president National League Cities chairman National Governors Association. To opponent's charge record education, Voinovich dismissive. I'm probably Republican United States endorsed Ohio Education Association National Education Association, said, adding Ms. Boyle member state Legislature period cited Supreme Court ruling. Mary Boyle vice chairman Ways Means Committee member Democratic leadership year, Voinovich said. They nothing fix building, nothing technology urban school district. Ms. Boyle, yet begun run campaign commercial television, said status underdog allowed focused, intense. Pausing campaign fund-raising breakfast former Democratic Sen. Bill Bradley New Jersey Wednesday, Ms. Boyle said: This marathon pretty much uphill. But now, we're last three mile. It's tough race. Sen. Alfonse D'Amato, New York Republican running re-election, went Manhattan's Grand Central Terminal morning accept award mass-transit advocate. But reporter gathered showed little interest shiny train car senator's back. Instead, repeatedly asked would vote impeachment President Clinton. Look, I'm going make comment respect subject matter, D'Amato responded. I citizen. I citizen-senator may called upon make decision. But D'Amato something else well: candidate may tightest Senate race nation. And variation elliptical response heard Senate race around country, Republicans Democrats encountering similar question. All suggests House voted Thursday authorize impeachment inquiry, year's 34 race US. Senate become, beyond already were, electoral equivalent jury selection. If House vote impeach Clinton, matter go Senate, must decide two-thirds majority whether convict and, thus, remove office. As result, Monica Lewinsky matter suddenly injected new disruptive force Senate contest. Voters, even support Clinton, expect political leader, Republican Democratic, renounce Clinton's behavior, candidate that. But impeachment another matter; poll show nation it. The danger Senate candidate impeachment real possibility, debate may move beyond president's behavior little disagreement problematic issue whether removed office. For strategist involved race, little guidance handle impeachment issue. Advisers candidate party said interview last week perplexed worried, unsure issue gain advantage guard harm. I can't tell one going go, said Mike Russell, spokesman Republican Senatorial Campaign Committee. This surreal environment. Of 34 Senate seat play, 18 held Democrats 16 Republicans, hold 55 seat all. Republicans would win 28 34 race produce 67 vote necessary conviction, assuming vote go along party line. Only electoral catastrophe Democrats, seems almost unthinkable, could produce huge loss. Jennifer Duffy, follows Senate race Cook Political Report, nonpartisan newsletter, said far, least, none Senate candidate made explicit appeal vote based would vote presidential jury. But others wondering may change. This difficult ground measure. One central question political year Clinton's dealing Ms. Lewinsky might affect turnout. For long time, politician assumed dispirited Democrats would stay home rebuke Clinton, many Republicans November 1974, three month President Richard M. Nixon resigned. But analyst wonder partisan fight Congress last week might opposite effect among Democrats. That's problem, said Stuart Rothenberg, editor independent political newsletter Washington. It's know, politician know, general public stand impeachment. The problem know electorate stand impeachment. And asking voter think ahead impeachment proceeding cast ballot Senate race is, word Stuart Stevens, Republican consultant, double bank-shot. Such strategy, said, tend work small number single-minded sophisticated voter. Against complicated backdrop, prevailing thinking use impeachment issue vary race race, state state week week, depending circumstance candidate composition electorate. If Democrats try turn image Clinton dock advantage, would state Democratic edge sizable number black voter, overwhelmingly support president. In contest like those, might well prove interest Democratic candidate to, one consultant put it, sit front camera tape advertisement candidate denounces president's behavior solemnly pledge vote impeachment. Strategists party believe kind approach could prove effective. This issue huge disconnect elite public, said Fred Yang, Democratic consultant client Wisconsin Carolinas. That kind Democratic strategy might emerge California, New York, Illinois, Wisconsin, Washington perhaps Arkansas. By contrast, Democrats South Carolina, Georgia Nevada would le likely oppose Clinton's impeachment. On side, Republican consultant telling candidate stress Clinton's misdeed stay away talk impeachment. The last thing party want turn Senate election referendum whether Clinton forced office. The White House might think overall public number maybe would like make referendum election, said Ed Goeas, Republican pollster working Senate race year. Republicans certainly going let happen. D'Amato responded question Clinton language Republican consultant suggesting candidate. When matter come Senate, I decide fact presented time, D'Amato said. It would premature suggest course action without referred. Because, indeed, may called upon act jury kind. But Schumer, member House Judiciary Committee, conducting impeachment investigation, virtually embraced issue. In live telecast hearing, said president deserved lesser punishment, censure reprimand. And Schumer plan campaign New York Monday Clinton side. Schumer's medium adviser, Hank Morris, seemed suggest last week impeachment grow issue. Senator D'Amato claim want share opinion people New York, Morris said. And opinion, he's New Yorker opinion. Asked Schumer would raise issue television commercial, Morris responded: We talk we're going do. I rule I rule out. ","Acknowledging his mistakes, Clinton supports Democrat candidates and speaks at fundraisers.He backs Mary Boyle of Ohio in her bid for U.S. Senate.Democrat candidates try to limit the effect of the Lewinsky debacle on their campaigns.A N.Y. labor union backs Democrat Schumer to keep Republicans from gaining a 60-seat majority.Sen.

If Scalfaro feel candidate capable mustering majority, could call early election. Because president cannot dissolve Parliament last six week term, election would scheduled December. Scalfaro named Prodi caretaker premier interim. Prodi's far-left ally, Communist Refoundation, provoked crisis withdrew support government 1999 deficit-cutting budget, said enough stimulate job creation. Despite help breakaway faction Communists, Sunday formed new party, Prodi lost Friday's vote confidence single vote. Prodi said take job back unless new government could stick policy old one, unlikely scenario given divided Parliament.

Prodi said would call confidence vote Communists yanked support. The coalition majority without Communists Senate, depended passage key legislation Chamber. MORE Italian politics long enlivened baroque feud shifting alliance. And time-honored tradition may embattled government Prime Minister Romano Prodi momentary reprieve. A leader Italy's hard-line Marxist faction, known Communist Refounding Party, resigned Monday protest party's decision reject government's 1999 budget imperil Prodi's slender majority Parliament. Prodi must realize majority longer exists, said Armando Cossuta, chairman Communist Refounding Party, fringe group broke mainstream Communists overhauled party following collapse Soviet Union 1991. Nevertheless everything possible, last minute, save government avoid crisis. Cossuta clearly unwilling join hard-line wing party withdrawing support Prodi risk branded torpedoed first leftist Italian government 50 year. But leader Communist Refounding Party Parliament, Fausto Bertinotti, seems compunction. On Friday, told journalist worried forcing new election could return right power. Sometimes take one step back order take two step forward, said shrug. Until now, however, communist rank file disagreed view. When Bertinotti forced Prodi offer resignation last year proposed budget cut, rank file protested, forced backpedal. Prodi met Monday President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro coalition leader devise strategy. He expected go Parliament Wednesday open debate crisis seek enough vote budget. Without it, Italian central bank unlikely cut key lending rate, something Italy must get line Germany bigger European neighbor introduction Jan. 1 single European currency, euro. But even gather enough vote pas budget, Prodi could still left without majority. After two half year office, government second-longest postwar era. But fragile center-left coalition held together mostly Italians united last two year effort reduce spending, inflation government borrowing meet requirement membership euro plan. Once goal achieved last spring, dissension quickly revived. Prodi's backer hoping enough member Communist Refounding Party break rank follow Cossutta save coalition. If not, Prodi faced two unappetizing choice. He resign seek new election, carry risk bringing opposition power. Or could seek form new majority without Communists seeking alliance small center-right party Francesco Cossiga. Cossiga's party came Prodi's rescue June, hard-line leftist refused back Prodi NATO expansion. But Prodi repeatedly said govern center-left majority elected 1996. Cossiga also suggested reporter Monday would welcome invitation join coalition led Prodi. We want majority get stained like Monica Lewinsky's dress, said. By one vote, center-left prime minister Italy, Romano Prodi, lost confidence vote Parliament Friday toppled power. The collapse government two half year, second-longest tenure since World War II, suggested chronic political instability marked Italy decade sprung back life. Though obliged tender resignation, Prodi remain charge caretaker prime minister new government formed. He may get second chance form new majority, even doe, negotiation end could take day even week, clouding decision urgent issue crisis Kosovo. NATO military planner preparing possible air strike Yugoslavia expected use key air base Italy. In weakened position, Prodi difficulty persuading Parliament approve NATO strike. He similar problem passing 1999 budget, necessary Italy cut lending rate, requirement joining single European monetary unit, euro, Jan. 1. Immediately Friday's vote 313-312, tense time raucous session, Prodi met President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro submit resignation discus option. In coming day Scalfaro consult dozen leader ascertain whether Prodi enough lingering support try form new government. If not, president expected turn another political leader. If compromise found, Italy could plunged early election. But party political stripe may reluctant push thing far, opinion poll suggest voter enamored center-right opposition party governing majority. Prodi, economist, admired Western ally down-to-earth leader vowed tame Italy's bloated economy reckless government borrowing actually lived pledge. By raising tax, lowering interest rate reducing deficit, Italy met requirement membership euro last spring, feat year considered impossible German French economist. Prodi helped healthy global economy rare consensus among industrialist, labor union taxpayer, feared exclusion euro would condemn Italy Third World status. But fiscal discipline followed reform political system inherently fragile. There 40 party Italy, government's effort amend constitution introduce two-party system failed. Unless Italian political system change, Italy condemned political instability, said Sergio Romano, former diplomat political science professor. The country need stability credibility, never happen long government hanging thread. In 1996 Prodi patchwork quilt center-left faction mostly made Catholic moderate leftist. He relied fringe Marxist group, Communist Refounding Party, majority lower house. And alliance, fragile beginning, finally frayed breaking point week. The hard-line leader Communist Refounding, Fausto Bertinotti, said party would vote 1999 budget would also end 28-month-old pact center-left coalition. That position drove moderate wing Communist Refounding, worried vote Prodi would open door center-right government, split away. But 20-odd deputy defied Bertinotti enough squeeze Prodi through. I bitter, Prodi said moment defeat. Even today I received lot support. In end coup de grace delivered one own, member coalition. They treachery one single person, Sergio Mattarella, deputy Prodi's coalition, angrily told reporter, referring Silvio Liotta, member Italian Renewal Party. Foreign Minister Lamberto Dini, head party, said Liotta would expelled. Prodi often said would govern majority center-left one elected 1996. But throughout tenure, forced seek temporary alliance push major policy decision. He struggled last try keep original majority intact. On Thursday, effort woo moderate Communists side, prime minister, staunch ally United States, warned would oppose NATO strike aimed stopping Serbian violence Kosovo unless UN. Security Council approved attack. Washington maintains NATO need new UN. resolution order strike. Premier Romano Prodi said Monday would appeal directly Parliament save Italy's second-longest government since World War II, threatened collapse defection Communist ally. The address Parliament expected Wednesday, followed perhaps Friday vote confidence determine whether Prodi's 2 1/2-year-old, center-left alliance stand fall. Prodi's far-left ally, Communist Refoundation Party, provoked crisis withdrawing support weekend saying would vote deficit-cutting 1999 budget, key Italy's participation European common currency. Prodi said would call confidence vote lost Communists' support. I've always acted coherence, Prodi said morning meeting President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro crisis. I've never changed strategy I want political gymnastics. The break Prodi's government divided Refoundation. Armando Cossutta, leader moderate wing, resigned party president Monday. He said party's desertion Prodi wrong dangerous, time promised follow party line. We complicated political crisis could lead early election, Cossutta told reporter Monday. And division left, would mean victory right. If crisis come confidence vote Prodi loses, would offer resignation. Once that, Scalfaro decide do. He could ask Prodi someone else form new government could call election 2 1/2 year early, something analyst think unlikely. Working Prodi's favor fact party think would stand gain early election, including Communist Refoundation. There speculation Prodi would reopen negotiation would win back communists' grudging support, managed past. Prodi's government held together long large part widely shared desire see Italy qualify participation 1999 debut Europe's common currency, euro. That happened earlier year leaving disparate ally without clear reason stay together. Prodi lead Italy's 55th government since World War II.

It single former President PW. Botha, Chief Mangosuthu Buthelezi, Inkatha leader, Winnie Mandela, among others, detailed treatment role political crime. One major flaw report absence section accusing FW. de Klerk, last apartheid president, knowing several bombing fact keeping silent. It excised de Klerk suing commission. The ANC also sued, unsuccessfully, stop publication. The lawsuit disappointing sign South Africa's political party interested honest look past, free flow information. The controversy added widespread complaint commission helped process reconciliation. This wrong. True reconciliation occurs society longer paralyzed past people work live together cannot based silence. No society restored health papering much pain South Africans suffered. A noisy informed debate complicity crime apartheid era necessary, uncomfortable. The report part Truth Commission's contribution healing process. The hearing themselves, allowed victim human right violation tell story public, helped country heal opened eye many white unpleasant truth apartheid. The amnesty process, permitting many important criminal escape justice, allowing family know exactly happened loved one dozen case would likely never gone trial South Africa's fragile judicial system. The process helping victim scholarship necessary aid go on, although enough. No commission transform society twisted South Africa's wa. But Truth Commission best effort world seen, South Africa better it. The deal South Africa's Truth Reconciliation Commission offered simple enough: Confess crime, apply amnesty go free. If come forward, prosecuted. After two year hearing apartheid-era atrocity, commission last week unveiled 3,500-page report naming dozen people belief elbow gore never applied amnesty. So prosecution begin soon, right? Not fast. The study barely hand President Nelson Mandela talk new amnesty deal begun. It seems nearly South Africa's political party including ruling African National Congress key official could end dock report. Suddenly, lot talk country can't withstand round politically divisive trial, many political analyst betting agreement mutual benefit offing. Already, three major political party calling kind new amnesty, ANC closing door. ANC spokesman Thabo Masebe said premature talk general amnesty, acknowledged party discussing amnesty specifically tailored violence black South Africans black littered KwaZulu/Natal province body late '80s '90s. In choosing truth commission rather Nuremberg-style trial close brutal past, South Africa hoped idealistic reconciliation. People would come clean receive true forgiveness. Society would able move on, wound cleansed healed. It model watched closely around world society wondering disentangle grudge brutal past. But given chance, hundred South Africa's perpetrator come forward. Commission official say frustrated lack cooperation, however exhaustive report may seem. It perhaps late, however, press more. Today's South Africa urgent new problem deal unemployment, crime, white flight, school hospital. So may wind settling pragmatic reconciliation one give amnesty unrepentant simply practical concerned move on. In recent year, truth commission gained popularity many place, notably Chile, Argentina El Salvador. But South Africa's biggest powerful, able grant amnesty subpoena witness supposed real test. Certainly commission forced nation see gruesome detail past, sobbing survivor stone-faced torturer told smashed genitals near suffocation. And commission's work added much knowledge happened South Africa 1960 1994. But year effect commission truly judged. Has anyone really forgiven anyone else? Will vendetta persist? No one answer. One thing seems clear, however: Four year South Africa held first non-racial election, growing number South Africans want done past. Raymond Louw, publisher respected weekly newsletter, Southern Africa Report, say new amnesty proposal could come February session Parliament, time remove issue next year's election campaign. You simply can't country torn apart prosecution, say. Everybody going howling amnesty. They already are. Even Archbishop Desmond Tutu, commission's chairman, delivered report, seemed anticipating push new amnesty arguing it. He said move would highly unfair came forward. He suggested instead two-year time limit, anyone indicted would effect get amnesty. To sure, opposition proposal limit prosecution. More dozen human right victim advocacy group already banded together condemn proposal unconscionable. The idea Truth Commission emerged compromise long negotiation brought South Africa's peaceful transition white supremacist state non-racial democracy. During talk, white National Party government pushed blanket amnesty, ANC refused. In end, 250 former police officer came forward, foot soldier. And two high National Party official, former Law Order Minister Adriaan Vlok Police Commissioner Johan van der Merwe, confessed role ordering bombing. In report, commission called apartheid state primary perpetrator gross human right violation held high ranking former official former President PW. Botha, former army chief, Georg Meiring, former intelligence chief, Niel Barnard, responsible. These men, others lower rank, applied amnesty For ANC, embarrassing prospect possible prosecution Mandela's former wife, Winnie Madikizela-Mandela, accused report taking part number assault abduction. Lesser-known official could face charge too. The ANC held responsible least 76 death KwaZulu/Natal. The ANC's problem complicated effort make peace largely Zulu-based Inkatha Freedom Party. Virtually one party came forward ask amnesty. Yet report found Inkatha, working white government, responsible widespread slaughter KwaZulu/Natal township around Johannesburg. Inkatha's leader, Chief Mangosuthu Buthelezi, many key party official stand accused fomenting wide range abuse. But prosecuting Chief Buthelezi could lead new warfare KwaZulu. Part reluctance go forward prosecution may result still another factor: The judicial system already overwhelmed rising crime evidence apartheid era old. So spend time money? At moment, one political party opposed form new amnesty tiny influential Democratic Party, liberal group involved violence. Its head, Tony Leon, say new amnesty would prove thuglike behavior, get away with. But concedes lonely voice. At point, say, little enthusiasm anything closing book past. A panel probing apartheid-era abuse accused African National Congress human right violation, including torture bomb attack, state broadcaster said Monday. The ANC, led struggle white rule power, previously acknowledged told expect implication right violation. The Truth Reconciliation Commission release final report 2 1-2 year investigation Thursday. The report expected place overwhelming blame era's abuse white government brutal security service. President Nelson Mandela's office received advance copy Monday ahead handover ceremony, retired Archbishop Desmond Tutu, chaired comission, present Mandela report. South African Broadcasting Corp. radio said leaked preliminary document condemns ANC politically morally responsible gross human right violation fall apartheid. An ANC spokesman, Thabo Masebe, said believed news report referred commission letter sent advance informing u intention implicate ANC gross human right violation. Commission official could immediately reached comment. Justice Minister Dullah Omar told journalist Pretoria heard news report, would comment. Former President FW. de Klerk, meanwhile, plan ask court prevent Truth Commission report implicating covering state-sponsored terror. Obviously comply ruling court, Omar said, added would regret court-ordered delay. The ANC nervous enough report request meeting commissioner earlier month. The panel refused, avoid appearing embarrassed. The party say accusation likely would center planting land mine border farm, abuse military camp Angola bombing. Omar said expected report's conclusion set debate added would lay basis reconciliation. President Nelson Mandela acknowledged Saturday African National Congress violated human right apartheid, setting odds deputy president report divided much South Africa. The disagreement stem Thursday's release report Truth Reconciliation Commission horror committed apartheid. Rather act salve aid reconciliation, report caused divisiveness, even among former comrades-in-arms fought apartheid. As expected, report called apartheid crime humanity. But also blamed ANC gross human right violation anti-apartheid struggle, saying group tortured suspected spy dissident killed innocent civilian land mine bomb.

His death, announced Poudre Valley Hospital here, fanned outrage followed word last week's attack, spawning nationwide vigil, producing call federal hate-crimes legislation President Clinton fueling debate law host Western state, including Wyoming, resisted them. From Denver University Maryland, people turned honor The slight, soft-spoken 21-year-old Shepard, freshman University Wyoming, became overnight symbol anti-gay violence found dangling fence passerby. Two men two woman charged case. The men charged attempted murder expected face first-degree murder charge could bring death penalty. There incredible symbolism tied fence, said Rebecca Isaacs, political director National Gay Lesbian Task Force Washington. People likened scarecrow. But sounded like crucifixion. Gay leader hope Christian conservative fear Shepard's death galvanize Congress state legislature pas hate-crime legislation broaden existing law. Conservatives generally oppose law favor one group's right another. In last two decade, 21 state District Columbia passed law increase penalty crime committed person's race, religion, color, national origin, sexual orientation.

Matthew's death may lead awakening Wyoming United States Congress need legislation. In 1996, 21 men woman killed United States sexual orientation, according Southern Poverty Law Center, Alabama group track violence minority. According FBI, sexual orientation factor 11.6 percent 8,759 hate crime recorded 1996. But Christian conservative warn gay leader want use Shepard's death expand hate right law curtail freedom speech. Hate crime law nothing perpetrator violent crime everything silencing political opposition, said Steven Schwalm, analyst Family Research Council, Washington group dedicated defending faith, family freedom. It would criminalize pro-family belief, Schwalm said. This basically sends message can't disagree political message homosexual activist. Agreement came John Paulk, featured summer series advertisement wife, Anne, overcame homosexuality religious conversion. We every right speak agenda contrary Biblical norm, said Paulk, describes homosexuality specialist Focus Family, Christian group Colorado Springs, Colo. Because standing opposing homosexual agenda, looked upon advocating violence homosexual, categorically reject violence homosexual. Last Thursday, Family Research Council unveiled series television advertisement preach healing homosexuality religious conversion. Gay leader charge advertisement help create hostile climate homosexual, climate lead violence. Hate crime law book 40 state impinged freedom speech, said Brian Levin, criminal justice professor directs Center Hate Extremism Stockton College, Pomona, NJ. Instead, said, hate crime law send clear message society tolerate attack minority. We want deter broken window simple assault escalate, said. Referring murder homosexual, added: These crime preventable. Offenders get emboldened punished first time. Levin said research indicated homosexual suffered higher rate violent crime population large. He also said roughly half people attack homosexual male, aged 22 younger. The two men charged killing Shephard white, Russell Henderson, 21, Aaron McKinney, 22. With crime, violence mean end. With hate crime, violence becomes unstoppable goal, Levin said. Shepard suffered dozen cut around head, face neck, well massive blow back skull. Because social stature society, gay often viewed appropriate target, Levin added. Citing need hate crime law send clear message gay bashers, Levin said: The discourse society leaf many people believe socially acceptable. While gay leader saw crucifixion imagery Shepard's death, others saw different symbolism: Old West practice nailing dead coyote ranch fence warning future intruder. This University Wyoming student beaten left die, tied fence like animal honest open gay, Beatrice Dorhn, legal director Lambda Legal Defense Education Fund, said Monday, Matthew Shepard's horrible suffering death cannot dismissed simply fault deranged, isolated individual. His attacker among million Americans constantly hear message gay people worthy basic equal treatment, Ms. Dorhn said. On day Americans learned last week Matthew Shepard, 5-foot-2, 105-pound gay college student, tortured, strung like animal left die fence outside Laramie, Wyo., Family Research Council co-hosting press conference Washington. It latest salvo six-month campaign religious right, tacit, even explicit, approval Republican leader, demonize gay people political gain election year. This particular press conference announce new barrage ad TV follow-up summer print campaign alleged former homosexual changed implore others likewise power Jesus Christ. The commercial, gooey style, end slogan: It's hate . It's hope. But really stirring fear produce hate. If ad truly aimed gay people, broadcast extravagant cost wide general audience reached TV, trumpeted Washington, insuring free national exposure, three week Election Day. The ad themselves, despite sugar-coating hope, ooze malice. In one them, homosexuality linked drug addiction certain death AIDS; implicitly posit homosexuality disease need cure. Matthew Shepard cured, that's sure. As uncle, RW. Eaton, told The Denver Post, 21-year-old Matt, aspired career diplomacy human right, small person big heart, mind soul someone tried beat him. Of nephew's shattered body Eaton said, It's like something might see war. And war is. Go Family Research Council's Web site find proud description readiness wage war homosexual agenda fight maintain traditional meaning `family.' The head Family Research Council Gary Bauer, GOP power broker putative presidential candidate, disingenuously go talk show say organization hate one deplores violence. But wage well-financed medium air war people innate difference sexual orientation ceaselessly branded sinful diseased un-American seeker special right, ground war follow. It's story old history. Once group successfully scapegoated subhuman threat normal value propaganda machine, emboldened thug take over. Two week James Byrd savagely dragged death pickup truck Texas June, I wrote column ugly incident outside GOP state convention Fort Worth, mob threatened group gay Log Cabin Republicans protesting discriminatory treatment party. The gay-bashers directly preceded steady saber-rattling Republican politicians: Sen.

Just two day near-brush violence Fort Worth, Trent Lott TV seconding religious right's condemnation gay people sinful sick. A frightened gay Texas Republican convention melee asked I interviewed then: Do have someone hurt beat dragged truck stop this? Months later even murder Laramie moved Lott apologize word, still major GOP leader dare take religious wing crusade people like Matthew Shepard. In one new ad supposedly hate-free crusade, ostensibly loving mother condemns son bad choice gay. Is mother speaks American value, Matthew's?

On many issue Turkish society encountering now, represents orientation seem totally tune time, Turan said. That would include position issue like privatization, integrating Turkey fully international system, devolution central authority. He failed grasp world heading. He look analyzes world category longer useful appropriate. Almost alone among Turkish politician, Ecevit life modestly avoided hint personal financial scandal.

Most declared favor government led lawmaker. Only center-right leader Tansu Ciller said wanted government led party leader, made clear willing take task. Turkey's parliament split longstanding animosity center-left center-right party. Yilmaz led last government, collapsed November amid allegation tie organized crime interfered sale state bank. By tradition, Demirel asked leader Parliament's largest party form new government. But Demirel broke custom keep Islamic-oriented Virtue Party power. Turkey's staunchly secular military opposes return Islamic-led government.

While veteran civic leader devote Wednesday's national holiday honoring fallen soldier, Remembrance Day become chilling vigil Canadians front line abortion-rights movement. There immediate fear, anti-abortion gunman believed large. And long-term anxiety, even country abortion legal publicly funded, woman may find access diminishing. There speculation sniper's timing linked Remembrance Day anti-abortion activist use day commemorate aborted fetus. Three time since 1994, sniper used time year fire home Canadian doctor performs abortion, time wounding target. The attack spread across Canada Ontario, Manitoba British Columbia. US. Canadian investigator believe attack linked two shooting abortion-providing doctor upstate New York, including Oct. 23 slaying Dr. Barnett Slepian home near Buffalo. An American anti-abortion activist, James Kopp, wanted questioning shooting. Police say know side border on, fueling uneasiness clinic hospital throughout Canada. You must realize Canada largest undefended border world, said Keith McCaskill, police inspector Winnipeg, Manitoba, spokesman investigation. Many women's clinic tightened security, doctor provide abortion urged take precaution. I would suggest extremely aware day-to-day going on, whether business day hour, said Toronto Detective Rick Stubbings. Across Canada, report obstetrician-gynecologists modifying practice deciding stop performing abortion. Some wear bulletproof vest hang sheet window home. Abortion-rights group say doctor backing down. There's great deal sadness, said Susan Fox, director clinic Edmonton, Alberta, provides abortion. But there's also feeling determination deterred scared action. Marilyn Wilson, executive director Canadian Abortion Rights Action League, see long-term threat fear violence may intimidate young doctor entering field. There almost doctor stopped performing procedure, even current reign terror, said. But young doctor family necessarily want this. They may willing put life risk. The abortion debate one several factor contributing shortage obstetrician-gynecologists Canada. The national society oversees speciality say 1,400 doctor field, shortfall 600, 50 60. The society say long hour limit fee paid public health-care system causing burnout deterring medical school graduate choose specialty. Another problem Canadian medical school offer training abortion. Women Canada's big city generally adequate access abortion. Those rural area often face long journey, province Prince Edward Island prohibits abortion six hospital, forcing woman travel New Brunswick Nova Scotia. Abortion-rights group say situation would improve RU-486 abortion pill available Canada. No drug company applied permission market pill, either fearing boycott doubting profitability. The government urged make public appeal drug company, health department say can't done. It would conflict interest, said Bonnie Fox-McIntyre, department spokeswoman. As regulator stay arm's length, judge application impartially. Abortion illegal Canada 1988. Now abortion law sort, 100,000 abortion performed annually, poll indicate roughly three-quarters Canadians favor pro-choice policy. Yet public support spare doctor fear. Dr. Henry Morgentaler, led effort overturn old abortion law whose Toronto clinic bombed 1993, say colleague sacrificing personal freedom reluctantly increase security measure. Unfortunately, doctor committed providing service accept certain diminishment enjoyment life, said. In aftermath last month's deadly sniper attack obstetrician upstate New York, Attorney General Janet Reno announced last week setting new investigative unit examine possibility doctor victim broader anti-abortion plot. The unit, National Clinic Violence Task Force, include dozen Justice Department lawyer involve several law-enforcement agency. But main work looking shooting Dr. Barnett Slepian suburban Buffalo home fit larger pattern organized violence done FBI, jurisdiction domestic terrorism. For many FBI, that's problem. In contrast old image gung-ho FBI agent turning surveillance machinery political group, number senior FBI agent privately expressed misgiving attorney general's latest task force, second ordered begin broad investigation conspiracy involving anti-abortion violence. FBI official fear expanding investigation could drive agency ill-defined boundary separate inquiry criminal activity political cause unpopular idea. Today's agent eager disassociate old J. Edgar Hoover day trampling civil right political dissident guise serious investigation. They want agency drawn middle bitter ideological war anti-abortion group abortion right advocate, long asserted existence organized campaign clinic doctor. Many calling government help subject FBI interest anti-war civil right activist. Senior agency official, including Director Louis Freeh, starting career early 1970s watched dismay FBI shaken revelation Cointelpro, counterintelligence program allowed agent spy on, burgle, wiretap infiltrate anti-war civil right group like Students Democratic Society Student Nonviolence Coordinating Committee. Some official dubious conspiracy exists kill doctor perform abortion. They came empty handed Reno ordered first federal inquiry 1994 killing Florida doctor bodyguard. The Justice Department conducted two-year grand jury investigation; agent pursued anti-abortion activist using surveillance team. But investigator never found specific plot abortion clinic staff member. Violence abortion clinic part problem. The FBI recent year found thrown minefield politically tinged case involving volatile world anti-government militia, environmental Christian extremist, white separatist, animal right activist Islamic fundamentalist. The FBI quick jump investigating crime investigating political association, said David Cole, law professor Georgetown University. When move investigating crime investigating group, all-important nexus criminal conduct get lost, focus get broader broader start sweeping kind lawful political activity. In response terrorist attack like bombing World Trade Center 1993, Oklahoma City federal building 1995 Olympic park Atlanta 1996, agency increased effort deter incident major prevention program. In case, Justice Department, FBI law enforcement agency said operate domestic security guideline require investigator find reasonable indication group planning break law open inquiry organization. Before authority use intrusive tactic wiretapping property search, must specific evidence. Yet FBI agent throughout country quietly evaluated threat posed variety extremist group link local authority informal interview leader group. Their conclusion group pose little real danger. Much difficult investigate lone terrorist inflamed oratory extremist ideology belong group, drifting along society's frayed margin, grid, agent describe it, without usual tie family, friend work. The profile fit Eric Robert Rudolph, fugitive wanted bombing Atlanta Olympics, gay nightclub two abortion clinic. He kept belief mostly himself, although acquaintance hint familiar religious extremism hate group. In contrast, James Charles Kopp, sought material witness killing Slepian, left trail clue motif. He early follower Randall Terry, leader Operation Rescue. Later, Kopp associated Lambs Christ, another militant anti-abortion group. One law-enforcement official said government best. We investigate violation, said. We investigate group. Everyone knew Dr. Barnett Slepian knew slight, graying physician endured measure stress would exhaust, even break, people. There stranger pawed garbage can home growled murderer passed grocery store aisle. Demonstrators assailed pregnant patient arrived office checkup, calling baby killer. Outside clinic performed abortion two day week, picket shouted epithet like pig face. Slepian, obstetrician gynecologist training abortion doctor principle, rarely acknowledged strain. He might crack occasional joke expense protester shadowed work weekend. Then would something unexpected, like invite anti-abortion leader breakfast stop chat familiar demonstrator outside clinic. So killed Oct. 23 sniper's bullet fired kitchen window home Buffalo, N.Y., suburb, furtive execution fit pattern four earlier attack abortion provider western New York state Canada, friend relative wondered much Slepian's work could arouse murderous violence. He predicted much himself. Instead, wondered, again, persisted work, long Buffalo doctor surrendered pressure abortion opponent. He incredibly fatalistic person thought number's up, up, nothing it, said H. Amanda Robb, doctor's 32-year-old niece. And incredibly stubborn. He said woman right comprehensive health care since women's doctor, going provide them. Slepian third doctor killed last five year bombing shooting killed 7 people wounded 17 abortion clinic around nation. To tormentor, simply abortion doctor. To member abortion right movement, martyr cause. But Slepian far either. In interview friend family member, emerges one-dimensional abstract conservative advocated old-fashioned value like self-reliance, shy man rare flash anger, doctor performed abortion patience woman multiple abortion woman multiple child want could support. He killed performed medical procedure become emotional politicized. Yet nothing life suggest crusader either politics medicine. Rather, obstinate, unassuming man remarkable thing. Out contrariness conscience, say knew him, refused allow anyone dictate kind doctor be, that, paid life. The clue Slepian's flinty brand commitment lie, part, upbringing. His family took success granted even teetered edge poverty. To earn money medical school, shoveled muck ranch drove taxi. He made friend, friend life. When wife sick, called repeatedly. When lonely, flew side. Slepian, known Bart, used tell people chose obstetrics specialty expose doctor least suffering, performed abortion legal alternative much worse. Slepian often expressed exasperation woman came abortion abortion. Don't get it? clinic staff recall saying once. He impatience woman like remembered residency inner-city Buffalo, child child mean support. He contempt somebody pulled bootstrap made world, Ms. Robb said. He believed ban abortion or, shameful view, stop teaching young doctor perform them, would correct human imperfection found irritating. There 1.5 million abortion performed country, niece said, felt we're equipped handle 1.5 million unwanted child. When killed, age 52, Bart Slepian owned imposing red brick home quiet suburb Amherst, complete swimming pool piped-in music assortment time-saving gadget adored. Slepian's trajectory comfortable doctor's life unconventional. His grandfather, Russian Jewish immigrant started selling shoelace pushcart Boston, propelled five son Harvard time Jews met university's blue-blood standard. His father, turn, decreed three son would doctor earn PhD's. We grew home tremendous, tremendous, tremendous respect education, said Serena Robb, Slepian's sister, four year older him. If got A, OK If got B, got yelled at. The family's mean match expectation. Slepian's father, Philip, joined father's business manufacturing leather sol shoe. Soon Bart born 1946 Boston, company failed, save money, father moved family six in-laws' apartment McKeesport, Pa., Rochester, NY. Once settled, Slepian's father set freelance writer, crisscrossing country old Studebaker, researching origin prominent citizen Library Congress writing story small-town newspaper. He sold article hundred, still writing death nine year ago age 93. The success expected Bart Slepian come easily. As child, shy cried anyone looked him, sister recalled. An unexceptional student, went local community college transferring University Denver, majored zoology. Rejected medical school United States fate two three applicant late 1960s studied one year Belgium enrolled Autonomous University Medicine Guadalajara, Mexico. His friend remember funny obstinate, thin young man glass receding hairline beat comer arm-wrestling pool. Bart certain belief, strongly held, said Richard Schwarz, old classmate internist Long Island. He always said sit around whining thing, Schwarz said. He would say, `Go what's what's right.' Bart Slepian's determination surfaced quirky way. He insisted going top World Trade Center, despite crippling fear height. To get window, crawled, inch inch. I said, `You this,' recalled Schwarz, time. And said, `I want it.' Bart made count. He felt alive. Forced drop school every semester work, lived Reno sister Serena, widow struggling take care two young daughter. She worked waitress blackjack dealer, sharing tip drove cab, cleaned barn ranch worked laboratory assistant local Veterans Administration hospital. After graduation, moved Buffalo medical residency. There married Lynne Breitbart, registered nurse 10 year junior, scraped together money buy obstetrics practice doctor retire. He soothing, unhurried manner. When patient his, Patti Durlak, diagnosed diabetes, Slepian referred specialist called every day month help overcome fear needle use insulin injection. The doctor said, `Just deal it,' Mrs. Durlak recalled. Not Dr. Slepian. In way, typical suburban family man, working six day week spending free time Little League game county fair four son. But late 1980s, abortion doctor Buffalo siege. In one notorious 1991 incident recorded videotape, Rev. Paul Schenck, one fieriest Buffalo's anti-abortion leader, threw front doctor's car pulled clinic driveway. Slepian parked street. As pushed way crowd chanting demonstrator, Schenck cupped hand around mouth lunged, shouting, Slepian, pig! Slepian's attempt separate abortion conflict private life futile. The protest followed home man bashful boy found himself, uncomfortably, center controversy attention. Once, showed anger. In 1988, demonstrator jeered sidewalk front home opened Hanukkah present child, doctor came brandishing baseball bat. He denied hurt anyone, town judge ordered repair one protester's smashed van window pay portion another's medical bill. The outburst surprised family friend. It Slepian's style make public fuss, much le acknowledge stress taunted protester. Stress? oldest brother Paul responded gruffly asked doctor's mood. I never heard word used family, except engineering term. He said nuisance. Mrs. Slepian respond request interview. She expressed rage The Buffalo News shortly shooting. She said whoever killed husband deserved death penalty would happy administer lethal injection herself. She also spoke Schenck's brother, Robert, another anti-abortion leader frequently confronted Slepian, sent bouquet flower. Mrs. Slepian denounced hypocrite. After confrontation 1988, Slepian turned civil harassment lawsuit, letter levity deal protester. In 1993, man active anti-abortion effort arrested rifling doctor's garbage can home, Slepian tried treat incident lightly. They hopefully got bag full dirty diaper, joked. He tried engage critic local newspaper. He told The Buffalo News abortion protester turn energy helping woman avoid unwanted pregnancy birth control counseling. In letter editor warned repeatedly calling murderer, critic inciting violence. Slepian accepted opponent abortion acted moral conviction, friend said, resented personal attack. He thought tended demonize dehumanize increased danger, said lawyer, Glenn Edward Murray. So Slepian took step nation's beleaguered abortion clinic doctor dared. He insisted tried hard enough, might cut venom. To dismay staff member feared safety, Slepian began year ago stop chat protester recognized outside Womenservices abortion clinic Buffalo, worked two day week. He surprised gathering protester preparing euphemistically called house call, demonstration doctor's home, invited protest's organizer, Rev. Robert Behn, breakfast. Their hourlong conversation next morning inconclusive, Behn said, dismissing Slepian's gesture attempt get people like him. He asked Slepian performing abortion affected spiritually. In response, recalled, doctor said, I'm fine spiritually. Slepian, meanwhile, focused time away home family. He planned take cruise next spring. He bought time-share apartment near Disney World Florida. He many plan, said Ellen Fink, close friend couple 15 year. He done. He done living yet. Still, sometimes casual conversation, shadow would appear. When wife gave gray African parrot birthday gift, Slepian joked bird would probably outlive would teach eulogy. He would talk funeral wanted, Mrs. Fink said. He said lot friend wanted come separate car, one car, he'd long procession. In week death, Slepian reason preoccupied thought mortality. A medical checkup revealed blockage heart, Mrs. Fink said, recounting conversation Mrs. Slepian day slaying. A blockage sign probable coronary artery disease. He test following week. I said, `Lynne, relax, going OK,' Mrs. Fink recalled. That day, National Abortion Federation sent fax Womenservices clinic warning pattern sniper attack abortion doctor occurred early November. Marilynne Buckham, clinic director, sent Slepian. He definitely took seriously, recalled. Typically, doctor share concern might felt. It normal day, said Tammi Latini, office assistant. We horsing around.' That evening, Slepians went synagogue mark ninth anniversary death Slepian's father. Shortly returned home, sniper's bullet smashed kitchen window, killing Slepian chatted wife son. The protester returned clinic five day later, first day reopened. Mrs. Buckham, director, said Slepian would surprised. They routine. So he. He never wanted day end bad note, said. At end day, I would always say, `Thank coming.' And would always turn stupid grin say, `Thanks me.' The slaying Dr. Barnett Slepian home last week eliminated mainstay abortion clinic here, eliminated women's access abortion. That availability abortion Buffalo area, much United States, complex reality, one affected class education, medical training personal conviction individual doctor. Knowledgeable middle-class affluent woman find unwanted pregnancy usually obtain abortion private gynecologist, gynecologist personal objection procedure, referral colleague. Women poor, young uneducated regular relationship doctor rely specialized clinic like one Slepian worked in, hospital. It group unplanned pregnancy far common prosperous woman face shrinking universe possibility result fear set Slepian's killing slaying five doctor clinic worker since 1993, medical expert said. If well well connected, get abortion, said Dr. Stephen Wear, co-director center clinical ethic University Buffalo, train doctor Buffalo area's hospital. For everybody else, le le available. The number abortion United States declining steadily since first year Supreme Court's Roe v. Wade decision legalized abortion 1973, according Alan Guttmacher Institute, study reproductive issue. They number roughly 1.5 million year, according report Guttmacher, 1.4 million, according National Right Life Committee, nation's largest anti-abortion group, calculates estimate partly Guttmacher figure. The number provider identify performing abortion part practice diminishing well. A 1994 Guttmacher study, last one published, found number decreased 18 percent 1982 1992, 2,380 2,908. Moreover, study said, 12 percent nation's residency program routinely offer training abortion first trimester, though many offer elective course. Laura Echevarria, director medium relation National Right Life Committee, contends, however, teaching hospital train gynecologist procedure treating miscarriage similar used performing abortion. Only cosmopolitan comparatively liberal city like New York availability abortion continue steady level, expert say, though even locale concern decreasing number young doctor emerge residency fully trained performing abortion. The Guttmacher Institute, keep nation's precise statistic, said 1992, last year figure, 142,410 abortion New York done 151 provider, including 61 hospital 44 clinic. Still, provider figure greatly understates number private doctor perform office, medical expert say. Many obstetrician gynecologist Manhattan provide abortion part palette service, many year, said Dr. Richard Hausknecht, medical director Planned Parenthood. Rich middle-class woman always access abortion, always will. The major threat availability city le result anti-abortion violence medical training. The bottom line we're facing impending shortage physician adequately trained willing procedure, said Dr. John Choate, chairman New York State division American College Obstetricians Gynecologists. But lack training program also result political pressure hospital university antagonist abortion climate fear. Physicians tend lie low, Choate said. They publicize fact them. If them, quietly fear practice life. One development horizon expected change outlook abortion substantially final federal approval, expected next year, RU-486 pill, drug end early pregnancy without need surgery. When pill introduced France Edinburgh, Scotland, Hausknecht said, number surgical abortion plummeted. In July 1988, Randall Terry drove night home Binghamton, N.Y., Atlanta start series anti-abortion protest would finally put new hard-line group, Operation Rescue, onto America's front page, James Charles Kopp van riding alongside him, according former leader Operation Rescue spoke condition anonymity. And, people say, Terry arrested first day Operation Rescue's Siege Atlanta, Kopp followed jail. Along one hundred Operation Rescue member, according people there, Kopp remained jail 40 day adhered Terry's order give real name police court. After release, Kopp returned Operation Rescue's Binghamton headquarters, working alongside Terry group's power influence anti-abortion movement surged late 1988 1989, according former leader Operation Rescue. Now, Kopp sought federal local law enforcement authority questioning material witness murder obstetrician performed abortion Buffalo region. The authority also say may information help solve four sniper attack doctor performed abortion Canada upstate New York. Some abortion-rights group seizing Kopp's role Operation Rescue raise new question connection recent anti-abortion violence hard-line anti-abortion protest group burst onto national scene late 1980s. For year, Federal Bureau Investigation Justice Department looked vain evidence determine whether national conspiracy might behind series clinic bombing shooting doctor clinic staff member began early 1990s. A federal grand jury Alexandria, Va., looked conspiracy allegation ultimately disbanded without finding national underground. But federal law enforcement official say hope Kopp may help provide link. In fact, announcement law enforcement official looking made Attorney General Janet Reno prepared revive interagency task force look possible conspiracy behind anti-abortion crime. Federal law enforcement official authority say Kopp suspect sniper attack Oct. 23 killed Dr. Barnett A. Slepian near Buffalo. But say Kopp's car seen near Slepian's home Amherst, NY. week doctor shot. One day issuing warrant Kopp's arrest material witness, law enforcement official least 10 agency spanning United States Canadian border still located Kopp Thursday. But law enforcement official said pursuing many tip, including 400 poured FBI's information line: (800) 281-1184. The police gone photograph abortion protester clinic worker Buffalo around country, also reviewing hundred hour videotape demonstration search Kopp's face. At point, official consider shooting Slepian connected three attack Canada one Rochester doctor provide abortion. The five attack, since 1994, occurred week leading Nov. 11, Veterans Day called Remembrance Day Canada holiday become important anti-abortion activist. But attack spread four year 3,000 mile, Vancouver, British Columbia, Buffalo.

By outward appearance, Dorothy Hayes' life seems ordinary. She family live rambling old home shore Lake Ontario, every morning, give husband, John, peck cheek go work. She run errand, like suburban mom, spends much day taking care child. But one thing set Mrs. Hayes apart neighbor. As devoted opponent abortion, 43-year-old mother nine regularly play host series traveling speaker, priest protester many come Rochester intent upon spreading word abortion shutting clinic provide it. She one thousand people across country loosely associated anti-abortion group like Lambs Christ opened home Lambs' founder, Rev. Norman Weslin, itinerant demonstrator. While many including Mrs. Hayes disavow violent tactic, supporter abortion right say people like bear responsibility protester help blockade clinic threaten doctor. These people provide Father Weslin food shelter come town close clinic innocent, said Ann Glazier, director clinic defense Planned Parenthood Federation. It's credible say part extremist activity taking place clinic. They still guilty interfering women's access. But Mary Quinn, local organizer Lambs Christ also offer home protester, see matter differing light. Taking people like act Christian charity, Mrs. Quinn said. `People travel around country work taken u want lose stupid house. We take people willing make sacrifice. Members Lambs Christ persistent figure protest Buffalo women's clinic Dr. Barnett Slepian worked shot death last month. Although suspect identified shooting several similar attack New York Canada past several year, official looking question Vermont man whose car seen near Dr. Slepian's home. That man, James Charles Kopp, participated abortion protest decade, often house guest member Lambs Christ. While Mrs. Hayes say would never much obstruct clinic's door, given refuge qualm so. Weslin, leader Lambs Christ, one benefited Mrs. Hayes' hospitality, modern version generosity Christ Apostles knew well. He pride arrested 60 time protest front medical clinic. And throughout 1980s early '90s, active clinic rescue, protester tried physically restrain patient trying enter clinic. Weslin stayed Mrs. Hayes' home once, beginning May 1996 first came speak local church anti-abortion movement. But stay lasted several month, arrested Federal charge blocking access Rochester health clinic abortion performed. He later convicted served two half month prison. During protest outside clinic, several protester locked homemade contraption called oven, made cement iron. It took police officer several hour lug device horse trailer carted off. At protest, one man glued head lock gate surrounding clinic, move protester later said accident.

They describe activity peaceful resistance meant stop see murder. Weslin house guest Mrs. Hayes Mrs. Quinn come recommended friend member local Catholic church, said, adding speaker local church anti-abortion event. And although say would never take home stranger wanted FBI, like Kopp, concede sometimes know little guest. But Mrs. Hayes Mrs. Quinn say know lot Weslin. An Army veteran, leader anti-abortion movement 25 year, say, founded home unwed mother. Mrs. Hayes said met him, obvious man peace tremendous devotion Blessed Mother basically recognized helpless lamb. Barbara Fredericks, another local abortion opponent developed tie Lambs Weslin came town, added priest epitomized man God. I knew I looked holy shoe simple coat mended 50 time, said. He humble, man higher purpose, trying save people sacrifice prayer. opp also robust defender among people housed rode country protest protest. E. Kenny, 20, said parent housed Kopp St. Albans, Vt., home two year spoke local church 1988. During Kopp's stay, pleasure, Kenny said, always helping around house.

Both Kopp Weslin arrested repeatedly abortion protest. The men moved circle time found arrested event. Mrs. Quinn said Weslin told recent telephone conversation knew Kopp. Weslin could reached comment, clear two men encountered other. Both faced misdemeanor charge blocking Burlington, Vt., health clinic 1990 Kopp called mill. And spent time jail Atlanta 1988 clinic protest. Slepian's death abortion opponent like Mrs. Hayes Mrs. Quinn worried, killing portrayed medium membership group like Lambs Christ. For long time, felt like voice desert heard, Mrs. Hayes said. And horrible tragedy doctor's death becoming face movement. We're saving life, said. The FBI talked Mrs. Hayes, Kenny said agent spoken him. The Justice Department say Federal task force set week investigate killing Slepian looking evidence connecting anti-abortion violence various clinic. It's fair say investigating event, look connection individual engaged criminal conduct, Myron Marlin, spokesman department, said. Many local Catholics associated Lambs Christ tried distance killing Slepian. They mailing literature saying killer represent movement. In addition, people associated Lambs offering possible explanation killing. Some say believe killer might someone overcome grief personal experience abortion. Others wondered whether shooter tried wound doctor scare prevent performing abortion. The Lambs also wonder whether abortionist opponent blamed shooting committed disgruntled patient. One idea gaining currency among Lambs, prominently displayed Web site, suggests killing result plot abortion supporter discredit abortion opponent last week's election. Mrs. Hayes say know truth. There wacko travel around may front clinic drawn place, said. But know everyone show turn person next tell belong there. Mrs. Fredericks said anyone would shoot doctor provides abortion someone snapped, perhaps importance situation. Members Lambs Christ opponent abortion Rochester wonder whether killing Slepian hinder effort. When Weslin first arrived two year ago, brought new focus group often done little counsel pregnant woman set booth college campus, said. In many city, priest life coordinating leading rosary march abortion, Mrs. Quinn said. But Father Weslin coming here, could finally come together feel like something sacrificial group. Mrs. Hayes said felt first pull movement early 1980s, heard woman speak choice regard abortion. Then saw Silent Scream, well-known anti-abortion film purport show footage abortion. What I saw end life, said. She began volunteer Catholic pregnancy center encouraged woman kill child. She also began house unwed mother went stand vigil outside local clinic abortion performed. Mrs. Hayes looked 3-month-old daughter, Bernadette, pointed prenatal image infant, sonogram taken 13 week keep refrigerator door. She described could baby's fate, someone else's child. Two pound two inch ago, could partial-birth abortion, Mrs. Hayes said, referring controversial late-term abortion procedure. They hardest time getting shoulder out, get head puncture it. It's brutal, expect purpose dead baby? There's question doctor trying murder child. ","Dr. Barnett Slepian, the mainstay of Buffalo's only abortion clinic, was slain as he stood at his kitchen window.Slepian has been described as a fatalist who stubbornly adhered to doing what he thought right.The FBI is looking for James Kopp for questioning as a material witness in the slaying.Kopp has long been identified as a major voice in the anti-abortion movement.Attorney General Reno will investigate if the slaying is part of a nation-wide plot.In Canada, authorities are worried that new violence could erupt as Remembrance Day approaches.Anti-abortion pamphlets have been delivered to a Canadian newspaper, possibly by Kopp.","On Oct. 23, 1998, a sniper killed Dr. Barnet Slepian, a mainstay in the last abortion clinic in the Buffalo area and one of only a few doctors performing the procedure in the face of protesters and threats.Many of the protesters are itinerants like Rev. Norman Weslin, founder of the anti-abortion group Lambs of Christ, who travel about spreading their message and shutting down clinics.Another itinerant demonstrator, James Charles Kopp, is wanted by the FBI as a material witness in the Slepian murder.In addition to anti-abortion violence, a shortage of doctors who are trained and willing to do the procedures imperil their widespread availability.","The primary doctor at the last abortion clinic in Buffalo, NY, was shot and killed.Dr. Slepian, a stubborn man, dedicated to women's care, and an unlikely martyr.It's the 7th such death, and the 4th similar attack.James Kopp is sought as a material witness.The anti-abortion movement has local and itinerate members.Their activities go from prayers and talking to confrontations, threats and violence.After this killing, the FBI resumed a search for an anti-abortion conspiracy.Since the first few years after Roe v Wade, the number of abortions has declined, as has the number of clinics and doctors providing the procedure, especially for poorer women.","Abortion clinics continue to be targeted by anti-abortion groups such as Operation Rescue, Lambs of Christ, and Army of God.Opposition ranges from silent vigils to vocal and physical intimidation, and even murder.Dr. Bart Shepian of Buffalo's only abortion clinic was murdered in his home.Police in the US and Canada are looking for James Kopp, a known abortion opponent, as a material witness in that murder.The clinics serve poor, young, and uneducated women since the well-to-do use their established providers.AG Janet Reno has named a task force to find out if the Slepian murder, the third in five years, is part of an organized campaign of violence."

Strawberry, struggled cry, hugged nurse, thanked everyone supporting him, rose wheelchair carefully entered car. Wow, I never thought day would come, Strawberry said. But ha. Unlike David Wells, Saturday night's starter World Series predicted Yankees would throttle Padres five game, Strawberry refused make prediction whether soon getting third World Series ring. But Strawberry, still hopeful returning play 1999, sounded confident 1998 Yankees, wearing number 39 back cap inspiration. They look really good, said Strawberry. It's going easy, I think they're ready. The best thing making World Series know go anywhere else that. You've made point go best do. That's about. As Bernie Williams start could final series Yankees Game 1 World Series Yankee Stadium Saturday night, want free mind. Free worrying extremely uncertain future undisclosed personal matter made post-season perplexing pleasing. But easy keep mind uncluttered. Williams know sign Yankees return center field next season, want test free agency. There good chance Yankees offer lavish contract, Williams might forced decide fattest paycheck new situation baseball city choice pretty fat paycheck familiar situation Bronx. Scott Boras, Williams' agent, compared client player $10 million-a-year bracket last season, price tag surely escalated Williams American League batting title .339 average drilling 26 homer knocking 97 run. Williams asked agreed theory team outbid Yankees. I know, said Williams, aloof post-season, declined discus why. And I'm thinking little I would like to. I would like keep focus series. It issue Williams Yankees want study Saturday coming day, team four victory away championship. Still, issue hovers Yankees ominously owner George Steinbrenner hovers general manager Brian Cashman. It's tough thing, Cashman said balancing excitement World Series reality trying re-sign Williams. You know ugliness future right front you. Although Williams adamant discussing future, relented slightly Friday. When reporter asked reason would staying Yankees, Williams' answer included escape clause. Just fact I've whole career, Williams said. That lot it. The relationship I've come know year, I think would hard, impossible, start scratch somewhere else. Williams continued: But I think reality game day age thing happen. You can't really write thing stone they're going happen. People get traded. People become free agent go team. I make decision really thinking people I'm accountable for. When Williams asked better situation could player center fielder Yankees, winning batting crown World Series, 30-year-old stumped. Wow, that's pretty good right there, Williams said. It's funny mention that, I really thought that. I think, point season, I going sit think, wow, bad year all. While Cashman would discus financial matter, another Yankee official said team offer Williams much $12 million year unless Steinbrenner get generous possible championship. It likely Yanks would offer Williams $10 million-a-year range. I'd hate speculate something point, Cashman said. We'll give best effort sign level we're comfortable with. Hopefully, enough. Then we'll marriage. If not, we'll divorce. While Williams earned right become free agent pursue contract want city want, interesting choice make. When reporter asked Williams would respond someone suggested accept le Yankees remain city popular, like teammate manager, team post-season four straight year, hesitate answer. My response would time right start thinking that, Williams said. If I start thinking that, it'll distract I need World Series. Williams talked Yankees end remarkable season want situation disrupt that. But, Williams' status uncertain, asked next four seven game would bittersweet, since could ending 13-year association Yankees. I want talk that, Williams said. I'm going lot fun there. I'm going go out. Then Williams walked away interview. The New York Times said editorial Saturday, Oct. 17: It fitting memorable baseball season conclude World Series open Saturday night Yankee Stadium, aging still grand cathedral sport. Bedecked bunting banner, revered ballpark always elevates game aura history accomplishment. That make perfect venue part championship series determine whether 1998 Yankees one greatest team modern era, talented squad owned regular season folded World Series. New Yorkers boisterous, boastful bunch, patter city week loud arrogant, must seem anyone venturing San Diego root Padres. The word sidewalk subway Padres measure Yankees. Sure, lethal starting pitcher Kevin Brown Andy Ashby, one game's best closer Trevor Hoffman, mention prolific hitter like Tony Gwynn Greg Vaughn, hobbling still dangerous. But match Yankees' World Series starting rotation David Wells, Orlando Hernandez, David Cone Andy Pettitte, bullpen flamethrower Mariano Rivera, plus deepest batting order baseball? Yet truth Yankees fan terrified team crumple. Baseball fan, even Yankee fan, spend lifetime waiting see home team historic caliber, Yankee team reach sanctified status unless end record-setting season winning World Series. The doubt keep creeping up. The team pitiful plate playoff. Tino Martinez, top run producer, numbing slump. Bernie Williams, American League batting champ, hit well pennant series Cleveland Indians, seemed distracted personal matter. Shane Spencer, rookie slugging sensation September, turned new Mr. October. Pettitte struggling since August. The curious thing team, game regular season team American League history, quiet unobtrusive be. It sport dominant superstar, swaggering clubhouse leader, one seems belong New York. So Yankees start drift field, fan tend fear team might simply fade away. Until Indians surged temporarily ahead playoff, Yankees faced serious test resiliency season. New Yorkers already taste ticker-tape parade Broadway. But behind every mighty cheer stadium Saturday night lurk fear curtain fall season, unheralded unlegendary team San Diego one remembered. The last time seen field Yankee Stadium, inadvertently influencing outcome game sent Cleveland Indians home Yankees World Series. That's say umpire mess World Series, shown eminently capable interfering natural progression postseason game. All right, Ted Hendry World Series; umpires' collective bargaining agreement league allow umpire work league championship series World Series. Joe Brinkman either, even though agreement allow umpire work division series World Series. The three American League umpire six-man World Series crew work first round playoff. One them, Richie Garcia, crew chief behind plate Saturday night's opener Yankee Stadium. Gene Budig, AL president, Friday called Garcia, 24-year veteran, one league's respected umpire. But Saturday night, Garcia move right field Sunday night Game 2. Now combination sound familiar, Richie Garcia right field? Ah yes, last time Garcia worked post-season series Yankee Stadium, umpire Game 1 league championship series two year ago young fan New Jersey name, please; over-glorified enough reached fence caught Derek Jeter's fly ball Tony Tarasco, Baltimore's right fielder, prepared catch it. Garcia ruled interference, home run, said oops watching television replay clearly showing interference. Too late. The call helped Yankees win first game set tone series. Even though made mistake, know best there, baseball official, speaking condition anonymity, said. That knowledge come small consolation Orioles. Budig, too, acknowledged umpire, like player manager, perfect. Major league umpire skilled do, human, said telephone interview. Day day good job Major League Baseball. Rounds one two difficult, happens time time. The umpire human American League playoff happened time time time time. The Cleveland Indians suffered brunt fallibility umpire. We highlight reel umpire getting knocked baseball, general manager John Hart said Indians' final game Yankees. The umpire lose game u, share controversy two playoff series umpire. In division series Boston, Brinkman, plate umpire, bad call pitch play plate immediately provoked dispute led ejecting Mike Hargrove, Indians' manager, three pitch Game 2, Dwight Gooden, starting pitcher, 19 pitch later. Hendry right wrong, depending one's point view, noncall interference Travis Fryman 12th inning Game 2 ALCS. That ruling went favor Indians. Little else did. In Game 4, Jeter stealing second fifth inning on-target throw Sandy Alomar Jr. hit Jim McKean, jumped try get way instead kicked ball right field. A batted ball, Omar Vizquel's line drive, struck Hendry Game 6. But worst call Game 6 Hendry's force play second base. Hendry called Bernie Williams safe, ruling Vizquel's foot came base caught ball. Members Yankees indicated Friday they, too, thought call wrong. I know, Williams said asked thought, I'll take it. It big play. But think out? I'd rather comment that, said. It stir lot controversy. I want get that. When player belief safe, say worry subsequent controversy. If Williams implying thought out, another member Yankees said doubt Williams out. I sure first, uniformed member team said, I saw Hendry, I said uh-oh. I also thought Omar smooth think come bag. Then I saw replay. He out. The game today faster used be, observer said. The umpire sharper. Maybe Garcia, Dale Scott Tim Tschida American League, Jerry Crawford, Dana DeMuth Mark Hirschbeck National League, sharp 18th century French guillotine four seven game. Leonard Coleman, NL president, said thought umpire first-rate division league series added three splendid umpire working World Series. Budig said: The World Series crew proven first-rate. We total confidence them. The umpire let player make error manager bad decision. Then everyone talk player manager umpire. A strong sign city going bonkers Padres came Friday morning 680 fan agreed shave head radio promotion raffle return 1-in-680 chance skybox ticket post-season play. This show support team one ticket, said Tommy Sablan, producer Jeff Jer show. It symbolic effort bald Padres Tony Gwynn, Wally Joyner, Greg Vaughn, Jim Leyritz. About thousand people showed men, woman child. We 10 barber 20 hairdresser took six hour line either get buzzed straight-razored. We shocked turnout. But bandwagon town. `Buy ticket day concert' type public. You'll see even bigger bandwagon Monday they've hopefully play Yankees real World Series. After Padres beat Braves, 3-0, Game 2 National League Championship Series Thursday night Atlanta take two-game lead four-of-seven-game series, San Diego fan began gearing shot World Series traditional way. It would team's first World Series appearance since 1984, downtown business district Friday, marquee banner read Go Padres lunch-hour rally attended several hundred fan. The Padres set attendance record 2,555,901 season, half-million last year nearly million half three year ago. It stemmed part effort John Moores, Padres owner, Larry Lucchino, team's president, put family entertainment park bought team December 1994. This diversified group fan I saw Atlanta, Lucchino said. Their crowd seemed yuppified. We're proud three generation family come game. Donna McMahon, 63-year-old homemaker La Jolla, fan since 10 Pacific Coast League Padres played Lane Field near harbor. She would take streetcar school meet father, would buy bleacher seat. Later, brought four child Jack Murphy Stadium National League Padres 2,500 people crowd. Now, brings grandchild sold-out Qualcomm Stadium. There different group stand, said, upper class, middle class, business person, beer-drinking fan, child, Mexican fan across border. We true fan u. San Diego Mayor Susan Golding agrees, also giving credit balmy weather. Padre fan cross-section county, said. Downtown, suburban, rural, east, north, rancher farmer high-tech engineer, yuppie new kid X generation. A lot across border. The Padres extremely popular Tijuana. We perfect weather long baseball season. Playing World Series October got better New York. Carlos Carrion, born San Diego baseball fan 25 year, brings 10- 8-year-old son stadium. This great chance let child see player work, Carrion said. They look guy understand character work ethic. The Padres ticket office estimate average, 15,000 fan 65,000-seat stadium Latin Americans San Diego, Baja California state Sonora. The Padres first major league baseball souvenir store Tijuana. A new shipment bat arrived Tino Martinez Friday, massaged handle make sure thin enough, knocked barrel listened certain sound swung slowly again. Martinez excited fresh bat, reacted like Little Leaguer wielding aluminum bat first time. You saving World Series tree now, right? Martinez said representative bat company. These World Series tree, they? Martinez could joke bat specially designed World Series Yankees began quest second title past three year play host San Diego Padres Game 1 Yankee Stadium Saturday night. Major leaguer player watching television could imitate David Letterman joke World Series wood. Even though Martinez struggled numerous bat post-season, could joke Yankees still alive title. Martinez still alive. For now, Martinez, power hitter mostly missing action, could joke around. For now. You always get fresh start post-season game game, said Martinez. If win, got another game next day forget bad at-bat. It's easier post-season next at-bat could biggest at-bat season. Normally, Martinez plate biggest at-bat season would pleasing sight Yankees. But calendar flip October. Martinez experienced another frustrating post-season. He 5 30 10 strikeout, homer 1 run batted hitting-starved team batted .229 still winning 7 9 post-season game superior pitching. Can Yankees continue win Martinez, valuable run producer, sometime single hitter? We've gotten two good series, said Paul O'Neill. The Yankees series. You focus one guy. You focus winning. The whole team won. As much Joe Torre talked Martinez needing one line-drive hit get groove, 30-year-old first baseman career drought post-season. Since joining Yankees, Martinez 20 107 (.187) one homer 4 RBI 29 post-season game. Those puny statistic, especially player driven 381 run 455 regular season game last three year. I would guess Tino would great series, O'Neill said. Baseball way evening thing out. You bad series, come back great series. In season, that's easier do. In post-season, get tougher. It cannot get much tougher Martinez, dropped fifth sixth order American League Championship Series Cleveland Indians remain spot notice. Martinez blamed paucity production impatience trying much. He sometimes flailed poor pitch hitter's count 3-1 2-0, instead working count, admitted previous failure post-season caused pursue obviously unattainable five-run homer. Actually, Martinez already made alteration, reached base 7 time last 10 plate appearance double, single, hit-by-pitch 4 walk. It enough pacify George Steinbrenner, something cling to. Until last night, anyway, Martinez face Kevin Brown, nasty right-hander retired 30 34 career at-bat. If I getting good pitch missing them, I'd say I bad swing working, said Martinez. But I've swinging bad pitch. Right now, I've got patient wait. The Yankees wait him. They to. In 1996 World Series, Torre started Cecil Fielder Martinez first Games 3, 4 5. It difficult decision Martinez paced team RBI Fielder join Yankees July 31. But Yankees grabbed three game worked. Torre attractive replacement season Luis Sojo. So Yankees stay Martinez, better worse, try stay positive finally produce. It's World Series, said Martinez. You got go fun it. Big game big game. You want go enjoy game try best win game. You think might lose day. Chuck Knoblauch Tino Martinez popular squeegee men week ago, speculation rampant one might exiled Yankees' historic year crumbled post-season. Two big hit midst big inning changed Saturday night Game 1 World Series. The Yankees trailed San Diego, 5-2, seventh inning, Knoblauch hit three-run home run tie score, five batter later, Martinez smashed grand slam. The seven-run explosion rocketed Yankees 9-6 victory opener four-of-seven-game series, 56,712 Yankee Stadium. Orlando Hernandez pitch Andy Ashby Game 2 Sunday night Stadium. Beyond seizing advantage series, Yankees able neutralize Padres' ace, Kevin Brown, driving mound seventh. Brown, seen many San Diego's best hope World Series upset, pitch Game 4, earliest. Brown pitching three-run lead top fifth, Tony Gwynn Greg Vaughn banged back-to-back homer. One seventh, however, Jorge Posada hit single, Brown walked Ricky Ledee. Brown, thrown whopping 64 pitch first three inning, went out, reliever Donne Wall came face Knoblauch. This Yankees done season, force starter game middle inning, exploiting middle reliever. Knoblauch, course, earned notoriety gaffe Game 2 American League Championship Series Cleveland, standing waiting interference call ball rolled stop behind decisive run scored. The Yankees came back win series, however; Knoblauch got reprieve talked much experience helped him. Facing Wall one-ball, no-strike count, Knoblauch duck runaway fastball. Two ball, strike. Wall throw strike, Knoblauch swung hard lifted high fly left-field line. Off bat, look like much. But kept carrying, Vaughn drifting back left looking up, see ball disappear stand. Tie game. Yankee Stadium shook. Knoblauch rounded base, crossed home plate thrust arm air, yelling crowd, like hyped Olympic weightlifter successfully hoisted half-ton. He stomped around dugout, helmet on, teammate banging happily. When Derek Jeter singled, nobody really noticed. Wall left game, Mark Langston took over. Paul O'Neill flied out, Jeter advanced wild pitch, Bernie Williams intentionally walked. Chili Davis drew walk. Bases loaded, more, Martinez coming plate, exactly one run batted in first 76 career at-bat league championship World Series game. With count two ball two strike, Langston threw pitch near outside corner thought strike. Instead, Garcia called ball. Langston glared, snapping return throw. Langston Martinez everyone field understood base loaded 3-2 count, Langston would throw player refer cookie tasty pitch middle. Martinez ate cookie. The ball soared upper deck right field, lifting three year post-season misery back Yankees' first baseman, grand slam. The crowd called Martinez dugout again. Like Knoblauch, Martinez pumped arm, later crowd would chant name, Martinez would wave cap. San Diego's lead long gone. The Yankees taken 2-0 lead Brown second inning, forcing throw 32 pitch second. They loaded base single two walk, Ledee, rookie left fielder playing none Torre's left fielder hitting, pulled sinking fastball right field line two out. The fan along foul line stood, waving push ball fair body English, ball landed line, skipping wall two runner scored. The Yankees early edge, jumped Brown, best pitcher mound. San Diego's Chris Gomez led second inning blooper shortstop, ball falling single. Quilvio Veras flied right, Gwynn grounded Gomez took second, bringing Vaughn plate. David Wells got ahead count, ball two strike, change-up fastball, trying run fastball inside Vaughn, hit 50 home run regular season. Vaughn attacked pitch: line drive landed second deck, foul way, frightening mistake. Jorge Posada, Yankees' catcher, jogged mound re-think strategy, perhaps remind Wells conventional wisdom: must pitch Vaughn outer edge plate. Posada returned plate, called outside fastball, Wells threw. Vaughn's swing short quick, ball making click sound bat, like well-struck golf ball, carrying wall right-center field. Tie game. Wells retired first two batter fifth inning, jamming Veras inside fastball. Veras' bat snapped contact, enough send looper short center field, single. Gwynn stepped in, hit single first two at-bat, looked sign third base coach Tim Flannery. With runner first, like try pull ball right side infield. Wells fired fastball, Gwynn turned pitch ripped it, line drive crashed facing upper deck right field. The Padres jumped dugout, celebrating, Wells turned away, disgusted, asking new baseball. He got one, delivered another fastball, Vaughn slugged deep left field stand. Two pitch, two home run, first back-to-back home run allowed Wells since April 30. San Diego led, 5-2, Yankee Stadium silent. It would stay way. The moment truth Chuck Knoblauch came bottom first inning name announced Yankee Stadium first time since neglected chase memorable loose ball last Wednesday. There boo. It warm ovation. They liked him. They really liked him. Knoblauch exhaled. Knoblauch emphasized game concerned winning rumbling World Series, fan. But surely made Knoblauch feel home realized fan forgiven him. Victories, time, healed malice toward Knoblauch could play second base without earplug. When Yankees defeated Indians, 9-5, Game 6 Tuesday night advance second World Series three year, Knoblauch easily relieved player field. The awful mistake made Game 2 would forgotten. The Yankees pennant, Knoblauch celebrating much anyone. To act like toward tremendous, said Knoblauch, response received. It great feeling, really helped out. Knoblauch wearing cap declared Yankees champion American League 1998; Champagne dripped brim spoke. He look up, continued talk learned lot vilified making mistake Little Leaguers expected make. Just face thing take like man answer question, although they're tough, Knoblauch said. You see made bounce back something like that. That's basically I learned. If Yankees lost ALCS, even Knoblauch's teammate said would branded villain failing pursue ball glanced Travis Fryman's back running outside baseline. Knoblauch argued umpire go ahead run scored first Indians won, 4-1. Now Knoblauch watch television read newspaper without getting queasy. That's huge him, David Cone said. That's huge me. I let back game, would tough one would come back beat u. And Knobbie, I'm sure he's feeling lot better now. Knoblauch, two hit five at-bat, working second bottle Champagne five minute reporter allowed clubhouse. He flashed sort smile shown much recently and, Yankees World Series, Knoblauch expect teased often mistake. Maybe go way, we'll that, Derek Jeter said. I know I'll say, I'll think something good. YANKEES Pitching The starting pitching enabled Yankees advance past Cleveland American League Championship Series. David Wells 7-1 career postseason additional edge Padres' lineup generally le effective left-handed pitching. Orlando Hernandez four terrific pitch, pitched seven shutout inning pivotal Game 4 ALCS earned start Game 2 series. David Cone benefit six days' worth rest start Game 3, well able pitch warm Southern California. Mariano Rivera's stuff might good year, Mike Stanton continues dominant postseason pitcher. Reasons concern: erratic Andy Pettitte, need home-plate umpire call strike pitch low away, Jeff Nelson, lost command last brief outing. Offense There sign ALCS offense coming collective slump Chuck Knoblauch getting base consistently, Derek Jeter back driving ball right field middle, Bernie Williams three hit Game 6, Scott Brosius consistent force bottom lineup. But Yankees holes: Chili Davis hard-pressed catch fastball Kevin Brown Andy Ashby, Tino Martinez's postseason funk problem. The Yankees could use contribution Jorge Posada, start Games 1 2 may get chance drive pitch low strike zone, hit power. Defense The Yankees best defense baseball, excellent middle Jeter Knoblauch, third Brosius. Nobody's really taken advantage fact Williams poor arm center field, rest assured Ken Caminiti, Steve Finley Greg Vaughn try. The Indians expose fact Yankees' pitcher trouble preventing baserunners stealing second third base. Baserunning The Yankees run well take extra base, particularly Paul O'Neill, Brosius, Jeter Knoblauch going first-to-third; Williams make mistake. The Yankees probably able steal Kevin Brown, effective slide step, could aggressive Andy Ashby, combination Sterling Hitchcock Jim Leyritz. PADRES Hitting Except Jim Leyritz, one San Diego lineup particularly hot particularly frightening moment. Tony Gwynn consistent usually is, Ken Caminiti Greg Vaughn streaky. But Padres veteran team capable putting ball play, getting runner base moving along, long getting exceptional pitching, that's really need. Quilvio Veras, leadoff hitter, adept drawing walk Steve Finley, become pull conscious last two year, could try take aim right field stand Yankee Stadium. Vaughn's power could factor Yankees' pitcher jam enough keep leaning plate. Pitching Kevin Brown best pitcher series, capable winning three game necessary, Padres manager Bruce Bochy choose start Games 1, 4 7. But point, San Diego need big outing either Andy Ashby Sterling Hitchcock. When Ashby's right, he's hitting corner sinking fastball slider, command suspect, get pounded. Hitchcock used split-fingered fastball great effectiveness right-handed batter first two round playoff, Yankees' left-handed hitter may cause concern. San Diego's middle relief weakest aspect team, Randy Myers Mark Langston left side (the stuff waned). But lead delivered hand closer Trevor Hoffman, he'll keep it. Defense They mostly catch ball avoid mistake, though unspectacular. Shortstop Chris Gomez second baseman Veras adept turning double play, Caminiti Gold Glove third base last year; Wally Joyner good hand first; center fielder Steve Finley extremely quick tracking base hit returning ball infield. Tony Gwynn's range better toward right field line, nearly good ball hit gap. The Yankees able run arm Vaughn left field. Baserunning Veras steal base (24) year, Finley tight spot, well. In general, however, Padres slow, plodding team, though Caminiti Vaughn good going first-to-third, Gwynn make mistake base. PITCHING TO THE PADRES Quilvio Veras: A switch-hitter power right-handed; try pitch down-and-in breaking ball he's hitting right-handed, jam fastball he's batting left-handed. Steve Finley: A left-handed hitter like pull ball. Left-handers like David Wells beat breaking ball low outside. Tony Gwynn: When he's hot, he's impossible. When he's hitting well, anxious early count, fed breaking ball strike zone. Greg Vaughn: Big-time power anything high plate. Because like pull ball, must pitch outer edge, occasionally jamming keep honest. Ken Caminiti: More power right-handed, better hitter left-handed. These day, he's good lowball hitter beat fastball zone. Wally Joyner: With runner base, he'll try jump fastball early count. Is strong hitter jammed. Chris Gomez: Like Derek Jeter, like hit pitch inside out, right field middle. He hit power make mistake breaking ball. Ruben Rivera: An impatient hitter chase pitch strike zone. Carlos Hernandez: Looks first-pitch fastball upper half strike zone. Can struggle breaking ball. Jim Leyritz: No apparent hole right now, hit fastball away. Best bet get ahead count try get chase breaking ball. PITCHING TO THE YANKEES Chuck Knoblauch: Hard thrower like jam fastball stand top plate, get hit often. Derek Jeter: Sometimes tendency chase pitch foot, get ball far enough, hammer ball wall right. Paul O'Neill: The Yankees' best pure hitter, sometimes chase fastball away, particularly one strike. Bernie Williams: A switch-hitter trouble resisting chest-high fastball. When lay them, much better hitter, last game Cleveland series. Chili Davis: Has great eye work pitcher deep count, overpowered fastball belt. Cheats get bat started, making vulnerable off-speed pitch. Tino Martinez: Nothing seems right moment. Is anxious chase pitch strike zone fall behind count, taking advantage mistake they're made. Scott Brosius: A great breaking ball hitter, also drive fastball long way anticipates, Cleveland's Charles Nagy know. Jorge Posada: When batting left-handed, fare poorly splitter, curveballs slider. Ricky Ledee: Like young hitter, tendency expand strike zone chase pitch strike zone falling behind count. Kevin Brown likely attack aggressively. SATURDAY'S PITCHERS Kevin Brown: Best sinking fastball game (91-93) mph, four-seam fastball 95-97 mph throw high strike zone, slider break away right-handed batter, forkball dive 88-89 mph. Holds runner well. David Wells: Aggressive, aggressive, aggressive, challenging hitter fastball. His curveball exceptional, changeup improved. Throw strikes: Allowed many home run (29) walk (29), allowed three-run homer grand slam year. Talk high expectation. It's man Tampa anymore. Knowing baseball well do, everybody Joe Torre family passed ticket divisional series league championship series much parsley plate life. The pressure get World Series, I see people, Torre, Yankees' manager, saying New York went play here-we-are, let's-go-for-it San Diego Padres Stadium Saturday night. Now Yankees Series, Florida-based owner fan see nothing appropriate four victory. Anything le 125 would feel like emptiness. But Yankees different six team already fell bus World Series? The gloom doom six city compare letdown would grip New York owner's insatiable little heart Yanks come short. The three-tiered playoff system practically turned baseball football, survival-of-the-fittest mentality produce one exalted Super Bowl champion league full chump loser, condemned nether world Parcells-like demon kicking sore spot eternity. The World Series used short sweet reward excellence, eight team per league, winner met daylight early October. Even Yankees clubbed poor Brooklyn Dodgers submission again, well, always next year. But 1969, baseball began league championship series, 1995 began two-layered playoff system. The World Series still different, resist babble post-season record flung u hyperactive computer hyperactive broadcaster dozen different network carry baseball. The World Series still competition one league encourages pitcher athlete another league relatively devoid strategy. Somehow playoff leave everybody feeling inadequate. Think it. The Houston Astros going around feeling cannot perform post-season. The Texas Rangers sulking best hitting league could hardly touch Yankee pitching counted. In Chicago, glory winning special playoff wild-card spot Sammy Sosa's 66 home run pre-empted. The city beat Cubs 1969 eastern title held parade Sosa Saturday canyon Lindbergh John Glenn 1969 Mets hailed. Speaking indignity, Red Sox, whose occasional qualification playoff merely signal nothing good come it. In Atlanta, team '90s exactly one World Series, management keep repeating that: The main goal get Series. This recorded announcement. This recorded announcement. This recorded announcement. In Cleveland, fan live phrase Nineteen forty-eight! chanted Indians Bronx Yankees put Indians misery. That leaf Padres team virtually nothing lose. This good, bad. Bruce Bochy, manager, reserve 1984 San Diego World Series team, said: A lot player team said, looking back, wish would little different attitude instead saying, `Hey, World Series.' And year, I think see player playing win. Torre recalled underdog 1996, said Yankees felt could beat Braves. I sure way Padres feel right now, maybe people predicting lot them, I sure themselves, Torre said. I think getting pressure is, Torre added. You want win, getting World Series tough playing 162 game getting post-season fight, bite scratch everything else get here. Torre continued: You think spring training want go win World Series. You want get World Series. Then get there, well, played well enough enough game, course, want win.

Both side amiable emerged two-hour session, little report indicated relatively early departure, compared last three night, interpreted sign crisis imminent peace budget talk. Sunday's discussion focused education President Clinton's request $1.1 billion hire 100,000 teacher, aide said bargainer delve much detail nothing resolved. I think made real progress today, still significant difference area education, said Erskine Bowles, Clinton's chief staff top negotiator, Sunday's meeting. We're going try plow next two day. Asked far apart two side education, Rep. Dick Armey Texas, Republican majority leader, replied: I know. We're together. He said two side made progress, enough. The talk came another day escalated political confrontation congressional Democrats Republicans, painfully aware three week Election Day, tried take advantage static budget situation.

Also resolved host issue little financing ideology, including environmental matter, contraception national student testing. Republicans said president disengaged process, irked said swooping 11th hour pushing education agenda apparently successful portrayal guardian popular topic. Democrats countered Republican-led Congress done nothing year, cast Republicans extremist blocking president's plea money hire teacher modernize school. In fact, Republican bargainer said Saturday night would provide money local government, Washington, could decide money would used. Armey one many castigated president apparent disengagement, indirect reminder Clinton steeped sex scandal facing impeachment inquiry House. The scant number congressional Republicans leave town weekend used House floor press message. What president? asked Rep. Tom DeLay Texas, majority whip. Maybe Martha's Vineyard? Aspen? Camp David? Where president? I bet American people know spent 152 day 283 day year fund raising, traveling vacation. Republicans said Clinton participated 98 fund-raising event far year two event Monday New York, supporting Senate campaign Rep. Charles Schumer, would bring 100.

But high-level budget bargaining concluded Sunday afternoon, side agreed would need extend deadline beyond midnight Monday, temporary financing government expires third time since Oct. 1 start fiscal year. Congressional Democrats struck back Republicans, saying held slack schedule themselves. Rep. George Miller, D-Calif., said Congress session 108 day far year, unusually abbreviated period one consumed month drive hold impeachment hearing president. Most Americans, Miller said, worked 225 day. They say, `Where president?' Miller said. The president waiting budget. This first Congress since 1974 budget, said, referring broad blueprint supposed guide spending. This Congress can't pas seven appropriation bill, said, largely divisive split among conservative moderate Republicans. Struggling meet fourth deadline federal budget, congressional Republicans White House official wrestled Tuesday difference education, politically high-stakes element budget battle. Negotiators ended late-night session without resolving disagreement education, census contraceptive. These among biggest issue still separated two side tried formulate message take home voter Nov. 3 election. On education, issue President Clinton propelled forefront Republicans want appear recalcitrant, side agreed spend $1 billion spend it. The president insists money spent hire 100,000 teacher across country average class reduced 18 student. Republicans, railing Beltway bureaucrat, say local school district decide money spent, whether teacher computer. As two side broke Tuesday night, White House chief staff Erskine Bowles, president's top negotiator, emerged session saying: We deal. We made good progress. The biggest issue, still, 100,000 teacher. He added: There still open issue upon agreement reached, sounded optimistic session scheduled Wednesday morning. I think we've got chance wrapping tomorrow, said. The two side remained apart several ideological matter, including whether allow federal health plan cover contraceptive whether allow plan religious affiliation refuse cover contraceptive religious ground moral ground well. They also split conduct census 2000, one thorniest issue. It one move voter, vital party help determine relative strength Congress. House Speaker Newt Gingrich Bowles met much day speaker's office, shuttling ante-rooms lieutenant giving clue nitty-gritty detail talk. They given another deadline midnight Wednesday wrap $500 billion worth spending item, could easily extend deadline another day two. They missed spending bill place Oct. 1 start fiscal year, providing temporary financing federal government Oct. 9, Oct. 12, Wednesday. Some central issue, like financing International Monetary Fund, nailed down, neither side ready declare final deal element budget package place. We're splitting infinitive, House Majority Leader Dick Armey said approving money IMF. As worked several issue, Republican leader appeared calculating difference party might sour final deal arrives House floor concern Senate floor Senate fewer difference among Republicans White House. Some conservative Republicans said concerned emerging shape final package, particularly element dealing family planning emergency spending. They say president's proposal emergency spending, item peacekeeping mission Bosnia, fixing year 2000 computer bug providing relief American farmer, break limit last year's balanced-budget agreement. The administration said money would come corresponding cut elsewhere budget, conservative say come raiding surplus. If Republican leader cannot count conservative, need support Democrats pas final package. And Democrats Tuesday expressed concern White House position, issue like census apparent compromise Republicans aid farmer. Rep. David McIntosh, R-Ind., leader House conservative, said believed Republican leader ceding quickly White House. He said president appeared getting way issue really seemed winning war public relation. The president getting wants; he's controlling situation, McIntosh lamented. When Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott appears television, McIntosh said, reaction president. Nonetheless, McIntosh suggested could vote final accord. Most conservative holding better deal we're hearing, said, we'll probably give vote see much better alternative happening go down. Others distressed, particularly two contraceptive issue. One would require federal health plan cover contraceptive. The would bar overseas family-planning organization lobbying change abortion law country. Rep. Tom Coburn, R-Okla., said wanted see final language health plan measure. As passed House Senate, allowed health plan religious affiliation decline offer contraceptive coverage; Coburn want plan able refuse coverage moral ground well. The plan cover five specific type contraception. Coburn said wanted two Depo-Provera intrauterine device eliminated coverage said interfered fertilization therefore considered cause abortion. Democrats like Rep. Nita Lowey, D-N.Y., introduced contraceptive plan House, said strongly objected Coburn's position. She said health plan based decision offer profit, moral. The question whether White House insist keeping contraceptive coverage final package oppose moral exception. If administration allows moral exception, could alienate House Democrats. House Democrats also worried direction talk taking census. This always loomed one biggest issue separating Democrats Republicans. The result census help determine future power two political party. But fact two side finally talking indicates covering full range budget matter need resolved. The White House proposed buying time matter financing Commerce, State Justice department five month. The Commerce Department contains Census Bureau. White House official said would put nettlesome issue allowing resolution entire spending package, House Democrats worry would prelude giving Republicans road. Republican leader like idea postponing decision say financing restricted Census Bureau. On several touchy environmental issue prompted repeated veto threat White House, two side appeared opting compromise confrontation, several dispute resolved. But particularly difficult issue remained negotiation. A compromise struck White House Alaskan lawmaker logging Tongass National Forest. But compromise still eluded question building road wilderness refuge connect two community Alaska. A sticking point White House congressional budget negotiator issue 2000 census conducted, White House finding negotiating issue much House Democrats House Republican leader. On Monday, White House negotiator, led chief staff Erskine Bowles, tried determine whether Democrats would accept deal finance six month department State, Justice Commerce, oversees Census Bureau. The deal would put next March contentious issue whether next census would use statistical sampling supplement traditional method counting people. Bowles told group Democrats House Republicans willing give number outstanding issue stalling final agreement budget, digging heel came financing census six month. The Democrats met office Minority Leader Dick Gephardt. The rationale half-year financing next March Supreme Court expected rule whether using sampling legal constitutional. The Supreme Court already agreed review two lower court ruling said sampling would violate federal law. Oral argument case set November. But House Democrats balked idea six months' financing census, arguing even Supreme Court allowed sampling, Republicans would obligation approve money census included sampling. The general feeling among many Democrats even case, would lot le leverage March, especially issue left debated, said House Democratic official insisted anonymity. Democrats contend time press Republicans, want complete work budget go home campaign. Rep. Lucille Roybal-Allard, D-Calif., attended meeting Monday, said, It wa, sort of, are. We've able accomplish great thing, think? We made clear unless census included, along issue, like school construction, deal acceptable. Statistical sampling would allow Census Bureau estimate population difficult count, would largest effect counting African-Americans city black Hispanics rural area, group traditionally undercounted standard mean. Republicans fear, Democrats hope, method would raise count people living traditionally Democratic area, giving party advantage new boundary election district drawn following 2000 census. At Monday's meeting, Democrats reminded administration official Clinton promised would veto legislation restricted Census Bureau's ability conduct accurate census. I can't think way restricts census fully fund it, said Rep. Carolyn Maloney, D-NY. The willingness House Democrats, including Gephardt, press president issue represents realization leverage Clinton, need support coming impeachment inquiry. Gephardt major player now, irony helped make that, said Rep. Christopher Shays, R-Conn., support use sampling census. The Democrats' position also indicates little trust many White House issue. The proposal finance department Commerce, Justice State six month similar one reached last November Bowles House Speaker Newt Gingrich. The idea holding three department hostage census fight would place maximum pressure side work difference sampling. But House Democrats consulted agreement struck later grumbled it. At meeting Democratic caucus Tuesday, Ms. Maloney briefed lawmaker dealing White House declared Clinton promised would hold firm census believed him, participant said. The statement greeted laughter. There certain level suspicion time cut out,said House Democratic official. But I say, much evidence that, time. Struggling meet fourth deadline federal budget, congressional Republicans White House official wrestled Tuesday difference education, politically high-stakes element budget battle. Negotiators ended late-night session without resolving disagreement education, census contraceptive.

But particularly difficult issue remained negotiation. A compromise struck White House Alaskan lawmaker logging Tongass National Forest. But compromise still eluded question building road wilderness refuge connect two community Alaska. House Senate negotiator agreed Thursday require federal health plan cover prescription contraceptive woman, giving unusual victory Capitol Hill advocate abortion right. But future measure doubt attached spending bill includes controversial provision regarding Federal Election Commission. That provision could scuttle spending bill, would finance Treasury Department Postal Service still must approved House Senate. The contraceptive measure would require federal health plan, affect 1.2 million female federal employee child-bearing age, cover five method contraception approved Food Drug Administration use country birth control pill, diaphragm, inter-uterine device, Norplant Depo-Provera. Currently, 19 percent federal health plan cover method. The House Senate approved contraceptive measure earlier year. But opponent abortion furious approval persuaded Republican leader negotiator reopen discussion matter. The cost contraceptive driven out-of-pocket cost health care woman. And many male member Congress seemed persuaded support coverage contraceptive woman, since almost 285 federal health plan cover Viagra, male impotency drug. Thursday, pressure building resolve spending bill Oct. 9, temporary financing government expires, negotiator agreed include contraceptive measure conference report $13.4 billion bill Treasury Department Postal service. Rep. Nita Lowey, D-N.Y., pushed contraceptive measure House, hailed Thursday's agreement first major accomplishment abortion right advocate since Republicans took control Congress 1994. She said negotiator agreed include measure election year want perceived opposing contraception seen rejecting measure passed House Senate. But many Democrats said upset bill contains provision seen interfering independence Federal Election Commission. That provision would require four-vote majority among seven federal election commissioner every four year retain general counsel staff director. The provision aimed getting rid Lawrence Noble, current general counsel, investigated campaign finance practice group like Christian Coalition. The contraceptive measure one four related matter helped stall four spending bill. The three bill stalled part abortion-related matter include agriculture bill, dispute whether federal Food Drug Administration use taxpayer money approve drug like RU-486, induce abortion. The foreign operation bill also stalled whether finance international family planning program may also promote abortion, labor health bill delayed provision would block access minor contraception. Addressing measure insurance coverage contraceptive, Helen Alvarez, spokeswoman National Conference Catholic Bishops, said bill bad policy. She said contraception failed stem number abortion, teen-age pregnancy out-of-wedlock birth. Public-relations-wise, good tactic them, conceded, term social policy, failure. For first time decade, Congress White House negotiated tax spending legislation year budget surplus. The result chaos. The lawmaker never able agree budget resolution framework tax spending bill supposed fit. This happened since congressional budget procedure established 1974. Then, without discipline overall plan, Senate House could pas eight 13 spending bill needed keep government running. So lawmaker stay session week longer hoped. Finally, lumped eight bill together week announced agreement. But way could get far resort gimmick. One designate $20 billion emergency expenditure program cut elsewhere offset new spending. This use one-quarter anticipated budget surplus current fiscal year. Another gimmick extended tax break Individual Retirement Accounts couple income $100,000 $150,000. This actually raise small amount revenue next five year period covered budget accounting make picture considerably worse later year. As hard negotiate budget bad old day budget deficit, say politician involved, exponentially difficult year. At least year past, common goal. As much disagreed policy principle, aiming reduction deficit. This year, member Congress wanted use surplus big tax cut. Others wanted pay national debt. Others wanted spend part medical research, school weapon Pentagon. Others wanted spend large sum highway. Still others wanted continue cutting government spending. And among Republicans. The Democrats idea budget, President Clinton laid marker saving surplus way found shore Social Security system. In budget term, said Robert Reischauer, former director congressional budget office, like end Cold War. There difference well way thing negotiated budget surplus. In 1990, 1993 1995, politician staked career striking budget deal lower deficit, fundamental question divide bitter medicine tax le spending. Republicans, part, opposed tax increase favored cutting spending social program. Democrats wanted raise tax, especially rich, protect social spending. In end, balance carefully drawn. But plenty politician President George Bush, name one lost job process. This year, Democrats Republicans alike claiming victory, burning issue parcel candy. Democrats got money education farm assistance. Republicans got money military extension popular tax break business. Some $20 billion eat surplus really go emergency, like relief victim Hurricane Georges. But much money, like $90 million pay six new helicopter national police Colombia use drug interdiction, designated emergency spending simply way get budget. For politician, new way fun. It hard imagine anyone voted office year's budget. But make easier reach agreement. The big difference principal fight year money all. They involved delicate policy issue like needle exchange, contraception, global warming, immigration census. In Congress, consensus matter. So way policy could set wrap giant spending bill. It may pleasant debate policy money. But probably harder find way split difference. As long surplus last, lack discipline characterized budget-writing year likely continue. This distressing devoted controlling government spending. The temptation, said L. Ari Fleischer, spokesman House Ways Means Committee, grab loot spend it. Some conservative sounded note discord Friday federal spending agreement, also said would probably vote $500 billion package boosted defense spending provided aid farmer. However, one vote package yet, finished. The deal President Clinton Republican leader hailed Thursday broad outline area agreement final portion $1.7 trillion budget, written document. That crafted chairman spending committee aide, said Friday still dispute needed resolved final document could run 3,000 page. For example, still unresolved dispute whether airline create peanut-free zone protect passenger allergic peanut. House Speaker Newt Gingrich member Georgia, major peanut-producing state, fighting proposal, would force airline ban peanut within three row someone allergy. Congress gave midnight Tuesday vote final bill, agreeing President Clinton fifth extension temporary financing keep government open. The budget due Oct. 1, start new fiscal year. The vote initially expected Friday, bill nowhere near written. Only handful top-level bargainer including Gingrich, Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott White House chief staff Erskine Bowles room final deal. Excluded committee chairman head appropriation committee, must write language put deal law. Almost everyone Capitol Hill expects budget pas eventually, biggest defection coming conservative object $20 billion taken surplus address so-called emergency package's failure offer voter serious tax cut. The lag time bill officially closed making conservative nervous member try add provision expand bill already consider overly bloated. And worry hometown pork stuffed bill publicly revealed, voter could put pressure member support it. The election Nov. 3. But several conservative said despite problem, expected support bill anyway. Rep. Mark Souder, R-Ind., said: `Most friend, predominantly activist conservative, split 50-50. If tax cut primary thing, unhappy, many conservative mixed agenda. My position is, hold nose vote yes. We tax cut far much spending I oppose, that's nature compromise. Every member little different focus. Souder said liked extra money defense spending, liked price support farmer. Hog farmer district, whose biggest customer Japan China, hit hard collapse Asian market. Several Republicans said bill seemed skewed favor Democrats. They cited two reasons: Clinton needed curry favor Democrats shore support House vote impeach him, Republican leader feared stood Clinton, might forced government shutdown Republicans would blamed. Clinton buying vote, said Rep. David Hobson, R-Ohio. He sucking liberal Democrats would support impeachment. Rep. WJ. (Billy) Tauzin, R-La., said leader seemed motivated desire avoid political damage incurred partial government shutdown 1995 1996. He also cited president's need placate left adding costly domestic program. The combination lesson learned three year ago scandal president's side yielded inevitable result, budget lean way left, Tauzin said. Still, said would probably support bill. It enthusiastically, said. It holding nose either. I would preferred spend money tax cut. I think would gotten tax cut, scandal. If president caught scandal, probably would followed Dick Morris strategy moved towards center. Gingrich said recognized conservative wary agreement. But sought reassure package served interest. He cited $9 billion increase defense spending. And noted Republicans blocked several item, including needle-exchange program District Columbia, national education testing US. contribution United Nations program pay family planning China, many Congress object China policy coercing abortion forcing sterilization. Gingrich said agreement best could achieved conservative Republican Congress liberal Democratic president. Some conservative especially critical understanding Thursday. Rep. David McIntosh, R-Ind., leader conservative House, denounced bill earlier Great Society type big-spending program. Friday, meeting Republicans, said, Our leadership found bad situation good job. A remained outright hostile bill, much hasty way cobbled together contained. Rep. Joe Barton, R-Texas, said: `I'm voting `no' unless something revolutionary happens Tuesday. I think process give president ability stonewall end hold u ransom. The Republican leadership House Senate good job limiting highway robbery, still gone far beyond spending cap. Also angry rushed endgame Rep. Gene Taylor, D-Miss., took House floor said could support final bill. I'm going urge colleague vote `no,' Taylor said. We stayed long. We stay little bit longer. And I going encourage colleague continue vote given adequate time study measure brought u. Voting mainly party line question become touchstone debate development preservation wilderness, Senate Thursday approved gravel road remote wildlife habitat Alaska. The road, barely 30 mile long, would slice across edge wildlife refuge wilderness area Aleutian Peninsula, would connect isolated village called King Cove long-range air strip town Cold Bay. Without road, backer say, 700 resident King Cove must continue use unreliable air boat service emergency, often risking dangerous wind sea seek medical evacuation Anchorage. Opponents road call project unjustifiable precedent threatens seasonal breeding ground protected migratory bird, say improved air sea service would better alternative. The vote Thursday, 59-38, victory state's congressional delegation. But President Clinton likely veto measure, final outcome may depend whether sponsor insert road proposal huge spending bill likely emerge Congress head home Nov. 3 election. Three Republicans voted bill, six Democrats voted it. The Clinton administration repeatedly warned veto big spending bill contains array anti-environmental provision consideration. Indeed, White House seems itching partisan fight environmental priority. But many Republicans Congress still appear reluctant engage broad fight, willing Thursday cast lot Senate's two powerful Alaskans, Ted Stevens Frank Murkowski, Republicans. A companion bill House, sponsored Rep. Don Young Alaska, also Republican, come floor. Even Sen. John Chafee Rhode Island, leader Republican environmentalist, voted road. Last February Chafee's staff assembled score environmental lobbyist office plan strategy opposing road, environmental advocate said Thursday. They speculated senator changed position deference power Stevens, chairman Appropriations Committee exerts tremendous influence time dozen spending bill final stage. A Chafee aide said Chafee voted reluctantly road Alaska's senator convinced merit. Stevens said angry tone Thursday two-thirds Alaska's land limit development vital health service denied state's resident. We can't use without permission bureaucrat compelled extreme environmentalist, said. They extreme say 330,000-acre Izembek refuge, smallest wilderness Alaska, sacrosanct can't move border 60 foot. But Sen. Dale Bumpers, D-Ark., called road project dangerous precedent. Building road wilderness Alaska, matter short long, would first time nation voted deliberately authorize road wilderness area, Bumpers said. And go road, nobody know going end.

Hog farmer district, whose biggest customer Japan China, hit hard collapse Asian market. ","Whether to use the 1st surplus in decades for a tax cut, to pay off the national debt, or for new initiatives made the 1998 federal budget negotiations chaotic.The Oct 1 start of the fiscal year was extended 5 times.Major issues were census statistical sampling, federal health plan coverage of contraceptives regardless of religious affiliation, and school aid decisions by the federal gov't or local jurisdictions.Other issues included a Federal Election Commission provision, a road through an Alaskan wildlife refuge, and an airline peanut ban.Committees crafted the budget document after broad agreement was reached when 8 bills were lumped together.","In 1998, for the first time in decades, the US budget negotiators faced a surplus.Both sides said this was harder than a deficit situation, but they finally spent $1.7 trillion.The last seven spending bills were the most difficult and finally were merged into one package.Controversial issues included health insurance paying for contraception, control of new education allocations, an Alaskan wilderness road, whether the 2000 census would include statistical sampling, and establishing an emergency fund.Conservatives felt the results favored the liberals, but both sides were satisfied and glad to finish before Election Day and avoid a government shutdown.","Budget negotiations between the White House and House Republicans were delayed on several issues.At issue were provisions that included requiring Federal Health Insurance providers to provide contraceptives to women as Well as a provision to build a road across a wildlife preserve in Alaska.The contraceptive issue faced an uncertain future while Clinton likely will veto the road.There is disagreement also on how to spend the funding on education.This year's budget discussions also have been hampered because it is the first time since budget procedures were established in 1974 that there has been a surplus, preventing agreement on a budget resolution.","After several deadline extensions, Congressional leaders and the White House agreed on an omnibus spending package, the final portion of the $1.7 trillion budget.It includes more money for education and defense, business tax breaks, and farm aid, as well as funds for Colombia to use in drug interdiction.To offset the new spending, the surplus will be tapped for $20 billion, to the ire of conservatives.This year, without the common goal of reducing the deficit, reaching agreement was very difficult.Policy provisions involving the 2000 census, contraception, and the Alaskan wilderness were also tied to the spending package and were hotly debated."

1033,"Microsoft Corp. said material unpublished book two business school professor crucial part defense antitrust trial scheduled begin next week. But judging advance copy manuscript, Justice Department 20 state suing software giant find support argument book well. To cite one example, Microsoft contends industry-standard Windows operating system Internet Explorer browser single integrated product. In suit, government asserts two separate product Microsoft bundled together get unfair edge rival, Netscape Communications Corp., market software used browse Internet's World Wide Web. In Competing Internet Time: Lessons Netscape Its Battle Microsoft, author, Michael A. Cusumano Massachusetts Institute Technology's Sloan School Management David B. Yoffie Harvard business school, quote Microsoft executive saying third version Microsoft's browser integrated Windows. Microsoft hurried first browser offering market, book say, race catch Netscape, took ambitious approach Internet Explorer 3.0, introduced August 1996. In version changed software design use programming module, component, could put together rearragned like building block. In book, Ben Slivka, Microsoft general manager, quoted saying, IE 3.0 key thing componentized browser, He added, We really made Internet Explorer part Windows platform. The timing could legally significant suit government cite evidence request August 1996 personal computer maker wanted load Netscape's browser machine instead Microsoft's browser. Microsoft denied request, insisting browers Windows single, integrated product. Microsoft's legal team obtained early manuscript new book last month, issuing subpoena Netscape executive given confidential copy author review. Microsoft also sought transcript 44 current former Netscape employee interviewed author. A federal judge Boston last week denied Microsoft access research material, company may appeal ruling. The new book, published Free Press imprint Simon &AMP; Schuster, hurried print shipped within day start Microsoft trial Oct. 19. But already, quote Netscape executive leaked out. The author decided send complete manuscript The New York Times three news organization Monday, material could read context. Microsoft intends use material book evidence Netscape's trouble resulted largely misstep rather alleged predatory practice Microsoft. The book detail Netscape stumbled, shifting strategy often running obstacle software development effort. In private antitrust suit, argument competitor worst enemy established defense. But legal expert say defense may well far le effective federal case government seeking court-mandated change Microsoft's business practice rather monetary damage goal plaintiff private case. It seems debate Netscape's mistake total sideshow, said Robert Litan, former senior official Justice Department's antitrust division, Brookings Institution. But Microsoft big legal team, seems working every defense find. The book quote former Netscape executive, Ram Shriram, saying company bungled chance win sizable share browser business America Online Inc. But second-chance deal America Online, leading online service. The government's case focus earlier deal March 1996, America Online chose Internet Explorer preferred browser; bargain Microsoft agreed place startup icon online service main Windows desktop screen prime real estate computing. For book entitled Competing Internet Time, intriguing one central theme Netcape got wedded notion Internet revolution would change everything quickly. Microsoft, contrast, stuck three-year planning horizon enabled company, author write, mesh short-run tactical plan broader strategic view win war. The book quote Steve Ballmer, Microsoft's president, saying, The fact matter customer can't take cataclysmic change every three month. The organization also can't. You ship product quickly. But can't say, `Oh, radically new strategy' every three month. The government's antitrust scrutiny Microsoft, world's largest independent software company, spanned Republican Democratic administration involved hundred government lawyer investigator. But mean example consistent, coordinated public policy. Nor, account, politics. Instead, like software industry itself, government's pursuit Microsoft taken leap, hit dead end evolved way one could controlled predicted back started 1989. It November year, hot afternoon computer-industry convention Las Vegas, Nev., Bill Gates, Microsoft's chairman, looked like he'd dragged news conference senior executive IBM time dominated Microsoft entire computer industry. The two company IBM, leading maker personal computer Microsoft, leader PC operating system software collaborating design marketing new operating system called OS/2. But Microsoft also beginning sell competing product, Windows. The industry trade press full worried articles: system going become new standard? With Gates standing uncomfortably side, James Cannavino, IBM divisional president, said two company wanted clear air. OS/2 future, said. As Windows, added, would remain niche product under-equipped computer. Windows, asserted, would never receive advanced feature OS/2. Gates certainly look happy. But disagree. The news conference got little attention, article deep inside newspaper trade publication. But week later, Norris Washington, senior antitrust lawyer Federal Trade Commission, happened read one article, Byte magazine. IBM Microsoft defined unified vision graphical operating environment, article said, look sort like US. economic model, divided lower-, middle- upper-class product. As Washington saw it, IBM Microsoft colluding divide operating-system market potential violation antitrust law. Soon FTC staff opened investigation Microsoft IBM And since small first step, Microsoft unrelenting scrutiny federal antitrust investigator constantly evolving series allegation charge, month month, year year, last nine year. Now come antitrust trial scheduled begin Monday, multiplicity charge woven thread drawn dozen different investigative inquiry nine-year span. Microsoft, today feared company software business carrying stock-market value nearly $234 billion, present huge highly visible antitrust target. Yet, company's ally ask, What Clinton administration's political agenda going Microsoft? answer seems none. In interview, dozen current former senior antitrust official whether friend government Microsoft say Justice Department's antitrust suit natural outgrowth previous investigation. As politics, official agreed antitrust division operates independent administration's political consideration. Charles Rule assistant attorney general headed antitrust division Bush administration, Washington lawyer serf adviser advocate Microsoft. When I there, Rule said Justice day, White House punctilious term never getting involved whatever decided do. There communication antitrust branch government. Asked believed policy changed Clinton administration, said: Not really. I've seen nothing suggest it. Joel Klein head antitrust division now, interview dealing division's role Clinton administration's technology policy, specifically relating Microsoft case, said: There statutory restriction, practical matter, civil criminal prosecution invariably carried without political contact. Klein said, way example, might discus merger case involving military aviation industry Defense Department Transportation Department. But never White House, said. For significant case, might call White House say `An hour going hold press conference.' The last time interference, added, Dita Beard-ITT case. Mrs. Beard, lobbyist ITT Corp., accused 1972 written memo saying $400,000 donation Republican National Convention gone long way toward settling antitrust suit brought company Nixon administration's Justice Department. The authenticity memo never proved, Mrs. Beard always denied writing it. In case, Klein say, since Watergate, immaculate. In case Microsoft, neither President Clinton Vice President Al Gore ever volunteered comment. In answer question news conference May, suit filed, Clinton said: I taken view I comment matter within Justice Department. At time, I think I depart policy case, even though obviously big impact important sector economy. But I say, based I know date, I confidence way antitrust division Justice Department handled matter. Since then, Clinton said nothing else case, publicly least. And Gore, generally represents administration technology issue, never commented all. In Rule's opinion, administration would foolish involve itself, even politically acceptable so. It would little odd administration push Justice Department suit, said. It would policy mistake political mistake. I would hard pressed explain would that. Taking side highly charged technology world dangerous, particularly since Democrats rely Silicon Valley company political donation support. In fact, present former government official said suit simply natural extension inquiry conducted last nine year. They began FTC. Soon Washington read article Byte, FTC staff opened investigation Windows-OS/2 question. But happened often following year, turn market made initial inquiry irrelevant. Microsoft abandoned agreement IBM, Windows quickly grew industry standard, OS/2 remained cipher. But issue faded, government investigator began looking Microsoft found thing troubled them. In 1991 Washington, still work FTC, informed Microsoft investigation expanded. The agency, letter said, trying determine whether Microsoft using dominant position operating-systems software stifle competition area. That general idea lie heart present suit. One former senior FTC official said commission staff confidence case realized Reagan-era commissioner, approve suit, might different view. We knew commission might difficulty monopolization case, former official said. They brought case year. And fact, 1993 commission voted 2-2 question whether file formal charge. The deadlock served dismissal. Then, month later, Justice Department decided pick case. It farther along case got, recalled Robert Litan, former senior official Justice Department's antitrust division Brookings Institution. Usually case would two three people complaining document, said. But fully researched record. They gave u file briefed u done. The Justice Department lawyer picked thread. The general idea behind inquiry, Litan said, allowed use monopoly operating system cement monopoly area. In 1995, Microsoft government reached consent agreement company promised stop forcing PC maker buy one copy Microsoft operating system every computer sold instead one every computer operating system, MS-DOS Windows, installed. The company also agreed stop tying sale one software product sale another. The charge present suit similar many way. Even agreement, government investigation continued. That year, Justice Department investigator showed office Netscape Communications Corp. first time ask question next line inquiry. America Online complaining, senior Netscape executive recalled, Microsoft bundling Microsoft Network, competing online service, Windows. Once more, market force overtook investigation. The Microsoft Network never grew particularly popular America Online prospered grew. But, surprisingly, new complaint filled void. In May 1995, Anne Bingaman, assistant attorney general headed antitrust division, remarked: We get complaint Microsoft time. We become kind Microsoft complaint center. And take seriously. In 1996, Netscape's first complaint arrived. In letter Justice Department, Netscape said Microsoft using dominance personal-computer operating system force persuade computer maker favor Microsoft's browser, used explore World Wide Web, one marketed Netscape. The next year Justice Department formally charged Microsoft violating consent agreement tying sale Windows installation company's Web browser new computer. It seemed like slam-dunk violation consent decree, natural extension case, recalled Litan, left department then. A Federal District Court judge agreed, Appeals Court panel overturned ruling summer. In meantime, last May Justice Department 20 state attorney general filed new suit Microsoft, scheduled trial Monday. It contends Microsoft engaged bundling, tying predatory behavior similar many way numerous previous allegation investigation last nine year. A good part case Round II case dealt Round I, early 1990s, Litan said. Or, former senior FTC official put it, there's certainly common thread run way here. But year thread twisted, pulled spun hundred different hand. The case United States v. Microsoft Corp., government's aggressive move monopolist almost 25 year, playing century antitrust law broadly worded court ruling ambiguous side citing ruling support opposing argument. Whatever outcome trial, scheduled begin Monday US. District Court Washington, almost certain appeal leave Supreme Court task bringing legal order 100 year clashing antitrust doctrine. The case focus Microsoft's Windows, operating system control 90 percent personal computer sold today. The government say objective curb illegal monopolistic business practice threaten render large part economy vulnerable vicissitude single company. Microsoft asserts case intended give government control feature added Windows. However grand economic stake, legal dispute narrow. The government say Microsoft's contract computer manufacturer company provide access Internet illegally stifle competition. The contract prohibit manufacturer substituting Netscape Communications Corp.'s Navigator browser Microsoft's Internet Explorer. They also prohibit removing Windows main screen, desktop, link site World Wide Web run Microsoft partner. Microsoft's contract company connect people Internet business sell good service Web require favored treatment Internet Explorer Navigator exchange link Windows desktop. In wake lawsuit, Microsoft voluntarily dropped requirement, though could reinstate will. Microsoft say contract legal produce tangible benefit customer, including easier Internet access. The Justice Department say bundling Explorer Windows 95 inclusion browser part Windows 98 amount tying, illegal practice force customer one product purchase another. The contract manufacturer Internet service illegal, government say, intended create monopoly browser market protect Microsoft's existing monopoly operating system. The latter threat key, according Justice Department. Browsers potential, like operating system, act software platform program run. So contract intended drive browser market would also insulate Windows monopoly. Many antitrust expert say problem facing Justice Department court provided clear definition tying clear guideline determining contract illegally exclusionary. Professor Lawrence White New York University, chief economist Justice Department's antitrust division early 1980s, say court treat tying unusual practice fact ubiquitous. No one, said, would challenge right manufacturer tie eraser tip pencil, tire automobile button shirt. His point, shared widely among economist, tying benefit consumer if, example, result product easier use enables company recover development cost. But tying bad lock monopoly power. The court, White say, offered enough guidance distinguishing good tying bad, nub legal dispute. Microsoft say need show bundling Windows Explorer pass might called gross consumer benefit test offer immediate benefit, whether cause long-term damage competition and, therefore, ultimately consumer. The Justice Department say Microsoft's practice must clear higher hurdle: yielding net consumer benefit immediate large enough balance possible long-term harm competition. So test consumer benefit satisfies antitrust law? The simple answer one know sure, side reasonably cite case without fear embarrassment. Consider 1985 case, Aspen Skiing Co. v. Aspen Highlands Skiing Corp., 1951 case, Lorain Journal Co. v. United States. In first, Aspen Skiing, owner three major ski run Aspen, Colo. monopolist year sold ticket cooperation Aspen Highlands, competitor, gave skier access companies' run. When Aspen Skiing unilaterally canceled agreement, rival's revenue shriveled rival sued. The Supreme Court ruled Aspen Skiing violated antitrust law evidence action helped consumer. In Lorain Journal case, local newspaper Lorain, Ohio, refused sell advertising company advertised new radio station. Here, too, Supreme Court ruled exclusionary practice nothing benefit consumer. Indeed, Aspen Skiing, court even forced monopolist business rival, precedent augur well Justice Department, seek force Microsoft install Netscape's browser alongside own. But Charles Rule, legal consultant Microsoft, say case court threw exclusionary practice offered consumer benefit. The court, argues, never pounced practice resulted lower price better product service. Nor court either case call balancing immediate benefit hypothetical long-term harm. Rule argues Microsoft's practice produce demonstrable consumer benefit. Besides, say, unlike action taken The Lorain Journal Aspen Skiing, Microsoft's contract prevent consumer installing Netscape's browser using Web site Microsoft's rival. In truth, though, neither case answered consumer benefit test apply product design. In Jefferson Parish Hospital District No. 2 et al. v. Hyde, another case cited side, Supreme Court 1984 recognized surgeon anesthesiologist provide integrated service. Yet, court said, hospital monopoly power would still allowed force surgical patient use panel anesthesiologist consumer wanted purchase two service separately. That principle could undercut Microsoft's defense functional interdependence Windows Explorer requires bundling. But Microsoft point strong concurring opinion called tougher standard government meet alleges tying. Microsoft also draw support several court ruling allowed IBM change design computer way made hard vendor attach peripheral equipment. But perhaps Microsoft's best argument nowhere government identified single case court explicitly called throwing tied product basis balancing test. The court, Microsoft emphasize, steer clear redesigning technically sophisticated product. The Justice Department's rejoinder note sole purpose antitrust law protect consumer, make sense bless practice provide dollar's worth benefit today but, stamping competition, drive price $1,000 tomorrow. The Justice Department ask court least insist monopolist use least exclusionary mean possible achieve whatever service provide customer. Experts agree court subject Microsoft's restrictive contract Internet company balancing test. But exactly court decide whether consumer helped hurt grab. A balancing test would court weigh immediate benefit consumer one-click access Internet site feature bundled Windows-Explorer package versus harm time diminished competition market browser operating system. But test make good sense theory prove fiendishly difficult use practice. Balancing test impossibly difficult arbitrary, said Rep. Thomas Campbell, R-Calif., former law professor Stanford University. The practical effect balancing hand defendant like Microsoft almost certain victory. Microsoft argues many antitrust expert agree court fact gravitated away balancing test toward simpler predation test exclusionary contract. Under standard, contract illegal intended drive competition thus pave way monopolist raise price later. Microsoft easier time defending charge predation, amount victimizing customer, would defending charge bundled product consumer slightly harm good. The antitrust record, say William Baxter, headed antitrust division President Reagan, littered contradictory, ambiguous sometimes nonsensical verdict. He legal expert agree nothing else, record leaf plenty legal leeway Supreme Court, hear Microsoft case, stiffen spine antitrust law. The legal tool government using assault Microsoft Corp. Sherman Antitrust Act 1890 brief, vague malleable. The combination meant bedrock statute antitrust policy turn toothless powerful year, depending politics economics day interpreted court. Sponsored Sen. John Sherman, Ohio Republican younger brother Civil War general William Tecumseh Sherman, act passed nod popular backlash rise industrial trust oil, steel railroad. Farmers, laborer small-business owner sizable voting group resented trust vehicle concentrated power. But trust, large national holding corporation, viewed many others engine modernization industrialization. Economists time opposed Sherman Act, law Congress passed vaguely worded compromise. No one knew impact would have, one senator, quoted Matthew Josephson's The Robber Barons, explained nearly everyone agreed something must flung appease restive mass. The act's two key provision, Sections 1 2, mention conspiracy, restraint trade attempt monopolize. Yet Sherman Act interpreted Magna Carta competition, never us term. After passed, critic trust derided impenetrable language Sherman Act called Swiss Cheese Act. But early 1900s, political climate changed. The growing antagonism trust, especially income gap widened, tapped avowed trustbuster, Theodore Roosevelt, became president 1901. The Sherman Act always elastic piece social legislation, used attack perceived exploitation aggregation power, said Eleanor Fox, professor New York University Law School. The model trust principal target trustbuster Standard Oil. Shrewdly, Roosevelt made distinction good trust, thrived superior efficiency, bad trust, grew result inevitable economic force unfair business practice. Throughout 1880s '90s, Standard Oil's rival complained company business practice founder, John D. Rockefeller. But year, price kerosene burned light nation's home declined steadily. So Standard Oil, could could reasonably argued, enterprising monopoly. In early 1900s, though, Standard Oil raised price United States prop profit time engaged price war Royal Dutch/Shell Europe, Standard Oil face genuine competition. When consumer hurt Standard Oil monopoly, popular support antitrust action company swelled, encouraged Roosevelt successor, William Howard Taft. The federal suit Standard Oil filed 1906, Supreme Court approved breakup company 1911. Standard Oil Microsoft case, historian observe, common theme. Both dominant company day, Bill Gates, Microsoft chairman, called modern Rockefeller. But presidential involvement real consumer dissatisfaction Microsoft case, said Ron Chernow, author Titan, best-selling biography Rockefeller. And Rockefeller, Chernow added, never went kind honeymoon period widespread public adulation favorable press coverage Bill Gates had. In summer 1995, whiff revolution air Silicon Valley. The Internet offered new deal computing, fresh opportunity entrepreneur try break Microsoft Corp.'s firm grip personal computer software business. Leading challenge Netscape Communications Corp., whose software browsing World Wide Web ignited Internet boom. Netscape chairman James Clark spoke boldly attacking Microsoft head-on. He borrowed imagery movie Star Wars, referring Microsoft Death Star Netscape leader rebel alliance. Microsoft answered vengeance. It dispatched hundred programmer work competing browser poured many million dollar marketing it. It prodded computer maker others distribute browser, folded browser industry-dominant Windows operating system gave browser away free campaign intended cut air supply, senior Microsoft executive described it. But competitor like Netscape encountered Microsoft's force. Microsoft's partner, corporate customer professional investor finance new venture collided it. A close look Microsoft's no-holds-barred push Internet software business offer window way company us market muscle influence behavior virtually every player industry. Some case recounted figure prominently suit brought Justice Department 20 state, scheduled go trial month, charging Microsoft time went far violated antitrust law. Regardless legal outcome, previously unreported detail incident suit example provide complete picture Microsoft action. When Compaq Computer Corp. considered loading Netscape's browser instead Microsoft's personal computer, Microsoft threatened stop selling Windows operating system Compaq. The company quickly changed mind. After Spyglass Inc. began supplying Microsoft early browser technology, Microsoft announced would give away browser free. The timing came rude surprise partner Spyglass. The company lost revenue almost overnight, technology, also licensing company besides Microsoft, suddenly became available free. When America Online Inc., competes fiercely Microsoft's online service electronic commerce division, went shopping browser technology, Microsoft made offer good pas up: If America Online used Microsoft's browser main one million subscriber, Microsoft would give America Online prime placement desktop screen personal computer using Windows. When Intel Corp. began developing Internet software, Microsoft complained. Intel, leading maker microprocessor serve electronic brain personal computer running Windows, pulled back. The chip maker decided lucrative hand-in-glove partnership Microsoft took priority. Microsoft's reach computing become pervasive nearly every year now, Silicon Valley's top venture capitalist meet privately team top Microsoft executive learn company's plan. The goal, one venture investor observed, stay way steamroller. Microsoft adamantly denies broken law similar situation. The company play game business hard, executive acknowledge without apology. Yes, Microsoft say, rival may suffer partner may irritated occasionally. But company insists action guided main corporate goal bringing new technology inexpensively conveniently million people use software. Most people computer industry say living Microsoft's world mean routinely making accommodation it. Microsoft's power emanates near-monopoly market personal computer operating system, master control program run computer. Because owns operating system, Microsoft essential utility information age, said James Moore, president Geopartners Research Inc., technology consulting firm. It act kind gatekeeper pipeline computing innovation, sitting deciding whether help innovation slow down. For month, Microsoft Netscape talked off, circling warily. But event would define unflinching rival meeting June 21, 1995, second-floor conference room Netscape's headquarters Mountain View, Calif. That meeting, according Justice Department 20 state suing Microsoft, high-tech equivalent storied gathering smoke-filled railroad car inspired passage nation's antitrust law century ago. On day, say, Microsoft made Netscape illegal offer divvy market Internet browsing software, collusion pact Netscape rejected. Microsoft reply prosecutor misinterpreting routine meeting software business company never tried divide browser market. Bill Gates, Microsoft's chairman principal strategist, attend Mountain View gathering, consulted telephone Microsoft team. Two people attend June meeting named witness trial scheduled begin next week: Netscape president James Barksdale Daniel Rosen, Microsoft's general manager new technology. In trial, government contend Microsoft presented Netscape all-or-nothing offer, according people questioned federal investigation. Relying heavily note taken meeting Netscape executive vice president Marc Andreessen testimony Barksdale, prosecutor expected assert Microsoft proposal several element, incentive requirement. Microsoft, according people questioned government, would invest Netscape, taking 15 20 percent stake, give Netscape technical information fine-tune Microsoft's operating system Netscape's software would run better Windows. In return, people say, Netscape would give Microsoft seat board, license technology Microsoft, give Microsoft advance knowledge product-development effort make browser next generation Microsoft operating system, Windows 95, shipped two month June 1995 meeting. And Microsoft, people added, always denied used access technology powerful lever business negotiation, offering Netscape preferential access Windows application program interface, APIs, link enable companies' program run smoothly Windows operating system. By turning deal, Netscape, say, would preferred access Microsoft technology threat Microsoft fiercely denies making. Barksdale, Netscape's 55-year-old chief executive, told colleague encounter Microsoft June 1995 damnedest meeting I've ever attended 35 year business. Had Netscape accepted Microsoft's offer, would Microsoft's money endorsement. Netscape would also free sell browser use earlier version Windows use operating system like Apple's Macintosh Unix, powerful system used mainly corporation research lab. But licensed technology Microsoft stepped aside, best could hoped becoming company sale $100 million hoping bought Microsoft, said Clark, former computer scientist Stanford University founded Silicon Graphics Inc., computer graphic pioneer, starting Netscape. We start Netscape that. For company, meeting Microsoft often charged affair. Every computing device keyboard disk drive, every software program game browser, must mesh smoothly Microsoft's Windows operating system. This necessary make computer reliable easier use, also give Microsoft role industry's gatekeeper. And since Microsoft make manner software product beyond operating system, company put uneasy position requiring Microsoft's cooperation able compete it. And software industry, every program rendered digital code 1's 0's, line divide competition cooperation often blurred. The talk line Microsoft-Netscape meeting focused division operating system platform, computer term application program, sometimes called solution, run top operating system. The government suit state sworn testimony, Chris Jones, Microsoft manager attended meeting, admitted Microsoft `absolutely' intended persuade Netscape compete. Microsoft read Jones' testimony differently, evidence mainly company's clarifying position. If Netscape stayed application solution side operating system, two company could partner, Microsoft said. But Netscape tried become player platform space, would compete. Microsoft released portion Jones deposition September evidence government quoted Microsoft manager context. Q. Do recall discussion desire anybody part Microsoft participating able persuade influence Netscape compete? A. Absolutely. But again, persuade sense force persuade sense of, hey, think great business relationship together. Later deposition, Justice Department lawyer asked Jones whether Microsoft executive intended suggest would consequence Netscape business Netscape chose go platform direction described earlier opposed solution direction. Jones replied: The conversation something like following: `We're platform business. We're going invest heavily part platform feel critical technology. That's done deal.' And we're asking them: `What business? Is business platform solution? If platform, we're platform business. We're competing.' Microsoft portrays comment innocuous statement fact. But Netscape, remark could taken warning, threat. This Internet browsing software potential become alternative platform Windows operating system. The browser, sitting top operating system, could supplant Windows main desktop screen users' machine main layer programming starting software application. In addition, Netscape's browser could serve powerful platform distributing running Java, Internet programming language developed Sun Microsystems Inc., Microsoft rival. In technical term, Netscape's upstart platform could replace Microsoft's APIs essential utility computing. Indeed, Andreessen boasted public Netscape's ambition relegate Microsoft's Windows much software plumbing underneath browser. By June meeting, Microsoft certainly viewed Netscape serious potential challenger Windows, corporate crown jewel. On May 26, 1995, internal memo, The Internet Tidal Wave, Gates wrote: A new competitor `born' Internet Netscape. Their browser dominant 70 percent usage share, allowing determine network extension catch on. Netscape's strategy, Gates wrote, move key API browser commoditize underlying operating system. THE BROADER INQUIRY: GOVERNMENT SEES ARM-TWISTING The federal government state recently broadened allegation Microsoft adding evidence tried bully Intel, Apple Computer Inc. company squelch competition. They say like Netscape meeting new evidence fit pattern behavior Microsoft, repeatedly tried limit competition strong-arming competitor partner. One episode fit pattern, prosecutor contend, effort Microsoft pressure Intel shelve development multimedia Internet software limit cooperation Netscape. Intel's main business making microprocessor chip act electronic brain of computer run Windows operating system. Indeed, fortune Intel Microsoft closely aligned two company sometimes referred single, powerful entity, Wintel. But Intel also employ hundred software engineer, mainly Intel Architecture Labs Hillsboro, Ore. And Intel Microsoft partner, also conflict, typically direction pace certain innovation introduced personal computer industry, dominate together. Federal state investigator focused Microsoft's strong reaction work done Intel's software engineer sentiment expressed uncertain term meeting Intel's Santa Clara, Calif., headquarters Aug. 2, 1995. The contentious session attended several executive Intel Microsoft, including Gates Intel chairman Andrew Grove. An internal Intel memo stated Gates made vague threat supporting Intel's competitor livid Intel's investment Internet wanted stopped. Later, Intel pull back multimedia Internet software development. Steven McGeady, Intel vice president attended August 1995 meeting, scheduled appear witness government. Microsoft reply government's account meeting like Netscape Intel fanciful distortion, created using biased selection document witness. The government's case, Microsoft asserts, betrays utter failure accept computer-industry reality Microsoft routinely meet company make sure software equipment work well Windows. Sometimes talk, Microsoft say, go include level cooperation like licensing technology Microsoft investment, company discussed Netscape. In trial, Microsoft expected argue advance browser market result business acumen Netscape's misstep. To document Netscape's error, Microsoft issued subpoena last month obtained unpublished manuscript new book, Competing Internet Time: Lessons From Netscape Its Battle With Microsoft, based hundred interview current former Netscape executive. The book chronicle mistake made Netscape. But author, Michael Cusumano Massachusetts Institute Technology's Sloan School Management David Yoffie Harvard Business School, think Microsoft hardly blameless. Microsoft's take-no-prisoners strategy backfired, inviting retaliation competitor, government even customer, Yoffie said. Emphasizing offering legal judgment, Yoffie added, I think Microsoft could achieved 90 percent without crossing line much did. THE SPYGLASS LINK: REWARDS AND PERILS OF A PARTNERSHIP On April 6, 1994, Gates 20 Microsoft executive gathered daylong retreat far company's headquarters Redmond, Wash. The subject Internet might revolutionize computer software business. Few concrete plan made day, Microsoft executive insist direction set. Our vision outset unite two world Windows desktop Internet, said Steven Sinofsky, Microsoft executive attended meeting. Yet Microsoft badly trailed Netscape browser field. To hasten entry, Microsoft licensed early browsing software Spyglass Inc. Naperville, Ill. The first meeting two company initiated Spyglass April 1994. At time, tiny company eager deal Microsoft. Spyglass selected commercial licensee browser technology developed National Center Supercomputing University Illinois. In summer 1994, Douglas Colbeth, president Spyglass, met Clark Netscape O'Hare International Airport Chicago. The two men talked United Airlines Red Carpet Room, reserved business-class passenger, Colbeth recalled Clark telling him, We're going take Microsoft head-on. At time, Colbeth recalled thinking himself, Great, Microsoft really want license me. Today, noted: Remember, company couple dozen people almost money bank. Netscape Jim Clark, money reputation, big-time venture capital backing Silicon Valley. Netscape different agenda. By July 1994, Microsoft become quite interested Spyglass technology, Colbeth say, two company signed first licensing agreement following December. Microsoft, Colbeth recall, always told would eventually fold browser technology operating system, timing accelerated Netscape's rapid rise. Microsoft initially hoping charge browser, Colbeth said. But Dec. 7, 1995, Gates declared Microsoft would deeply integrate browser Windows would give away. The announcement caught industry, even Colbeth, surprise. At time, Spyglass licensed technology 82 company, including IBM Digital Equipment, use software product licensing revenue stream $20 million year. As result Microsoft's move, Spyglass saw revenue vanish within year, smaller Internet software company went business big customer shifted Microsoft's free browser. Spyglass slashed payroll scrambled new niche software industry replace lost sale, succeeded eventually. Whenever license technology Microsoft, understand someday build itself, drop operating system put business, Colbeth said. THE NONOPTION COMPAQ: SUDDENLY SEES THE LIGHT Well 1996, Netscape's share browser market continued rise, Microsoft made little headway, even though browser free. Industry analyst trade magazine agreed Netscape's browser clear technical leader. In April 1996, Netscape's Navigator used 87 percent people browsing Web, compared 4 percent using Microsoft's Internet Explorer, according Zona Research. So biggest personal computer maker, Compaq, thought made sense give customer Netscape's browser instead Microsoft's. But Microsoft would stand Compaq choice give in. In June 1996, Compaq wanted load popular Netscape browser machine also remove icon Microsoft's Internet Explorer, delivered computer maker Windows 95. Microsoft informed Compaq removed Internet Explorer, computer maker would lose license Windows, said Stephen Decker, Compaq's director software procurement, testimony federal investigator. The ultimatum Microsoft delivered bluntly letter headed, Notice Intent Terminate License Agreement. Faced denied essential operating system, Compaq quickly reversed course kept Internet Explorer icon. Microsoft asserts Windows Internet Explorer single product Microsoft alone defines product. Nothing contract, Microsoft add, prohibits computer maker including competing technology. While cutoff letter Microsoft sent Compaq seems unnecessarily hardball tactic dealing largest corporate customer, Microsoft chief operating officer Bob Herbold insists take one letter one snippet e-mail try portray Microsoft arrogant company unfair. Noting Compaq executive witness Microsoft, Herbold said, We totally dependent tremendous relationship key company like Compaq. At Netscape, however, Compaq episode watershed. That singular act got going Justice Department, Barksdale recalled. Barksdale said regarded Microsoft's tactic forcing Compaq buy browser condition obtaining essential product, Windows operating system, illegal act absolute proof Microsoft monopolist. After investigating incident, Justice Department state agreed Barksdale Microsoft illegally tying sale one product another. Microsoft reply long history adding new feature operating system. And outset, Microsoft say, intended Windows Internet Explorer browser would seamlessly integrated, Windows 98. Thus, Microsoft insists, product-tying violation antitrust law. In separate case, federal appeal court sided Microsoft, upholding principle company could put whatever wanted operating system declare single product. But June 1996, Compaq wanted offer Netscape product instead Microsoft's browser, industry expert viewed browser operating system two different software program. It took long time integration strategy play out, said former senior Microsoft researcher. Back then, integration basically bolting browser onto Windows. THE `BALANCING ACT': AMERICA ONLINE TOSSES IN TOWEL America Online chairman Stephen Case refers dealing Microsoft delicate balancing act. That balance swung sharply fall 1995 spring 1996, Microsoft used lure giving America Online featured place Windows desktop ultimate bargaining chip. To gain access computing's coveted real estate, America Online agreed make Microsoft's Internet Explorer main browser online subscriber, number 13 million. Yet throughout 1995, Microsoft prepared introduce Windows 95, significant improvement ever operating system, Case knocking door Justice Department. His complaint Microsoft going place new online service, Microsoft Network, direct competitor America Online, prominently desktop screen Windows 95, introduced August. This bundling tactic using industry-dominant operating system market Microsoft Network, MSN, Case argued, gave Microsoft unfair advantage young fast-growing online business. The Justice Department listened investigated. But ultimately, government decided taking action. At America Online's headquarters Vienna, Va., Microsoft feared loathed time. America Online designated Microsoft watcher, young MBA. tracked adversary's every move. Above desk small, windowless office picture Gates. Beneath picture, large block letter, word THE ENEMY. Though America Online clear leader online service business, ample reason worry all-out assault rival rich aggressive Microsoft. When visited Microsoft headquarters couple year earlier, Case recalled, Gates bluntly assessed Microsoft's option saying could buy 20 percent America Online, enter online business bury you. A threat merely statement fact? A bit both, Case said recently. But mainly articulating everybody meeting kind intuitively understood. Yet 1996, Microsoft America Online found reason cooperate. With exploding popularity Internet's World Wide Web, conventional online company, like America Online Compuserve, provide customer Internet access well service. America Online browser, keep pace rapidly advancing technology made sense deal Netscape Microsoft. For software company, deal America Online, 5 million subscriber time, could mean big surge browser use market share. Netscape seemed natural partner America Online, since company Microsoft rival. On March 11, America Online announce would buy Netscape technology, standard licensing deal based payment-for-use formula. The next day, America Online announced significant deal Microsoft making browser default technology browser America Online subscriber would use unless specifically asked Netscape's Navigator. To win deal, Microsoft offered give America Online start-up icon Windows desktop precisely kind equal treatment main Windows screen Case asked Justice Department require Microsoft. After agreed Internet Explorer browser, Microsoft allowed u bundled Windows desktop, Case said. It example Microsoft's pragmatic side. The pragmatic decision paramount corporate goal increase browser market share protect mainstay software business. As result, new online service, MSN, would sacrifice important marketing advantage main rival, America Online. It Bill's decision, said former MSN general manager Russell Siegelman, referring Gates. He sent e-mail it. He said think would hurt MSN much. I disagreed him. To Microsoft executive, Gates expressed different view likely impact MSN. He told senior vice president Brad Silverberg putting America Online Windows desktop would amount putting bullet MSN's head, according deposition taken Justice Department. In antitrust suit, government asserts America Online deal show Microsoft used power Windows monopoly give edge browser war Netscape. David Colburn, senior vice president America Online took part browser negotiation Microsoft, witness government. Today, Microsoft overhauled Internet strategy focus mainly building popular special-interest Web site field like travel, personal finance, automobile retailing news. And putting site, along e-mail search feature, all-in-one site us name MSNcom. I still regard Microsoft primary threat, Case observed. Microsoft history getting right long run, there's reason think business well. We always Microsoft's cross hair. THE LESSON: DON'T CONFRONT A STEAMROLLER At Netscape's headquarters Silicon Valley, strategy today one avoiding head-to-head competition Microsoft whenever possible. Don't something Microsoft's path that's lesson learned, observed Clark, Netscape chairman. Silicon Valley's venture capitalist, investor finance many nation's high-tech startup, generally follow Netscape formula day. Yet still leaf ample room prosper. For competing directly Microsoft dangerous, software industry whole engine wealth creation, job generation technical innovation. And ambivalent side venture community's relationship Microsoft. For start-up cannot steer clear Microsoft entirely, favored option bought Microsoft, scooped many fledgling company way acquiring promising technology people. Microsoft understands start-up innovation co-opt start-up innovation better high-tech company, said James Breyer, managing partner Accel Partners, venture capital firm. As Microsoft grown, come seen merely competitor force nature shape business environment, like weather front. Microsoft incredibly pervasive, said Stewart Alsop, partner New Enterprise Associates, venture capital firm Menlo Park, Calif. At board meeting company firm invested, two issue always come up, said: One price company's stock, Microsoft going do. In last year, Microsoft offered guidance almost yearly meeting senior Microsoft executive leading venture capitalist. The meeting part Microsoft's effort improve sometimes prickly relation Silicon Valley. We work hard provide clarity we're going we're going, said Greg Maffei, Microsoft's chief financial officer. Last year's conference took place October Quadrus office building Sand Hill Road Menlo Park, Wall Street high-tech venture investing. Maffei led team five Microsoft executive appeared group 40 venture capitalist, one stood asked question seemed mind many peers: How I invest company stay way steamroller? Maffei, recalled one person attended meeting, stood delivered brief lecture business Microsoft likely avoid. His list included specialized software manufacturing, human resource management, computer-aided design others. But, person noted, broad swath industry appeared designated limit including new software platform might compete Microsoft's personal computer operating system. At one point, Ruthann Quindlen, partner Institutional Venture Partners, leaned Vinod Khosla, co-founder Sun Microsystems partner venture capital firm Kleiner Perkins Caufield &AMP; Byers, said quietly, I guess leaf u washing machine toaster. Following text first two section Sherman Act, passed Congress 1890. As foundation federal antitrust law built, act amended several time elevating crime felony, increasing fine prison term individual setting fine corporation convicted violating it. In case Microsoft, government invoked Sherman Act file civil suit seek change company's business practice, criminal suit seek financial penalty. An Act Protect Trade And Commerce Against Unlawful Restraints Monopolies: Section 1. Every contract, combination form trust otherwise, conspiracy, restraint trade commerce among several States, foreign nation, hereby declared illegal. Every person shall make contract engage combination conspiracy, shall deemed guilty misdemeanor, and, conviction thereof, shall punished fine exceeding five thousand dollar, imprisonment exceeding one year, said punishment, discretion court. Section 2. Every person shall monopolize, attempt monopolize, combine conspire person person, monopolize part trade commerce among several States, foreign nation, shall deemed guilty misdemeanor, and, conviction thereof, shall punished fine exceeding five thousand dollar, imprisonment exceeding one year, said punishment, discretion court. Will matter consumer Bill Gates nice guy? Until last week, Americans thought Gates, chairman Microsoft Corp., genius innovator. A nerd perhaps also self-styled visionary almost single-handedly unlocked power personal computer. Monday, however, Washington courtroom, Justice Department began painting different, darker portrait Gates. In antitrust suit brought department 20 state, man whose company command 97 percent share market personal computer operating system depicted Nixonian schemer go almost length crush competition. Product innovation, suit argues, sufficient weapon Gates. Flashing back forth snippet Gates' videotaped deposition e-mail message sent contradicted testimony, government sought establish pattern threat offer payment Microsoft chairman. It also sought cast Gates obsessed man feared tiny Netscape Communications Corp. potential threat domination market Internet browser, software used navigate World Wide Web. Gates portrayed Justice Department litigator David Boies schoolyard bully ride roughshod computer industry crudeness stark contrast popular image benevolent dictator high-technology guru. According document presented Boies, example, Gates asked America Online executive 1996: How much need pay damage Netscape? This lucky day. The implication, Boies said, amount irrelevant, Microsoft, deep pocket market dominance, make many offer can't refuse needed achieve goal. Microsoft official closely watching market survey hint new image bare-knuckled Gates might detracting company's world-famous brand name, insist public continue draw distinction allegation anticompetitive business tactic company's software. Despite reading press, people judge u product, said Mich Matthews, head Microsoft's corporate public-relations office. Our experience people vote pocketbook. So far, consumer casting positive vote. Last week Microsoft reported quarterly profit $1.52 billion, stunning 58 percent increase level year earlier. Despite record profit, marketing expert say public come view Gates Rockefeller-style robber baron, company brand name may suffer. When company visible chief executive, CEO really driver brand, said David Aaker, brand marketing expert Haas School Business University California Berkeley. There question going affect Microsoft's brand recognition. Already early warning signal, political cartoon newspaper across country bashed Gates last week. One showed holding globe saying, If play way, I'll take ball go home; another portrayed Microsoft chairman standing next henchman dangling someone window Microsoft secretary say caller, I'm sorry, Mr. Gates busy teaching competitor Windows. But industry analyst believe new view Bill Gates know play hardball may bad thing company. The he-said, she-said round e-mail message dragged court case Washington Silicon Valley, Microsoft locked legal battle archrival, Sun Microsystems Inc., viewed little different exaggerated trash talking go professional sport. It's like taking Charles Barkley Michael Jordan say ball court turning something sinister really is, said Paul Andrews, co-author Stephen Manes Gates (Doubleday, 1993). Indeed, evidence darker view Gates company far taken root District Columbia Silicon Valley, computer industry long felt impact Gates' tactic, bitterness distrust Microsoft deep. In rest country, Gates continues enjoy great popularity. Two week ago, speaking crowd almost 7,000 student Indiana University, questioner asked Justice Department's suit roundly booed. BILL GATES, WHIPPING BOY c.1998 NY. Times News Service Is Bill Gates high-tech Machiavelli, Public Enemy No. 1 threat known universe? All three, judging numerous political cartoon popped newspaper across country last week. From Chattanooga Boston, cartoonist took delight demonizing Gates, facing unexpected public relation challenge Microsoft's antitrust trial unfolds Washington. Other cartoon ran gamut predictable (a worker, pointing aquarium large fish gobbling smaller one, saying visitor, Welcome Microsoft's research development department) weird (a dweebish man hunched front computer screen staring words: Our beloved leader, Mr. Gates, attack. Leave possession. Go desert. Await spaceship). And Week One trial. Stay tuned. A federal judge Friday pushed back starting date antitrust trial Microsoft Corp. four day, Oct. 19, also ordering company comply Justice Department's request examine Microsoft's financial record. Microsoft argued allowing army government attorney come make demand make difficult u remain business. But winning assurance government lawyer would make narrow, targeted search record, Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson US. District Court District Columbia ordered Microsoft open database perusal. Microsoft asked trial delayed several month prepare defense said last minute broadening case Justice Department, added new evidence. Last month, government said process preparing trial discovered Microsoft tried persuade Apple Computer market Quicktime multimedia software Windows customer. On Thursday, Justice Department 20 state added two new people witness list testify Microsoft dealing Apple Sun Microsystems. Avi Tevanian, former Apple executive, added witness list part describe Microsoft's proposal, Microsoft denies ever made. The new witness James Gosling, Sun executive led development Java, Internet programming language Microsoft see potential threat company's dominance software market. The government charging Microsoft took illegal step prevent Java gaining wide acceptance. To counter that, Microsoft named two new witness Friday, Robert Muglia, senior Microsoft executive worked Sun, Chris Engstrom, executive handled Microsoft's dealing Apple. At time, John Warden, Microsoft's lawyer, argued new allegation place case. The Justice Department, Warden told judge, trying turn something approximating plenary monopoly case like IBM case. It becomes clearer clearer clearer new filing trying turn broader case, said. You can't bait-and-switch file complaint alleging A, B, C, talk whole alphabet three time over. As result, Warden said, Microsoft wanted, minimum, another two-week delay, even though normal schedule would trial start next year. The judge respond. Instead entered order setting Oct. 19 trial date. Late Friday, Microsoft entered formal motion asking another two-week delay. A response expected next week. The case United States v. Microsoft Corp., government's aggressive move monopolist almost 25 year, playing century antitrust law broadly worded court ruling ambiguous side citing ruling support opposing argument. Whatever outcome trial, scheduled begin Monday US. District Court Washington, almost certain appeal leave Supreme Court task bringing legal order 100 year clashing antitrust doctrine. The case focus Microsoft's Windows, operating system control 90 percent personal computer sold today. The government say objective curb illegal monopolistic business practice threaten render large part economy vulnerable vicissitude single company. Microsoft asserts case intended give government control feature added Windows. However grand economic stake, legal dispute narrow. The government say Microsoft's contract computer manufacturer company provide access Internet illegally stifle competition. The contract prohibit manufacturer substituting Netscape Communications Corp.'s Navigator browser Microsoft's Internet Explorer. They also prohibit removing Windows main screen, desktop, link site World Wide Web run Microsoft partner. Microsoft's contract company connect people Internet business sell good service Web require favored treatment Internet Explorer Navigator exchange link Windows desktop. In wake lawsuit, Microsoft voluntarily dropped requirement, though could reinstate will. Microsoft say contract legal produce tangible benefit customer, including easier Internet access. The Justice Department say bundling Explorer Windows 95 inclusion browser part Windows 98 amount tying, illegal practice force customer one product purchase another. The contract manufacturer Internet service illegal, government say, intended create monopoly browser market protect Microsoft's existing monopoly operating system. The latter threat key, according Justice Department. Browsers potential, like operating system, act software platform program run. So contract intended drive browser market would also insulate Windows monopoly. Many antitrust expert say problem facing Justice Department court provided clear definition tying clear guideline determining contract illegally exclusionary. Professor Lawrence White New York University, chief economist Justice Department's antitrust division early 1980s, say court treat tying unusual practice fact ubiquitous. No one, said, would challenge right manufacturer tie eraser tip pencil, tire automobile button shirt. His point, shared widely among economist, tying benefit consumer if, example, result product easier use enables company recover development cost. But tying bad lock monopoly power. The court, White say, offered enough guidance distinguishing good tying bad, nub legal dispute. Microsoft say need show bundling Windows Explorer pass might called gross consumer benefit test offer immediate benefit, whether cause long-term damage competition and, therefore, ultimately consumer. The Justice Department say Microsoft's practice must clear higher hurdle: yielding net consumer benefit immediate large enough balance possible long-term harm competition. So test consumer benefit satisfies antitrust law? The simple answer one know sure, side reasonably cite case without fear embarrassment. Consider 1985 case, Aspen Skiing Co. v. Aspen Highlands Skiing Corp., 1951 case, Lorain Journal Co. v. United States. In first, Aspen Skiing, owner three major ski run Aspen, Colo. monopolist year sold ticket cooperation Aspen Highlands, competitor, gave skier access companies' run. When Aspen Skiing unilaterally canceled agreement, rival's revenue shriveled rival sued. The Supreme Court ruled Aspen Skiing violated antitrust law evidence action helped consumer. In Lorain Journal case, local newspaper Lorain, Ohio, refused sell advertising company advertised new radio station. Here, too, Supreme Court ruled exclusionary practice nothing benefit consumer. Indeed, Aspen Skiing, court even forced monopolist business rival, precedent augur well Justice Department, seek force Microsoft install Netscape's browser alongside own. But Charles Rule, legal consultant Microsoft, say case court threw exclusionary practice offered consumer benefit. The court, argues, never pounced practice resulted lower price better product service. Nor court either case call balancing immediate benefit hypothetical long-term harm. Rule argues Microsoft's practice produce demonstrable consumer benefit. Besides, say, unlike action taken The Lorain Journal Aspen Skiing, Microsoft's contract prevent consumer installing Netscape's browser using Web site Microsoft's rival. In truth, though, neither case answered consumer benefit test apply product design. In Jefferson Parish Hospital District No. 2 et al. v. Hyde, another case cited side, Supreme Court 1984 recognized surgeon anesthesiologist provide integrated service. Yet, court said, hospital monopoly power would still allowed force surgical patient use panel anesthesiologist consumer wanted purchase two service separately. That principle could undercut Microsoft's defense functional interdependence Windows Explorer requires bundling. But Microsoft point strong concurring opinion called tougher standard government meet alleges tying. Microsoft also draw support several court ruling allowed IBM change design computer way made hard vendor attach peripheral equipment. But perhaps Microsoft's best argument nowhere government identified single case court explicitly called throwing tied product basis balancing test. The court, Microsoft emphasize, steer clear redesigning technically sophisticated product. The Justice Department's rejoinder note sole purpose antitrust law protect consumer, make sense bless practice provide dollar's worth benefit today but, stamping competition, drive price $1,000 tomorrow. The Justice Department ask court least insist monopolist use least exclusionary mean possible achieve whatever service provide customer. Experts agree court subject Microsoft's restrictive contract Internet company balancing test. But exactly court decide whether consumer helped hurt grab. A balancing test would court weigh immediate benefit consumer one-click access Internet site feature bundled Windows-Explorer package versus harm time diminished competition market browser operating system. But test make good sense theory prove fiendishly difficult use practice. Balancing test impossibly difficult arbitrary, said Rep. Thomas Campbell, R-Calif., former law professor Stanford University. The practical effect balancing hand defendant like Microsoft almost certain victory. Microsoft argues many antitrust expert agree court fact gravitated away balancing test toward simpler predation test exclusionary contract. Under standard, contract illegal intended drive competition thus pave way monopolist raise price later. Microsoft easier time defending charge predation, amount victimizing customer, would defending charge bundled product consumer slightly harm good. The antitrust record, say William Baxter, headed antitrust division President Reagan, littered contradictory, ambiguous sometimes nonsensical verdict. He legal expert agree nothing else, record leaf plenty legal leeway Supreme Court, hear Microsoft case, stiffen spine antitrust law. Shortly government filed antitrust suit Microsoft Corp. May, Joel Klein, assistant attorney general charge Justice Department's antitrust division, met Silicon Valley executive. The executive recall telling Klein unless case went beyond Internet browser market, would little effect Microsoft's power stifle competition across computer industry. Klein replied understood computer executive's concern. But said time running short strongest evidence hand involved Microsoft's battle Netscape Communications Corp. market so-called browser software used navigating Internet. This Netscape case, executive recall Klein saying. But five month later, case government bringing trial Monday extends well beyond Netscape browser war embrace described recent court filing broad pattern anti-competitive conduct Microsoft. Netscape, government insists, still prime example pattern one several example. The 12-person witness list Justice Department 20 state suing Microsoft reflects new evidence added case since May. James Barksdale, Netscape's president chief executive, appear first, followed executive representing cross section nation's high-technology company including Intel, IBM, Sun Microsystems, Apple Computer, America Online Intuit. In bringing ambitious, complicated case trial one filed May, government chosen high-risk strategy. The law state new evidence added suit filed, new charge. And so, federal courtroom Washington, U.S.District Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson could decide rule new evidence ranging far afield original suit. But government win broadened case, court-ordered remedy would doubt far tougher Microsoft. In May, government's suggested step amounted equal treatment Netscape's browser Microsoft's browser. But government recently asked judge hold separate hearing remedy, win case. The remedy consideration include basic change Microsoft's business practice perhaps even breakup company intended loosen Microsoft's grip computing. That would precisely kind sweeping reform Microsoft's foe would applaud. The government doubled bet doubled stake, said David Yoffie, professor Harvard business school co-author book, Competing Internet Time: Lessons From Netscape Its Battle With Microsoft. Meanwhile, Microsoft camp, government's strategy dismissed desperate act taken court ruling June threatened undermine antitrust suit. That ruling came separate case, involving interpretation consent decree Microsoft signed Justice Department 1995. In June ruling, federal appeal court said Microsoft could bundle browser industry-standard Windows operating system call one product. The appeals-court ruling would seem undercut assertion government's current antitrust case browser operating system two separate product, bundled together given away effort thwart competition browser market. With appeals-court ruling June, government lost heart case, said Charles Rule, former senior official Justice Department, consultant Microsoft. So taken blunderbuss approach scrambling throw everything find even evidence Justice Department year gun barrel see hit. The June appellate ruling shake prosecution team. But mostly strengthened hand within Justice Department urging case broadened, according people worked investigation. At time, say, new evidence coming investigation moved ahead prosecutor raced meet accelerated trial schedule approved court. Speed priority outset, say. The Justice Department state filed suit May move Microsoft's new operating system, Windows 98, introduced June. While seeking block release Windows 98, government lawyer wanted get the courtroom early possible PC maker computer user adopt latest version Microsoft's Windows operating system, function central nervous system 90 percent personal computer sold. The key allegation, government lawyer note, changed since May namely, Microsoft illegally used market power operating system defend monopoly position try extend new market. But thing wrapped bow time May filing browser, said one person worked case. The real game plan always get broader case. What more, one person noted, prosecution team full strength shortly suit filed. David Boies, renowned courtroom litigator former partner Cravath, Swaine &AMP; Moore successfully defended IBM 13-year confrontation government, named special counsel Justice Department last December. But Boies, left Cravath last year, start working full-time Justice Department mid-April, still finishing private case firm, Boies &AMP; Schiller. The antitrust suit filed May leaned heavily Netscape story, mentioning Microsoft's main rival browser market 130 time complaint supporting memorandum. But also prominently mentioned Microsoft's tactic Sun Microsystems, creator Java, Internet programming language, cited example Microsoft's behavior. It crafted template could added without much stretching, one person involved case said. And so, new evidence piled seemed fit pattern, Klein step step approved widening case, person said. And explains, person continued, evidence hand Justice Department year added case since May; gathering new evidence become apparent older material fit pattern current case. For example, government added contention Microsoft pressured Intel Corp., big microchip maker close partner Microsoft, curb development effort multimedia Internet software might conflict Microsoft's plan.
