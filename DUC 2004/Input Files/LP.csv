1,"Cambodia's two-party opposition ask the Asian Development Bank Monday to stop provide loans to the incumbent government, which it call illegal. Negotiations to form the next government have become deadlocked, and opposition party leaders Prince Norodom Ranariddh and Sam Rainsy be out of the country follow threats of arrest from strongman Hun Sen. Hun Sen complain Monday that the opposition be try to make its members' return an international issue. Hun Sen's rule party narrowly win a majority in elections in July, but the opposition claim widespread intimidation and fraud have deny Hun Sen the two-thirds vote in parliament require to approve the next government. Meanwhile, it says, the old government be hold power illegally. Ranariddh and Sam Rainsy renew their international lobbying campaign against the old government Monday in a letter to ADB President Mitsuo Sato call for the bank to stop lend money to it. We respectfully advise the Asian Development Bank not to provide any new loans to the current regime in Cambodia, the two party leaders wrote. At best the current regime could be consider a caretaker government as it have not be approve by the National Assembly. After a meeting between Hun Sen and the new french ambassador to Cambodia, Hun Sen aide Prak Sokhonn say the cambodian leader have repeat calls for the opposition to return, but express concern that the international community may be ask for security guarantees. There have be reports that there be an attempt to internationalize the return of those members of parliament on the excuse of security problems, Prak Sokhonn said. Some (opposition politicians) have want the United Nations to help guarantee a safe return for them. The U.N. secretary-general's representative office in Phnom Penh provide monitors to opposition politicians after they return to Cambodia to participate in the July election. The monitoring end Sept. 30. Our office have not receive any official request for that operation to be start up again, U.N. diplomat Jonathan Prentice say Monday in reaction to Prak Sokhonn's statement. The opposition have insist that any further talks on the next government must take place outside the country, but the ruling party have reject allegations of intimidation and recently guarantee opposition members' safety inside the country. Diplomatic efforts to revive the stalled talks appear to bear fruit Monday as japanese Foreign Affairs Secretary of State Nobutaka Machimura say King Norodom Sihanouk have call on Ranariddh and Sam Rainsy to return to Cambodia. Less than two weeks after abandon hope that he could influence the parties to reach a compromise, Sihanouk be now strongly interested in preside over a summit meeting of the three party leaders in Cambodia, Machimura said. Cambodian politicians express hope Monday that a new partnership between the parties of strongman Hun Sen and his rival, Prince Norodom Ranariddh, in a coalition government would not end in more violence. Hun Sen and Ranariddh, co-prime ministers in a coalition form in 1993 after a landmark u.n.-sponsored election, often clash over power-sharing and the integration of guerrilla fighters from the crumble Khmer Rouge. Their arguments turn bloody last year when Hun Sen oust Ranariddh in a coup. The prince flee Cambodia and do not return until a few months before elections in July. Hun Sen's Cambodian People's Party narrowly win the polls, but a strong second-place finish by Ranariddh's FUNCINPEC give the royalist party leverage in post-election negotiations. After a three-month impasse, they agree last week to a coalition deal that will make Hun Sen sole prime minister and Ranariddh president of the National Assembly. This will not be a repetition of 1993 because there will not be two prime ministers, say Hun Sen aide Prak Sokhon, who attend last week's summit. When we have two prime ministers, everything move very slowly and decisions be make more politically than technically. Ranariddh say Saturday that the two parties agree to keep the ministries of interior and defense under co-ministers. Senior FUNCINPEC official Ahmad Yahya reveal Monday that it be also agree that the CPP would control the foreign affairs and finance portfolios. FUNCINPEC will take justice and information. The parties be to form work groups this week to divide remain government posts and draft a constitutional amendment to form a new Senate. Hun Sen and Ranariddh be schedule to meet Nov. 23 two days before parliament reopens to review the results of the work groups and give their final approval, Ahmad Yahya said. Their ability to repair their relationship and work together will be the key to a stable coalition. I consider this a remarriage, Ahmad Yahya said. They have to be careful with the way they work and what they say. They will have to compromise to achieve results. Ranariddh's ally, Sam Rainsy, whose party place a distant third in the election, be leave out of last week's deal. Sam Rainsy, a virulent critic of Hun Sen, and his party's 14 other members of parliament have remain outside Cambodia since September amid fears for their security. In a letter to King Norodom Sihanouk release Monday, Sam Rainsy complain that Hun Sen have not respond to his queries on security, make it unsafe for his people to return for the reconvening of parliament. Sam Rainsy say he have be tell by Ranariddh that his party and former Khmer Rouge guerrillas have be implicate by Hun Sen in a rocket attack on the Sept. 24 opening of parliament. Authorities have call it an assassination attempt on Hun Sen. A police general investigate the attack say Monday that likely suspects have be identified, but he would not reveal names or their political affiliation. Cambodia's rule party respond Tuesday to criticisms of its leader in the U.S. Congress with a lengthy defense of strongman Hun Sen's human rights record. The Cambodian People's Party criticize a non-binding resolution pass earlier this month by the U.S. House of Representatives call for an investigation into violations of international humanitarian law allegedly commit by Hun Sen. Events mention in the resolution include Hun Sen's coup last year against his co-prime minister, Prince Norodom Ranariddh, and his violent crackdown in September against anti-government demonstrations. A copy of the resolution have since be submit to the U.S. Senate Committee on Foreign Relations. The CPP would like to launch an appeal to U.S. senators to wisely and realistically consider this draft resolution and give justice to the CPP, Hun Sen and the cambodian people by not approve it, the party say in a statement. It defend Hun Sen's ouster of Ranariddh as a proper response to the prince's attempts at the time to negotiate the defections of senior Khmer Rouge rebels. It also repeat claims that the prince's party have move rebel soldiers into Phnom Penh, a contention that remain unproved. The killings of nearly 100 of Ranariddh's supporters document by U.N. human rights workers in the aftermath of the coup be dismiss by the CPP as mostly fabrications mean to distort the political situation. Ranariddh and his core supporters do not return to Cambodia until a few months before an election in July this year that the rule party narrowly won. Ranariddh and his opposition ally, Sam Rainsy, refuse to accept the election results, allege widespread intimidation and fraud by the CPP. When their claims be dismiss by a Hun sen-friendly court, they rally their supporters into the streets of Phnom Penh. After two weeks of tolerate the demonstrations, Hun Sen order a violent crackdown that result in the deaths of at least four protesters. U.N. human rights workers later discover more than 20 bodies many bearing signs of torture in and around the capital, prompt speculation that the death toll could be much higher. The rule party support the police action in its statement, note that public property be damage by protesters and that grenades be throw at Hun Sen's home after Sam Rainsy suggest in a speech that the U.S. government should fire cruise missiles at Hun Sen. The opposition claim the grenade attack be stag as an excuse to begin the crackdown. The leaders of illegal demonstrations be the ones who must bear responsibility for the consequences derive from the protest, the CPP say Tuesday, refer to the deadly violence as minor incidents. The ruling party also remind the United States that Washington support a cambodian exile government dominate by the brutal Khmer Rouge in the 1980s. The Khmer Rouge be responsible for the deaths of as many as 2 million people during the guerrilla group's 1975-79 rule of Cambodia. After a series of border clashes, the Khmer Rouge be oust from power by an invade vietnamese army that set up a surrogate cambodian communist government later lead by Hun Sen. The rule party accuse U.S. policy-makers of not take timely action to save the cambodian people from the Khmer Rouge. They must not make unjust accusations against those who lead the struggle to liberate the people from genocide, it added. Cambodia's bicker political parties break a three-month deadlock Friday and agree to a coalition government leave strongman Hun Sen as sole prime minister, King Norodom Sihanouk announced. In a long-elusive compromise, opposition leader Prince Norodom Ranariddh will become president of the National Assembly result from dispute elections in July, even though Hun Sen's party hold a majority of 64 seats in the 122-member chamber. Hun Sen's Cambodian People's Party drop insistence on a joint assembly chairmanship share by Ranariddh and party bos Chea Sim, the current speaker. It be one of the main stumbling blocks in months of discord. Instead, Sihanouk announced, the constitution will be modify to create a new Senate, which Chea Sim will head. Chea Sim will still serve as act head of state during the king's frequent absences from the country. The major political crisis in the country have be resolve and the political deadlock face the nation have also come to an end, the king say in his statement. The Senate will initially be appoint by the king. The agreement do not say how many seats there would be, nor how they would be divided. The parties will hammer out details later. Pok Than, one of Ranariddh's negotiators, say the Senate would serve a mostly advisory role to the assembly. The senior Senate leaders will join those of the assembly, the prime minister and the country's top two buddhist monks in a delicate balance of power on the council that will choose Cambodia's next king after Sihanouk dies. The two parties say that the assembly would convene again Nov. 25. The agreement come surprisingly quickly follow Ranariddh's return Thursday from Thailand, where he have be hole up with other opposition figures for weeks amid fears for their safety if they stay in Cambodia. The deal should allow rapid formation of a government between the CPP and Ranariddh's royalist FUNCINPEC to allow international donors and businesses to again operate in the poverty-stricken country, which be in desperate need of aid. It could also hasten Cambodia's entry into the Association of Southeast asian Nations, put on hold last year after Hun Sen depose Ranariddh as co-prime minister in a bloody coup. Earlier, as both sides arrive at the Royal Palace for a second day of meetings, Sihanouk say they have agree in principle to form a coalition and make important concessions. The king, the sole force in cambodian politics able to broker a deal, pressure both sides to reach agreement before he leave Saturday for medical treatment in Beijing. Sihanouk report that Hun Sen respond positively to a request by Ranariddh for five of his key supporters to receive political pardons. All five be convict of political crimes by courts that be widely see as loyal to Hun Sen. The king have powers to grant pardons, but have await agreement from Hun Sen in politically sensitive cases. Former battlefield enemies, the CPP and FUNCINPEC have be at loggerheads since the CPP narrowly win parliamentary elections in July. The vote fail to put an end to instability that follow last year's coup. The CPP fell short of the two-thirds majority need to form a government alone. Ranariddh's party and opposition ally Sam Rainsy hold back their support, claim the CPP win due to fraud and intimidation. The opposition organize protests in Phnom Penh seek Hun Sen's ouster that be violently dispersed. Sam Rainsy, under investigation by a Phnom Penh court for his role in the demonstrations, have remain abroad. His 15 seats in the 122-seat assembly be irrelevant to form a work government. cambodian leader Hun Sen on Friday reject opposition parties' demands for talks outside the country, accuse them of try to internationalize the political crisis. Government and opposition parties have ask King Norodom Sihanouk to host a summit meeting after a series of post-election negotiations between the two opposition groups and Hun Sen's party to form a new government failed. Opposition leaders Prince Norodom Ranariddh and Sam Rainsy, cite Hun Sen's threats to arrest opposition figures after two allege attempts on his life, say they could not negotiate freely in Cambodia and call for talks at Sihanouk's residence in Beijing. Hun Sen, however, reject that. I would like to make it clear that all meetings relate to cambodian affairs must be conduct in the Kingdom of Cambodia, Hun Sen tell reporters after a Cabinet meeting on Friday. No-one should internationalize Cambodian affairs. It be detrimental to the sovereignty of Cambodia, he said. Hun Sen's Cambodian People's Party win 64 of the 122 parliamentary seats in July's elections, short of the two-thirds majority need to form a government on its own. Ranariddh and Sam Rainsy have charge that Hun Sen's victory in the elections be achieve through widespread fraud. They have demand a thorough investigation into their election complaints as a precondition for their cooperation in get the national assembly move and a new government formed. Hun Sen say on Friday that the opposition concerns over their safety in the country be just an excuse for them to stay abroad. Both Ranariddh and Sam Rainsy have be outside the country since parliament be ceremonially open on Sep. 24. Sam Rainsy and a number of opposition figures have be under court investigation for a grenade attack on Hun Sen's Phnom Penh residence on Sep. 7. Hun Sen be not home at the time of the attack, which be follow by a police crackdown on demonstrators contest Hun Sen's election victory. The Sam Rainsy Party, in a statement release Friday, accuse Hun Sen of be unwilling to make any compromise on negotiations to break the deadlock. A meeting outside Cambodia, as suggest by the opposition, could place all parties on more equal footing, say the statement. But the rule party refuses to negotiate unless it be able to threaten its negotiate partners with arrest or worse. Worried that party colleagues still face arrest for their politics, opposition leader Sam Rainsy seek further clarification Friday of security guarantees promise by strongman Hun Sen. Sam Rainsy write in a letter to King Norodom Sihanouk that he be eager to attend the first session of the new National Assembly on Nov. 25, but complain that Hun Sen's assurances be not strong enough to ease concerns his party members may be arrest upon their return to Cambodia. Hun Sen announce a government guarantee Wednesday of all politicians' safety and their right to conduct political activities in accordance with the laws in force. Sam Rainsy, who earlier call Hun Sen's statement full of loopholes, ask Sihanouk for his help in obtain a promise from Hun Sen that all members of the Sam Rainsy Party be free from prosecution for their political activities during and after last July's election. Sam Rainsy, a staunch critic of Hun Sen, be force to take refuge in a U.N. office in September to avoid arrest after Hun Sen accuse him of be behind a plot against his life. The allege assassination attempt come during massive street demonstrations organize by the opposition after Hun Sen's Cambodian People's Party narrowly win the election. The opposition, allege widespread fraud and intimidation, refuse to accept the results of the polls. fear for their safety, Sam Rainsy and his then-ally Prince Norodom Ranariddh lead an exodus of opposition lawmakers out of Cambodia after parliament be ceremonially open in late September. Ranariddh, whose FUNCINPEC party finish a close second in the election, return last week and strike a deal with Hun Sen to form a coalition government. The agreement will make Hun Sen prime minister and Ranariddh president of the National Assembly. The two parties have form three work groups to hammer out details of the agreement, include the establishment of a Senate to be the upper house of parliament. Sok An, represent Hun Sen's party, say Friday that one work group have complete its work on a joint political platform to be implement by the new government. The platform be say to emphasize administrative, economic and judicial reforms, but Sok An would not reveal details, say Hun Sen would announce it when he present his Cabinet choices to the National Assembly. King Norodom Sihanouk on Tuesday praise agreements by Cambodia's top two political parties previously bitter rivals to form a coalition government lead by strongman Hun Sen. In a short letter send to news agencies, the king say he have receive copies of cooperation agreements sign Monday that will place Hun Sen and his cambodian People's Party in firm control of fiscal and administrative functions in the government. The protocol on cooperation between the CPP and FUNCINPEC will certainly bring peace and progress to our nation and people, Sihanouk wrote. Uncompromising enemies just a few months ago, Hun Sen and FUNCINPEC President Prince Norodom Ranariddh agree Nov. 13 to form a government at a summit convene by Sihanouk. The deal, which will make Hun Sen prime minister and Ranariddh president of the National Assembly, end more than three months of political deadlock that follow a July election narrowly win by Hun Sen. Key to the agreement be the formation of a Senate as the upper house of Parliament, to be lead by CPP President Chea Sim, the outgo head of the National Assembly. Sihanouk, recalling procedures use in a past government, suggest Tuesday that he should appoint the first two members of the upper house. The remain senators, he said, should be select by a method agree upon by the new government and the National Assembly. Hun Sen say Monday that the CPP and FUNCINPEC have agree that the Senate would be half as large as the 122-seat National Assembly. other details of the Senate, include how much power it will be give in the promulgation of legislation, have yet to be iron out by the two parties. King Norodom Sihanouk have decline requests to chair a summit of Cambodia's top political leaders, say the meeting would not bring any progress in deadlocked negotiations to form a government. cambodian leader Hun Sen's rule party and the two-party opposition have call on the monarch to lead top-level talks, but disagree on its location. Papa will not preside over any summit meeting between the three parties, whether it be hold in Phnom Penh or Beijing, because such a meeting will certainly achieve no result, Sihanouk write in an Oct. 17 letter to his son, Prince Norodom Ranariddh, leader of the senior opposition FUNCINPEC party. A copy of the letter be obtain Thursday. In it, the king call on the three parties to make compromises to end the stalemate: Papa would like to ask all three parties to take responsibility before the nation and the people. Hun Sen use Thursday's anniversary of a peace agreement end the country's civil war to pressure the opposition to form a coalition government with his party. only those who want to prolong the anarchy and instability prevent efforts to set up a new government, Hun Sen say in a televised speech mark the anniversary of the 1991 Paris Peace Accords. Hun Sen's party win 64 of the 122 seats in parliament in July's national election, but not the two-thirds majority necessary to form a government on its own. Opposition parties lead by Ranariddh and former finance minister Sam Ram Rainsy have refuse to enter into a coalition with Hun Sen until their allegations of election fraud have be thoroughly investigated. International monitors say the election be relatively free and fair. Hun Sen say his current government would remain in power as long as the opposition refuse to form a new one. Ranariddh and Sam Rainsy have remain outside the country since the Sept. 24 ceremonial convening of parliament. Citing Hun Sen's threats to arrest opposition politicians follow two alleged attempts on his life, Ranariddh and Sam Rainsy have say they do not feel safe negotiate inside the country and ask the king to chair the summit at his residence in Beijing. Hun Sen have reject the opposition's reservations, say it would be inappropriate to hold a summit outside the country. Negotiations so far have prove fruitless except for the opening of parliament after a Sept. 22 summit lead by the king. Hun Sen imply Thursday that the opposition fail to follow through on promises make at the summit. If those results be strictly respected, there seem no reason to hold another summit, Hun Sen say in a speech on the anniversary of the 1991 Paris Peace Accords. Sihanouk be reportedly set to fly to Beijing next month to receive medical treatment from his chinese doctors. The 75-year-old monarch suffers from a variety ailments and periodically make extend trips to Beijing. He be diagnose with colon cancer in 1993, but it have since go into remission. In September, thousands of people fill the streets of Phnom Penh to protest against the alleged election fraud. Hun Sen order police to break up the demonstrations. At least four demonstrators be kill by police, but the discovery of more than 20 bodies in the aftermath have prompt speculation that the death tally could be much higher. In his speech, Hun Sen blame the violence on opposition leaders, say the demonstrations instigate social and economic chaos. Cambodia's lead opposition party rule out share the presidency of Parliament with its arch foe Saturday, insist it alone must occupy the top position in the legislative body. dispute over the presidency have be a major stumble block in talks between the two-party opposition bloc and the Cambodian People's Party to form a new government. cambodian leader Hun Sen, who head the CPP, have offer to share the legislature's top job with the royalist FUNCINPEC party of Prince Norodom Ranariddh in order to break the impasse. The prince's party, in a statement date Friday and see Saturday, say such a scenario be unconstitutional. co-sharing anything with the CPP mean surrender full power to them. Furthermore, such a proposal be unconstitutional, the faxed statement said. The royalist party also reject Hun Sen's call to hold bilateral talks, insist that Ranariddh's main ally Sam Rainsy also be included. No party with seats at the National Assembly should be leave out if transparency and a check and balance system be to be use in government, the statement said, add that the Sam Rainsy Party should also be give chairmanship of one of the national assembly's nine commissions. note that FUNCINPEC allow the CPP to hold the presidency despite its win in the 1993 general elections, the statement say it be now its turn to take the post. In the most recent elections, hold in July, Hun Sen's party collect 64 of the 122 parliamentary seats, but be short of the two-thirds majority need to set up a new government. Fearing arrest, many opposition members of Parliament leave Cambodia after the ceremonial opening of the National Assembly on Sep. 24. A series of negotiations to forge a new government have failed. The talks have be complicate by the CPP-FUNCINPEC quarrel over the Parliament's top job. Hun Sen's party recently call on Ranariddh to return to the negotiation table and say it be willing to make an appropriate concession to break the deadlock over form a government. FUNCINPEC have demand from Hun Sen write guarantees for the safety of its members and activities as a precondition for re-entering negotiations. cambodian leader Hun Sen have guarantee the safety and political freedom of all politicians, try to ease the fears of his rivals that they will be arrest or kill if they return to the country. The assurances be aim especially at Sam Rainsy, leader of a vocally anti-hun Sen opposition party, who be force to take refuge in the U.N. offices in September to avoid arrest after Hun Sen accuse him of be behind a plot against his life. Sam Rainsy and the 14 members of parliament from his party have be hole up overseas for two months. But a deal reach between Hun Sen and his chief rival, Prince Norodom Ranariddh, on form a new government last week have open the door for their return. In a letter to King Norodom Sihanouk the prince's father and Cambodia's head of state that be broadcast on television Tuesday, Hun Sen say that guarantees of safety extend to Ranariddh apply to all politicians. His assurances come a week before the first session of Cambodia's new parliament, the National Assembly. Sam Rainsy say Wednesday that he be unsatisfied with the guarantee. He say it contain indirect language and loopholes that suggest he and his Sam Rainsy Party members be still under threat of arrest from Hun Sen's rule party. It should be easy for them to say, `Rainsy and the SRP members of the assembly have no charges against them and will not be arrested,' the opposition leader say in a statement. But instead they make roundabout statements, full of loopholes that can easily be exploit by a legal system that be completely in their control. Ranariddh tell reporters Wednesday that he believe it be safe for Sam Rainsy in Cambodia. Speaking upon his return from a brief stay in Bangkok, the prince say he would soon meet with Hun Sen to discuss the apportioning of ministries in the new coalition government. last week, Hun Sen's Cambodian People's Party and Ranariddh's FUNCINPEC party agree to form a coalition that would leave Hun Sen as sole prime minister and make the prince president of the National Assembly. The deal assure the two-thirds vote in parliament need to approve a new government. The men serve as co-prime ministers until Hun Sen overthrow Ranariddh in a coup last year. I think Hun Sen have get everything. He's get the premiership and legitimacy through the election and recognition from his majesty the king. I don't think there be any benefit for Hun Sen to cause instability for our country, Ranariddh said. The prince also say that his top general, Nhek Bunchhay, would not be give back his previous position as the second-ranking general in the cambodian military's general staff. Nhek Bunchhay's outnumber forces in the capital put up tough but unsuccessful resistance to last year's coup.

The U.S. National Weather Service in Miami say Mitch could weaken somewhat, but warn it would still remain a very dangerous hurricane capable of cause catastrophic damage. The entire coast of Honduras be under a hurricane warning and up to 15 inches (38 centimeters) of rain be forecast in mountain areas. The Honduran president close schools and public offices on the coast Monday and order all air force planes and helicopters to evacuate people from the Islas de la Bahia, a string of small islands off the country's central coast. The head of the Honduran arm forces, Gen. Mario Hung Pacheco, say 5,000 soldiers be stand by to help victims of the storm, but he warn the military could not reach everyone. For that humanitarian work, we would need more than 300 Hercules C-137 planes, he said. Honduras doesn't have them. A hurricane warning be also in effect for the Caribbean coast of Guatemala.

In El Progreso, 100 miles (160 kilometers) north of the Honduran capital of Tegucigalpa, the army evacuate more than 5,000 people who live in low-lying banana plantations along the Ulua River, say Nolly Soliman, a resident. Before bear down on Honduras, Mitch sweep past Jamaica and the Cayman Islands. Rain squalls flood streets in the Jamaican capital, Kingston, and government offices and schools close in the Caymans, a british colony of 28,000 people. The strong hurricane to hit Honduras in recent memory be Fifi in 1974, which ravage Honduras' Caribbean coast, kill at least 2,000 people. Better information from Honduras' ravage countryside enable officials to lower the confirmed death toll from Hurricane Mitch from 7,000 to about 6,100 on Thursday, but leaders insist the need for help be growing. President Carlos Flores declare Hurricane Mitch have set back Honduras' development by 50 years. He urge the more than 1.5 million Hondurans affect by the storm to help with the recovery effort. The county be semi-destroyed and await the maximum effort and most fervent and constant work of every one of its children, he said. In the capital, Tegucigalpa, Mexican rescue teams begin search for avalanche victims. Honduran doctors dispense vaccinations to prevent disease outbreaks in shelters cram with refugees. As of Thursday, Mitch have kill 6,076 people in Honduras down from officials' earlier estimate of 7,000. The numbers of miss drop from an estimate 11,000 to 4,621, Government Minister Delmer Urbizo said. We have more access to places affect by the storm, Urbizo explained. Until now, we have have a short amount of time and few resources to get reliable information. In Nicaragua, around 2,000 people be killed, most of those sweep away when a volcano crater lake collapse a week ago. El Salvador report 239 dead; Guatemala say 194 of its people have be killed. Six people die in southern Mexico and seven in Costa Rica. Aid groups and governments have call for other countries to send medicine, water, can food, roofing materials and equipment to help deliver supplies. In Washington on Thursday, President Bill Clinton order dlrs 30 million in Defense Department equipment and services and dlrs 36 million in food, fuel and other aid be send to Honduras, Nicaragua, El Salvador and Guatemala. The White House also say Clinton be dispatch Tipper Gore, wife of Vice President Al Gore, to Central America on a mission to show the U.S. commitment to provide humanitarian relief. Hillary Rodham Clinton also will travel to the region, visit Nicaragua and Honduras on Nov. 16. She later will stop in El Salvador and Guatemala before continue on to Haiti and the Dominican Republic for a visit that have be cancel due to Hurricane Georges, which strike the Caribbean in October. Mitch, which sit off the Honduran coast for several days last week, destroy scores of central american communities before move northwest. The weakened storm cross southern Florida on Thursday, damage mobile homes and buildings and injure at least seven people. Countries overwhelm by the storm's devastation have only just begin to calculate the damage. Honduran authorities still don't know how many shelters have be set up across the central american country. Surveyors have yet to evaluate roughly 10 percent of the most affected areas the departments of Cortes, Atlantida, Colon and Yoro in the north, southern Choluteca and Valle, and the central department of Francisco Morazan, which include the capital. Numbers still can vary wildly. The estimated number of homeless drop from 580,000 to 569,000 Thursday. Mitch damage or destroy at least 90 bridges on major highways, include most spans on Highway 5, the main north-south route, officials said. Urbizo say Honduran officials hop the scale of need in next-door Nicaragua wouldn't overshadow Honduras' plight. Our problem be that all of the country have be affected, he said. Thursday's relief operations pal in comparison to the scope of the disaster. A total of 14 helicopter relief missions be deliver aid to stricken towns, say Col. Roger Antonio Caceres of the government's Operation Mitch emergency response task force. We can manage with the number of aircraft we have because there be little to distribute, Caceres said. more help be on the way. Mexico be send 700 tons of food, 11 tons of medicine, at least 12 helicopters, four cargo planes and 475 soldiers to help in relief operations. The United States commit 19 Blackhawk and Chinook helicopters, two c-27 aircraft and one C-130 cargo plane. France say it be send 250 rescue workers to Central America, along with a ship load with construction material and equipment. The U.N. World Food Program say Thursday it be divert ships, some already at sea, to rush their cargoes of donate food to Central America. It also be pull food from warehouses at its base in Rome, probably for delivery by emergency relief flights, spokesman Trevor Rowe said. We're try to move food as fast as possible to help people as soon as possible, Rowe said. Searches for the miss continued, and some decomposed bodies, once found, be be bury in common graves. About 100 victims have be bury around Tegucigalpa, Mayor Nahum Valladeres said. In the flood-ravaged Tegucigalpa neighborhood of Nueva Esperanza, Mexican military rescuers load search dogs on their backs and ford a muddy river to look for people believe bury in a 200-foot (60-meter) avalanche that occur last Friday. Dozens of homes be sweep into the river. This be the first place we've be with the dogs, Honduran army Maj. Freddy Diaz Celaya said. From here we'll continue search downriver. concern that crowd shelter conditions could produce outbreaks of hepatitis, respiratory infections and other ailments, the Health Ministry announce an inoculation campaign, especially for children. Doctors volunteer at a shelter housing 4,000 people at Tegucigalpa's Polytechnic Development Institute say they'd heard of the campaign but have yet to receive word or medicines from the Health Ministry. We have to vaccinate the children, say Dr. Mario Soto, who have treat at least 300 children at the shelter for diarrhea, conjunctivitis and bacterial infections. Aid workers struggle Friday to reach survivors of Hurricane Mitch, who be in danger of die from starvation and disease in the wake of the storm that officials estimate kill more than 10,000 people. Foreign aid and pledges of assistance pour into Central America, but damage to roads and bridges reduce the amount of supplies reach hundreds of isolated communities to a trickle: only as much as could be drop from a helicopter, when the aircraft can get through. In the Aguan River Valley in northern Honduras, floodwaters have receded, leave a carpet of mud over hundreds of acres (hectares). In many nearby villages, residents have go days without potable water or food. A 7-month-old baby die in the village of Olvido after three days without food. Residents fear more children would die. The bad thing, the sad thing, be the children. The children be suffering, even dying, say the Rev. Cecilio Escobar Gallindo, the parish priest. A score of cargo aircraft land Thursday at the normally quiet Toncontin airport in the Honduran capital of Tegucigalpa, deliver aid from Mexico, the United States, Japan and Argentina. Former U.S. President Jimmy Carter and his wife, Rosalynn, intend to visit Nicaragua on Friday to learn more about the hurricane's impact, The Carter Center in Atlanta announced. We hope this visit will help call attention to the suffering and humanitarian need this disaster have created, Carter say in a statement. U.S. President Bill Clinton request a global relief effort to help Central America and boost U.S. emergency aid to dlrs 70 million.

First lady Hillary Rodham Clinton add Nicaragua and Honduras to a trip she plan to the region begin Nov. 16. Taiwan say today it will donate dlrs 2.6 million in relief to Honduras, Nicaragua, El Salvador and Guatemala. The four countries be among a dwindle number of nations that recognize Taiwan, which China claim be a breakaway province. Two british ships that be in the area on an exercise be on their way to Honduras to join relief efforts, the Defense Ministry say Friday. It's a coincidence that the ships be there but they've get men and equipment that can be put to work in an organize way, say International Development Secretary Clare Short. Nicaragua say Friday it will accept Cuba's offer to send doctors as long as the communist nation fly them in on its own helicopters and with their own supplies. nicaraguan leaders previously have refuse Cuba's offer of medical help, say it do not have the means to transport or support the doctors. Nicaragua's leftist Sandinistas, who maintain close relations with Fidel Castro during their 1979-90 rule, have criticize the refusal by President Arnoldo Aleman's administration.

3,"Margaret Thatcher entertain former Children dictator Gen. Augusto Pinochet at her home two weeks before he be arrest in his bed in a London hospital, the ex-prime minister's office say Tuesday, amid grow diplomatic and domestic controversy over the move. Pinochet, who have vow to fight attempts to extradite him to Spain on allegations of murder, genocide and torture, have drinks with Lady Thatcher and her husband, Denis, in their home in London's elite Belgravia district four days before he be hospitalize for back surgery perform Oct. 9. She regard it as a private meeting, say Mark Worthington, spokesman for the Lady Thatcher, Conservative Party prime minister from 1979-90. The 82-year-old Pinochet be arrest Friday at a spanish magistrate's request. In conservative government days, Pinochet be welcome on regular visits that include tea with the prime minister. He be the only latin american leader to support Britain in its 1982 war against Argentina to reclaim the Falkland Islands. Pinochet and Lady Thatcher also implement similar brands of right-wing economics. The current visit be Pincohet's first since Prime Minister Tony Blair's Labor Party administration be elect 18 months ago, end 18 years of Conservative Party rule. Chile's ambassador deliver a formal protest to the Foreign Office on Monday, say Britain have violate Pinochet's diplomatic immunity. He arrive last month on a diplomatic passport and be also a senator-for-life in Chile, which protect him from prosecution there. Pinochet's 17-year-rule be mark by torture and other human rights abuses against political opponents in which, the chilean government have said, 4,299 people be kill or vanished. He remain chilean army commander-in-chief until March. The magistrate broaden his charges Monday to include killings of Chileans as well as Spaniards, and genocide for which there be no diplomatic immunity. Chilean Ambassador Mario Artaza, himself an exile during Pinochet's rule, say Chile have a duty to protect a citizen with diplomatic immunity and senator status. We be not protect the dictator of the '70s, Artaza say in a british Broadcasting Corp. radio interview Tuesday. What we be fight for and discuss with the (british) government be the special situation of a senator in our transition who many people do not understand and many people don't like. We're not discuss his record during his period of dictatorship, that the present government do not support at all, add the ambassador. A Chilean specialist in international law be travel to London for further meetings with british officials, Artaza said. Pinochet, expect to be hospitalize for perhaps two more weeks face a long battle through british courts to avoid extradition, question by two spanish judges who instigate the proceedings, and an appearance at London's Bow Street magistrate's court. British Conservative Party lawmakers accuse the Labor government of gesture politics and pander to the party's left-wing. The wife of former Chilean dictator Augusto Pinochet appeal for his release, say he be too sick to be extradite to Spain to face charges of genocide. This be very painful for our family, a tearful Lucia Pinochet tell reporters late Friday outside the private London Clinic, where her husband be under arrest as he recuperate from back surgery. 'I would like to ask for compassion for a person who be very, very, very, ill. Pinochet, 82, have surgery Oct. 9 for a herniated disc, a painful spinal disorder which have hinder his movement. He be arrest Oct. 16 at the instigation of a spanish magistrate seek to extradite him on charges of genocide, terrorism and torture. The spanish warrant cite 94 victims, but could be broaden to include some 3,000 people who be kill or disappear during his 17-year-rule. Chile argue that Pinochet must be release because as a senator he enjoy diplomatic immunity and because he be in poor health. Unconfirmed media reports in Chile this week indicate that Pinochet, who have wear a pacemaker for years and be diabetic, also have a urinary tract infection. There have also be reports that he be suffer from depression. In a separate attempt to block his extradition, lawyers for the former strongman go to court Friday to argue that british police act illegally in accept the spanish warrant. The case resume Monday. Pinochet rule from 1973 until 1990 but remain army commander until last March. Then, he move to congress as a senator for life, as permit by the constitution his regime drafted. The spanish and british governments appear Wednesday to be seek shelter from the political storm brewing over the possible extradition of former Chilean dictator Augusto Pinochet to Spain. Despite everything that have be written, this be not a decision for the british government or the spanish government, British Prime Minister Tony Blair say in an interview publish by a spanish newspaper on Wednesday. In a similar vein, spanish Foreign Ministry spokesman Joaquin Perez say Wednesday: The government should not have any opinion about the extradition. british police, act on an international arrest warrant from spanish judge Baltasar Garzon on Friday, detain the ail general in the London clinic where he be recover from back surgery. The detention and the possible extradition of Pinochet to Spain to stand trial for genocide, terrorism and torture during his 17-year dictatorship be warmly welcome by human rights activists worldwide. But it spark protests from the Chilean government, and fears it could damage economic relations. In 1997, seven years after Pinochet leave power, Spain be the big single investor in Chile, follow closely by Britain. Blair quote in the El Mundo newspaper say that Pinochet's detention be unrelated to his government's so-called Ethical Foreign Policy, apparently ignore pressure from leftists within his Labor party to support moves to prosecute the former dictator. This be about two legal systems unite by an extradition treaty but nobody seem to understand this, he said. Blair add that should Home Secretary Jack Straw would use only strictly legal criteria and act as if he be a judge, should he be require to make a decision on an extradition request from Spain. The tone of the british Prime Minister's first public comment on the issue contrast sharply with Sunday's emotional statement from influential Trade Secretary Peter Mandelson who say most Britons would find diplomatic immunity for Pinochet gut-wrenching. The european extradition convention give Garzon 40 days to present a formal extradition request to the british authorities via the spanish government. But while spanish Prime Minister Jose Maria Aznar have promise his government would rubber stamp the process if it reach his desk, he appear to be hop he will never have to do so. Public prosecutors from Spain's National Court have appeal the judicial investigations into human rights abuses in Chile and Argentina that underpin Garzon's arrest warrant. depend on the result of the appeals it be possible that it (the extradition request) will never reach the government so perhaps the government will never have to pronounce on it, Aznar be quote as say in Wednesday's edition of the Madrid newspaper El Pais. The appeals argue that crimes commit during Pinochet's 1973-1990 dictatorship be none of Spain's business, and should be leave to the Chilean or international courts. A ruling on the appeals be expect next week, and a decision in their favor would nullify Garzon's extradition attempt. Europe's top official say Friday that he hop former Chilean dictator Augusto Pinochet would be extradite to Spain to be try for crimes commit during his 17-year rule. sometimes it should be make clear that crimes, wherever they take place, cannot be leave unpunished, european Commission President Jacques Santer said. Pinochet be detain by british police in London on Oct. 16 by request of a spanish magistrate as a first step toward his extradition to stand trial for genocide and terrorism. The dictatorship cause great suffering and send many citizens into exile, Santer said, refer to the 1973-90 Pinochet regime. Santer be speak to reporters in the northern Spanish city of Oviedo where he be due to receive the Prince of Asturias Prize for social science one of the eight annual prizes name after the heir to the spanish throne. Meanwhile, a spanish newspaper report Friday that Pinochet be not fully aware of his predicament. Daily El Mundo say the ailing retire general's family and aides have be shield him from the details for fear he would fly into a rage that would kill him. Pinochet be detain in the London clinic while recover from back surgery. El Mundo say its reporter accompany Chilean politicians seek his release during a visit to the clinic Thursday. The reporter say he talk briefly to Pinochet's wife, Lucia Hiriart, and daughter Veronica. If Augusto know the truth, he would have an attack of rage and die, El Mundo quote Hiriart as say to others while wait for permission from Scotland Yard to visit her husband on the eighth floor of the clinic. She say she be particularly concerned because he be also suffer from a urinary infection, heart problems and diabetes, the newspaper reported. El Mundo report that the family have ask police guards to stand outside the former dictator's room and keep out of sight. The paper say the room lack television, radio or telephone. accord to the report Pinochet be inform of the arrest order from two policemen, but be convince it be a mistake and that he be protect by diplomatic immunity. Meanwhile, a Chilean television station report Friday that a chilean army officer close to Pinochet tell the former military chief about his situation after fly to London Thursday. TV13 report that the unidentified officer say Pinochet react calmly to the news impart as one soldier to another. Cuban President Fidel Castro say Sunday he disagree with the arrest in London of former Chilean dictator Augusto Pinochet, call it a case of international meddling. It seem to me that what have happen there (in London) be universal meddling, Castro tell reporters cover the ibero-american summit be hold here Sunday. Castro have just finish breakfast with King Juan Carlos of Spain in a city hotel. He say the case seem to be unprecedented and unusual. Pinochet, 82, be place under arrest in London Friday by British police act on a warrant issue by a spanish judge. The judge be probe Pinochet's role in the death of Spaniards in Chile under his rule in the 1970s and 80s. The chilean government have protest Pinochet's arrest, insist that as a senator he be travel on a diplomatic passport and have immunity from arrest. Castro, Latin America's only remain authoritarian leader, say he lack details on the case against Pinochet, but say he think it place the government of Chile and President Eduardo Frei in an uncomfortable position while Frei be attend the summit. Castro compare the action with the establishment in Rome in August of an International Criminal Court, a move Cuba have express reservations about. Castro say the court ought to be independent of the U.N. Security Council, because we already know who command there, an apparent reference to the United States. The United States be one of only seven countries that vote against create the court. The (Pinochet) case be serious ... the problem be delicate and the reactions of the Chilean Parliament and arm forces bear watching, Castro said. He express surprise that the british have arrest Pinochet, especially since he have provide support to England during its 1982 war with Argentina over the Falkland Islands. Although Chile maintain neutrality during the war, it be accuse of provide military intelligence to the British. Castro joke that he would have think police could have wait another 24 hours to avoid have the arrest of Pinochet overshadow the summit be hold here. now they be talk about the arrest of Pinochet instead of the summit, he said. Pinochet leave government in 1990, but remain as army chief until March when he become a senator-for-life. The swiss government have order no investigation of possible bank accounts belong to former Chilean dictator Augusto Pinochet, a spokesman say Wednesday. Weekend newspaper reports in Spain say a spanish judge who order Pinochet's arrest have issue a petition aim at freeze any accounts the 82-year-old general might have in Luxembourg and Switzerland. But government spokesman Achille Casanova say no accounts have so far be freeze in Switzerland and no investigation order have be give to federal banking authorities. Pinochet have be hold at a London clinic since his arrest earlier this month. spanish magistrate Baltasar Garzon be seek his extradition on charges of genocide, torture and terrorism during his 17-year rule which end 1990. On Monday, Switzerland also request Pinochet's arrest and extradition on charges of murder, kidnapping and torture. The move follow a criminal complaint file in Geneva last week by the widow of Alexis Jaccard, a student of swiss-chilean dual nationality who disappear in May 1977. Swiss authorities say the spanish effort to extradite Pinochet should be give priority. A spanish request for legal assistance from Switzerland, make Friday, have be pass on to Geneva authorities. No details have be give of the content of the spanish request. As his lawyers in London try to quash a spanish arrest warrant for Gen. Augusto Pinochet, the former Chilean dictator, efforts begin in Geneva and Paris to have him extradited. In London, where Pinochet have be under arrest in a clinic for the last 10 days, a phalanx of british lawyers argue before the high Court of Justice that the arrest order send from Spain be illegal because the general, 82, be not a spanish citizen. They also maintain that as a former head of state, the general have diplomatic immunity for actions take while in office. His lawyer, Clive Nicholls, say that if a bid to extradite the general succeeded, by the same token Queen Elizabeth II could be extradite to Argentina to face trial for the death of Argentine soldiers in the Falklands war in 1982. On the oppose side, Alun Jones, a british government lawyer act as prosecutor in the case, defend the Spanish warrant, which lead to the general's detention in London. The prosecutor argue that the the right-wing general be responsible for kill at least 4,000 people and have set out to destroy a national group Chilean nationals who do not share his ideological values. After hear the arguments in a court crowd with Chilean exiles in the public gallery, Lord Bingham, Britain's senior judge, say the court be expect to decide the matter on Tuesday. The Chilean air force have send an ambulance plane to Britain in hope of the general's early release. But efforts to prevent that gathered strength elsewhere in Europe. In Geneva, a public prosecutor, Bernard Bertossa, say Monday that he have issue a warrant for Pinochet's arrest in connection with the kidnapping and presumed death of a swiss-chilean citizen in 1977. Bertossa say he have open a judicial investigation in response to a complaint by the widow of the victim, Alexei Jaccard, who be 25 when he be torture in Chile and subsequently disappeared. The prosecutor say he be ask the swiss federal government to seek Pinochet's extradition from Britain to face trial in Geneva. At the same time in Paris Monday, the families of three french citizens, of whom two disappear and one be kill in Chile during the 1973-90 dictatorship, file suit in a french court. In addition, a human rights group in Paris say Monday that it have file a suit with a Paris court on behalf of Anne Marie Pesle, whose father, Etienne Pesle, disappear in Chile in 1973. In Madrid, Baltasar Garzon, the spanish investigating magistrate who first obtain Pinochet's arrest in London, say he have formally request the governments of Switzerland and Luxemburg to block bank accounts hold by the general. Court officials in Madrid say Garzon want any accounts block with a view to their possible use later as compensation to relatives of victims. In London, British officials keep insist that Pinochet's case will be decide by the courts and not politically, yet the issue have stir intense political activity both in Britain and in Chile. Supporters and opponents of the dictator have travel to the London clinic where he be be held. From Chile have come six right-wing senators, the deputy foreign minister, aides and legal experts who file in and out of the private clinic in central London. From Europe have come dozens of longtime opponents of the general who be force into exile after his 1973 coup against the elected Socialist president, Salvador Allende Gossens. The exiles, along with others, stand daily outside the clinic hold up photograph of miss relatives and shout anti-pinochet slogans. On occasion there have be shout matches between the two sides. He be ill, and in a few days he will be 83, Mariano Fernandez, Chile's deputy foreign minister, say after visit Pinochet who have minor surgery for a back ailment. After his surgery on Oct. 9, the general be arrest by Scotland Yard during the night of Oct. 16. The diplomatic and judicial entanglements that ensue now involve at least five governments. The political and legal imbroglio could end if Britain's home secretary, Jack Straw, decide that the general should be release on compassionate grounds because of his age and fail health. last week he say that in exercise his powers under the 1989 Extradition Act, he would consider whether the offenses be of a political character and he would take into account any compassionate circumstances. Britain have defend its arrest of Gen. Augusto Pinochet, with one lawmaker say that Chile's claim that the former Chilean dictator have diplomatic immunity be ridiculous. Chilean officials, meanwhile, issue strong protests and send a delegation to London on Sunday to argue for Pinochet's release. The former strongman's son vow to hire top attorneys to defend his 82-year-old father, who rule Chile with an iron fist for 17 years. british police arrest Pinochet in his bed Friday at a private London hospital in response to a request from Spain, which want to question Pinochet about allegations of murder during the decade after he seize power in 1973. Pinochet have go to the hospital to have a back operation Oct. 9. The idea that such a brutal dictator as Pinochet should be claim diplomatic immunity I think for most people in this country would be pretty gut-wrenching stuff, Trade Secretary Peter Mandelson say in a british Broadcasting Corp. television interview Sunday. Home Office Minister Alun Michael acknowledge Sunday that Pinochet enter Britain on a diplomatic passport, but said, That do not necessarily convey diplomatic immunity. The Foreign Office say only government officials visit on official business and accredit diplomats have immunity. Pinochet have be a regular visitor to Britain, generally without publicity. His arrest this time appear to reflect a tough attitude toward right-wing dictators by Prime Minister Tony Blair's Labor Party government, which replace a Conservative Party administration 18 months ago and promise an ethical foreign policy. However, Michael Howard, a Conservative spokesman and former Cabinet minister, say he be concern that Pinochet be arrest as a result of pressure from Labor lawmakers and lobby groups. Chilean President Eduardo Frei criticize the arrest, say the spanish magistrate's arrest order be tantamount to not recognize Chile's institutions. Spain also live under an authoritarian for 40 years and many of its present institutions be inherit from that regime, Frei say in Porto, Portugal, where he be attend the ibero-american Summit. Would a chilean court be allow to start a trial for abuses that occur under the spanish authoritarian regime (of Francisco Franco)? Frei asked. It be only for chilean courts to try events that occur in Chile. Franco's reign end in 1975. Pinochet's family issue a statement Sunday call the arrest an insult and thank the Chilean government, rightist politicians and the military for their support. In London, police guards be deploy Sunday outside the London Clinic, where Pinochet be believe to still be a patient. About 100 chilean demonstrators please with the arrest gather outside, chanting and waving placards bear faded black and white portraits with the caption Disappeared in Chile. Across the Atlantic, the Chilean capital of Santiago be the scene of duel demonstrations Sunday, reflect the long-standing division of public opinion over Pinochet. The rallies be mostly peaceful, although riot police use tear gas and water cannons on some pro-pinochet protesters try to break through police lines into the british embassy on Sunday evening. No arrests or injuries be reported. The envoy send to London to argue for Pinochet's release, Santiago Benadava, would offer only diplomatic advice, say Chilean Foreign Minister Jose Miguel Insulza. Any legal defense would be up to Pinochet's family. Pinochet's son, Augusto, say the family would hire the best legal team available in London. Several right-wing Chilean politicians, include some who hold posts in the Pinochet regime, also be fly to London to show their support to their former boss. Under extradition laws, Spain have 40 days from last Friday to formally apply for extradition. The final decision lie with British Home Secretary Jack Straw. There be no immediate word on when Pinochet would be questioned. But police sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, say questioning be not expect for a week or two. Pinochet have be widely accuse of run a ruthless regime mark by disappearances and deaths of political opponents. His arrest be prompt by applications last week to question him by two spanish judges investigate human rights violations. One of them, Baltasar Garzon, also want to question Pinochet about the disappearances of chilean dissidents in Argentina. The arrest warrant, however, refer only to question about allegations that he kill Spaniards in Chile between 1973 and 1983. In Chile, seven Spaniards have be identify as miss or dead under the Pinochet regime, include two catholic priests and a U.N. official. accord to a chilean government report, a total of 4,299 political opponents die or disappear during Pinochet's term. Pinochet, commander-in-chief of the Chilean army until March, have immunity from prosecution in Chile as a senator-for-life under a new constitution that his government crafted. He be also cover under an amnesty for crimes commit before 1978 when most of the human rights abuses take place. A delegation of chilean legislators lobby against the possible extradition of Augusto Pinochet to Spain to face trial, warn Thursday that Chile be on the brink of political turmoil. There be a climate of division, confrontation and instability in Chile, parliamentary deputy Alberto Espina tell reporters in Madrid after meet the Chilean ambassador. Pinochet be arrest in London on Oct. 16 at the instigation of spanish magistrate Baltasar Garzon who be seek to extradite the former dictator on charges of genocide, terrorism and torture. In Chile, the detention trigger both celebrations by relatives of victims of Pinochet's 1973-1990 regime and protests from the retired general's supporters. Espina also warn that the issue be damage relations between Chile Spain and Britain. Spain be the big single investor in Chile last year, follow closely by Britain. The deputy arrive in Madrid late Wednesday accompany by the senators Jovino Movoa and Julio Lagos. The delegation be an offshoot of a large group of Chilean parliamentarians currently protest the detention in London on behalf of the opposition parties Independent Democratic Union and the National Renovation Party. Espina, Movoa and Lagos be hop to talk to officials from the spanish Foreign Ministry and other government representatives. All we ask be that Spain stop meddle in our internal affairs, Espina said, argue that Chilean problems should be deal with by Chilean courts. We stop be a spanish colony 188 years ago and we have no intention of become one again, he added. Government spokesman Josep Pique say Prime Minister Jose Maria Aznar have no plans to meet the delegation, the state-owned news agency EFE reported. Aznar have promise his government will rubber stamp a formal extradition request to the british government if ask to do so by the judicial authorities. But the extradition attempt could be annul by legal challenges in Spain well before the deadline for present it in Britain. The deadline be set for November 25th coincidentally Pinochet's 83rd birthday. On Thursday the head prosecutor from the National Court set in motion appeals against several rulings make by Judge Garzon relate to Pinochet's detention in the London clinic where he be recover from back surgery. The court's plenary be expect to meet next week to decide on an early challenge of the spanish judicial investigations into human rights abuses in Chile and Argentina that underpin Garzon's arrest warrant. A ruling that the investigations be outside the jurisdiction of spanish law would make any extradition request difficult. The decision be likely to hang on how genocide and terrorism be interpreted, as these crimes be specifically mention in the spanish legal code. The british and spanish prime ministers say Sunday that the fate of former Chilean dictator Gen. Augusto Pinochet be in the hands of their judicial authorities and they will not interfere. Both myself and Mr. Aznar agree this be not a matter for us to discuss, british Prime Minister Tony Blair said, refer to spanish leader Jose Maria Aznar. I've avoid comment on that judicial process and I don't intend to do so. Aznar make similar comments when he meet journalists on the margin of a European Union summit in this Alpine lakeside resort. Pinochet be under arrest in a London hospital where he'd go for back surgery. He be detain on a warrant from a spanish magistrate seek to extradite him on charges of genocide, terrorism and torture during his 1973-90 rule. The chilean government have urge Britain to release Pinochet on humanitarian grounds, and argue that as a senator, he be entitle to diplomatic immunity. Aznar dismiss reports that the bid to try Pinochet will damage Spain's relations with Latin America. It's important we don't talk nonsense about this issue. This be stupid.

5,"NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) FBI agents this week begin question relatives of the victims of the Aug. 7 U.S. Embassy bombing as well as the seriously injure on request of the U.S. Attorney's office for the Southern District of New York, a U.S. official say Thursday. The blast at the embassy building in downtown Nairobi kill 213 people, 12 of them Americans, and injure 5,400. In an nearly simultaneous bombing of the U.S. Embassy in Dar e Salaam in neighbor Tanzania, 11 people be kill and 85 be injured, none of them americans. The official, who could not be further identified, say the questioning be aim at gather recorded testimony to be use by the prosecution in the pre-sentencing phase of the trials of the six men indict in connection with the attack. Wadih El Hage, Mohamed Sadeek Odeh and Mohamed Rashed Daoud Al-'Owhali be be hold by the U.S. District Court in the Southern District of New York. All three have plead innocent. Fazul Abdullah Mohammed be a fugitive. Saudi exile Osama bin Laden, the allege mastermind of a conspiracy to attack U.S. targets around the world, and Muhammad Atef, the alleged military commander of bin Laden's terrorist organization, Al-Qaeda, be charge in a separate 238-page indictment with murder and conspiracy in the bombings. Bin Laden be believe to be live in Afghanistan. U.S. law provide for the trial in the United States of those charge in terror attacks against American citizens, even if carry out on foreign soil. The United States have obtain new evidence to link the owner of a sudanese factory destroy in a U.S. cruise missile strike last month to a terrorist group back by Osama bin Laden, the suspected mastermind of the bombings of two U.S. embassies in East Africa, accord to U.S. intelligence officials. The evidence, the officials say last week, shows that Salih Idris, the owner of Al Shifa pharmaceutical plant in Khartoum, have have financial dealings with members of Islamic Jihad, an egypt-based group responsible for the assassination there of President Anwar Sadat in 1981. Islamic Jihad, in turn, receives money and sponsorship from bin Laden and have be absorb into his terror network, the officials added. This evidence be uncover after the United States destroy Idris' factory in a missile attack follow the bombing of the U.S. embassies, the officials said. A spokesman for Idris deny the accusations, say Idris have no ties either to bin Laden or to any Islamic terrorist groups. In a statement provide by Tim Pendry, his london-based adviser, Idris said: I have absolutely no relationship with any Islamic terrorist organization anywhere in the world. I have never meet Mr. bin Laden, I have never speak with him, I have never have any financial or business relationship with him, nor knowingly with anyone act as his agent. U.S. officials say they have also receive new reports of an increase in the Iraqi presence in Sudan since the missile attack. Officials say they be not certain what the Iraqis be now do in Khartoum. But intelligence agents previously obtain evidence that the manager of the Shifa plant make frequent trips to iraq, where he visit the head of the chemical weapons program. In addition, a soil sample that the CIA clandestinely take at the Shifa plant show the presence of a chemical use in the production of VX nerve gas, a process use only by Iraq. The new evidence come as President Clinton face attack over his decision to strike the Shifa plant. Some State Department and CIA officials have object to the decision, argue that it be base on tenuous evidence of a connection between the plant and bin Laden. The criticism be also base on the suspicion that the United States have poor data on Sudan, as the CIA station there have be close since 1995 and the entire U.S. Embassy since 1996. In addition, more than 100 intelligence reports from a CIA informer in Sudan be withdraw in January 1996 because they prove to be fabrications. That year a second informer warn of several terrorist threats, include one against Anthony Lake, then the national security adviser, but his reports prove impossible to confirm. Senior administration officials say that at the time of the cruise missile strike they have evidence of Sudan's involvement with bin Laden in a chemical weapons program, but no direct evidence link the Shifa plant directly to that effort. now they say that the new evidence against Idris have confirm their initial suspicions about Al Shifa. At the time of the Aug. 20 cruise missile attack, Clinton administration officials acknowledge, they do not know that Idris own the Shifa factory. The CIA, which have begin to scrutinize the plant 18 months earlier, believe the plant's ownership be irrelevant. What we know about the ownership be that a lot of it couldn't be reliably established, say one senior U.S. intelligence official. Still, after the missile strike, when Idris be publicly identify as the owner, U.S. intelligence begin to investigate his possible connections to chemical weapons and terrorism. A sudanese expatriate who now live in Jidda, Saudi Arabia, Idris, 46, be previously a senior manager of the National Commercial Bank of Saudi Arabia. He buy the Shifa plant in March. Officials say U.S. intelligence have receive reports that Idris launders money for international Islamic groups, and that he also have a stake in a company in Sudan that be 40 percent own by the Military Industrial Corporation, a government entity that the United States say controls sudanese chemical weapons development. Bin Laden have help finance the Military Industrial Corp. in his effort to use Sudan as a base for chemical weapons production, and talk to sudanese leaders about test poisonous gases against U.S. troops in Saudi Arabia, accord to U.S. intelligence. But Pendry deny that Idris own any businesses with the Military Industrial Corp. U.S. intelligence officials decline to provide details about the reports of Idris' financial dealings with members of Islamic Jihad. But they say that Islamic Jihad have now be consolidate into bin Laden's terrorist campaign. Police arrest two journalists and charge them with write articles to encourage Muslim youths to stage an Islamic revolution in Bangladesh after the Taliban model in Afghanistan, a police officer say Thursday. Mufti Abdul Hye and Manzoor Ahmed, editors at Jago Mujahid or wake Up Mujahid, a monthy magazine publish from Dhaka, the Bangladeshi capital, be jail for a month shortly after their arrest on Wednesday. They be arrest under a 1974 law that allow police to detain any one for offenses relate to national security, the officer say on condition of anonymity. Those arrest need not be take to court for trial for up to three months. Police seize copies of the newspaper for reproduce a foreign newspaper interview of afghanistan-based Saudi billionaire Osama Bin Laden, who have be accuse by the United States of mastermind bomb attacks on the U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania in August. Under Taliban rules women may not study or work outside their houses, and all kinds of light entertainment include music be banned. Men must grow beards of a certain length and criminals be subject to amputations and public executions even though Bangladesh be a predominantly Muslim country, it be govern by secular laws. Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina's liberal government hasn't recognize the taliban government in Afghanistan. Albania say it have uncover a terrorist network operate by Osama Bin Laden, the Islamic fundamentalist accuse of mastermind the August embassy bombings in Africa, and that it's members have infiltrate other parts of Europe, The Sunday Times reported. The newspaper quote Fatos Klosi, the head of Shik, the albanian intelligence service, as say that Bin Laden's network have send units to fight in Kosovo, the neighboring serbian province. Egyptians, Saudi Arabians, Algerians, Tunisians, Sudanese and Kuwaitis they come from several different organizations, Klosi be quote as tell The Sunday Times. He say he believe terrorists have already infiltrate other parts of Europe from bases in Albania through a traffic in illegal immigrants, who have be smuggle across the Mediterranean to Italy in huge numbers. Interpol believe more than 100,000 blank albanian passports be steal in riots last year, provide ample opportunity for terrorists to acquire false papers, the newspaper said. Apparent confirmation of the Bin Laden's activities come earlier this month during the murder trial of Claude Kader, 27, a french national and self-confessed member of Bin Laden's Albanian network, the newspaper said. Kader claim during the trial that he have visit Albania to recruit and arm fighters for Kosovo, and that four of his associates be still at large. Bin Laden be believe to have establish an albanian operation in 1994 after tell the government that he be head of a wealthy Saudi humanitarian agency wish to help in Albania, the newspaper reported. MUNICH, Germany (AP) U.S. prosecutors have ask for a 20-day extension to provide Germany with paperwork necessary to extradite a top lieutenant of Saudi terrorist suspect Osama bin Laden, officials say Saturday. Mamdouh Mahmud Salim, 40, of Sudan, have be jail since his arrest near Munich on Sept. 16 by bavarian authorities act on a U.S. warrant. Under german law, U.S. officials have 40 days after the arrest to turn over support evidence so a german court can rule on their extradition request. A bavarian Justice Ministry spokesman, Gerhard Zierl, say U.S. authorities a few days ago ask the court hear the case for an extra 20 days to provide the necessary material. quote unidentified bavarian law enforcement sources, Focus newsmagazine report Saturday that the evidence turn over so far be not very strong. The magazine say much of it be base on the testimony of an FBI informant, a former bin Laden associate, who make only vague connections between Salim and terrorist activities. Zierl decline to comment on the report, but say U.S. authorities probably ask for more time just a precautionary measure. U.S. authorities charge Salim help finance, train and arm members of a terrorist organization, include the alleged bombers of the U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania. A criminal complaint unseal Sept. 25 in U.S. District Court in New York charge him with murder conspiracy and use of weapons of mass destruction. Sometime in the summer of 1997, an operative for Osama bin Laden sit down at his personal computer in a hideaway in Kenya. He be worried, he write in an angry dispatch, about the security of the East Africa network of bin Laden, the Saudi exile accuse of mastermind a worldwide terrorist conspiracy against Americans. The organization, the author complained, have declare war against the United States, yet he have learn of that only from the news media. The writer, who federal authorities believe be Haroun Fazil, who be to become one of the central suspects in the bombing of the U.S. Embassy in Nairobi a year later, note with alarm british press reports about the arrest of an aide to bin Laden. Striking almost bureaucratic tones, he say he be worry that an important man with close links to bin Laden, seem to have fall into the enemy's hands. He say the Americans be breathe down the necks of his associates in Nairobi and that he have to take precautions. The cell be at 100 percent danger, the operative warned. The letter, an extraordinary bit of digital evidence in a cloak-and-dagger case, be retrieve from a computer in a house where Fazil have be staying, accord to papers file in U.S. District Court in New York City. The papers say the computer be seize in August 1997 in a raid by Kenyan authorities that be attend by an FBI agent. The documents do not make clear whether the FBI have translate and read the document before or after the bombings of the U.S. Embassies in Nairobi and Dar es Salaam, Tanzania, on Aug. 7 of this year. The timing be potentially important because there have be mount questions since the bombings about whether the United States adequately follow up warnings of a possible terrorist attack on american targets in Kenya. Officials of the FBI and the U.S. attorney's office in New York City refuse to say Tuesday night at what point FBI agents learn of the computer file, nor would they make any other comment. Fazil elude american investigators after the bombing as he travel from Kenya to his home in the Comoros Islands and then to the Middle East. He remain a fugitive. The dispatch provide a remarkable insight into the workings of a terrorist network in the twilight of the 20th century. The author talks of how he and his fellow operatives follow events on CNN and use the Internet to communicate. He refer to himself as the media information officer of the East Africa cell and complain that he be not be keep in the loop on big decisions. Along the way, in an almost casual fashion, the document seem to confirm two of the central charges of the federal case against bin Laden: That he have plant a terrorist cell in Nairobi and that his operatives carry out another of the crimes lay at bin Laden's door by federal authorities the attacks on american soldiers in Somalia in 1993 and 1994. The writer of the document warn that the followers of bin Laden, whom he refer to as the sheik, have become America's primary target. He say his comrades in East Africa should know that there be an american-kenyan-egyptian intelligence activity in Nairobi aim to identify the names and residences of the members who be associate with the sheik since America know well that the youth who live in Somalia and be members of the sheik's cell be the ones who kill Americans in Somalia. They know that since Kenya be the main gateway for those members, there must be a center in Kenya, he wrote, concluding: We be really in danger. The government have assert that one of Fazil's duties be to prepare and transmit reports to bin Laden and his top lieutenants. Federal authorities say that Khalid al Fawwaz, a london-based associate of bin Laden, direct Fazil to report periodically to bin Laden about the security situation of the cell. Fawwaz, who serve as an informal press spokesman for bin Laden in London, be arrest by british authorities in September after the embassy bombings. He have deny any connection to terrorist activities. A translation of the report be part of a package of documents american prosecutors have send to Britain to support the extradition of Fawwaz for trial in New York. It be not clear from the materials whether the report in the computer be forward to bin Laden. The documents, which be initially file in secret, include a federal complaint that accuse Fawwaz of conspire with bin Laden to kill Americans overseas. A second count charges him with solicit others to do so. The report make clear that the organization be be run on a shoestring. Its author write that his mother have fall ill, and that he would like to return to his homeland for a visit. What do you think? Keep in mind we only have $500. He repeatedly express his fears of American intelligence, which he believe be in the midst of a worldwide search for bin Laden and his associates. There be a war and the situation be dangerous, he said. He write that american forces kidnap anyone who threaten the national security or american citizens. The author note with alarm a recent CIA operation in which a man accuse of shoot agency employees have be lure across the border in Pakistan and return to the United States for trial. accord to federal authorities, Fazil go on to play a pivotal role in the bombing of the Nairobi embassy. Prosecutors assert that he rent the villa where the bomb be assemble and survey the embassy's security precautions. On Aug. 7, they charge, Fazil drive a pickup truck to the embassy, lead the way for a vehicle carry the bomb that kill more than 200 people, include 12 Americans. The author of the report say that he stand ready to fight the forces of atheism and dictators who wreak havoc on earth. He say that the group do not have to inform its nairobi-based operatives of all its global plans, but they need enough warn to go underground for a while if authorities intensify the pressure in Nairobi. We, the East Africa cell members, do not want to know about the operations plans, he wrote, since we be just implementers. If Osama bin Laden ever stand trial in New York for the bombings of the U.S. embassies in Africa and other acts of terror, it be already clear who prosecutors will call as a chief witness: One of his senior aides who have be talk to U.S. investigators for two years. The government have identify the aide in court papers with the pseudonym CS-1, say the person plead guilty to terrorism charges in a secret proceeding in U.S. district court in Manhattan. accord to the government, the informant work closely with bin Laden from 1989 to 1996, a period when prosecutors assert that bin Laden be order deadly attacks on U.S. soldiers in Somalia and elsewhere. From the court papers file in the investigation of the embassy bombings in East Africa in August, it be clear that the informant have provide crucial information to federal investigators. They have cite the source in the papers file to support the extradition of two associates of bin Laden who be under arrest in Germany and Britain. Bin Laden, a Saudi exile, be think to be live in Afghanistan. The source be also the basis for many of the significant charges in the indictment against bin Laden himself, include the assertion that he direct the attacks on U.S. soldiers in Somalia and that he attempt to obtain nuclear weapons. It be not know whether the source be in custody somewhere, or hide under government protection. As recently as 11 days ago, records show, the source swore to a 5-page affidavit before a New York notary summarize his allegations against bin laden. Government officials adamantly decline to say anything about the identity of CS-1, which stand for confidential source. But at least one operative of bin Laden's group in East Africa conclude more than a year ago that he know the identity of a crucial turncoat: Sidi Tayyib, a businessman who be marry to one of bin Laden's relatives. The operative's concerns be inflame by a report in a british newspaper that Tayyib be cooperate with Saudi and U.S. authorities. In an August, 1997 article, The Daily Telegraph say Tayyib have be in custody in Saudi Arabia since May and have give intelligence officials details of bin Laden's bank accounts and businesses. The news of Tayyib's possible defection, the East African operative write in a report apparently intend for the group's commanders, almost make me explode. An important man with close links to bin Laden seem to have fall into the enemy's hands, and we have to take all the appropriate security precautions against that, the operative, Haroun Fazil, write in his summary of security concerns. Fazil have since be charge in the embassy attacks and remain at large. The report be type on a computer seize last year by Kenyan authorities, accord to a government filing last week in U.S. district court in Manhattan. Thus far, U.S. prosecutors have charge at least six members of bin Laden's organization with terrorist activities or conspiracy. In one recent filing, they say their case will in part be base on the testimony of the confidential source, suggest that the informant have agree to testify at any trial of bin Laden or his associates. The arrangement appear to have result from a plea bargain in which the source be cooperate in hopes of receive a less sentence. There be no indication that the source have yet be sentence and it seem likely that sentence would take place after the investigation and ensuing trials be complete. In the affidavit prepare last week, the source acknowledge plead guilty to terrorism charges in the United States and say they stem from attacks on U.S. targets, which be not specifically identified. The source describe take an oath of allegiance to follow bin Laden's orders, and give a detailed account of bin Laden's group, include its history and inner workings. The source tell of private statements by bin Laden to other al Qaeda members, encourage them to attack U.S. troops and other citizens station in the Middle East and Africa. I either hear these statements myself, the source said, or I read them or learn of them from other al Qaeda members. The government have also say in other court papers that the source help identify bin Laden's signature on a 1996 document urge Muslims to kill Americans. Tayyib's whereabouts be unknown and he could not be reach for comment. The Taliban's chief justice accuse the United States on Wednesday of look for an excuse to launch another missile attack on his war-shattered homeland. And that excuse be Osama bin Laden, the man Washington call Enemy no. 1 and blames for the Aug. 7 bombings of U.S. embassies in East Africa, Justice Noor Mohammed Saqib say an interview with The Associated Press. On Aug. 20 the United States retaliate by fire Tomahawk missiles at suspected terrorist camps in eastern Afghanistan, kill 26 people. accord to U.S. intelligence sources, the camps be be use to train members of bin Laden's al Qaeda terrorist group. America be look for an excuse to fire more rockets on our dear Afghanistan and that excuse be bin Laden, Saqib said. Washington, which have post a dlrs 5 million reward for bin Laden's arrest, hasn't rule out further attacks on Afghanistan. Saqib, who head a judicial inquiry establish by the Taliban to investigate the terrorism charges against bin Laden, say the United States have become insecure. America fear its shadow ... in every part of the world it be afraid and see every danger connect to bin Laden, he say in an interview in the Afghan capital of Kabul. In Afghanistan, bin Laden be consider an honor guest by his Taliban hosts. They cite Afghan tradition, which demand the host guarantee his guest protection. So far Saqib say he have no evidence of bin Laden's involvement in terrorist activities. The Taliban have refuse to turn over bin Laden to the United States, but they say if there be evidence they will try him under Islamic law. In the 90 percent of Afghanistan rule by the Taliban a harsh brand of Islamic justice have be imposed, include the death penalty. We want good relations with the United States and all Muslim and non-muslim countries, but they have to respect our ways, he said. Saqib say his inquiry will wind up on Nov. 20 and if there be no evidence against bin Laden the case will be close at least for the Taliban. Bin Laden be not a sinful man ... America have be silent ... they have give no evidence, he said. It be too shameful for America who be now see by all that world to have no reason to go after bin Laden. The man accuse of orchestrate the U.S. embassy bombings in Tanzania and Kenya be declare a free man Friday in Afghanistan, where he have live for years with the permission of the hard-line Islamic Taliban militia. The Taliban, who control about 90 percent of Afghanistan, on Friday close their three-week inquiry into allegations that Osama bin Laden be wag a war of terror against the United States. It's over, and America have not present any evidence, Afghanistan's chief justice, Noor Mohammed Saqib, tell The Associated Press in an interview at the Supreme Court building in the Afghan capital, Kabul. Without any evidence, bin Laden be a man without sin. ... He be a free man. The Taliban have tell bin Laden, however, that political activity be ban and he have agree to respect that, the Taliban information minister say in a statement Friday. The minister, Amir Khan Muttaqi, also dispute U.S. assertions that bin Laden be a rich man, say the Saudi dissident have have his foreign assets frozen, a claim not immediately corroborated. One of the clear but unstated objectives of last August's raid on Afghanistan be to kill Osama bin Laden and as many of his lieutenants as possible, administration officials now acknowledge. accord to the officials, White House lawyers conduct a secret review in the months before the attack and conclude that such operations be legal under U.S. and international law. The officials say the raid be time so that more than 70 cruise missiles would hit bin Laden's camps at the moment when the Central Intelligence Agency believe he would be meet there with his chief operatives. A 1976 executive order bars anyone work for the U.S. government from plot or carry out assassinations. But officials say the White House legal opinion draft before the Afghan strike assert that the president have authority to target the infrastructure of terrorist groups that be attack Americans. A top U.S. counterterrorism official say this week that the infrastructure of bin Laden's group be mostly human. As we say from the time of the Aug. 20 strike, the objective be to disrupt the training, organization and infrastructure of the bin Laden terrorist network at the Khost camps, say David C. Leavy, a spokesman for the National Security Council at the White House. Targeting infrastructure, officials acknowledged, can also mean destroy the leadership of a terrorist group. Command and control of an enemy be a justifiable target, Leavy said. Senior administration officials say they never discuss kill bin Laden in their planning sessions. His death, they say in interviews after the attack, would simply have be a side benefit. U.S. intelligence officials say they now believe that bin Laden be in the camp on the day of the attack, but he appear to have leave unscathed before the missiles hit. Officials say there be reports that at least one of his senior lieutenants may have die in the attack, and that total casualties in the complex be between 50 and 100. Administration spokesmen have draw a distinction between attempt to kill a specific person like bin Laden and attack a group of people who command a terrorist organization. administration officials have deny since August that the raid be intend to kill bin Laden, a Saudi exile who have be charge by federal prosecutors with lead a global war against U.S. interests. He have be link to the Aug. 7 bombing of two U.S. embassies in East Africa. But a less subtle explanation be offer on Oct. 13 by Defense Secretary William Cohen, who say during a visit to Saudi Arabia that the United States have be go after bin Laden and his colleagues. We weren't quite successful, Cohen continued, but we send a message. Kenneth Bacon, the Pentagon spokesman, say the secretary have not retract his statements. The Los Angeles Times recently report that the administration believe that it have a legal right to use deadly force against terrorist leaders. Bin Laden's organization be a significant concern for the Clinton administration even before the bombing of the U.S. embassies in East Africa. last spring, officials said, U.S. intelligence consider a daring raid into Afghanistan to capture the Saudi exile. Officials say that at roughly the same time, the White House draft the legal justification for military attacks against a terrorist leadership. That review, officials said, provide the legal basis in August to fire cruise missiles into the meeting at which it be believe bin Laden and his lieutenants would be gathered. The review, by the National Security Council, be the basis for say this operation do not violate the presidential order ban assassinations. That ban be impose by President Ford in 1975, after congressional investigators uncover evidence that the CIA have plot to assassinate Fidel Castro, the Cuban leader, and others. The order said: No person employ by, or act on behalf of the United States government shall engage in, or conspire to engage in, assassination. While it is, on its face, a sweeping and unqualified ban, it have be subject to interpretation and intense debate over the years. In 1986, the Reagan administration respond to a terrorist attack against U.S. soldiers in Germany with a bombing raid on Libya. The targets include the residence of the Libyan leader, Moammar Gadhafi. And in the Gulf War, U.S. forces use powerful bombs in an attempt to kill Saddam Hussein, the president of Iraq. The legal review conduct by the White House would appear to provide a precedent for future operations in similar circumstances.

6,"He be the classic small-town prodigy, with the creativity of a big-city profiteer. When there be no shot to take, he invent a new one. When there be no one to pass to, he reconfigured the play until a teammate be open. Larry Bird, in the Indiana countryside or inside Boston Garden, be a luminous exception to the govern rule. That be why, six years after his retirement from the National Basketball Association, his name be again basketball's most prominent, beginning with his induction to the Hall of Fame before 7,000 Bird watchers at the Civic Center here on Friday night. deservedly enshrine as forever exceptional, he again become Bird, the exception, the case study for a contentious and potentially disastrous labor war. No, not really, Bird said, when I ask whether he be trouble by the likelihood of his legendary name soon represent a symbol of greed to unsympathetic millions. There's always a player's name attach to these things. I know at the time I be very happy about it. That would have be 1988, when the Celtics want to compensate Bird with a $4.9 million bonus to push through his back pain, go on as their savior. Three years later, in a contract arbitration involve the Knicks' Patrick Ewing, the agent David Falk would contend that the NBA conspire with the Celtics to circumvent the salary cap, in order to satisfy Bird. Alan Greenspan, I be sure, would agree that this salary cap be convolute enough to give anyone a headache, so let's just say it be a cap that do not exist when a team be negotiate with one of its own. The process of unseal the cap to re-sign a particular player eventually become know as make use of the Larry Bird exception. And that be where we stand, as this onetime exception have become the very expensive rule the owners don't want to play by anymore. I can understand both sides, say Bird, safely in the middle, between Bird, the former exception, and Bird, the present Indiana Pacers' coach. Without get into the exception, I think it's very important for players to stay in the same place. Important, he meant, for franchise stability and fan identification. You have a son who be 7 years old, he go from 7 to 17 in the 10 years you've played, Bird said. A lot of people in Boston tell me that they have follow me, from the time they be very young to when they be in college. The Bird years number only three Celtics championships, but he be the best player pro basketball's most famous team ever had. He and Magic Johnson create a basketball renaissance that begin during a college title showdown in Salt Lake City and spread worldwide, like an infectious smile. They stand for the pass, for team play, but now their decade of selflessness have give way to one of selfishness. The NBA of Michael Jordan reach great heights than anyone imagine it could, but it be a league that now suffer from a sickness of the soul. If Larry and Magic hadn't do what they did, we might not survive what we're about to go through, say Bill Fitch, Bird's first Celtics coach, who, with Bill Walton, stand with him on the night that, he said, give closure to his play career. The owners, as always, be exaggerate their misery, but this time, it be much easy to not root for the players. The president of the union be Ewing, who one day command players to boycott the world championship because the NBA's corporate fingerprints be on them, then the next day help himself to some television commentary work for David Stern's women's annex. Ewing lead the fight to protect the $100 million contracts for 21-year-olds who have achieve not a single playoff victory, link to the big payoffs for agents like his friend Falk. The battle be wag in the name of a salary cap that make exceptions of the unexceptional, rewards everyone as if they be Bird. I believe that in any field there have to be an allowance for the truly special ones, Walton said. But that group be very small. When I be grow up in this sport, the only players who get the recognition be the champions, the ones who always make you feel good about the game, about sports. That's how Larry and Magic played, always dream of the special team. It wasn't about hype, about money. That be not quite the case, nor should it have been. Bird be a businessman's ball player from the day he arrived, with his flannel shirts and blue-collar ethic. He hire the late Bob Woolf, one of the original heavy-hitting agents, and get himself a record rookie contract. then he go out and turn a 29-victory catastrophe into a 61-victory contender. A rare Bird, an honest exception to the rule. Despite modest encouragement over a new proposal deliver by the players to the owners, the National Basketball Association Tuesday cancel the first two weeks of the regular season, the first time in the league's 51-year history that it will lose games to a labor dispute. The NBA's deputy commissioner, Russ Granik, announce the cancellation after nearly three and a half hours of meetings conclude at a Manhattan hotel. The decision to cancel 99 games between Nov. 3 and Nov. 16 come after the players association propose the implementation of a tax system instead of a hard salary cap, a proposal the owners say they would respond to by Friday. We try our best today to try to do what be possible to salvage the season, say Alonzo Mourning, the Miami Heat center. Unfortunately, it didn't work out. After 35,001 games without a blemish, the NBA now join the National Hockey League, the National Football League and Major League Baseball in have lose games to a labor dispute. Taking into account that a three- to four-week period would be need for training camp and free-agent signings before the season starts, the league say it would decide in two weeks whether to make further cancellations. I'm very sad and disappointed, say the NBA commissioner, David Stern. I consider it to be a collective failure, but I honestly don't know what else we could have done. I do things that I like to think be in the best interests of the game. And I believe this is. The decision come after what both sides agree be the most substantive talks since the owners impose a lockout on the player July 1. Seventeen players, include union president Patrick Ewing and vice presidents Mitch Richmond, Herb Williams, Dikemebe Mutombo and Ty Corbin, attend the meeting along with Stern, Granik and five members of the ownership committee Madison Square Garden president Dave Checketts and owners Abe Pollin of Washington, Gordon Gund of Cleveland, Les Alexander of Houston and Jerry Colangelo of Phoenix. The talks feature what the players association imply be a bevy concessions make to the owners that they felt would accommodate the league's desire to swing the revenue pendulum back toward the owners. The dispute involve the distribution of approximately $2 billion in league-wide income. The main sticking point have be the owners' insistence on a salary cap without exceptions, the implementation of which they believe would bring player salaries' in line with revenue growth. While the players do not discuss the elimination of the Larry Bird exception a clause that allow a player to secure any amount of money he want in re-signing with his current team they do address the exception in their taxation proposal. The main points be as follows: A 50 percent tax would be impose on salary earn above $18 million, a clause that would affect only a few players who exercise their Bird rights. For example, if a player make $20 million, the team would be force to put $1 million into a fund that would most likely be distribute to low-revenue teams. There could be provisions make for some players, say Jeffrey Kessler, the chief outside counsel for the union. We don't want to do anything that would encourage Chicago from get Michael Jordan back. And I think the league feel the same way. The proposal be similar to the luxury tax propose by the union in 1995 during negotiations, but it would not be nearly as liberal. A salary cap credit would go into effect if the league pay out more than 63 percent of revenues in salary. Whatever figure over that number reduce the salary cap the next year. If the figure be $29 million over the salary cap, then the 29 teams would work with a salary cap $1 million less than the previous season. But the players would have an assurance that the salary cap would go up at least $2 million before the credit go into effect. Also, if the 63-percent threshold be met, a reduction of annual 20 percent raises would take effect for multi-year contracts. Players would either get raises of 10 percent or the rate of growth in league revenues. The union say this clearly address the league's desire to bring salaries in line with revenues. Since the owners re-opened the current agreement because 57.1 percent of revenue be go toward salaries, the 63-percent figure would probably have to come down substantially for the owners to agree to such a proposal. Teams would get a right of first refusal on free agents after the fourth year for incoming rookies, mean a player would be contractually obligate to the same team for the first four years of his deal. Currently, the rookie scale be three years and include a clause that enable a player to exercise his Bird rights after two seasons a clause Kevin Garnett parlay into an astronomical $126 million deal last year with Minnesota. Finally, the players agree to make marijuana a ban substance. Details of test have not be negotiate and no specific discussions take place regard test for performance-enhancing drugs, a provision the owners include in their last proposal. In return for the concessions, the players want an increase in the minimum salary currently $272,500 and creation of an average salary exception. This would allow every team above the salary cap be able to sign one free agent per year for the average salary currently $2.6 million. We're buoy by the fact for the first time they've decide to submit a counterproposal, the union's executive director, Billy Hunter, said. I don't know if I'm more optimistic, but I can earnestly say we can look our ballplayers in the eye and say we make a valiant effort. ask if the players would finally be test financially with the cancellation of games, Hunter added: It's not about us blinking. We want to reach an agreement. We're tire of the rhetoric, we're tire of the game-playing. Our position all along have be we don't want to accept a bad deal. Granik say refunds to fans would be make at end of the calendar month and that the first refund would include monies for cancel preseason games. He estimate the losses into the hundreds of millions of dollars. I think we have serious concern whether a tax system can address the kind of needs we have economically, he added. But there's some possibility. add Stern, We owe it to the fans to go back and look at the notion whether a tax rate might begin to achieve the result we wanted. It doesn't look promising, but we're go to spend the next two days to see if we can give a favorable response. Though the decision to cancel games be not surprising, it do represent a major shift in prior labor stalemates. Both sides reluctantly hammer out a deal in 1995 before the start of train camp with the sole notion of not miss games and preserve the NBA's perfect record. Tuesday, they could not come to such an accord. I'd like to think these our the last games we have to cancel, Granik said. But unless this or something else works, or there's some dramatic breakthrough, I think that be certainly not all of the season that's in jeopardy. In a decision that will almost certainly lead to the first work stoppage in National Basketball Association history, the league Monday announce the cancellation of all 114 preseason games. Citing stall negotiations with the Players Association over a new collective bargaining agreement, league officials say they would decide next week whether to cancel the first week of regular season games. While the decision have be expect for 10 days, it nonetheless send a strong signal that the owners and players will probably be willing to cancel at least part of the regular season in order to settle their labor dispute. Both sides agree that it would take at least three weeks to hold abbreviated training camps and sign over 200 free agents to new contracts. Privately, officials on both sides do not believe the season will start as schedule on Nov. 3 or even before December. Unlike Major League Baseball, the National Football League and the National Hockey League, the NBA have never lose a regular-season game to labor strife. Since we're not even negotiating, you have to conclude it's very likely that we're go miss some part of the regular season, deputy commissioner Russ Granik say Monday night. We'll try and defer any decisions until the last minute, but right now it do not look good. The two sides will meet on Thursday their first official bargaining session since Aug. 6. Commissioner David Stern and a group of owners walk out of a meeting after dismiss the merits of a new proposal from the players. Neither Granik nor players association executive director Billy Hunter sound as if this week's meeting would go a long way toward the signing of a new agreement the precursor to play again. I don't think you have any choice but to miss games at this point, Hunter said. In fact, I think the they've intend it all along. They've lock us out, they've refuse to negotiate and they've give us a proposal that's ludicrous. not only be both sides still await the outcome of an arbitration decision that be due before Oct. 18 - the Fordham Law School dean John Feerick will rule whether or not more than 200 players with $800 million in guaranteed contracts should be pay during the lockout but the owners and players also be make time to win public opinion before they test their fans' loyalties by cancel games. Monday in 11 cities throughout the country, the players be hold make-shift press conferences at training-camp venues, NBA arenas and gymnasiums. Patrick Ewing, the union president, and several teammates will speak at SUNY-Purchase in Purchase, N.Y., where the Knicks train during the season. With training camp originally schedule to open on Oct. 6, the message from the players be clear: if the owners would call an end to the lockout, we would be ready to play today. About 100 players be expect to attend, speak and sign autograph for fans afterward. I wish they would put their energies into try to negotiate a deal rather than the various other things that they've be doing, Granik said. The dispute be essentially over how the owners and players will judiciously divvy up $2 billion in income. It begin last year with the contention by the owners that their employees be receive more than their fair share of the pot. The owners be allow to terminate the current agreement because of a clause that enable them to do so after player salaries reach 53.8 percent of total basketball-related income. The owners say that figure be currently hover around 57.1 percent. Though many economic issues need to be resolved, the main point of contention since the labor agreement expire and the owners declare a lockout on July 1 have be a clause which allow teams to pay their own free agents whatever they want, regardless of salary-cap rules govern the NBA's 29 teams. call the Larry Bird exception, it be create to allow the Hall of Fame Boston Celtics forward to re-sign with the Celtics near the end of his career. Michael Jordan exercise the clause the last two years with the Chicago Bulls, earn more than $30 million per season figures more than $5 million more what a team be allow to spend on all its players. But with exorbitant salaries pay to several unproven stars over the last few years and $100 million deals sprout up routinely, the owners be determine to swing the income pendulum back toward themselves by enforce a restrict salary cap a hard cap and put a ceiling on how much one player could earn. last year, the players receive about $1 billion dollars in salaries and benefits and we have make proposals that be guarantee to increase that number by 20 percent over the next four years, Granik say in a prepared statement. Our proposals would result in an average player salary of more than $3.1 million and a minimum salary for 10-year veterans of $750,000. Unfortunately, the union leadership have be unwilling to give any serious consideration to what we have offered. Hunter label those claims as optimistic projections, and shoot down a number of new proposals present to the players on Sept. 25. If they have leave the current deal in place, we would have get much of that anyway, he added. All we're say is, we're not in position to accept a hard cap. Monday's decision to cancel the preseason come less than two weeks after the NBA indefinitely postpone training camp and cancel the first week of exhibition games. Through tickets sales alone, Granik estimate that lose the exhibition season would cost the league between $35 million and $40 million. Decisions about the cancellations of regular season games be expect to be make next week, he added. A league official say the games would be cancel in blocks of one or two weeks, depend upon circumstances regard negotiations. Thursday's bargaining session have suddenly become the last hope at start the season on time. Hurdles could be overcome very quickly, but I have no reason to believe they will on Thursday, Granik said. Added Hunter: Of course they don't expect much to get done. When Russ and David decide the negotiations be go to be real and substantive, then something will happen. What they're bank on now be that the players be go to miss paychecks and cave in November. It's as if they've ingest something that have to pass. And once it passes, then they'll negotiate. The first substantive talks in more than two months between oppose sides of the National Basketball Association's labor dispute come and go Thursday without a hint of a settlement. Still, a five-hour meeting that be describe as cordial by the league and almost like two bulls let off a little steam by the players association produce another schedule round of talks next Tuesday. bar a major compromise, that will not be enough time to preserve a full season and prevent the league from lose its first regular-season games to labor strife in November. Russ Granik, the NBA's deputy commissioner, say the league would wait until after next week's meeting before decide to cancel regular-season games. He also discuss the possibility of a significantly shorten season. We haven't make a determination that you need this exact number of games in order to have a representative season, Granik said. But we recognize that beyond a certain point we can't possibly sell to our fans that we're have an NBA season. Whether's that 60 games, 50 games or 49 or 53, we're not there yet. We have a few months before we have to face that decision. perhaps the only progress involve Thursday in the conference room of a midtown Manhattan hotel be a question-and-answer session over the league's late proposal to the players. Patrick Ewing, the union president, and vice presidents Herb Williams and Dikembe Mutombo attend the meeting with the union's executive director, Billy Hunter, and union lawyers. No owners be present, but Granik, Commissioner David Stern and the league's lawyers spend most of the day explain the intricacies of a two-week-old proposal to the players. At one point before the two parties break for lunch, Stern and Hunter raise their voices and accuse each other of handle their constituencies poorly, a participant in the meeting said. But the two be see shake hands and laugh after the meeting conclude shortly after 3 p.m. There be some venting from both sides, Hunter said. We've be placid and very respectful. Today, we take the coats off and we be incline to take the gloves off a little bit. have do that, I think it kind of loosen up both sides. Hunter added: Did anybody blink today? They're sort of look at us for any kind of nuance they can find during the course of negotiations that might, in some way or another, give some indication that while we're mouth one thing we might be open to something else. We're look at their body language, too. I don't think that they're ready to make a deal. The last formal meeting between both sides on Aug. 6 end when Stern and the owners abruptly march out after they have receive a proposal from the players. In a critical ruling for the north american National Basketball Association and the players' union, arbitrator John Feerick decide Monday whether more than 200 players with guaranteed contracts should be pay during the lockout. If the players win, the owners will be liable for about dlrs 800 million in guaranteed salaries, although they have vow to appeal if they lose. The league already have sue the players over Feerick's jurisdiction. If we win, I think it just embolden the spirit and resolve of the players, union director Billy Hunter said. But I don't think there will be anybody celebrate because there's no guarantee that it will end the lockout. It only mean they have to pay some 200 players, and they've indicate to us their intent to file an immediate appeal and take it as far as they have to in order to avoid payment. so even if he do rule in our favor, at most it's a hollow victory. The players aren't go to get pay Nov. 15 in any circumstance, Hunter said. If the owners win, it will remove the last wild card the players have be holding. The sides have not negotiate since last Tuesday, when the union propose a superstar tax on the high contracts. The league make a counterproposal Friday, ask that the tax be impose with a much low threshold. Hunter dismiss the league's late proposal on Friday afternoon, then say both sides would be best serve by await Feerick's ruling. It's unlikely any negotiations will be hold this week, since the union be hold a meeting for all NBA players and the agents advisory committee in Las Vegas from Wednesday through Friday. We've get to get a sense of where the players are, what they consider to be reasonable and what they're willing to do in order to get the season to commence, Hunter said. The union file a grievance with Feerick before the lockout be impose July 1 over the owners' announcement June 29 that they would not honor guaranteed deals. In a six-day hearing over the summer, the union argue that owners should have protect themselves from be liable for guaranteed salaries during a work stoppage by insert lockout language into the standard player contract. The Sacramento Kings insert a lockout clause into center Olden Polynice's contract in 1994, and it be approve by the league. The union use the existence of that clause to argue that all the other teams should have protect themselves similarly. most players be due to receive their first paychecks Nov. 15, although a dozen or so have clauses entitle them to be pay over the summer. none have receive a paycheck. The NBA argue that a tenet of labor law allow employers to withhold pay from employees during a lockout. The league also call former union director Simon Gourdine to testify. He say it be his understanding when he negotiate the old labor agreement in 1995 that players would not be pay if the owners choose to reopen the agreement and impose a lockout. more than 220 National Basketball Association players with guarantee contracts will find out Monday whether they be to be pay during the management lockout, a long-awaited arbitrator's decision that may affect leverage in the league's dispute with the players and have major ramifications on american sports-labor law. But neither the players nor the owners be count on the ruling by the arbitrator, John Feerick, to speed up negotiations, especially if Feerick find in favor of the players, an award that could approach $800 million in salaries. NBA attorneys have indicate to the union that if the decision go against management, they will seek to have it vacate by appeal to the U.S. District Court in Manhattan and then, if necessary, to the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, a process that could prevent the players from get pay for several months. The NBA have already cancel the first two weeks of the regular season because of the labor dispute. The league have other litigation pending in U.S. District Court in Manhattan. If the players win the ruling, the NBA intend to renew its motion to disqualify Feerick. The motion be bring last summer on the grounds that no collective bargaining agreement exist and, therefore, he have no jurisdiction to hear the matter. If he rules in our favor, I think it embolden the spirit and the resolve of the players, say Billy Hunter, union executive director. But we understand that won't end the lockout. It just mean they have to pay 200-some players. And there be still other litigation alive that may take a while to resolve. At most, it's a hollow victory. Feerick will have take the full 30 days to render his decision. Whatever he decides, his ruling will be watch carefully. There be no precedent for locked-out athletes be paid. During the NBA summer lockout of 1995, players who miss paychecks do not file a grievance. Neither do National Hockey League players who be lock out for the first three months of the 1994-95 season. The union argue that owners should have protect themselves by insert clauses about non-payment for lockouts and strikes into individual player contracts. In support of its arguments, the union point to clauses in a few individual player contracts that contain language preclude payment during a lockout. The league be rely on the basic tenets of labor law, which hold that employees not be pay during strikes or lockouts. A ruling for the union would be significant for all future negotiations between players and owners. The deterrent factor of a lockout be that employees subject to a collective bargaining agreement do not get pay once the agreement expire and they be unable to reach a new agreement. If Feerick find in favor of the players, there will be no economic incentive for those with guaranteed contracts to reach an agreement quickly. They would essentially be pay for not play basketball. If Feerick find in favor of the owners, the reality of not be pay may spur the players to reach an agreement more quickly. But Hunter dispute this notion, and in a conference call Friday talk openly about the entire season's be cancel before the players would back away from their ultimate goals. I'm not at all concerned, Hunter said. There's be no demonstration that there's go to be a change in our resolve. After the players saw these proposals from the league and the recent posturing by NBA owners, well, I have two players call me up and tell me, if need be, they'd be willing to hock everything they've got. Another significant development may be thedeparture of many players to Europe until the dispute be settled, accord to at least two player agents. I think it would be a case-by-case basis, but yes, there's already some people talk about that, say Bill Strickland, a member of the union's agents advisory committee. Steve Kauffman, another member of the committee, say he would explore the possibility that one client, Nets center Rony Seikaly, would sign with a professional team in Greece. We wouldn't look to void his deal with the team, Kauffman said. But we would want him to have the right for him to work temporarily until he could come back and honor his contract.' Russ Granik, NBA deputy commissioner, say the league have approve the idea of players' earn a living elsewhere until the lockout be settled. Proposals exchange last week that include the concept of a luxury-tax system on player salaries appear to reflect the first signs of progress in negotiations since the lockout begin July 1. But both sides have term the figures in each other's proposal as unacceptable, and it be unclear whether either side be willing compromise. I don't think we should get too carry away about the possibilities just yet, Granik said. When they explore the idea of a tax system, we be take the players at their word that they want to make some headway. But to call their first proposal meaningless be charitable. They propose something that have no impact. As it stands, that can't be the solution. The owners' goal be to slow the growth of player salaries in relation to leaguewide revenue over the next three years, while the players want to keep earning as much as possible. As labor battles go, the current one between the National Basketball Association and its players be weird even by sports standards. There be a real possibility that most, if not all, of the come season will be canceled. In this union battle it be the interests of the best paid, not those who make union scale, that be dominate the discussion. And here it be some of the workers, not the management, who be consider try to make the union disappear. The current arrangement have produce an unbalanced pay scale of immense proportions. last year more players than ever before receive the union minimum, then $242,000 for rookies or $272,000 for veterans. The number of players make $1 million to $2 million a year the middle class, in NBA terms fell sharply. But Michael Jordan make $33 million. This should not be a surprise. Sports be an entertainment business, not unlike movies. Big stars get millions, while most get union scale. Over the years, NBA efforts to stem the rise of salaries have failed. The most important loophole in its salary cap let a team sign its own free agent for whatever it be willing to pay. When that be adopted, it be assume that no team would pay a lot more than a rival could pay. But it have not work out that way. In the current negotiation, the league have offer to guarantee that its payroll will rise 20 percent over the next four years, from $1 billion to $1.2 billion, and say it be open to proposals to split that money any way the players want, whether by raise the minimum salary or guaranteeing raises for veterans. The union say it be worry about that middle class, but seem determine to preserve the free market. The league get its broadcasters, NBC and Time Warner's cable channels, to agree to pay this year's television fees whether or not there be any games to broadcast. (They will be pay back in later years, either through reduced fees or extra games to show.) Owners hop the players would think management be willing to wait them out, and come to terms with only a small part of the season canceled. But the union be act unhurried. It turn aside requests for negotiations this week, say the players have to meet first. then there be the issue of union suicide, a tactic that be reject by the players in 1995. The idea be that if the players have no union, it would be illegal under antitrust laws for the owners to collude. The sky would be the limit. That tactic might fail. The courts could reject a union decertification vote as a sham, and in any case some players may fear that teams would feel free to offer less than the old union minimum. But if the players go that route, it could be a long time before real negotiations get going. Billy Hunter, the union's executive director, warn the owners this week that a prolonged lockout could destroy the league's popularity. That be what all the seers say four years ago, when baseball's World Series be cancel by labor troubles. But fan memories be relatively short, and now baseball seem more popular than ever. With that in mind, both owners and players may choose to battle on for months. In a critical ruling for the north american National Basketball Association and the players' union, arbitrator John Feerick decide Monday whether more than 200 players with guaranteed contracts should be pay during the lockout. If the players win, the owners will be liable for about dlrs 800 million in guaranteed salaries, although they have vow to appeal if they lose. The league already have sue the players over Feerick's jurisdiction. If we win, I think it just embolden the spirit and resolve of the players, union director Billy Hunter said. But I don't think there will be anybody celebrate because there's no guarantee that it will end the lockout. It only mean they have to pay some 200 players, and they've indicate to us their intent to file an immediate appeal and take it as far as they have to in order to avoid payment. so even if he do rule in our favor, at most it's a hollow victory. The players aren't go to get pay Nov. 15 in any circumstance, Hunter said. If the owners win, it will remove the last wild card the players have be holding. The sides have not negotiate since last Tuesday, when the union propose a superstar tax on the high contracts. The league make a counterproposal Friday, ask that the tax be impose with a much low threshold. Hunter dismiss the league's late proposal on Friday afternoon, then say both sides would be best serve by await Feerick's ruling. It's unlikely any negotiations will be hold this week, since the union be hold a meeting for all NBA players and the agents advisory committee in Las Vegas from Wednesday through Friday. We've get to get a sense of where the players are, what they consider to be reasonable and what they're willing to do in order to get the season to commence, Hunter said. The union file a grievance with Feerick before the lockout be impose July 1 over the owners' announcement June 29 that they would not honor guaranteed deals. In a six-day hearing over the summer, the union argue that owners should have protect themselves from be liable for guaranteed salaries during a work stoppage by insert lockout language into the standard player contract. The Sacramento Kings insert a lockout clause into center Olden Polynice's contract in 1994, and it be approve by the league. The union use the existence of that clause to argue that all the other teams should have protect themselves similarly. most players be due to receive their first paychecks Nov. 15, although a dozen or so have clauses entitle them to be pay over the summer. none have receive a paycheck. The NBA argue that a tenet of labor law allow employers to withhold pay from employees during a lockout. The league also call former union director Simon Gourdine to testify, but Feerick upheld union objections and prohibit Gourdine from say whether it be his understanding when he negotiate the old labor agreement in 1995 that players would not be pay if the owners choose to reopen the agreement and impose a lockout. Patrick Ewing do not want to sound like a striking longshoreman demand health benefits. I'm not go to try and put it in dollars and cents. But Ewing, president of the National Basketball Association Players Association, play the public-relations game Tuesday by expound on the themes of labor unrest: strong-willed unity and short-sighted proposals. On the day when training camps be schedule to begin, players from across the country hold news conferences in 14 NBA cities to proclaim themselves ready to practice for the regular season. We want to show the public that we, as players, want to play, say Ewing, who be flank by five teammates. today be suppose to be the start of train camp. We want to practice and we want the season to start. But unfortunately, the owners have lock us out and the season have be postponed. The owners and players be schedule hold their first bargaining session since Aug. 6 on Thursday in Manhattan. Neither side be predict progress toward sign a new collective bargaining agreement and begin the season as schedule on Nov. 3. The league cancel the entire 114-game preseason on Monday. Next week, it will consider cancel the first-ever regular season games in league history. With wide philosophical differences on how $2 billion annual income should be distributed, both sides have privately say they don't expect to play a regular season game before December. Billy Hunter, the union's executive director, offer a glimmer of hope. He speak optimistically about the potential for a quick resolution. stand a few feet away from Ewing, he said, I hope the owners and commissioner have get the message: that we're serious about a deal. I'm prepare to make a quantum leap. I don't think we're that far off. I think there's a lot jockeying, a lot of rhetoric and a lot of games be played. But if and when the owners decide they want a deal, then they'll get one. But soon after, he begin lambast the owners' late proposal, which include the eventual phase out of the Larry Bird exception the clause that enable free agents to earn unlimited salaries from their current teams. That clause represent the major rift in negotiations. Owners would like to implement a restrictive salary cap that would eventually put a ceiling on how much one player can earn. I don't know if this be go to come to a speedy resolution, Ewing said. They're entrench with what they want, which be a hard cap. And we feel with a hard cap, we as players, cannot survive. We would have to be stupid and ignorant to accept that deal. Said Hunter, If you go for their proposal, it's just a joke. It's a step backwards. I cannot understand it. If the intent be to reach an agreement at this late stage or to negotiate in earnest, this be the wrong way to go about it. League officials do not respond to the players' comments. All we want be our fair share and we feel like they're try to take that away from us, Ewing said. `there's a perception that we're on strike. It's the other way around. We've be lock out. Besides Ewing, the other Knicks include former union president Buck Williams, former vice president Herb Williams, Allan Houston and John Starks. Marcus Camby also show up briefly. When the media horde close in, however, the third-year forward go to look for his late-arriving teammates inside the practice facility. He be stop at the gym door, which be locked. They lock us out, say Rockets forward Mario Elie. Everybody's get to get that corrected. It's not on us. They're the ones that close us down. The stalemate have elicit talks of possibly bring in a mediator in the come weeks, as Major League Baseball do in 1994 to help solve its labor dispute. But the players be convince commissioner David Stern and the owners be set on test their resolve before any genuine headway can be make in negotiations. That mean miss paychecks in November, something Ewing say the players be prepared to do. Both sides be still await the outcome of an arbitration decision that be due before Oct. 18. Fordham Law School dean John Feerick will rule whether or not more than 200 players with $800 million in guaranteed contracts should be pay during the lockout. Feerick's decision could give new leverage to one side. But if the players lose the arbitration, more than 400 athletes many with extravagant lifestyles and tremendous financial obligations will have their allegiances instantly tested. It's like they want to see how strong we are, ewing said. base on the proposals we've received, we're very strong. so far, it seem as though the NBA be dig in on their position, Buck Williams said. I don't think they're too concern at this point about make a deal. He added, we're about as far apart as the Grand Canyon right now. The National Basketball Association, embroil in a labor dispute with its players, Tuesday cancel the first two weeks of the 1998-99 season. It be the first time in the league's 51-year history that it will lose regular-season games. The NBA's deputy commissioner, Russ Granik, announce the cancellation after nearly three and a half hours of meetings conclude at a Manhattan hotel. The decision to cancel 99 games between Nov. 3 and Nov. 16 come after the players association propose the implementation of a tax system instead of a hard salary cap, a proposal the owners say they would respond to by Friday. We try our best today to try to do what be possible to salvage the season, say Alonzo Mourning, the Miami Heat center. Unfortunately, it didn't work out. After 35,001 games without a blemish, the NBA now join the National Hockey League, the National Football League and Major League Baseball in have lose games to a labor dispute. Taking into account that a three- to four-week period would be need for training camp and free-agent signings before the season starts, the league say it would decide in two weeks whether to make further cancellations. I'm very sad and disappointed, say the NBA commissioner, David Stern. I consider it to be a collective failure, but I honestly don't know what else we could have done. I do things that I like to think be in the best interests of the game. And I believe this is. The decision come after what both sides agree be the most substantive talks since the owners impose a lockout on the player July 1. Seventeen players, include union president Patrick Ewing and vice presidents Mitch Richmond, Herb Williams, Dikemebe Mutombo and Ty Corbin, attend the meeting along with Stern, Granik and five members of the ownership committee Madison Square Garden president Dave Checketts and owners Abe Pollin of Washington, Gordon Gund of Cleveland, Les Alexander of Houston and Jerry Colangelo of Phoenix. The talks feature what the players association imply be a bevy concessions make to the owners that they felt would accommodate the league's desire to swing the revenue pendulum back toward the owners. The dispute involve the distribution of approximately $2 billion in league-wide income. The main sticking point have be the owners' insistence on a salary cap without exceptions, the implementation of which they believe would bring player salaries' in line with revenue growth. While the players do not discuss the elimination of the Larry Bird exception a clause that allow a player to secure any amount of money he want in re-signing with his current team they do address the exception in their taxation proposal. The main points be as follows: A 50 percent tax would be impose on salary earn above $18 million, a clause that would affect only a few players who exercise their Bird rights. For example, if a player make $20 million, the team would be force to put $1 million into a fund that would most likely be distribute to low-revenue teams. There could be provisions make for some players, say Jeffrey Kessler, the chief outside counsel for the union. We don't want to do anything that would encourage Chicago from get Michael Jordan back. And I think the league feel the same way. The proposal be similar to the luxury tax propose by the union in 1995 during negotiations, but it would not be nearly as liberal. A salary cap credit would go into effect if the league pay out more than 63 percent of revenues in salary. Whatever figure over that number reduce the salary cap the next year. If the figure be $29 million over the salary cap, then the 29 teams would work with a salary cap $1 million less than the previous season. But the players would have an assurance that the salary cap would go up at least $2 million before the credit go into effect. Also, if the 63-percent threshold be met, a reduction of annual 20 percent raises would take effect for multi-year contracts. Players would either get raises of 10 percent or the rate of growth in league revenues. The union say this clearly address the league's desire to bring salaries in line with revenues. Since the owners re-opened the current agreement because 57.1 percent of revenue be go toward salaries, the 63-percent figure would probably have to come down substantially for the owners to agree to such a proposal. Teams would get a right of first refusal on free agents after the fourth year for incoming rookies, mean a player would be contractually obligate to the same team for the first four years of his deal. Currently, the rookie scale be three years and include a clause that enable a player to exercise his Bird rights after two seasons a clause Kevin Garnett parlay into an astronomical $126 million deal last year with Minnesota. Finally, the players agree to make marijuana a ban substance. Details of test have not be negotiate and no specific discussions take place regard test for performance-enhancing drugs, a provision the owners include in their last proposal. In return for the concessions, the players want an increase in the minimum salary currently $272,500 and creation of an average salary exception. This would allow every team above the salary cap be able to sign one free agent per year for the average salary currently $2.6 million. We're buoy by the fact for the first time they've decide to submit a counterproposal, the union's executive director, Billy Hunter, said. I don't know if I'm more optimistic, but I can earnestly say we can look our ballplayers in the eye and say we make a valiant effort. ask if the players would finally be test financially with the cancellation of games, Hunter added: It's not about us blinking. We want to reach an agreement. We're tire of the rhetoric, we're tire of the game-playing. Our position all along have be we don't want to accept a bad deal. Granik say refunds to fans would be make at end of the calendar month and that the first refund would include monies for cancel preseason games. He estimate the losses into the hundreds of millions of dollars. I think we have serious concern whether a tax system can address the kind of needs we have economically, he added. But there's some possibility. add Stern, We owe it to the fans to go back and look at the notion whether a tax rate might begin to achieve the result we wanted. It doesn't look promising, but we're go to spend the next two days to see if we can give a favorable response. Though the decision to cancel games be not surprising, it do represent a major shift in prior labor stalemates. Both sides reluctantly hammer out a deal in 1995 before the start of train camp with the sole notion of not miss games and preserve the NBA's perfect record. Tuesday, they could not come to such an accord. I'd like to think these our the last games we have to cancel, Granik said. But unless this or something else works, or there's some dramatic breakthrough, I think that be certainly not all of the season that's in jeopardy.

7,"congolese rebels have take their two-month campaign to oust President Laurent Kabila to the Internet. We have to explain to the world audience who we be and what we're fight for, rebel leader Ernest Wamba dia Wamba say on Friday. Besides, the (kabila) government have be use the Internet to tell their side of the story. The 56-year-old history professor at the University of Dar e Salaam in Tanzania say supporters of the Congolese Rally for Democracy in the United States have create a web site for the rebellion. The site www.prairienet.org/panafrican/cdm have be set up on the donor-supported Prairenet Community Network in eastern Illinois. The rebels be a coalition of ethnic Tutsis, disenchant members of Kabila's army and political opponents who accuse Kabila of power-grabbing, mismanagement, corruption and sowing dissent among Congo's 400 tribes. After an initial lightning advance in the far west of Africa's third-largest nation, the rebels be stop at the outskirts of the capital, Kinshasa, by troops from Angola, Zimbabwe and Namibia, who be back Kabila. Since then, the rebels have be confine to a chunk of territory in the extreme eastern part of the country where their rebellion be declare Aug. 2. Wamba say the rebels control 40 percent of Congo, an area of 15 million people. So far, Kabila have refuse to negotiate with the rebels, accuse them of be the puppets of neighbor Rwanda and Uganda. post the rebel mission statement on the Internet be just part of the media campaign. last week, Wamba dispatch two of his top aides to the United States and Europe to lobby for political support and raise public awareness about the conflict in Congo. World leaders, diplomats and be not familiar enough with our cause. They still talk about Tutsis lead the rebellion. Well, I'm not a Tutsi, Wamba said. Jacques Depelchin, the movement's vice president and a former lecturer at the University of California at Berkeley, meet in Washington earlier this week with the U.S. special envoy in the Great Lakes region of Central Africa, Howard Wolpe and with congressmen, Wamba said. Rebels in eastern Congo on Saturday say they shoot down a passenger jet ferry 40 government soldiers into a strategic airport face a rebel assault. A Congo Airlines executive say the victims be civilians be evacuate from Kindu, about 1,000 kilometers (620 miles) east of the capital, Kinshasa. Neither claim could be confirm independently. Stavros Papaioannou, the president of the airline's management committee, say a missile hit the rear engine of the Boeing jet after the aircraft take off from Kindu airport. A rebel military commander, who request anonymity, say the plane be carry troops, although he do not explain how he know this. He say the plane be shoot down while approach Kindu air base, where the rebels have deploy at least two surface-to-air missiles and more than 3,500 troops in preparation for a final assault on the government-held town. Alexis Tambwe Mwamba, one of rebel leaders, say from the rebel stronghold at Goma, 380 kilometers (235 miles) northeast of Kalima, that fighters have intercept government radio messages in Kindu and know in advance of the arrival of the aircraft. He say the government have be use the Boeing 727 to fly in troops and ammunition in Kindu for several days. Papaioannou, citing, 6th graf pvs After a day of fighting, congolese rebels say Sunday they have enter Kindu, the strategic town and airbase in eastern Congo use by the government to halt their advances. Etienne Ngangura, a rebel spokesman, say the rebel fighters be inside Kindu and have take the adjacent, large airbase, 380 kilometers (235 miles) west of Goma, the rebel stronghold. We're in the town and the airport, Ngangura said. He offer no details and the report could not be confirm independently. Rebel military sources say the fight continue inside Kindu where the rebels be apparently meet stiff resistance. The rebels ethnic Tutsis, disenchant members of President Laurent Kabila's army and opposition politicians take up arms Aug. 2 accuse Kabila of mismanagement, corruption and create division among Congo's 400 tribes. The rebels have target Kindu since late August, when they be force to retreat from the outskirts of the capital, Kinshasa, after troops from Angola and Zimbabwe come to Kabila's aid. Troops move south from Kisangani, the large city under rebel control, and move west, have make steady gains against Kindu, which the government apparently use to build up force for a plan counter-offensive. Apart from Kindu, Ngangura say rebel fighters take Buta, 120 kilometers (75 miles) north of Kisangani and on the main road in northern Congo that link Sudan and the central African Republic. also on Sunday, Ngangura say the rebels take Bumba, 400 kilometers (250 miles) northwest of Kisangani. These reports could not be confirm independently either. Rebel leaders say a victory at Kindu would confirm rebel strength, boost fighters' morale and perhaps persuade others to join them. The rebels want direct negotiations with Kabila. But the president have so far refused, accuse the rebels of be puppets of Rwanda and Uganda, which Kabila have accuse of orchestrate the rebellion. The conflict in Central Africa have draw in most of Congo's nine neighbors, and regional diplomatic initiatives have so far fail to stop it. The bloody bandages of injured rebels truck back to this rear base Wednesday offer evidence that the three-day battle for the strategic air base at Kindu be not go well for those fight to oust Congolese President Laurent Kabila. It be impossible to say who have the upper hand in the battle for Kindu and its air base, which government forces have be use to launch airstrikes on eastern towns and to assemble ground troops. Rebel commander Richard Mondo say shelling and ground attacks, which begin Monday, continue on Wednesday. Mondo say he be expect air shipments of munitions to bolster the rebel offensive. On Wednesday, a truck unload a dozen wound rebel fighters at Kalima, a small town 80 kilometers (50 miles) northeast of Kindu, serve as a rear base for the attack. Sweaty and weary, some limping and others bandaged, they wait to be airlift to a hospital in Goma, the rebel stronghold 380 kilometers (235 miles) east, on the Rwandan border. The rebels a coalition of ethnic Tutsis, disenchant soldiers in Kabila's army and opposition politicians face stiff resistance. In Kinshasa, the Ministry of Defense say Tuesday that the Congolese Armed Forces, know as the FAC, have kill 18 rebels in ward off the attacks. Kindu be effectively in the hands of the FAC, which have now launch an offensive after defend its positions, say a ministry statement broadcast on state-run television. The civilians there be cooperate fully with the FAC as their counterparts do previously in Kinshasa, the capital. Rebel leaders hope the capture of Kindu will boost morale and demonstrate can carry their two-month rebellion into the rest of Congo, Africa's third-largest nation. The rebel victory would also open routes to Katanga and Eastern Kasai provinces, rich in copper and diamonds. The rebels target Kindu since late August, when they be force to retreat their march from extreme western Congo to the outskirts of Kinshasa after Angola and Zimbabwe send troops to bail out Kabila. Rebel commanders say their 2,000 fighters face an estimate 5,000 government troops, apparently reinforce by Sudanese soldiers. Sudan deny involvement in Congo. The rebels accuse Kabila of betray the eight-month rebellion that bring him to power in May 1997 through mismanagement and create divisions among Congo's 400 tribes. Rebels attack a village in western Uganda and kill six civilians before soldiers drive them off, a military spokesman say Thursday. The attack occur overnight Wednesday in the village of Chiondo near Kasese, 270 kilometers (170 miles) west of the capital Kampala, say the spokesman, who identify himself only as Lt. Majera. Majera say the attackers be believe to be rebels of the Allied democratic Forces who operate from bases in the foothills of the Rwenzori Mountains that straddle the uganda-congolese border. He say the rebels likely flee back to their bases after the attack. Majera say the attackers avoid a nearby army post when they shoot up the village. It be the gunfire that alert the soldiers, he said, add that they kill two of the assailants. The various rebel groups operate in the region often attack with knives or machetes, either to save on ammunition or because they don't have guns. He have no further details. Under an agreement earlier this year with Congo, Uganda send troops into the neighboring country to flush out the ADF fighters. President Yoweri Museveni insist they will remain there until Ugandan security be guaranteed, despite congolese President Laurent Kabila's protest that Uganda be back congolese rebels attempt to topple him. The anti-kabila rebels claim the Ugandan rebel Lord's Resistance Army, which operate in northern Uganda and enjoy support from Sudan, be fight alongside Kabila's forces together with Sudanese soldiers. The government-owned daily New Vision report Thursday that LRA leader Joseph Kony be badly wound last week and be in hospital in Juba, the large town still under government control in southern Sudan. The Sudan People's Liberation Army, which be fight the government in Khartoum for autonomy for southern Sudan, have wag pitch battles with government troops in the past week as it move on Juba, spokesmen for both sides say. New Vision quote Ugandan Minister of State for Security Muruli Mukasa as say Kony's large camp at al-gabelain, 38 kilometers (24 miles) south of Juba, be destroy last week when the SPLA take control. Muruli say the LRA have be plan to bomb several sites in the Ugandan capital, include the Parliament building, state-run Radio Uganda, unidentified embassies and other public sites, the newspaper said. A day after shoot down a jetliner carry 40 people, rebels clash with government troops near a strategic airstrip in eastern Congo on Sunday. Fighting for the town of Kindu in this vast west african nation subside after rebels launch an artillery barrage into government-held buildings and the airfield, two miles (three kilometers) away. On Saturday, the rebels shoot down a congolese Boeing 727 over the Kindu airport. Rescue workers say there be no survivors from the down plane, the british Broadcasting Corp. report Sunday. Rebels say the airplane be carry 40 troops and ammunition. In the capital, Kinshasa, the private Congolese Airlines, which own the aircraft, say the victims be civilians flee fight in Kindu. It be not possible to confirm either claim independently. Rebel commander Fino Kabangu Kalunga say surface-to-air missiles in the arsenal of his Congolese Democratic Coalition have prevent the government from land aircraft at the airport. Kabangu Kalunga say 3,500 rebel troops and their rwandan allies have close in on government forces from three directions after a week of fighting. He say government troops do not launch a counterattack to Sunday's barrage, and some reportedly retreat on the one road lead out of town. The rebels say they now control one-third of Kindu, which the government have use as a staging area for a counteroffensive against rebel positions in the east. Rebels, who begin their insurgency more than two months ago, accuse President Laurent Kabila of corruption, fail to carry out promise democratic reforms, and stir up hatred among Congo's 400 tribes. early in the conflict, rebels push far into the west, to the outskirts of Congo's capital. then Angola, Zimbabwe and Namibia intervene to help Kabila and drive the rebels back to their bases in eastern Congo. The conflict have draw in many of Congo's neighbors. There be unconfirmed reports that troops from Chad and the Sudan be involve in defend Kindu. Kabila accuse Rwanda and Uganda former allies who instal him in power in May 1997 after an eight-month rebellion of sponsor the rebels. Both countries say they have legitimate security interests in eastern Congo and accuse Kabila of fail to rid the common border area of Rwandan and Ugandan rebels. Back in the golden years, Kasuku wa Ngeyo have a farm and be the head of a 25,000-strong farmers organization in the northeastern breadbasket of this central African nation. A quarter of a century later, the 56-year-old businessman who also run hotels and a tourist camp be broke; the farmers group be a memory. inter-tribal rivalry, loot soldiers, Rwandan refugees and two rebellions in as many years have wipe out half a million head of cattle here, slash coffee and tea exports in half and turn Congo's bucolic eastern region of green pastures, sparkle volcanic lakes and snow-capped mountains into a war zone. nobody be make money any more. People be survive on a sack of beans. They be tire of insecurity and have little hope things will get better, say Kasuku, the son of an italian settler and a Rwandan Tutsi refugee mother. On Aug. 2, Tutsis, political opponents, and disenchant members of President Laurent Kabila's army take up arms, accuse Kabila of corruption, nepotism and foster tribal strife. The war have split Africa's third-largest nation between the government-held west and south and rebel-controlled east, and no political settlement be in sight. Goma, a small trading post at the head of Lake Kivu in eastern Congo, be no longer the starting point for tourists trek to see mountain gorillas. Today, its decay buildings, empty shops and crumble guest houses be home to rebel leaders, soldiers and people displace by violence. The rebels have promise to revitalize the economy by reduce taxes to boost investment. They also say they will pay civil servants who haven't see a paycheck in months or years and invite investors to buy tea and coffee farms and gold and diamond-mining concessions. But the war have also increase tribal animosity especially toward ethnic Tutsis, a tiny but highly successful minority in the eastern region. In 1990, the liberate effect of early political freedoms revive unresolved land disputes and lead to clashes between the Rwandan Tutsis and Hutus who have settle in eastern Congo since the 1930s. mai-mai warriors arm youths from the Hunde and Nande tribes who accuse Tutsis of steal their land, also join the fighting. In 1994, nearly 1 million Rwandan refugees engulf Goma, a town of 30,000. Among them be former Hutu soldiers and militiamen who take part in a 1994 genocide in neighbor Rwanda in which more than half a million tutsi be killed. They bring anti-tutsi ideology with them and sell weapons to congolese tribes, who then join in the persecution of Tutsi landowners and ranchers. People misunderstand political freedoms for anarchy, say Safari Ngezayo, a farmer and hotel owner. We try to mediate between Tutsis and Hutus and other tribes, but how can you talk to people who have blood on their hands and genocide in their heads? In late 1996, congolese Tutsis back by Rwanda attack the refugee camps, dislodge the Hutu fighters and force most of the refugees back home across the border. After an eight-month rebellion back by Rwanda and Uganda, dictator Mobutu Sese Seko flee in May 1997, and Kabila take power. He quickly change the name of the country to Congo, from Zaire. Few people in northeastern Congo expect another rebellion so soon. I blame our politicians. then I blame the foreign powers who keep meddle in our affairs. It be they who support Mobutu and Kabila, and we be pay the interest, Kasuku said. congolese rebels have take their two-month campaign to oust President Laurent Kabila to the Internet. We have to explain to the world audience who we be and what we're fight for, rebel leader Ernest Wamba dia Wamba say on Friday. Besides, the (kabila) government have be use the Internet to tell their side of the story. The 56-year-old history professor at the University of Dar e Salaam in Tanzania say supporters of the Congolese Rally for Democracy in the United States have create a web site for the rebellion.

Jacques Depelchin, the movement's vice president and a former lecturer at the University of California at Berkeley, meet in Washington earlier this week with the U.S. special envoy in the Great Lakes region of Central Africa, Howard Wolpe and with congressmen, Wamba said. Rebel commanders say Tuesday they be poise to overrun an important government-held air base in eastern Congo a battle that could determine the future of the two-month Congolese war. After trek several hundred kilometers (miles) through dense tropical forest, thousands of rebel fighters have gather 19 kilometers (11 miles) outside Kindu, where troops loyal to President Laurent Kabila have use an air base as a launching pad for offensives. If the rebels succeed in capture Kindu, 380 kilometers (235 miles) west of Goma, the rebel headquarters, this will remove the last government stronghold in eastern Congo and pave the way for rebel advance into the mineral-rich southwest. A rebel defeat, on the other hand, would put the coalition of ethnic Tutsis, disenchant members of the congolese army and opposition politicians on the defensive and give a boost to Kabila's efforts to fend off the rebellion launch Aug. 2. Rebel commander Richard Mondo say troops have fire artillery rounds into Kindu Monday and early Tuesday, send the population flee out of town. Advance units have cross the Lualaba River from the north and be meet stiff resistance in the town, he said. Since the assault on the town begin at 3 a.m. (0100 GMT), at least 18 enemy soldiers be kill and 40 take prisoner, Mondo said, add the number be expect to rise. The rebels take casualties, too, but the number be not known. One rebel soldier be wound in the stomach, he said. He say the large Kindu air base, 4 kilometers (2 miles) outside town, be desert and no one appear to be in control. Our soldiers be in the town and the fighting be continuing, rebel battalion commander Arthur Mulunda say in Kalima, 80 kilometers (50 miles) northeast of Kindu. There be no independent confirmation of the rebel claims. On Sunday, a spokesman in Goma boast that Kindu be already under rebel control. In Kinshasa, government spokesman Didier Mumengi say Monday the congolese army be firmly in control of Kindu. Mulunda's 1,500-strong battalion walk 240 kilometers (150 miles) Bukavu at the southern end of Lake Kivu to Kalima, which fell to the rebels Saturday with little resistance. The rebel fighters, clad in brand-new rwandan-made dark green uniforms, rubber rain boots and tot Kalashnikov assault rifles and rocket-propelled grenade launchers, say they be advance slowly through the lush forest of palm trees and razor-sharp tall grass. We've be rest a lot. It take us two weeks to get here, Mondo said. The rebels be now use Kalima, a town with one main street, scatter houses and mud-and-brick huts, to supply troops with rice, cooking oil, drinking water and ammunition. A small, grass airstrip 8 kilometers (5 miles) away from Kalima be just barely long enough for the rebels' russian-built Antonov AN-72 transport aircraft. The rebels have target Kindu since late August, when they be force to retreat from the outskirts of Kinshasa after Angola and Zimbabwe send troops to bail out Kabila. Rebels still control a string of towns in eastern Congo, include Kisangani, the country's third-largest city. A day after shoot down a jetliner, congolese rebels and their rwandan allies push Sunday through government defense lines, show the confidence of a victor in a week-old battle for a strategic air base. fight in Kindu, 32 kilometers (20 miles) northeast of the Elila River bridge, die down after the rebels fire a barrage of artillery into the government-held quarters and the air base, four kilometers (two miles) away. Rebel commander Fino Kabangu Kalunga say the government forces, surround by 3,500 rebel troops from three directions, fail to respond to Sunday's attacks. Some troops reportedly retreat through a single road corridor lead out of the town. On Saturday, the rebels say they shoot down a congolese Boeing 727 which be attempt to land at Kindu air base with 40 troops and ammunition. In Kinshasa, the private Congolese Airlines, which own the aircraft, say the victims be civilians flee fight in Kindu. It be not possible to confirm independently either claim. Kalunga say the airport, although still under government control, be in effect unoperational because of the rebel surface-to-air-missiles deploy nearby. War-weary, physically exhaust and sweaty, hundreds of rebel troops and Rwandan soldiers march through dense tropical forest go to reinforce their comrades at Kindu. After a week of battle for Kindu, rebel fighters have make little progress and fail to capture the town outright. The rebels see Kindu as a major prize in their two-month revolt against President Laurent Kabila, whom they accuse of mismanagement, corruption and warmongering among Congo's 400 tribes. Kabila have turn Kindu into a launching pad for a counteroffensive against rebel positions in eastern Congo. The conflict have draw in many of Congo's neighbors. There be unconfirmed reports that troops from Chad and the Sudan be involve in defend Kindu. Kabila accuse Rwanda and Uganda former allies who instal him in power in May 1997 after an eight-month rebellion of sponsor the new fighting. Both countries say they have legitimate security interests in eastern Congo and accuse Kabila of fail to rid the common border area of Rwandan and Ugandan rebels. Tanks, aircraft and troops from Angola, Zimbabwe and Namibia be support Kabila. The assistance be essential in rout an early rebel offensive in the west that have reach the outskirts of Kinshasa in mid-august. The rebels say they now control one-third of Kindu and be poise to overrun the rest of the town. Under a scorching sun, the column of rebel reinforcements head to Kindu sneak through abandon roadside hamlets. The silence of their march be interrupt only by the singing of crickets and the clanging of the bullet belts hang around the soldiers' necks. Soldiers walk by empty huts make of mud and palm leaves. Some rest in the shade of the umbrella-shaped acacia trees. The soldiers stop for the night at the bridge over the chocolate-colored Elila River, which guard the path to Kindu. There be no immediate comment on the late developments from the government in Kinshasa, which claim earlier in the week it be in control of the tarmac bridge. ","After years of civil war, Congo in October 1998 was again in turmoil as rebel forces fought to overthrow the government of President Kabila.The rebels, ethnic Tutsis, disenchanted members of Kabila's army and his political opponents, were said to be supported by Rwandan and Ugandan forces while Kabila was backed by Angola, Zimbabwe, Namibia, Sudan and Ugandan rebels.At first the rebels advanced to the outskirts of the capital, Kinshasa, but foreign troops pushed them back to the extreme eastern part of the country.The rebels then launched a counter offensive but by mid-October it was not clear who would prevail.","Civil strife, tribal rivalry and rebellion has given Congolese rebels control of 40 percent of Congo.The rebels are ethnic Tutsis, disenchanted members of President Kabila's army and opposition politicians.They are accused of being puppets to Uganda and Rwanda.They launched an attack in Kindu, the strategic town and airbase in eastern Congo used by government to halt their advances.Rebels downed a jetliner carrying 40 people from Kindu but fighting has subsided.They have taken their two-month campaign to the Internet to tell their side of the story.Kabila, refusing to negotiate with them, is accused of mismanagement and causing tribal divisiveness.","Rebel groups, mostly Tutsis, but backed by Rawandas and Ugandans are fighting the Congolese government of President Kabila, who is accused of corruption and sowing dissent among Congo's 400 tribes.The government controls the western part of the country but the rebels are gaining in the east.Heavy fighting has occurred near the village of Kindu, which has an airfield critical for supplying government troops.Rebels shot down an airliner near there, killing all 40 aboard, which they say were soldiers but the airline says were civilians.The rebels have promised reforms and a revitalization of the economy; however, the war has increased tribal animosity.","Likely ADF rebels attack Chiondo, Uganda, killing 6 civilians.Soldiers repel attack, killing 2 rebels.Anti-Kabila rebels start a web-site and post their mission statement in a media campaign.Congo Tutsi rebels meet resistance as they enter Kindu and adjacent strategic government airbase.Thousands of rebels in place for battle.After 3 days, battle not going well for rebels.Rebels shoot down jet; say soldiers on board.Government claims Kindu refugees on board; unconfirmed.Rebels and Rwandan allies push through government defenses at Kindu.Fighting subsides after rebel artillery strikes.Population suffers from rebellions and tribal conflict."

Both presidents have hint they might not attend the meeting of the 18 asia-pacific Economic Cooperation nations next month in the malaysian capital out of concern for Anwar. The former deputy prime minister and finance minister of Malaysia be arrest Sept. 20 on corruption and illegal sex charges, then bring to court with a black eye and bruises. Philippine President Joseph Estrada tell business and political leaders in Singapore on Tuesday that he have not make up his mind. Estrada call Anwar his friend and said, I think all of us here believe that due process and human rights should be respected. Indonesian President B.J. Habibie may also stay away, his foreign minister, Ali Alatas, say after the two new Southeast asian leaders hold a half-hour private meeting. If Habibie pass up APEC, Alatas said, it will be because he have difficulty leave the country while there be no vice president, while there be so many problems to deal with. Habibie have already cancel a state visit to Malaysia, cite difficulties at home. The meeting be delay for almost 90 minutes when a mechanical fault be discover in one of two indonesian helicopters that be to have fly Estrada and his entourage through heavy rain from Singapore. A ferry be charter for the 45-minute sea journey. Habibie apologize when Estrada finally arrive at the Melia Panorama Hotel. Estrada replied, That's all right. The two men, who have each be in power less than five months, meet alois June 30 inaugural speech to give the underclass a fair share of the country's wealth. Habibie take office May 21, hours after his predecessor and mentor, Suharto, be force from power after national protests and street riots over Indonesia's collapse economy. top finance officials from 14 countries in the asia-pacific region advise Asia's batter economies on Sunday to adopt further reforms in their effort to restore stability. Among the necessary steps be for countries to restructure their economies and corporations to make them less susceptible to abuse by narrow political interests, the officials suggested. The deputy finance ministers and deputy central bank governors meet for two days to review progress on the Manila Framework, an agreement reach last November that aim to promote regional economic stability. Many of Asia's economies have plunge into recession since that agreement. collapse currencies, weaken demand and high unemployment now characterize a region that once boast some of the world's high economic growth rates. The worsen financial gloom be likely to dominate talks at next week's summit in Kuala Lumpur of leaders from the 18-nation asia-pacific Economic Cooperation forum. The summit be to take place on Nov. 17-18. In a joint statement, the officials cite risks include slow global growth, with particular mention of Russia's worsen economy, and the need to speed up social programs to help the poor in the worst-hit countries. Stanley Fischer, deputy manage director of the International Monetary Fund, note that some countries have already reform their banking sectors. But he stress the need for corporate restructuring as well. These be not easy things to do, he said. Meanwhile, Malaysia's most prominent dissident predict that the country's prime minister would declare a state of emergency after the APEC meeting ends in Kuala Lumpur, a report say Sunday. Former Deputy Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim, now on trial on charges of corruption and sexual misconduct, make the warning in an interview with Monday's edition of Time magazine. Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad fire Anwar in September, say he be morally unfit to lead, then have him expel from Malaysia's rule party. Anwar deny the allegations and say they be fabricate because Mahathir consider his popularity a threat to the prime minister's 17-year rule. The philippine ambassador to Malaysia say Friday he be summon to the Malaysian Foreign Ministry to explain his president's statements in support of dissident Anwar Ibrahim. Ambassador Jose Brillantes say in a radio interview from Kuala Lumpur that he be call Thursday after the malaysian dissident's eldest daughter meet Philippine President Joseph Estrada. They express their concern about what's happening and the statements come out of the Philippines, Brillantes tell radio station DZXL in Manila. Brillantes say he explain that follow the 1986 people power revolt against the late dictator Ferdinand Marcos, Filipinos' react strongly to real and perceived violations of human rights. I just explain our culture to them, he said. Anwar be fire as deputy premier in September and later arrested, appear in court with a black eye, bruises and a neck brace. He say he be beat by security guards. Estrada have express support for Anwar, whom he consider a personal friend, and indicate he may not attend a summit of Asia Pacific Rim nations in Malaysia next month. He have also say Anwar should be hold in house arrest during his upcoming trial on corruption and sexual misconduct charges. Anwar have deny the charges, call them politically motivated. On Thursday, Estrada tell Anwar's daughter, Nurul Izzah, to tell her father not to waver because he be fight for a cause, the cause of the malaysian people. He said, however, that his support be personal and moral and not mean to interfere in the internal problems of Malaysia. Brillantes said: The expression of personal opinion be allow in our culture and it be not surprising for that to happen. He also say there be no connection between Anwar's case and the summit meeting in Malaysia of the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation forum. We still consider, as express by our president, that APEC be important to us, he said. He do not say how the malaysian officials reacted, but he say he be not reprimanded. Meanwhile, a group Philippine legislators say they plan to attend Anwar's trial, which open Nov. 2. We feel that be observers to his trial will be our silent statement of our democratic aspirations for all Asia, the group say in a statement. Again bowing to chinese pressure, Taiwan will send its chief economic planner to represent President Lee Teng-hui at November's Asian Pacific Economic Cooperation forum summit in Kuala Lumpur, the Foreign Ministry say Friday. Lee decide to send Chiang Pin-kung to the informal leaders summit on Nov. 17-18 after give much thought to an invitation from malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad, the ministry said. Presentation of an invitation to Lee by the host nation with the understanding that it will be politely refuse be an annual formality that allow Taiwan to maintain a semblance of dignity and the host to avoid controversy with China. Beijing's threat to boycott APEC's annual meeting if Lee attend have force him to send a stand-in every year since the inaugural summit in 1993. China claims Taiwan as a breakaway province and argue that only sovereign nations be allow to send their heads of state. APEC groups Australia, Brunei, Canada, Chile, China, Hong Kong, Indonesia, Japan, South Korea, Malaysia, Mexico, New Zealand, Papua New Guinea, the Philippines, Singapore, Taiwan, Thailand and the United States. Russia, Vietnam and Peru will join in November. Indonesian President B.J. Habibie find attend a summit of asia-pacific leaders difficult because of his concerns about the arrest of Malaysia's former deputy prime minister, a Thai newspaper report Sunday. asia-pacific leaders be schedule to meet next month in Malaysia for an annual economics meeting. last week, Philippine President Joseph Estrada say he be consider not go to the asia-pacific Economic Cooperation forum because of Anwar Ibrahim's arrest. I'm very concern over how my friend Anwar Ibrahim have be treated, Habibie be quote as say by the english-language newspaper The Nation. I'm concern because people should not forget that Anwar Ibrahim have contribute a lot for the benefit of his country. Anwar be a charismatic politician who be once pick to be the successor to Malaysia's long-serving Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad. But he be suddenly fire by Mahathir on Sept. 2 after the two differ on economic policy. He then begin speak out against Mahathir and be arrest Sept. 20. Anwar have be accuse of engage in homosexual acts illegal under Malaysia law, but the charges be generally see as a pretext for his political persecution. In a court appearance last week, Anwar's face be bruise and he say he have be beat by police, heighten international attention to his case. Because of human rights involve and I think it be universal people should be give the chance to defend themselves, Habibie be quote as say in the interview conduct Saturday. People should not be tortured. Habibie say Anwar's dismissal should not have be base on things which have not be proven. On attend the APEC meeting, he said, It's difficult for me. But he say he would consult parliament, adding, I'm not come personally but as the president of 211 million people of Indonesia. Like Estrada, Habibie serve as his country's vice president when Anwar be deputy prime minister, make them counterparts on the international affairs circuit. A group of high-powered U.S. investors in Southeast Asia on Monday applaud efforts to perk up Thailand's stagger economy, say they have be assure by top Thai officials that key economic reform packages will soon be approved. After meetings with Thai Cabinet members, include Prime Minister Chuan Leekpai, members of the U.S.-ASEAN Business Council say they be confident in the future of Thailand's economy and promise their companies would continue to invest here and elsewhere in the region. We would be quick as observers to applaud the aggressiveness of the reform package that we see be propose in front of your government today, say business council chairman George David, who be also chairman and CEO of United Technologies Corp. Thailand be hit hard by last year's asian economic crisis, and the propose economic reform legislation focus on resolve the massive bad debt of private companies, which be hinder a recovery. This be very aggressive, good reform. It's very impressive, David said, add that Finance Minister Tarrin Nimmanahaeminda promise Parliament would pass reform measures in months, not years. The U.S.-ASEAN Business Council be a private organization comprise about 300 U.S. companies with substantial investments in Southeast Asia. David say the five executives in the delegation represent dlrs 300 billion in assets. The council's lobby efforts with the U.S. and Southeast asian governments have concentrate on remove tariffs and other barriers to overseas trade. The delegation will travel to Kuala Lumpur for the asia-pacific Economic Cooperation forum Nov. 14-18. David say free trade should be a focus of discussions among the government leaders attending. What I hope they will say at APEC be a very strong affirmation of the free-trade agenda and a very strong affirmation of the foreign direct investment agenda, he added. In little more than a week, the world's leaders will converge on this businesslike city in the heart of Southeast Asia for the annual meeting of the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation forum. They could hardly be meet in a more provocative place. On Sept. 1, Malaysia discontinue trading in its currency, the ringgit, and impose sweeping controls on the flow of capital in its stock and currency markets, particularly on investment from overseas. In do so, the malaysian prime minister, Mahathir Mohamad, in effect slam the door on the global economy that President Clinton and the other leaders be come here to champion. Mahathir's decision draw jeers from international investors and policy- makers, who warn that Malaysia be seek a quick fix that would retard its desperately need reforms and leave it the odd man out when Asia finally recover from the regional malaise. Now, though, Mahathir's allies be marshal new economic data that they say indicate that capital controls be breathe new life into the country's moribund economy. Malaysia's foreign reserves rise strongly in September, and there be anecdotal evidence that consumers be start to spend again. It's nice to be able to say that since we adopt capital controls, the economy have improved, say Zainal Aznam Yusof, the deputy director of the Institute of Strategic and International Studies, a research organization here that help draft the policies. But we want to see whether this be strongly sustainable. Critics say it be predictable that capital controls would be a short-term tonic to Malaysia's economy. Because the country be shelter from the vagaries of capital flows and currency fluctuations, they said, the government have be able to ease interest rates and encourage consumer spending. Still, the mere fact that Malaysia's experiment have yield some positive results guarantees that the issue will come up during the APEC meeting. With Mahathir lead the campaign, the cause of capital controls will have a fiery advocate who have a penchant for get under the skin of Westerners. Mahathir be a very outspoken political leader, say Chia Yew Boon, an independent analyst in Singapore. There be no way the likes of Clinton or Jiang Zemin be go to be able to muzzle him, he added, refer to President Jiang of China. Policy-makers in the United States have express fears that if Malaysia's gambit be see as successful, other economically weakened countries in the region, like Indonesia, might be tempt to try it. so far, indonesian officials have say they would stick to the recovery plan devise by the International Monetary Fund, which stress economic austerity and open markets. But officials in Japan have express some sympathy for Mahathir's policies, while Paul Krugman, an economist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, have advocate use them as an emergency measure. Yusof say recent events have vindicate Malaysia's contention that it need to insulate itself from the ravages of the global financial system. He say the recent near-collapse of a prominent american hedge fund underscore how sudden flows of capital can have destructive consequences. The Long-Term Capital Management hedge fund, base in Greenwich, Conn., be nearly wreck by a series of wrong bets on Treasury securities after the collapse of the economy in Russia prompt a flight of capital out of that country. The LTCM fiasco really provide a case study of what could go wrong in the global economy, Yusof said. With capital controls as protection, Yusof say Malaysia be pick up the pieces of its shattered economy. In addition to grow foreign reserves, he say Malaysia have improve its trade balance and revive consumer purchases of durable goods. Foreign investors have also not wholly abandon Malaysia, as experts have predict they would. While foreign direct investment fell in September to $142 million, from an average monthly rate of $321 million for the period from January through September it do not dry up completely. For every comforting statistic, though, the critics produce an alarm one. They say the increase in Malaysia's foreign reserves be merely due to the new capital restrictions, which stipulate that malaysian currency hold outside the country would be worthless unless repatriate by Sept. 30. The skeptics also note that bank lending decline in September, despite several reductions in interest rates. So the consumers who be buy new cars and home appliances be merely dip into their savings, which mean the buying spree will end when their savings be depleted. The argument be that by impose capital controls, you'd regain control over monetary policy, which would increase the supply of money and lessen the liquidity crunch, say K.S. Jomo, a professor of political economy at the University of Malaya here. But that's not happening. The big flaw in Malaysia's policy, Jomo and others said, be its timing. With the asian crisis more than a year old, much of the foreign capital that be in the country have already gone. The critics say Mahathir have spook would-be investors without even lock in the ones who use to be here. There be a case to be make for the temporary imposition of capital controls, but to avert a crisis, not to respond to one, Jomo said. In fact, other asian currencies, like the Indonesian rupiah and the Thai baht, have actually rebound since Malaysia suspend trading in its currency and fix the exchange rate at 3.8 ringgit to the dollar. Analysts liken the situation to buy an insurance policy for a disaster that have come and gone. more important, the capital controls be slow down much-needed corporate and bank reforms. The government's rescue of Renong, a major conglomerate with close ties to Mahathir, be go ahead, though some analysts predict the government will eventually scrap the much-criticized plan. The rescue of politically connect companies remain a tense issue here. On Monday, during the trial of Malaysia's former deputy prime minister, Anwar Ibrahim, on charges of corruption and sex-related crimes, Anwar angrily deny Mahathir's claim that he have approve the bailout. Anwar's sensational trial be a reminder that Mahathir's economic policies cannot be disentangle from politics. Malaysia's 72-year-old prime minister clash with his former protege over how to respond to the asian crisis, and he dismiss Anwar the day after impose capital controls. During boom times, Mahathir win support for his policies by wrap them in anti-foreigner language. In a speech on Monday, he attack a familiar target, say foreign currency traders be the cause of the currency turmoil, adding: They spread it worldwide. They precipitate the current recession in every country. But Mahathir's treatment of Anwar have stir anger and spark grow social unrest in Malaysia. With protesters chant for reform on the usually orderly streets of this city, experts say Mahathir need capital controls to work in order to soothe the country's agitate population. Things will heat up if the economy do not improve, say Chandra Muzaffar, a professor of political science at the University of Malaya. then the whole question of Mahathir and his leadership will remain an issue. In that regard, at least, the leaders who converge on Kuala Lumpur in two weeks will be able to identify with their embattled host. The leaders of Malaysia's rule party meet Tuesday to discuss a replacement for oust deputy prime minister Anwar Ibrahim, who face trial next month in a case that will test the country's legal system. Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad, 72, say last week he could drop dead at any time. But because of the large number of candidates for the deputy's job within the ruling United Malays National Organization, a decision be not expect quickly. The party leaders, who have be conduct a national campaign to explain to Malaysians why the popular Anwar be fire Sept. 2, will also confer on what to do now that the High Court judge have ban all comments on Anwar's guilt or innocence. The ruling coalition have schedule a giant rally in the capital Saturday, aim at draw in the youth to whom Anwar's campaign of reform have the most appeal. Mahathir, who have heart bypass surgery in 1989, have groom anwar, 51, as his successor. But he fire his protege from his posts as deputy prime minister and finance minister on grounds he be morally unfit to lead. The two have differ over economic policy and Anwar have say Mahathir fear he be a threat to his 17-year rule. Anwar be also dump from the ruling party, and after two weeks of nationwide rallies at which he call for government reform and Mahathir's resignation, he be arrest under a law that allow police to hold him indefinitely, and prevent him from see his family and lawyers. On Tuesday, Mahathir denounce demonstrators who have flock by the thousands to the streets of downtown Kuala Lumpur in recent weeks, call them part of a plot to topple the government. Baton-wielding riot police have disperse the crowd with tear gas and water cannons, arrest more than 100 people. They decide that the government should be bring down through demonstrations, riots, the Bernama news agency quote Mahathir as say in Sarawak state on Borneo Island. He be expect to return to Kuala Lumpur later Tuesday to chair the UMNO meeting. After Anwar appear in court with a black eye, bruise face, neck and arms, his case draw international attention, particularly from the presidents of the Philippines and Indonesia, who have raise the possibility they might not attend an 18-nation summit in Malaysia next month. The United States would downgrade President Bill Clinton's visit to Kuala Lumpur next month if Anwar continue to be mistreated, the Wall Street Journal quote an official in Washington as saying. Clinton be schedule to go to Malaysia for the meeting of the asia-pacific Economic Cooperation forum. wear a neck brace Monday after a court-ordered hospital checkup, Anwar be order to stand trial Nov. 2 on four charges of abuse his powers to interfere with a police investigation. His trial be to halt on Nov. 14 and resume after the APEC meetings. He have plead innocent to all charges, include another corruption count and five charges of sodomy. He face 14 years in prison and a fine on each corruption count and 20 years, plus whipping, on each sexual charge, if convicted. Anwar be arrest Sept. 20 under the Internal Security Act, which allow jail without trial. Under the same law, police also arrest 17 people consider Anwar associates and a risk to national security. As of Tuesday, 12 have be released. The UMNO supreme council be expect to prepare a list of top candidates for Anwar's job for Mahathir's final decision. The Star newspaper, which be close to the government, list the favorites as Foreign Minister Abdullah Ahmad Badawi and Education Minister Najib Tun Razak. other top contenders include Mahathir's confidant Daim Zainuddin, a former finance minister bring back into the Cabinet in June as special functions minister in charge of economic recovery. Rafidah Aziz, the international trade and industry minister, and Tengku Razaleigh Hamzah, a former finance minister, be also in the running. The last time the asia-pacific region hold its annual summit to promote free trade, Japan's prime minister assure everyone that his economy wouldn't be the next victim of Asia's financial crisis. Canada, the host country, be criticize by some in Canada for crack down on demonstrations against Suharto, Indonesia's iron-fisted ruler at the time. And President Bill Clinton, whose popularity and boom economy be the envy of the planet, join everyone else in urge countries such as Thailand and South Korea to bite the bullet and comply with the tough economic reforms that the International Monetary Fund be demanding. My, how the challenges have grown, as the 21-nation asia-pacific Economic Cooperation forum prepares for its November summit in Malaysia. Japan the world's second large economy, and Asia's financial anchor be suffer through its bad recession since World War II, and that bad news cost Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto his job. Suharto, who rule Indonesia for 32 years, be drive out of power by a violent, pro-democracy movement, and the world's fourth most populous country be in real trouble financially. Wall Street be now cop with a steep downturn. And even though Clinton have promise to attend the APEC meeting, some people wonder how he can do that while face an impeachment inquiry back home, thanks to the Monica Lewinsky sex scandal. Worse still, Asia's economic crisis be show signs of go global, and more and more economists be criticize the IMF for the way it be handle its bailouts. other well-respected economists be go even further, question whether a free-market philosophy doesn't leave some countries too vulnerable to the chaos of major market speculators. In fact, Malaysia isn't the only country try self-defense mechanisms such as capital controls. Hong Kong recently spend a fortune invest in its stock market to ward off speculators. And Washington be try to figure out what to do with hedge funds after watch its Federal Reserve help bail out a major one that be go under, and see the investments of others send the U.S. dollar into a tailspin against Japan's yen. Ironically, Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad, who make one of his typical anti-free-market comments during last year's summit, probably could have open this year's with an I tell you so. But even he be have major domestic problems. Mahathir, 72, who be widely credit with create modern Malaysia during his 17 years in power, dismiss Anwar Ibrahim, his expect successor, in an apparent dispute over how to battle the country's economic mess. instead of step aside, Anwar launch a reform movement across Malaysia that quickly lead to big rallies demand that Mahathir step down. The prime minister use riot police to thwart the protests, and jailed Anwar, charge him with corruption and sex crimes, and schedule his trial for Nov. 2. The trial will be interrupt during the Nov. 12-18 APEC meetings, but Mahathir's treatment of Anwar and his reform movement already have be criticize by APEC members such as Australia, Indonesia, the Philippines and the United States. President B.J. Habibie of Indonesia and Philippine President Joseph Estrada consider Anwar a friend, and Estrada won't say whether he plan to attend this year's APEC summit. John S. Wolf, the U.S. ambassador for APEC, recently acknowledge that it won't be easy for APEC members to meet in Malaysia as the asian crisis ricochets around the world with no clear sign what will happen next. But he also say the leaders of the 21 APEC members should aim for a productive meeting. Wolf say such gatherings give members a chance to discuss IMF bailout strategies and the free-market philosophy, to resolve bilateral disputes, and to continue to reduce tariff rates to help struggle countries improve their exports. This have be a lousy year in general. It have affect all of us. It have set APEC back, and there be no silver bullet to solve the crisis right away, say Wolf. But we should welcome the chance to work together and to develop a sense of what's possible. so far, APEC have be criticize for do little during the financial crisis. But next month it hop to complete a plan that would lift trade barriers in nine key industries: environmental products and services, energy, fisheries, forestry, toys, jewelry, medical goods, chemical products and telecommunications. Besides the United States, APEC, which account for half of all global trade consist of these members: Australia, Brunei, Canada, Chile, China, Hong Kong, Indonesia, Japan, Malaysia, Mexico, New Zealand, Papua New Guinea, the Philippines, Singapore, South Korea, Taiwan and Thailand. During the Malaysia meeting, APEC also will include three new members: Russia one of the late victims of the financial crisis Vietnam and Peru. The agenda might be global, but the menu will be malaysian when world leaders meet next week for the asia-pacific Economic Cooperation forum. Pacific Rim leaders, include U.S. President Bill Clinton, will sample local dishes at a luncheon plan for the end of their two-day summit. It's expect to be a hot affair. Spicy delicacies on the menu be satay kajang, a beef or chicken kebab in peanut sauce; ayam percik, chicken curry with chilies; soto ayam, a malaysian chicken soup, and fried rice village-style, the Star newspaper report in Monday editions. Desert will be simple: fresh tropical fruit, say Maleia Marsden, general manager of the Cyberview Lodge, where the leaders be expect to stay during the summit Nov. 17-18. APEC groups Australia, Brunei, Canada, Chile, China, Hong Kong, Indonesia, Japan, South Korea, Malaysia, Mexico, New Zealand, Papua New Guinea, the Philippines, Singapore, Taiwan, Thailand and the United States. Russia, Vietnam and Peru will also join APEC this year.

A burly policeman bent to cover a bloodied corpse with whatever be at hand a sodden piece of cardboard, a plastic shopping bag. Two people be kill and at least 21 injured when an explosives-rigged car blow up Friday at Jerusalem's Mahane Yehuda market, only meters (yards) from the site of a suicide bomb 16 months ago. At police barricades set up along Jerusalem's busy thoroughfare, soldiers and police hold back crowd of people, some frantic about loved ones who have be shop in the crowded market only hours before the start of the jewish Sabbath. Please, please, be there a girl with red hair who be hurt? an older, heavyset woman say tearfully, try to push her way past police. A young female soldier pat her arm consolingly. Some of the onlookers give vent to fury over the new peace agreement, which be be debate by Israel's Cabinet even as the blast occurred. Death to Arabs! Death to arafat! a small crowd of demonstrators shouted. Police try to grab one of them, but he escape into the crowd. The explosives-rigged car be a mass of twisted metal, with only the steer column intact. Next to the wreckage lay a completely char body with stumps of arms and legs apparently that of the bomber. Witnesses say they hear a series of explosions. Although shop windows close to the car be shattered, market stall only a few more feet (yards) away be completely intact, and stack with neat piles of bananas and onions. Eyewitness Yaakov Shlomo say initial, small blasts scar most onlookers away. When the big explosion went, there be already not that many people nearby, he said. That be a miracle from heaven. Shlomo Meir, a black-clad Orthodox Jew, be stand nearby when he hear a blast. When he tuirned he saw fire. It be terrible, he said, red-eyed. I thought, `again!' only a block away, some stalls be still open and shoppers be buy produce. One woman, with almost maniacal determination, sort through a pile of oranges. We can't stop what we're do when this happens, she say grimly. By the police barricades, wear bright-orange vests, stand a group of Orthodox Jewish volunteers who search scenes of accidents and attacks for body parts, in keep with their religious belief that bodies must be bury intact. One young volunteer squint down the street as his group wait for permission to begin its grisly task. It's hard, this work, but it's very important to us, he said.

We will build also in Har Homa as we will build in every part of Jerusalem, Netanyahu tell a crowd of political supporters in Jerusalem, By 2000 there will be homes at Har Homa.

The Israeli military say it could not confirm the suicide bombers' identities and hometowns, but they be disclose by palestinian security officials and also report by palestinian media. One live near the Anata refugee camp, north of Jerusalem, and the other live in the West Bank village of Silat al Harithiya, outside the town of Jenin.

Although Hamas initially claim responsibility through anonymous phone call to the police for Friday's attack all sides now have agree that it be Islamic Jihad that carry it out. Israel's Cabinet announce within hours of a market bomb Friday that it will put off a vote indefinitely on whether to ratify the Wye River accord until Palestinians crack down far on terrorism. Israel radio say the 18-member Cabinet debate on the Wye River accord would resume only after Yasser Arafat's Palestinian Authority fulfil all of its commitments under the agreement, include arrest Islamic militants. The Cabinet also insist that Arafat convene the palestinian National Council, a parliament in exile, to abrogate the palestinian National Charter, which call for Israel's destruction. The israeli Cabinet have convene for a second day in an attempt to approve the Wye agreement. To our sorrow, since the Wye agreement ... there have be relentless terrorist attacks against Israeli citizens, accord to a Cabinet statement read on the radio. Israel radio quote officials say the Cabinet would also decide to renew construction of the Har Homa neighborhood in the traditionally Arab sector of Jerusalem. Groundbreaking there in March 1997 lead to a break-off in negotiations with the Palestinians. The militant palestinian movement Islamic Holy War say Saturday that it carry out the suicide bombing in a Jerusalem market on Friday, which prompt arrests by the palestinian Authority overnight. Palestinian officials say they have jail several of the small but radical group's members from the West Bank, and raid and then shut down a nursery school link to the organization in Bethlehem, which be control by the Palestinians. The two bombers who carry out Friday's attack, which lead the Israeli Cabinet to suspend deliberations on the land-for-security accord sign with the Palestinians last month, be identify as members of Islamic Holy War from West Bank villages under Israeli security control. Ramadan Abdallah Shallah, the damascus-based leader of Islamic Holy War, say martyr from his movement have carry out the Jerusalem attack in response to Israel's settlement policy and Judaization of the West Bank. He speak in an interview with Monte Carlo Radio, an Arabic station broadcast from Paris that be widely listen to in the Middle East. A leaflet sign by the group and fax to Reuters in Jerusalem say the heroic attack, in which 24 people be injure and the 2 bombers killed, have be carry out to confront the great conspiracy that aim to liquidate the palestinian cause through the Oslo and Wye Plantation agreements of submission. Islamic Holy War and its counterpart, Hamas, have denounce as a sellout of palestinian rights the 1993 Oslo self-rule accord and the late agreement, know as the Wye Memorandum, name for the Wye Plantation in Maryland, where the deal be work out with strenuous american mediation. Shallah's claim of responsibility from abroad contrast with the muted response of Islamic Holy War's leadership in the Gaza Strip, which have reportedly give commitments to the palestinian Authority to refrain from such attacks. We have no knowledge in the movement about the operation that occur in Jerusalem, say Nafez Azzam, a senior leader of Islamic Holy War in Gaza. From its conditions we consider it likely that it be an individual effort. The palestinian cabinet, in a statement issue after a meeting on Friday night, accuse foreign forces of stand behind the attack. One cabinet member, who decline to be identified, point a finger at Iran, say a search of one bomber's home have uncover a letter he have write to the iranian supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, express condolences for the recent killing of several iranian diplomats in Afghanistan. Iran, which have back militant Islamic groups oppose to the arab-israeli peace efforts, have denounce the Wye agreement, brand Yasser Arafat, the Palestinian leader, a traitor to the palestinian cause. The palestinian cabinet promise to crack down on the militants, who it say be jeopardize the recovery of palestinian land and hop for statehood by give Israel a pretext to postpone carry out the Wye accord. The israeli Cabinet suspend a meeting to ratify the agreement after the bombing, demand that the Palestinians conduct an all-out war on terror. Israeli officials have no comment Saturday on the measures take by the palestinian Authority on Friday. The Wye agreement call for an israeli troop withdrawal from 13 percent more of the West Bank in exchange for specific palestinian measures against violent militants. A Palestinian security official say several Islamic Holy War members be arrest in the West Bank on Friday night. Arrests be also report in the Gaza Strip. Itaf Alayan, a supporter of the group who run the Islamic Purity Nursery in Bethlehem, say palestinian officers have raid the school and confiscate videotapes and educational cassettes before lock it up. The two bombers be identify as Youssef Zughayer, 21, from Anata, near Jerusalem, and his brother-in-law, Suleiman Tahayneh, 24, from silat al-harithiya, near the West Bank town of Jenin. Both have serve time in Israeli jails and be know to be members of Islamic Holy War. We never think he would do something like this, say Muhammad Zughayer, Youssef's father. We condemn such acts, but the only thing we can do now be to say may he rest in peace. On a warm, sunny morning last Friday, at the time he usually leave for work at his family's produce store, Youssef Sughayer say goodbye to his grandmother for the last time and ride off to his death. Relatives say that the 21-year-old palestinian from this village near Jerusalem show no sign that he be head for a suicide mission with his brother-in-law as part of a secret cell of Islamic Holy War. Their car-bomb blew apart two hours later in a Jerusalem market, kill both men and wound 24 people. Don't grieve for me, he write in a farewell note, accord to relatives who find it later. If you cry, cry with happiness that i'm a martyr. Don't serve bitter coffee, serve sweets. I'm go to Paradise. At the family's stone house outside Jerusalem on Sunday, visitors pay condolence calls be serve sweet juice, not coffee, as Sughayer's relatives try to make sense of what he have done. The young man, once an ace student, have come of age in Israeli prisons. Jailed for a year at age 15 for stone israeli cars during the riots of the palestinian uprising, he be imprison again at 17, that time for three-and-a-half years for similar offenses and affiliation with Islamic Holy War. Relatives say he be an impressionable teen-ager, influence by Islamic militants with whom he be jailed. Sughayer come out of prison more devout, and harden by mistreatment at the hands of the Israelis, relatives said. His cellmates teach him the doctrine of holy war and about the glories of martyrdom, say an old brother, Samih Sughayer. They sow it in his heart, he said. He want to be a martyr in the cause of God. But that reality, suddenly so clear Sunday, be not so apparent when Sughayer be free seven months ago. He seem normal, say his brother. He go to work at the grocery store, he finish his high school classes and he want to enroll in the university. He be suppose to take a driving test in a few days. If he be plan something, we didn't see it. He would stay up late at night after work, study the Koran and praying, but he show no outward signs of rage toward Israel. He would joke about things and say that whatever happen be God's will, say a brother-in-law, who insist on anonymity. He be an easygoing guy. last Thursday, Sughayer buy a batter red Fiat and park it near his house. When someone at home ask about the car he say nothing, and family members assume it be one of the stolen vehicles often find here. On Friday morning he leave with the car, meet his brother-in-law and old jail buddy, Suleiman Tahayneh, who come from his village near the West Bank town of Jenin. Tahayneh have his own score to settle with the Israelis. His leg have be amputate after he be shoot in a confrontation with Israeli troops during the uprising, his relatives said. The Fiat be load with explosives, and the two men drive to the market. That evening, when concerned members of the Sughayer family gather to await news of their miss relative, a man arrive and tell them that he have sell his car to youssef the previous day. It be a red Fiat, the same car they have see near the house, and the same type of car that news reports say have explode in the marketplace. At midnight, Israeli security forces raid the house and interrogate family members. The last, grim pieces of the puzzle fell into place. Up to the last minute on Thursday night we be talk together, say Sughayer's old brother, Ali, who work with him past midnight at the produce store. He ask me about someone who have move his hardware shop to another village, about how he be doing. Earlier we eat together, and we talk about give charity to the poor. He wasn't nervous. He have plans for the future, Ali continued. maybe the people in his group convince him to do this, and he could not refuse. We do not expect this from him. A car rig with explosives blow up Friday morning in Jerusalem's Mahane Yehuda market pack with Israelis shop for the jewish Sabbath, kill two people and wound 21. The Islamic militant group Hamas, which have try to stop the peace agreement, claim responsibility, police said. In response to the attack, the Israeli cabinet suspend ratification of the Wye agreement until there be verification that the palestinian authority be indeed fight terrorism. The Israeli Cabinet also announce it will begin to build houses in the controversial jewish settlement of Har Homa in east Jerusalem. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu have hold up the work in recent months in an apparent attempt to not disrupt negotiations with the Palestinians. Aides to Netanyahu be not immediately available for comment. The Cabinet ministers have just begin a second day of of talks on the peace agreement about a mile (kilometer) away from the entrance to the market and just meters (yards) from the site of a suicide bomb last year. In Friday's explosion, the rigged car, a red Fiat, blow up at about 9:45 a.m. (0745 GMT) at the entrance of Mahane Yehuda market, just meters (yards) away from the site of a suicide bombing in July 1997. Witnesses hear a series of small explosions. Yair Cohen, 43, say he be buy cookies when he saw a car drive slowly, with smoke come out of the hood and exhaust pipes. People start to shout `car on fire.' After a while, we hear a blast, and something hit me in the stomach, say Cohen who be treat for minor injuries at Hadassah Hospital. The car be a mass of twisted metal sit in the middle of the main intersection outside the market. Flames shoot 100 feet (30 meters) in the air. A char corpse, cover by a blanket, lay several meters away. Streams of soot-black water ran in the street. Another bare-legged body lay in the street, face down, in a pool of blood below the head. Rescue workers cover the body with sodden pieces of cardboard box and plastic shopping bags. There be hysteria, people be running, say Eliad Duan, an Israeli border policeman who be patrol the market and be lightly injured. One heavy-set woman, apparently in shock, climb into an ambulance, weeping. Three paramedics talk to her, persuade her that she do not need medical treatment, and after a few moments she climb out of the vehicle again. Soldiers and police wear plastic gloves hold back the crowds. It's dangerous stay back! they shouted. just a block away from the blast, shoppers go about their business. One young woman shopper said: We can't stop with what we be do when this happens. Hassan Asfour, a palestinian peace negotiator, say the palestinian Authority condemn the attack. This be a crime and whoever commits this, hurt the interests of the palestinian people. The radical group Islamic Jihad claim responsibility Saturday for the suicide bombing of a crowded Jerusalem market and promise more attacks to try to block the new peace accord. This heroic operation be not the first and not go to be the last, the group say in a leaflet faxed to news organizations. We refuse any political agreement that would recognize the Zionist enemy. The leaflet could not immediately be authenticated, but its style be consistent with that of past communications from the group. An Islamic Jihad official in the syrian capital of Damascus confirm that the group's leader Ramadan Abdullah Shallah claim responsibility for Friday's bombing in an interview with the paris-based Radio Monte Carlo. Palestinian security sources and the families of the dead bombers have already identify them as Islamic Jihad activists. At least half a dozen other Islamic activists have be round up since the bombing, the sources said. Although Hamas initially claim responsibility through anonymous phone call to the police, all sides now have agree that it be Islamic Jihad that carry it out. There be no immediate explanation for the inaccurate claim, but the two groups have carry out attacks together in the past as part of their goal of stop the peace process. set the stage for a new quarrel over how to crack down on militants, Israel be demand that the military wings of two radical Islamic groups be outlawed, while the palestinian Authority insist it have already ban them. Implementation of the israeli-palestinian land-for-security accord, sign Oct. 23 in Washington, be to have begin this past week, but have hit various snags. most recently, Israel's Cabinet put off a vote to ratify the accord after a suicide bombing Friday in Jerusalem that kill the two assailants and injure 21 Israelis. The radical group Islamic Jihad claim responsibility. David Bar-Illan, a top aide to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, say Sunday that Israel expect palestinian leader Yasser Arafat to formally outlaw the military wings of Islamic Jihad and the large militant group Hamas. Hassan Asfour, a senior palestinian official, say Hamas' military wing, Izeddine al Qassam, and the military wing of Islamic Jihad be outlaw by the palestinian Authority in 1996. But Bar-Illan say the palestinian legislature have never pass such a law. Why do Mr. Arafat agree in the Wye accord to outlaw them if he have already do it? he asked. The Wye memorandum states that the palestinian Authority will inform the United States fully of the actions it have take to outlaw all organizations (or wings of organizations, as appropriate) of a military, terrorist or violent character, and their support structure and to prevent them freedom of action in the areas under its jurisdiction. A palestinian security official, speak on condition of anonymity, say a joint israeli-palestinian meeting be hold Saturday night to discuss security in the wake of Friday's attack. Participants include the head of the palestinian intelligence, Amin Hindi, and the head of preventive security in the Gaza Strip, Mohammed Dahlan. The idea of outlaw Hamas and Islamic Jihad be bring up in the meeting and also propose by Netanyahu to Arafat during a phone call, the official said. The Palestinians say they could ban activity by Hamas or Islamic Jihad that endanger either Israelis or Palestinians, but could not outlaw them outright as political movements. Friday's bombing lead to finger-pointing by both sides. Israel say it show Arafat's crackdown on terrorists have not be sweep enough. The Palestinians, however, have also accuse Israel of fail to take at least partial security responsibility for the attack, because both attackers come from israeli-controlled areas, and have recently serve time in Israeli jails. Israel as a rule be harshly critical of the palestinian Authority's security efforts when attackers come from palestinian-controlled areas or have be release from palestinian prisons. On Sunday, Palestinian Justice Minister Freih Abu-Medein accuse Netanyahu of use the blast as a pretext for delay implementation of the peace accord. This attack be a gift to Mr. Netanyahu, Abu-Medein said. All the time he be pray to God to help him ... to escape from the agreement. Under the accord, Israel be to hand over another 13 percent of the territory in the West Bank to the Palestinians in exchange for various security steps. Israeli Defense Minister Yitzhak Mordechai predict Sunday that the israeli Cabinet would ratify the agreement in come days. I estimate that the government will meet this week and will accept the decision of the majority (in favor of the agreement), he said.

He face 14 years in prison and a fine on each corruption count and 20 years, plus whipping, on each sexual charge, if convicted. Anwar be arrest Sept. 20 under the Internal Security Act, which allow jail without trial. Under the same law, police also arrest 17 people consider Anwar associates and a risk to national security. As of Tuesday, 12 have be released. The UMNO supreme council be expect to prepare a list of top candidates for Anwar's job for Mahathir's final decision. The Star newspaper, which be close to the government, list the favorites as Foreign Minister Abdullah Ahmad Badawi and Education Minister Najib Tun Razak. other top contenders include Mahathir's confidant Daim Zainuddin, a former finance minister bring back into the Cabinet in June as special functions minister in charge of economic recovery. Rafidah Aziz, the international trade and industry minister, and Tengku Razaleigh Hamzah, a former finance minister, be also in the running. Deprived of a voice in state-controlled newspapers and television, supporters of Malaysia's jailed opposition leader have turn to the Internet to air their views. Although the government say police would check every bit of information and leaflet post on the Internet, Malaysia's sole Internet provider acknowledge Friday the medium be impossible to control. Jailed, beaten and face trial on 10 sexual misconduct and corruption charges, oust Deputy Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim be a political underdog in Malaysia. In the realm of cyberspace, though, he's top dog. Within hours of Anwar's recent speech accuse Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad of cruelty and insanity, dozens of boot-legged recordings have be post onto new websites hatch by supporters. Among the hot images now make the Internet rounds be several news-photo versions of Anwar's badly bruise eye, which he claim be inflict by police during his first night of detention. Most pro-anwar sites also contain his speeches, private letters to Mahathir, clippings of foreign news reports and prose scorch the 72-year old prime minister. most of the Internet content about Anwar be false or unverifiable, but the medium be tough to rein in, say Azzman Shariffadeen, head of Mimos, the company that set up Malaysia's Internet infrastructure. No website have be block or censor by the government, he said. shortly after Anwar's arrest, one of the former leader's aides brag that they have set up dozens of sites offshore, beyond the reach of the malaysian government. malaysian journalist M.G.G. Pillai, who run a popular website on local politics, isn't surprise by the aggressive march toward cyberspace. When you're in the opposition and you have no access to resources and media, then you end up make use of what's available to air your grouses, he said, note that membership on his site have soar by 40 percent since Anwar's ouster. The cyber explosion be a boon to most middle-class Malaysians, who be leery of local media. I've finally give up read local newspapers. They're so skewed, say Michael Chan, a lawyer who upgrade his computer with a high-speed modem the day after Anwar be arrest on Sept. 20. Chan use the modem to download pictures of balaclava-clad police in bulletproof jackets bust down Anwar's front door before bundle him off to jail. Occasionally, he receive e-mail call for organize rallies at the National Mosque and nearby Independence Square, where hundreds of protesters have be arrest by police. The advertised demonstrations don't always materialize. other e-mails call for silent protests. Malaysians be be urge on the Internet now to switch off all lights for 10 minutes on Oct. 6 to declare their state of sorrow, sadness and darkness over national injustice. A key witness in the government's sexual misconduct case against Malaysia's former deputy prime minister remain determined to appeal his conviction, his attorney say Monday. Munawar Ahmad Aness, a friend and speech writer of Anwar Ibrahim, plead guilty to the charges last month, allegedly confess to have sex with the political dissident. Anwar have say the guilty plea be coerced. Aness, a Pakistani with permanent residence in the United States, be sentence to six months in jail. In a move that could deal a major setback to the case against Anwar, Aness then file a letter of appeal through his lawyers. Another letter then appeared, say Aness would not go through with the appeal. His lawyers say the second letter be a fraud. His instructions be he want us to proceed with the appeal. There be no change, say Balwant Singh, one of two lawyers defend Aness, after a meeting with Aness. One of the major charges against Anwar hinges on Aness' confession. Singh speak to reporters after attend court proceedings Monday where Anwar's trial be fix for Nov. 2 on corruption charges. He say he go to a hospital to meet Aness when the court break for lunch. Aness be jail on Sept. 15 but move soon after to a hospital where he have be under treatment for heart problems. He have give us the write retainer. He sign a notice of appeal. We have instructions to proceed and we be proceeding, say Singh, add he file the letter of appeal in court Sept. 29. Between the visits with his client, however, Aness sign another letter say he would not proceed with the appeal, Singh said. That lead to confusion whether Aness really want an appeal. somebody approach him and ask him to sign a typewritten letter, say Singh. He be ask to sign it and he did. Bruises on the face of jailed dissident Anwar Ibrahim, splash on newspaper front pages for two days and download from the Internet, be blemish the image of Malaysian police. After first suggest that the former deputy prime minister have beat himself on the face, neck and arms during 10 days in police custody, Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad call for an investigation of the wounds Anwar display in court Tuesday and Wednesday. We can't accept this and we will undertake full investigations, Mahathir be quote as say in Thursday's New Straits Times. The police cannot harm their detainees in the course of their interrogation. Mahathir fire Anwar on Sept. 2 from his posts as deputy prime minister and finance minister, say he be morally unfit for office. The two have differ over economic policy as the country veer into recession and Anwar have say the 72-year-old Mahathir fear him as an alternative leader. Local newspapers that be normally pro-mahathir have splash close-up photos of Anwar's badly bruise face for two days. People be peer at the pictures, download copies from the Internet, discuss whether Mahathir, who also oversee the police as home affairs minister, know what be happen to the man he have once groom as his successor. It be not the first time that a Malaysian have say he be torture or mistreat in police custody. But there have be no one as high-profile as Anwar. What I experience be chicken feed compare to Anwar, Syed Husin Ali, head of the opposition Malaysian People's Party, say Thursday. In a book about his six-month detention under the same law that keep Anwar away from family and lawyers for 10 days, Syed describe be hit and deprive of sleep. At least I didn't have bruises on my face, although I be slap and hit on the stomach, Syed tell The Associated Press. Anwar's bruise raise alarming questions about the state of governance in the country, say Lim Kit Siang, leader of the opposition democratic Action Party. If Mahathir do not know of the allege beatings, it suggest the police act on their own. At a series of rallies before his arrest, Anwar lead throngs in chant for Mahathir's resignation and a more open, less corrupt government. His arrest Sept. 20 be follow by street protests and hundreds of additional arrests. Before his arrest, Anwar designate his wife, Azizah Ismail, as the leader of his new reform movement. But police have ban her from speak publicly. On Thursday she be summon for the third time to police headquarters for question about an interview with regional television network CNBC Asia. She have express fears that her husband would be inject with the HIV virus to prove allegations of homosexuality, and police be investigate possible charges of sedition against her. She call the repeat interviews pressure and harassment. Three Malaysian police officers travel to Singapore Thursday to ask CNBC news anchors how they have arrange to get the Sept. 21 interview with Azizah and one with Anwar on Sept. 3. CNBC refuse to answer questions about its news gathering, say vice president of news program Chris Blackman. Anwar, who plead innocent this week to five charges of sodomy and five of corruption, tell the court that police beat him the night he be arrested, until blood seep down my nose, leave him half-conscious. His allegations, accompany by pictorial evidence, bring prompt expressions of disapproval, from the U.S. State Department, the Australian government, Amnesty International, and the finance ministers of other countries who use to meet with Anwar at international conferences. On Thursday, the Indonesian government, where security forces have be accuse for years of mistreat prisoners, say it regret the reports about Anwar's injuries and that the allegations have place in doubt a visit to Malaysia by President B.J. Habibie. The arrest of former Malaysian Deputy Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim won't lead to massive social unrest or frighten away investors, Malaysia's trade minister say Thursday. Anwar be fire by Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad on Sept. 2 after the two differ on economic policy. He then begin speak out against Mahathir and be arrest Sept. 20. Frankly speaking there be no reason to say that just because one man be arrest for something ... that it should bring any unrest, trade minister Rafidah Aziz said. Leaders come and go. ... They even get sack in all countries of the world. They even die, she tell a news conference in Manila, where she attend a meeting of Association of Southeast Asian Nations economic ministers. Rafidah say there have only be a few demonstrations in Malaysia over Anwar's arrest, all of them orchestrated. In recent visits to Chicago, New York, Houston and Boston, she say potential investors ask her about Anwar's arrest but be still interested in invest in Malaysia. Anwar say police beat him in custody. In recent appearances in court, where he be face charges of corruption and illegal homosexual acts, he be see with a black eye and a neck brace. At least two ASEAN leaders, Philippine President Joseph Estrada and Indonesian President B.J. Habibie, have speak out against Anwar's treatment. The philippine leader say he be consider skip a summit of asia-pacific leaders in Malaysia in November to protest the arrest of Anwar, whom he describe as a personal friend. He later say he would attend the summit and have only make the early remarks out of sympathy toward Anwar. The Philippines, Malaysia and Indonesia be found member countries of ASEAN, which also include Brunei, Laos, Myanmar, Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam. Among Asia's leaders, Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad be notable as a man with a bold vision: a physical and social transformation that would push this nation into the forefront of world affairs. It almost come true. In 17 years as prime minister, Mahathir, 72, who be a medical doctor, foster an economic liberalization that lead to some of the world's fast rates of growth. He drive Malaysians to be more productive, to embrace high technology and to begin major investments around the world. He create a national affirmative-action program that allow the country's ethnic Chinese, Malays and Indians to share in improved living standards and a new sense of malaysian identity and pride. This year be to have be Mahathir's year of triumph, perhaps pave the way for his retirement, with the inauguration of huge public work projects and impressive gatherings of foreign leaders and sportsmen. But today, in a dizzying turnaround, Malaysia be on Asia's critical list, its economy teeter on the edge of disaster and its stability shake by what seem to have be an entirely avoidable political cat fight. last month, Mahathir dismiss and arrest his deputy and heir apparent, Anwar Ibrahim, 51, accuse him of corruption and illegal sex acts. The move set off street demonstrations and arouse international condemnation, particularly from Anwar's many friends in foreign governments. One of the region's most stable and prosperous nations be suddenly in an uproar. It appear that as in Indonesia, Thailand, Japan and South Korea, the pressures of economic collapse have spawn a political crisis. In all those nations, the result be a change in leadership. The question now is: Is Mahathir next? The answer be far from clear. Unlike in Indonesia, there have be little evidence of a simmering discontent in Malaysia. The ouster of former President Suharto in Indonesia have be predict by many people. almost no one seem to have foresee the eruption here. Malaysia be not familiar with political demonstrations. Unlike Indonesians, Malaysians rarely riot. many people here be puzzle and disturb when they encounter water cannon and the riot police on the streets in recent weeks. What we're see be unprecedented, say Ambassador John Malott of the United States. This have never happen in Malaysia, and nobody know where it's go to go. You can write a lot of scenarios but we be in totally uncharted waters. Mahathir, the confident nation-builder, seem to be flail as he watch his legacy crumble. An economy that have be grow at more than 8 percent a year for the last decade be now head for a contraction of perhaps 6 percent. Angry and frustrated, he close Malaysia off from international financial markets one month ago, turn his back on the foreign investors whom he once embrace and who have fuel the country's rapid growth. The move have the intended effect of bring home the malaysian currency, insulate it from the speculators Mahathir blame for the crisis, and give an adrenaline jolt to the now self-contained economy. It be a move that seem in tune with a recent round of question of the economic orthodoxy of the International Monetary Fund. But few foreign economists expect it to work for long. Mahathir be attack the fundamental belief of the free market, of capitalism, of Wall Street, a foreign diplomat said. We be either watch economic theory be rewrite or reconfirm and I don't think it's be rewritten. The day after make his economic gamble, Mahathir set off the most severe political crisis of his tenure, dismiss Anwar, the man he have be groom to be his successor. Two weeks later, Anwar be arrest at his home and hold incommunicado for 10 days, during which he say he be beat by his jailers. last week he be charge with 10 counts of corruption and sexual misconduct that could result in a prison term of up to 34 years. The harshness of those moves unleash a surge of largely unsuspected discontent that mobilize Anwar's motley fellow constituencies: liberal democrats, young professionals and politically assertive Muslims. For the first time in decades, Malaysians by the thousands demonstrate in the streets and in mosques and be meet with tear gas and water cannon. many people be beat and hundreds be detained, although most be later released. With the emergence of this still-tentative opposition movement, the fear express by one western diplomat be of a downward spiral in which suppression breed more discontent breeds more suppression breeds more discontent. People here whisper that Mahathir's days may now be numbered. But few venture a guess at what the number might be. Given his control of the levers of power and the lack of focus or leadership in the opposition, Mahathir could ride out the storm as Anwar's trial proceeds. But he have strike a harsh blow to the morale of his own nation, to the sense of confidence he have work so hard to build under the slogan Malaysia Can! In this generally decorous nation, the depth of anger express by two men who once call each other father and son be disturb to hear. Anwar, say the prime minister, be despicable and a sodomist. Mahathir, say his former deputy, be senile and insane. Malaysians, who have stolidly accept Mahathir's authoritarian rule with a mixture of gratitude and emerge pride, seem stunned. Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad say Friday he be not too choosy about who will be his successor. The man need not necessarily be very religious and only preoccupy with do virtuous deeds at all times, the national news agency, Bernama, quote Mahathir as say after Friday prayers at the Al-Falah Mosque in the northern town of Jitra in Kedah state. It be sufficient that the person do things acceptable by the people, Mahathir said. So far Mahathir, 72, have designate three heirs-apparent during his 17-year rule. One resigned. Another challenge Mahathir for leadership of the ruling party, and lost. On Sept. 2, he fire the last one, Anwar Ibrahim, call him morally unfit for office. Anwar mount a nationwide campaign against the prime minister before be detain as a national security risk and charge with illegal homosexual acts and corruption in connection with those allegations. Mahathir tell reporters later that Anwar have be work toward topple him as prime minister and president of the govern coalition's dominant party, the United Malays National Organization. He appear very good to me but he be actually plan ways of bring me down. At first, I do not believe when people tell me about this, but I now know this to be true, say Mahathir. Mahathir say Anwar have arrange for his supporters to contest for and gain control of the UMNO divisions so that he could win the party's top post in next year's party elections. Indonesian President B.J. Habibie find attend a summit of asia-pacific leaders difficult because of his concerns about the arrest of Malaysia's former deputy prime minister, a Thai newspaper report Sunday. asia-pacific leaders be schedule to meet next month in Malaysia for an annual economics meeting. last week, Philippine President Joseph Estrada say he be consider not go to the asia-pacific Economic Cooperation forum because of Anwar Ibrahim's arrest. I'm very concern over how my friend Anwar Ibrahim have be treated, Habibie be quote as say by the english-language newspaper The Nation. I'm concern because people should not forget that Anwar Ibrahim have contribute a lot for the benefit of his country. Anwar be a charismatic politician who be once pick to be the successor to Malaysia's long-serving Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad. But he be suddenly fire by Mahathir on Sept. 2 after the two differ on economic policy. He then begin speak out against Mahathir and be arrest Sept. 20. Anwar have be accuse of engage in homosexual acts illegal under Malaysia law, but the charges be generally see as a pretext for his political persecution. In a court appearance last week, Anwar's face be bruise and he say he have be beat by police, heighten international attention to his case. Because of human rights involve and I think it be universal people should be give the chance to defend themselves, Habibie be quote as say in the interview conduct Saturday. People should not be tortured. Habibie say Anwar's dismissal should not have be base on things which have not be proven. On attend the APEC meeting, he said, It's difficult for me. But he say he would consult parliament, adding, I'm not come personally but as the president of 211 million people of Indonesia. Like Estrada, Habibie serve as his country's vice president when Anwar be deputy prime minister, make them counterparts on the international affairs circuit. Lawyers for the prime minister's former deputy, now his most prominent opponent, go to court Thursday to demand their client's release from indefinite detention. Azizah Ismail, the wife of jailed politician Anwar Ibrahim, tell reporters that the lawyers have file a habeas corpus appeal that say the dissident politician be be unjustly held. She say authorities have deny lawyers access to her husband, and asked: How be they go to prepare for his defense? Anwar, 51, be arrest Sept. 20 under the Internal Security Act, which allow indefinite detention without trial, after two weeks of rallies around Malaysia at which he call for government reform and Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad's resignation. Anwar be sack on Sept. 2 from his posts as deputy prime minister and finance minister, after he have differ with Mahathir on policy for escape economic recession. But the prime minister say the deputy be fire because he be morally unfit. Anwar say Mahathir view him as a threat. Anwar since have be charge with corruption and illegal homosexual acts, and be to go on trial Nov. 2. He have plead innocent to all the charges, which he say be trump up by his political enemies. We claim that his detention be illegal and we'll prove that in court, say one of Anwar's lawyers, Pawancheek Marican. He say the lawyers have ask the High Court for an early hearing on the request for Anwar's release. When Anwar appear in court Monday, the judge have assure defense attorneys that they would have access to their client so that they could prepare their arguments for the trial. Azizah say authorities have spurn all her requests for family members to visit her husband on grounds that Anwar's case be still under police investigation. I plead with the police to allow the children to see their father, she tell reporters at the courthouse. I tell them that I don't have to see my husband. But please let my son go and see him. But the police say no. Although Anwar remain in custody at the Bukit Aman federal police headquarters in Kuala Lumpur, all but five of those arrest under the ISA for participate in activities and rallies organize by Anwar have be released. Sidek Baba, deputy rector of the International Islamic University, be release Wednesday after 16 days in jail. I may have be detain because I know Anwar during my involvement with the malaysian Islamic Youth Movement, Sidek be quote as say by The Star daily. Despite the recent protests against him, Prime Minister Mahathir say Wednesday that support for his rule party remain strong and there have be no defections from the party, which claim a membership of 2.4 million in a nation of 22 million. He rule out an early election to prove his popularity. A general election be not schedule until 2000. Support be solid, say Mahathir. There be no exodus from the party. This week, Mahathir decline to name a replacement for Anwar, who have be Malaysia's deputy prime minister since 1993. The absence of a successor could lead to a power struggle in the event Mahathir be force to resign or dies, because there be no clear line of succession.

Secretary-General Kofi Annan say systematic terror have be inflict on Kosovo civilians within recent days and that Yugoslav forces be mostly responsible. But Annan say he do not have the means necessary to provide an independent assessment of compliance as require by the Security Council and suggest the 15 members may want to make their own judgement in this respect. follow a meeting with Solana in Brussels, Belgium, U.S. special envoy Richard Holbrooke say the situation in the southern serbian province be as bad now as two weeks ago. Holbrooke say he would tell Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic of the extreme gravity of the situation. Sources speak on condition of anonymity say Holbrooke arrive in Belgrade late Monday afternoon and be expect to meet Milosevic in the evening. BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) U.S. special envoy Richard Holbrooke say Monday the military situation in Kosovo be as bad now as two weeks ago. Holbrooke say he will explain the extreme gravity of the situation when he meet Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic later Monday. Speaking after a meeting with NATO Secretary General Javier Solana and Supreme Allied Commander Europe Wesley K. Clark, Holbrooke say while the level of fight (in Kosovo) may have abate temporarily, the capacity for its resumption be there. The situation therefore remain fully as serious today as it be a week or two ago, he tell reporters before fly to Belgrade. He plan to meet with the Kosovan Albanian leaders on Tuesday. We hope to make clear to president Milosevic and the people of Yugoslavia the extreme gravity of the situation, he said. Under NATO threat to end his punish offensive against ethnic albanian separatists in Kosovo, President Slobodan Milosevic of Yugoslavia have order most units of his army back to their barracks and may well avoid an attack by the alliance, military observers and diplomats say. Milosevic, who on one hand be excoriate by Washington as the scourge of Kosovo yet on the other hand be treat as key to peace in Bosnia, act as the European Union, NATO and the United Nations prepare for a review on Monday of possible military intervention. Russia step up its warnings against such action and dispatch its foreign and defense ministers on an unusually high-level mission to see the Yugoslav president Sunday in Belgrade. As he have so often, Milosevic appear to have bow to foreign demands in the nick of time and yet still accomplish what he wanted. This weekend, foreign diplomatic observers in Kosovo report that a military stand-down have take place in the province, where Milosevic's forces have wag a fierce offensive against albanian rebels. The observers say that except for segments of three brigades, most units of the Yugoslav army be home. The daily reports of the observer mission, make up of U.S., European Union and russian military experts, be one of the key elements in help Washington and european capitals decide whether Milosevic have meet their demands for a cease-fire. By put the army back in its barracks, send some police units out of Kosovo and order an end to burning and looting of villages, Milosevic may well avoid a NATO attack, diplomats here and in Washington said. But at the same time, they acknowledge that while NATO look the other way, he enjoy a three-month license to overwhelm the Kosovo Liberation Army the rebel army fight for independence for Kosovo and its ethnic albanian majority and terrorize the rural civilian population that support it. His military operation create more than 250,000 refugees, whom the Clinton administration be gear up to take care of this winter through a variety of relief organizations. U.S. officials say they expect Richard Holbrooke, the U.S. envoy who deal with Milosevic in negotiate an end to the war in Bosnia, to meet with him on Monday to discuss a political plan for Kosovo. The heart of the disagreement in Kosovo be between Serbia, Yugoslavia's principal republic, which insist on keep Kosovo as a province, and the ethnic Albanians there who have chafe under Milosevic's repression since he strip the province of virtual autonomy in 1989, and who now seek independence. The West, fear the precedent that independence for Kosovo would set in other conflicts in the world, have be try to mediate a middle course. In essence, diplomats say they believe that the plan Holbrooke will present to Milosevic call for a three-year interim period lead to a status fairly close to the pre-1989 autonomy arrangement. Since the Kosovo conflict flare up in March, critics of Washington's policy toward Milosevic argue that he have be able to choreograph every move to suit his goal: push the albanian population into submission with impunity. The United States and its allies have wait four months while he clean the clock of the Kosovo Liberation Army, say Morton Abramowitz, head of the International Crisis Group, a policy analysis organization, and take three weeks to discuss military action, with the result that 500 albanian villages be destroyed. Administration officials now acknowledge that when NATO fail to live up to its early threat in June to strike Serbia, Milosevic take advantage of the indecision and plunge ahead with an artillery and tank offensive against the lightly arm guerrilla forces, whose bedrock of popular support have help win them effective control of large swaths of Kosovo territory, include key roads. While he be do that, Milosevic skillfully manage a key requirement for Washington: he make sure that the war do not spill over into neighbor Albania and Macedonia, fragile countries in a traditionally volatile area. All along, the big fear in Washington have be that the Kosovo conflict would engulf neighboring countries and encourage Albania and the ethnic albanian population in Macedonia to join the cause. Such a possibility raise the specter of a new Balkans conflict just three years after peace be secure in Bosnia. Milosevic cater to Washington's concern that the conflict be contained. The Yugoslav army mine Kosovo's borders with Macedonia and Albania, ensure that few refugees could escape and limit routes for arms supplies for the rebels. The Yugoslav leader also understand that Washington be unsure about how to deal with the disorganized albanian political leadership in Kosovo and the unbending Kosovo Liberation Army, whose main chiefs be harden emigres return from Switzerland and Germany. For example, Holbrooke persuade Milosevic to meet in May with Ibrahim Rugova, the top albanian political leader in Kosovo, an encounter that turn out to be little more than a photo opportunity. For that procedural breakthrough, Holbrooke recommend the lifting of a ban on foreign investment in Serbia that have be put in place the month before. After meet with Rugova, Milosevic step up his military operations in Kosovo, force Washington to reverse itself again and carry out the investment ban. In late June, Holbrooke meet with two self-styled Kosovo guerrilla commanders in the province's western town of Junik but then break off all contact. Clinton administration officials say at the time that they be concern that NATO intervention would bolster the separatist forces. To try to put the best face on the situation, Washington work with Moscow to get Milosevic to accept the presence of international monitors who would patrol Kosovo and report on military action. The monitors be slow in get organized. By August, when the Yugoslav army, back by the serbian special police, be in full swing against the rebels and burning and looting villages in the process, the monitors find it difficult to gain access to the fighting. They drive up to roadblocks, knew something be go on from the sounds and the smoke, but could not be precise. In recent days as the tanks and artillery have withdrawn, access have improved, the monitors say. But there be some areas in central Kosovo around Likovac and Gornje Obrinje that the monitors have rule off limits because of land mines on the roads. The mines be believe to have be plant by the guerrillas. Gornje Obrinje be the site of a massacre of 18 ethnic albanian women, children and elderly people on Sept. 26. A british reporter who walk across fields into the village on Sunday say about 10 mortar shells, apparently from the serbian police or the Yugoslav army, be fire at the village early Sunday afternoon. The Yugoslav army and police forces have be responsible for the vast majority of atrocities in the Kosovo conflict, say a report by New york-based group Human Rights Watch, release here on Sunday. The report say the rebels have also violate the laws of war by take civilian hostages and carry out summary executions. But the violations by the guerrillas be on a less scale than the government abuses, the author of the report, Fred Abrahams, concluded. The report focus on what it call a watershed in the conflict the attack by police forces on three ethnic albanian villages in late February and early March in the Drenica region of central Kosovo. At least 83 people, include 24 women and children, be kill in the attack, which involve helicopters, artillery and armored personnel carriers. In the Yugoslav capital, Belgrade, which be a four-hour drive north through roll countryside from Kosovo's capital of Pristina, Milosevic remain politically secure. That be in part, his domestic critics say, because diplomats like Holbrooke and the head of the U.N.refugee agency, Sadako Ogata, insist on go to see him, thus enhance his stature. The American envoy Richard Holbrooke meet with President Slobodan Milosevic of Yugoslavia Monday night and accord to American diplomats tell him that he have to take further steps to pull back his military in Kosovo Province or face a NATO attack. Milosevic be also told, the diplomats said, that he have to insure that the roughly 250,000 ethnic albanian refugees who have be force to flee their homes in the fighting in the last six months be allow to return home. most of these refugees be reluctant to return because many of the Serb police officers who destroy their homes and villages remain in the neighborhoods. After deliver his stern message so far to Milosevic over the Kosovo conflict, Holbrooke say at a news conference that NATO's military plans for attack Serbia be move ahead on a serious, intense and sustained basis. Holbrooke's mission to Milosevic be describe by the american diplomats as not a do or die trip, but they added, We're at a very serious juncture. shortly after Holbrooke's meeting with Milosevic, the Yugoslav leader issue a defiant statement on serbian television in which he say the threats of aggression outline by Holbrooke represent a criminal act. Milosevic, who rarely comments about his meetings with foreign diplomats and whose tough words cast an unusually ominous tone, also say that Holbrooke's position constitute support for albanian terrorists and not the albanian people. Milosevic be apparently accuse Holbrooke of support the ethnic Albanian guerrilla of the Kosovo Liberation Army, who have be fight to make the serbian province of Kosovo an independent nation. The Yugoslav leader add that for more than seven days there have be no skirmishes or military action. An american diplomat familiar with the themes Holbrooke plan to stress to Milosevic say there have be no expectation that the american envoy would walk out Monday night with an agreement. Rather, the point be to underscore to the Yugoslav leader and make explicit what be expect of him. It be not quite an ultimatum, the diplomat said, but more a matter of what steps have to be take to show compliance. The essence of Holbrooke's demands center on issues outline in a United Nations Security Council resolution of two weeks ago. The resolution order Milosevic to withdraw the extra army and police forces that be send to Kosovo to deal with the guerrillas and to send back to their bases the military forces normally station in the province. so far, american diplomats said, Milosevic have withdraw troops from the field but not all of them be in their barracks. Such a move be essential, american diplomats said, to create a conducive atmosphere for any possible negotiations on the future status of the province. The U.N. resolution also call for a political solution. Holbrooke and the U.S. ambassador to Macedonia, Christopher Hill, discuss with Milosevic a political document draw up by the State Department that call for broad autonomy for Kosovo. Milosevic withdraw the autonomy in 1989 as he begin his campaign of Serb nationalism. The countryside in central Kosovo have be eerily silent since last Thursday. The sound of artillery thud and mortar rounds have be noticeably absent and the coils of white smoke that signify burn villages have vanish from the green hills and valleys. Police checkpoints be more relaxed and areas that be seal off this time last week by the Yugoslav army be now open to the patrols of diplomatic monitors from the United States, European Union and Russia. These monitors, many of whom be former military officers, have report that the Yugoslav army have stand down and that they have see virtually no military action since late last week. There have be sporadic shooting, the monitors have reported. But this superficial calm be not good enough because the Serb military have the capacity to resume fight very quickly, a NATO military officer say Monday. The officer add that a cease-fire in Kosovo be pretty much enacted. He also say that the trend toward compliance be positive. The interior ministry police must also reduce their presence around villages so that refugees who have flee have the confidence to return, the military officer said. Some interior ministry police officers have leave the province, but not enough, he added. On the question of how badly damage the KLA have be by the Yugoslav army's three-month offensive, the NATO officer said, It's a fair assessment that the KLA be dismantle but not destroyed. Holbrooke's first stop Monday be Brussels, where he meet with the secretary-general of NATO, Javier Solana. On Tuesday he plan to travel to pristina, the capital of Kosovo, where he be schedule to meet with the ethnic albanian leader Ibrahim Rugova to present the political proposal for the future status of Kosovo. He be expect back in Belgrade on Tuesday afternoon for another session with Milosevic. The United States and Russia be ratchet up the pressure on President Slobodan Milosevic, warn that NATO airstrikes be inevitable unless he take decisive action soon to end the humanitarian crisis in the southern serbian province. fear airstrikes, Yugoslav generals put the nation's air defense on high alert, but try a belated compromise by move some tanks and other heavy equipment out of Kosovo. A Western diplomat say up to 120 Yugoslav army armor vehicles, include tanks, have be pull out. In Brussels, Belgium, however, U.S. special envoy Richard Holbrooke tell reporters Monday that the situation in Kosovo be as bad now as two weeks ago. Holbrooke be en route to Belgrade for a meeting with Milosevic. While the level of fight (in Kosovo) may have abate temporarily, the capacity for its resumption be there, Holbrooke say after a meeting with NATO Secretary General Javier Solana and Supreme Allied Commander Europe Wesley K. Clark. The situation therefore remain fully as serious today as it be a week or two ago, he said. We hope to make clear to president Milosevic and the people of Yugoslavia the extreme gravity of the situation. On Sunday, Milosevic meet with Russian Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov and Defense Minister Igor Sergeyev, Serbian President Milan Milutinovic and Yugoslavia's top defense officials. The Russians be against use NATO force in Kosovo. However, Ivanov and Sergeyev say the airstrikes could occur if decisive measures be not immediately take for a radical improvement of the situation, Foreign Ministry spokesman Vladimir Rakhmanin tell the ITAR-Tass news agency. To avoid such an attack, Yugoslavia must end the hostilities, withdraw army and security forces, take urgent measures to overcome the humanitarian crisis, ensure that refugees can return home and take part in peace talks, he said. In berlin, german Gen. Dieter Stoeckmann tell german radio that NATO action could come within days. NATO's decision may depend on a report U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan be schedule to present to the Security Council Monday on whether Yugoslavia be meet U.N. demands. Serb authorities appear ready for compromise by instal an interim government in the rebellious province in Serbia, the dominant republic in Yugoslavia. Serbian police and the Yugoslav army have rout separatist Kosovo Albanian rebels in the crackdown that begin in late February. The conflict have kill hundreds most of them albanian civilians and leave more than 275,000 refugees. A Yugoslav statement say the nation's leaders want the Kosovo dispute solve peacefully, but in case we be attacked, we shall defend our country with all means. The government say Friday that the fighting have end and blame continue violence on ethnic albanian rebels, who be fight for independence for the serbian province. Although the United States and Europeans want an end to the fighting, they also oppose independence for the majority Albanian province, fear that could destabilize other Balkan countries with albanian populations. In the Kosovo capital Pristina, the KLA offer to help NATO forces if asked. KLA spokesman Jakup Krasniqi say in a statement publish Monday by the albanian language newspaper Bujku that we wish they (airstrikes) would become reality and we shall provide assistance... if it be ask of us. Krasniqi accuse ethnic albanian politicians of have give up on independence and have become the servants of the enemy, by agree to accept autonomy but not independence. Serbs report two attacks Sunday on civilian cars by albanian terrorists 25 miles (40 kilometers) south of Pristina, Kosovo's provincial capital. Elsewhere, a policeman be kill after step on a mine, the Serb Media Center said. The Kosovo Information Center, ally with the ethnic Albanians, report heavy fighting between government forces and the guerrillas 25 miles (40 kilometers) southwest of Pristina. Ethnic Albanian political leaders have reject the new interim government, which be draw up without their participation. The council be compose of seven Serbs, five ethnic Albanians and the rest Turks and Muslims. Momentum for outside involvement have increase in the past week amid revelations of massacres of ethnic albanian civilians in the forests of Kosovo. London's Sunday Telegraph report that Britain be prepare troops and armor units for Kosovo, to be deploy in a post-airstrike peacekeeping role. The defense ministry refuse to confirm or deny the report but repeat that Britain be ready to participate in a NATO attack. French Foreign Minister Hubert Vedrine meet Sunday night with his british counterpart, Robin Cook, to discuss the situation in Kosovo, France's Foreign Ministry said. Vedrine and Secretary of State Madeleine Albright have a lengthy telephone conversation as well, the spokesman said. On Sunday, Human Rights Watch say both Milosevic's government and ethnic albanian rebels have commit atrocities since the conflict began, but the government abuses be on a much great scale. The report by the New york-based human rights organization say Milosevic have the primary responsibility for gross government abuses. With the threat of NATO attack mounting, Yugoslavia's prime minister warn Monday the nation face the immiment danger of war and claim the government be take steps to comply with international demands for peace in Kosovo. In New York, U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan say systematic terror have be inflict on Kosovo civilians within recent days and that Yugoslav forces be mostly responsible. But Annan say he do not have the means necessary to provide an independent assessment of compliance as require by the Security Council and suggest the 15 members may want to make their own judgement in this respect. But U.S. special envoy Richard Holbrooke say the situation in the southern serbian province be as bad now as two weeks ago. Holbrooke speak in Brussels, Belgium en route to Belgrade, where he plan to drive home to Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic the extreme gravity of the situation. Meanwhile, Yugoslavia's prime minister tell an emergency session of parliament Monday that the country be face with the imminent danger of war. Kosovo be a province of Serbia, the main republic of Yugoslavia. The threats be serious, Prime Minister Momir Bulatovic said. And I call on this parliament to conclude that Yugoslavia be face with the imminent danger of war. Yugoslavia have to defend itself if it be attacked. One option could be for parliament to declare a state of emergency a step which could lead to a general mobilization of all military-aged men. In an attempt to head off NATO action, Bulatovic say the government have accept a russian proposal for the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe to investigate the crisis. Yugoslavia have repeatedly reject such a mission to Kosovo until Yugoslav membership in the 54-nation organization be restored. Bulatovic also claim there be no longer any fighting in the rebellious, majority Albanian province. He say five of the 10 special police units have be remove from Kosovo and the others have be return to barracks in the province. In Brussels, however, Holbrooke make clear that half-measures would not be enough to satisfy Washington and prevent a NATO attack. While the level of fight may have abate temporarily, the capacity for its resumption be there, Holbrooke say after a meeting with NATO Secretary General Javier Solana and Supreme Allied Commander Europe Wesley K. Clark. The situation, therefore, remain fully as serious today as it be a week or two ago, he said. We hope to make clear to president Milosevic and the people of Yugoslavia the extreme gravity of the situation. Meanwhile, the head of Yugoslavia's other republic, Montenegro, call on Milosevic to accept all international demands and avert a NATO attack. We have to avert a clash with the whole world, a confrontation which we be bind to lose, Montenegro's pro-western president, Milo Djukanovic, say in a statement. Djukanovic, a staunch Milosevic critic, call on the Yugoslav president to address the nation with an unambiguous message that he have accept all U.N. resolutions and agreements he make with russian President Boris Yeltsin. Djukanovic blame Yugoslavia's problems on Milosevic's undemocratic regime. fear airstrikes, Yugoslav generals put the nation's air defense on high alert and move some tanks and other heavy equipment out of Kosovo. A Western diplomat say up to 120 Yugoslav army armor vehicles, include tanks, have be pull out. Belgrade have be count on Russia to block any u.n.-sanctioned military moves by the western Alliance. On Sunday, Milosevic meet with Russian Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov and Defense Minister Igor Sergeyev, Serbian President Milan Milutinovic and Yugoslavia's top defense officials. Although the Russians be against use NATO force in Kosovo, Ivanov and Sergeyev say the airstrikes could occur if decisive measures be not immediately take for a radical improvement of the situation, Foreign Ministry spokesman Vladimir Rakhmanin tell the ITAR-Tass news agency. To avoid such an attack, Yugoslavia must end the hostilities, withdraw army and security forces, take urgent measures to overcome the humanitarian crisis, ensure that refugees can return home and take part in peace talks, he said. In berlin, german Gen. Dieter Stoeckmann tell german radio that NATO action could come within days. Serb authorities appear ready for compromise by instal an interim government in the rebellious province in Serbia, the dominant republic in Yugoslavia. Serbian police and the Yugoslav army have rout separatist Kosovo Albanian rebels in the crackdown that begin in late February. The conflict have kill hundreds most of them albanian civilians and leave more than 275,000 refugees. Ethnic Albanians compromise 90 percent of the province's 2 million-strong population, and most favor independence or substantial self-rule. Momentum for outside involvement have increase in the past week amid revelations of massacres of ethnic albanian civilians in the forests of Kosovo. Although the United States and Europeans want an end to the fighting, they also oppose independence for Kosovo, fear that could destabilize other Balkan countries with albanian populations. In the Kosovo capital Pristina, the KLA offer to help NATO forces if asked. KLA spokesman Jakup Krasniqi say in a statement publish Monday by the albanian language newspaper Bujku that we wish they (airstrikes) would become reality and we shall provide assistance... if it be ask of us. Krasniqi accuse ethnic albanian politicians of have give up on independence and have become the servants of the enemy, by agree to accept autonomy but not independence. ethnic albanian political leaders have reject the new interim government, which be draw up without their participation. The council be compose of seven Serbs, five ethnic Albanians and the rest Turks and Muslims. With NATO attacks say to be only days away, top U.S. envoy Richard Holbrooke deliver a last-minute warning Monday to Yugoslavia's president to halt his crackdown on ethnic Albanians in Kosovo or face airstrikes. But Slobodan Milosevic show no signs of back down. follow his meeting with Holbrooke, Milosevic's office issue a statement denounce NATO threats as a criminal act that favor separatist ethnic Albanian guerrillas. The statement, broadcast by government television, say there have be no fight in the serbian province for the past seven days and that the crisis represent no threat to other countries in the southern Balkans. Holbrooke, the U.S. ambassador-designate to the United Nations, meet with Milosevic for several hours late Monday after arrive from Brussels, Belgium, where he confer with senior NATO officials. Holbrooke issue no statement after the meeting. Before board a plane for the Yugoslav capital, Belgrade, however, Holbrooke say conditions in the southern serbian province have not improve since the alliance start two weeks ago to finalize plans for air raids to force Milosevic to halt his offensive against Kosovo Albanian separatists. Holbrooke say he plan to drive home to Milosevic the extreme gravity of the situation. Holbrooke negotiate the peace deal with Milosevic and other Balkan leaders that end the 3 1/2 year Bosnian war in 1995. In Washington, U.S. President Bill Clinton express concern that Milosevic be play the classic game of make false promises to avoid NATO military strikes. Clinton, in a telephone call with russian President Boris Yeltsin, say Milosevic's compliance with U.N. demands must be verifiable, tangible and irreversible, press secretary Joe Lockhart say at the White House. What happen next depends on President Milosevic, Lockhart quote the president tell the russian leader, who have oppose the use of force against Moscow's longtime ally. As Holbrooke try to resolve the crisis through negotiations, british Foreign Secretary Robin Cook say a decision on NATO military action be imminent. We be get ready for NATO action and later this week we will expect a decision to be taken, Cook tell reporters after a special session of the Cabinet call by Prime Minister Tony Blair. In Brussels, NATO officials say they be ready to launch airstrikes within hours of receive an order to attack. If that first airstrike fail to deter Serb forces, a senior NATO official say on condition of anonymity, the alliance could unleash a fully fledge air campaign involve hundreds of planes. At the United Nations, Secretary-General Kofi Annan say Yugoslav forces have increase their attacks on Kosovo's ethnic Albanians even after a U.N. resolution demand a cease-fire. In a widely anticipate report to the Security Council, Annan list apparent violations of a Sept. 23 U.N. resolution, decry the appalling atrocities in Kosovo, and say it be clear beyond any reasonable doubt that Yugoslav forces be responsible for the bulk of them. The U.N. chief also say rebel forces of the Kosovo Liberation Army also be responsible for human rights violations, a charge the KLA quickly denied. NATO countries have be await the U.N. chief's report to determine whether to use military force to stop the offensive on ethnic Albanians, who be seek autonomy like they have until 1989, if not independence, from Yugoslavia. Albanians in the province outnumber Serbs 9-to-1. Despite Annan's unwillingness to declare Serb noncompliance, U.S. State Department spokesman James Foley say the Clinton administration believe Milosevic have not meet the conditions lay down by the U.N. Security Council. Foley cite the absence of a formal cease-fire, the failure to arrange a meaningful dialogue with ethnic albanian leaders and the continued presence of major army units in southeastern Kosovo near Albania's border. The European Union nations be divide Monday on whether to launch air strikes without U.N. Security Council backing. The EU foreign ministers, meeting in Luxembourg, agree to tighten economic sanctions against Milosevic, but it be unlikely that strict travel curbs for Yugoslav officials and freeze more Yugoslav assets abroad would be anything more than symbolic. Meanwhile, Yugoslavia's prime minister tell an emergency session of parliament Monday that the country be face with the imminent danger of war. Yugoslavia be comprise of dominant Serbia and small Montenegro. The threats be serious, Prime Minister Momir Bulatovic said. And I call on this parliament to conclude that Yugoslavia be face with the imminent danger of war. Yugoslavia have to defend itself if it be attacked. One option be for parliament to declare a state of emergency a step toward a mobilization of all military-aged men. But the parliament vote to introduce the measure when the first bomb drops on our territory. In an attempt to head off NATO action, Bulatovic say the government have accept a russian proposal for an investigation by the 54-nation Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe. Yugoslavia have repeatedly reject such a mission to Kosovo until Yugoslav membership in the organization be restored. The prime minister also say there be no longer any fighting in Kosovo, which have 2 million residents. He say five of the 10 special police units have be remove from Kosovo and the others have be return to their barracks in the province. One diplomat in Kosovo, who speak on condition of anonymity, say there have be a significant redeployment of Yugoslav army troop out of Kosovo to other parts of Serbia, include a mechanized brigade that pull out Sunday. Some army units remain in the field, and there be enormous fear that violence will resume, particularly among refugees, tens of thousands of whom be live in the hills and forests without shelter. ","Yugoslavia failed to comply with a U.N. resolution demanding that the forces sent to Kosovo to suppress the ethnic Albanian separatist uprising be withdrawn and is now threatened with NATO airstrikes.Though Milosevic moved some units from the Serbian province, U.S. special envoy Holbrooke called the situation serious.Russia, previously against a NATO attack, said the strikes could occur if steps aren't taken to end the crisis.Hundreds, mostly Albanian civilians, have been killed and thousands are refugees.While the U.S. and other nations want peace, they oppose Kosovo independence, fearing it could destabilize other Albanian-populated Balkan states.","Under threat of NATO attack, Milosevic orders back most army units.US envoy says situation is as grave as it was 2 weeks ago, despite temporary abatement of fighting.US and Russia increase pressure on Milosevic to end the humanitarian crisis in Kosovo or face NATO airstrikes.US envoy tells Milosevic to pull back his military and let Albanian refugees return home.Yugoslavia claims it is taking steps to comply with peace demands.However, NATO says that UN Security Council conditions have not yet been met.US envoy gives Milosevic last minute warning to halt ethnic crackdown in Kosovo.Milosevic calls NATO threat criminal act favoring guerrillas.","Yugoslav President Slbodan Milosevic does not appear to be complying completely with UN demands to withdraw his troops and stop anti-Albanian activity in Kosovo.U.S. special envoy Richard Holbrooke said the level of fighting may have abated but the situation is such that it could resume.The U.S. and Russia have ratcheted up pressure on Milosevic warning him of inevitable NATO air strikes.Yugoslavia claimed it ""is faced with the imminent danger of war"", will defend itself if attacked and called NATO's threats a ""criminal act"".Yugoslav generals put the nation's air defense on high alert then pulled some armored equipment out of Kosovo as a compromise.","On Oct. 4, 1998 Yugoslav President Milosevic ordered his forces in Kosovo back to their barracks.While supressing the Albanian independence movement they had massacred hundreds of civilians and left 275,000+ refugees.NATO threatened airstrikes unless hostilities ceased and peace talks began.U.S. envoy Holbrooke insisted that Milosevic pull all forces out of Kosovo.Milosevic called the NATO threat ""a criminal act"" and said Holbrooke aided Albanian terrorists.Russia also urged an end to hostilities, but the Yugoslavs denied any fighting and vowed to defend their country if attacked.Neither side budged as NATO seemed to wait for a U.N. decision."
17,"A north korean man arrive in Seoul Wednesday and seek asylum after escape his hunger-stricken homeland, government officials said. Kim Myong Sup, 23, have be live in hide in a third country since flee North Korea last year, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade said. The ministry generally use the term third country to avoid name China, which be require by treaty with North Korea to return defectors to their homeland. The ministry describe Kim as a former athlete, but say details of his background and his method of escape from North Korea be not available. About 200 north Koreans have defect to South Korea in the past three years, include 60 so far this year. All complain about severe food and fuel shortages in their country. The Koreas be divide into the communist North and the capitalist South in 1945. They fight the Korean War in 1950-53 and never sign a formal peace treaty. Hunger and malnutrition in Cambodia be reach crisis levels comparable to the effects of famine in North Korea, a U.N. World Food Program representative say Tuesday. Though North Korea be suffer from a simple lack of food, a falter economy in Cambodia combine with weak health care and education be cause similar levels of malnutrition in children, say Ken Davies, the WFP's country director. There be enough rice. The problem be that people be too poor to access it. The problem be poverty, Davies said. The WFP be currently support 1.7 million hungry Cambodians about 15 percent of the population with food-for-work and direct assistance programs, but Davies say he fear there be still plenty more that be not get enough to eat every day. The problem be so bad that it be only a little worse in North Korea, Davies said. The situation be much bad than most people recognize. accord to a recent WFP survey, 49 percent of cambodian children under age 5 be stunt by lack of food and 20 percent suffer from acute malnutrition. By comparison, a similar survey of north korean children under 7 find that 65 percent be stunt and 16 percent suffer from acute malnutrition. Cambodia have produce a rice surplus for export in the last two years and expect another this year, but WFP statistics show that 25 percent of rice-growing areas account for 75 percent of the surplus. The majority of cambodian farmers be not produce enough to keep their families feed and be be increasingly saddle with debts incur when they run out of reserves before harvest, Davies said. Money-lenders in rural Cambodia typically charge 100 percent interest, which must be pay in rice at harvest time, give many farmers a handicapped start on the next crop season. Poor sanitation, lack of health care and ignorance of modern child rear problems leave mostly unaddressed by under-funded health and education sectors in Cambodia have exacerbate the food security problem, Davies said. Davies urge the new government to substantially increase annual expenditures on health, education and rural development as a first step in a long-term solution to Cambodia's food crisis. The poverty be get bad right now and the situation with the malnutrition of children be a crisis, Davies said. Cambodia typically earmark about half of its annual budget to defense and security. In the 1998 budget, education be allocate 6.5 percent, health 4.4 percent and rural development 0.2 percent. actual disbursements to the three ministries be often only 60 to 70 percent of the budgeted amount as annual revenues fall short of expectations, accord to aid workers. A 1999 budget draft propose a reduction of the health ministry's allotment, which cause an outcry in September from health officials and the U.N. World Health Program. The draft be later readjust to provide an unprecedented 33 percent increase in health spending. North Korea be enter its fourth winter of chronic food shortages with its people malnourish and at risk of die from normally curable illnesses, senior Red Cross officials say Tuesday. The officials warn against international complacency and hostility toward North Korea as the food crisis stretches on and the isolated communist country show little willingness to adopt far-reaching changes to revive its ruin economy. humanitarian suffering cannot be routine in any part of the world, say Margareta Wahlstrom, the Red Cross' undersecretary of disaster relief, who return to Beijing Tuesday after a week inspect the aid agency's operations in North Korea. She and other Red Cross officials saw further ravages of North Korea's slow-motion famine: electricity supply to only half the capital, Pyongyang, at a time; the elderly look swollen, a sign of long-term hunger; a generation of children stunted, with 10-year-olds look like 6-year-olds and 5-year-olds like 2-year-olds. Everywhere, from bakeries to government ministries, people be be serve noodles and cakes make from soybeans mixed with acorns, grass and herbs, Red Cross president Astrid Heiberg said. Heiberg liken the additives to cattle food and note that doctors report a rise in stomach illnesses from the mixtures. This be really part of the daily life, she said. You would not give them to your children or your elderly mother know she would get cramps in her stomach and diarrhea unless her stomach be moaning. Three years of floods and drought that start in 1995 devastate North Korea's collective farming and plan economy, already teeter from the loss of its soviet bloc trading partners. With few goods or money to barter or buy foreign supplies, the country lack sufficient fertilizer for crops, and fuel and parts for machinery. The Red Cross inspectors saw soldiers and people harvest cabbage, the winter's main vegetable. The grain harvest be finish and by U.N. estimates little improve over last year's: about 3 million tons, only enough to meet two-thirds of the needs of North Korea's 22 million people. As the long, harsh winter begins, doctors confirm and official statistics show widespread malnutrition, tuberculosis on the rise and hunger-weakened patients unable to recover from operations and sickness, Heiberg said. Doctors worry that the respiratory illnesses so common in the winter may take a toll on the weaken population, she said. One 10-bed hospital in the countryside be keep only three patients at a time because it do not have food to care for more, say Heiberg. The Red Cross want to focus its late dlrs 9 million appeal on get essential medicines and blankets and warm clothes to North Korea. Food aid be largely be turn over to U.N. agencies. Despite catastrophic hunger at home, North Korea plan to send 317 athletes and officials to next month's asian Games in Thailand, South Korean officials say Thursday. It will be the large sports delegation the communist country have send abroad in recent years. north korean Sports Minister Chang Ung say 209 athletes from his country will compete in 21 events in Bangkok, hop to win medals in women's judo, women's soccer, wrestling, table tennis, weightlifting and boxing. Chang make the remarks in an interview publish recently by the Chosun Shinbo, a newspaper run by pro-north korean residents in Japan, say Seoul's Naewoe Press, which obtain the report. Chang say North Korea be send a large delegation to Bangkok to prepare for the 2000 Sydney Olympics. North Korea do not enter the last asian Games, in Hiroshima, Japan, in 1994. It send only 18 athletes and officials to the Winter Olympics in Nagano, Japan, in February. Naewoe be run by South Korea's main government intelligence agency and specialize in monitor communist news media. Three years of floods and drought that start in 1995 devastate North Korea's collective farming and plan economy, force the country to rely on outside aid to fee its 23 million people. famine-threatened North Korea's harvest will be no better this year than last and could be worse, a senior U.N. aid official say Saturday. North Korea need a minimum 4.5 million to 5 million tons of grain to fee its 23 million people, but manage last year to harvest just 2.8 million tons, Namanga Ngongi, deputy head of the World Food Program said. Although hard figures be not yet available, the prospects for this year be that the harvest will not be any better, Ngongi tell reporters in Beijing after visit North Korea. It may be bad than last year. Poor harvests, economic collapse and three years of floods and drought, have produce chronic food shortages in North Korea and leave it heavily reliant on foreign aid. Fertilizer be lacking, as be fuel to power tractors and farm machinery, mean most planting and harvest must be do by hand. Every year it get worse, Ngongi said. But despite the need for food aid, Ngongi say the government about a month ago cut the number of counties to which the WFP have access from 171 to 145, reduce the number of people who can get aid from 6.7 million to 5.8 million. Most of those receive WFP aid be children age between 6 months and 6 years. Ngongi say the government cite security concerns notably the lack of a peace treaty with its rival South Korea for its decision. The government say the ban would be temporary, Ngongi added. Ngongi, who spend four days inspect WFP relief efforts in North Korea, say people generally look good than during a visit last year. But he also say he could see that a large part of the population be very weak. everybody have be consume at a very low level. So they may not be severely malnourished, but they be not well nourish at all, he said. U.S. officials who tour some of the hardest-hit regions of North Korea this summer say 2 million people may have die because of famine. Ngongi say he saw malnourished children who be say to be 10 or 11 years old, but appear to be only 4 or 5 years old. About 30 percent of children in one primary school he visit be not in class. A lot of the children be too weak to come to school, he said. But Ngongi say foreign food aid have save lives. A lot of people be alive today thanks to the international community's support, he said. A congressman who visit remote parts of North Korea last week say Saturday that the food and health situation there be desperate and deteriorating, and that millions of North Koreans might have starve to death in the last few years. The congressman, Tony Hall, D-Ohio, who have have a longtime interest in world hunger, pass through Tokyo on his return to the United States and show photograph he have take of north korean children with patchy hair, protrude bones, open sores and other signs of severe malnutrition. Hall also bring back a bag of what officials call substitute food be distribute by a government food station: dry leaves and straw, so coarse that even cattle would normally turn away. They grind it into powder and make it into noodles, Hall said. The noodles have no nutrition and be indigestible, leave people hold their aching stomachs, he said. North Korea have admit that it be face serious economic difficulties, but there have be sharply diverge assessments of how serious these are. Some visitors with the United Nations and other organizations have say that the food situation seem to be a bit better now than a year or two ago. Hall say that the divergence might have arise because in the north korean capital, Pyongyang, life do seem to be slightly good than during his three previous trips to North Korea. But in rural areas where foreigners be not often allow to visit, he added, the overall situation be bad than ever. base on visits to four hospitals, Hall also emphasize that public health care have decline sharply. In one hospital, assistants be hold down a patient while surgeons conduct a stomach operation without electric lights or anesthesia. Ordinary North Koreans be suffering, in part, because their government's hard-line policies have alienate would-be donors and aid agencies. The United Nations have repeatedly appeal for relief aid for north Korea, but the late appeal have raise less than one-third of the target. In September, Doctors Without Borders announce that it be pull its staff of 13 from North Korea because it fear that its aid be go to the politically connect rather than to the most needy. North Korea do not release mortality figures or health statistics, but Hall say that the United Nations have gather and would soon release data indicate that 30 percent of north korean children under age 2 be acutely malnourish and that 67 percent of all children be physically stunted. Hall say he think that overall at least 1 million people have die and that the total be probably closer to 3 million. In an indication of the seriousness with which professional demographers view the situation, the U.S. Bureau of the Census recently publish estimates suggest that North Korea's population peak in 1995 at 21.55 million and have since fall to 21.23 million this year. That would be a decline of 320,000 over three years, a period when North Korea's population would have be expect to grow by about 925,000 people, base on the population growth rate of the early 1990s. Nicholas Eberstadt, an american specialist on north korean population figures, say that there simply be not enough hard information for him to estimate the death toll from the famine. But he note one political tidbit: North Korea's constitution stipulate that there should be one delegate to the country's people's assembly for every 30,000 citizens. This year's assembly do not expand as previous ones did, but rather have just 687 delegates, the same as the previous assembly hold in 1990. While Eberstadt counsels caution, that could mean that North Korea's population, after eight years in which it have be expect to add several million people, be now back to 20.6 million people or fewer. The United States have be supply grain to North Korea, but strains be grow over a secret underground complex in the North that some experts worry may be the heart of a new nuclear weapons program. The United States warn last week that the agreed framework that be the basis for its relations with North Korea will be in jeopardy unless the North let american experts visit the underground complex and resolve their doubts. North Korea have say that it will show off the complex only if Washington promise that if the complex be not a nuclear one, it will pay for vilify us and impair our prestige. Washington refuse to pay, and North Korea be warn that the standoff could lead the agreement to fall apart. Their shameless and wicked demand be an open infringement upon our sovereignty and wanton interference in our internal affairs, declare North Korea's lead newspaper, Rodong Sinmun. more than five years of severe food shortages and a near-total breakdown in the public health system have lead to devastate malnutrition in North Korea and probably leave an entire generation of children physically and mentally impaired, a new study by international aid groups have found. The study, the first scientific nutritional survey in North Korea, confirm the disturbing reports by international aid workers, who over the past year have gain increase access to the population of this highly isolated and secretive country. Among other shock findings, researchers from the World Food Program, Unicef and the European Union find that, because of long-term food shortages, a staggering 62 percent of children under 7 years old suffer from stunt growth. They have discover that, despite a huge international food aid program over the past three years, severe malnutrition be widespread among toddlers at crucial stages of brain development, suggest that this generation's physical and mental abilities will not develop normally and that the losses can never be recovered. Separately, international medical workers from groups like the Red Cross, have begin to document how the effects of food shortages be be severely compound by a breakdown in public health services. even basic water purification systems stand idle for lack of essential ingredients like chlorine, Red Cross workers say, leave vast numbers of people with such severe diarrhea that they be unable to absorb completely what little food they have. As the north korean dictatorship have slowly, often grudgingly, grant increased access to international aid groups in the last six months, an increasingly clear and saddening picture of the hunger haas emerge as a result of the large formal study and informal surveys and observations by foreign aid agencies. Past assessments of the magnitude of the disaster in the country of 23 million be consider flaw because they be base on interviews with a small number of north korean refugees who have flee into China. And while the researchers and aid workers on the ground in North Korea have not see evidence of cannibalism or starve children die by the roadside descriptions that have surface in the more lurid refugee reports what they do find be in many ways equally disturbing: A population withering after nearly a decade of chronic hunger, people so weaken by malnutrition that colds and stomach flus quickly turn lethal, the future of a generation irretrievably lost. now at last we have hard facts the situation be very grave, say Judith Cheng-Hopkins, regional director for Asia of the World Food Program, which have take part in the research. To me this be a famine in slow motion. People cope year after year, and probably a lot drop off. But the totality be very hard to gauge. For three weeks this fall, crew lead by foreign scientists be finally permit to fan out across North Korea to conduct the first random sample nutritional survey of children, providing by far the most solid data on the crisis. They find that 62 percent of children under 7 have stunt growth, a symptom of long-term malnutrition. Thirty percent of 1-year-olds suffer from moderate to severe malnutrition. This mean a high likelihood of impaired mental and physical development, because the nervous system mature dramatically during this essential first year. The researchers say that available scientific data suggest that 10 years ago, malnutrition be rare in North Korea. even if the situation improves, it be unlikely to improve to the degree that the country will fully recover from what we saw, say Judit Katona-Apte, a senior program adviser for the World Food Program. People will be small and not as well develop as otherwise and somewhat limit in their mental capacities. Likewise, when Red Cross representatives this year test the water supply at the 840 hospitals and clinics where they operate, they find that not one have water that be suitable for human consumption, say Sten Swedlund, head of the Red Cross delegation in North Korea. But of course they drink it they have no choice, he say during a recent trip to Beijing. There be a very close relationship between the problems cause by the lack of food and a health sector that's in very bad shape. Virtually all the children under 7 who be malnourish also have diarrhea, he said. none of the aid groups have be able to study the issue of hunger-related deaths, and the North Koreans have not release relevant figures, although most experts agree that probably more than one million and perhaps as many as three million have die prematurely since the food shortages began. But public health experts say the number who have perish might be difficult to tally in any case, because most deaths be probably not from quick starvation, but from immune systems weaken by years of hunger, so that common colds more easily give way to lethal pneumonia and an ordinary bout of infectious diarrhea prove fatal. Still, there be some disturb clues: In one limited study conduct by the World Food Program and other groups last year on 4,000 children hand-picked by the government, 10 percent have a parent who be dead. In this fall's independent nutritional survey, 18 teams of experts send to eight of North Korea's nine provinces look at 1,800 rural and urban children under seven. In addition to find that 62 percent of children have stunt growth, the team find that about 16 percent of children be suffer from acute malnutrition and be underweight for their height, a sign that they be severely underfed at the time of the study. That figure be high than in any country in East Asia and put North Korea among the world's worst 10 countries in terms of malnutrition. While that 16 percent figure be not quite as bad as that of India and Bangladesh, the bad in the world with an 18 percent malnutrition rate, experts say that North Korea's number in some ways understate the problem. In India and Bangladesh, pockets of severe poverty alternate with pockets of relative plenty, while in North Korea the whole country be to some degree underfed. even in war-torn countries, famine be more in pockets, Dr. Katona-Apte said. It's hard to think of another country that's be affect in this way. The survey results be especially sober since the researchers study only children under 7, the group that receive nearly all the food donate from abroad. After three years of food donations, many foreign aid workers in the country have remark that children in nurseries and kindergartens be look better but that their old siblings be failing. so a month ago, the World Food Program begin provide elementary schools with high nutrition biscuits for children age 7 to 12. We have reason to believe that many people be suffer and that the elderly be a neglected age group that be just get weak and weaker, Swedlund said. There be now more than 100 Westerners live in Pyongyang, the capital city, and many say the long-term hunger be readily apparent there. If you walk down the street in Pyongyang and ask a child how old she is, you be usually off by three years, Swedlund said. She may be 7 but she look just 3 or 4. Dr. Katona-Apte, a nutrition expert who have work in Bangladesh and the Sudan, say she be shock when she first visit a north korean kindergarten last year. There be these two children sit at a desk who be obviously severely malnourish they be so thin and they have patchy hair, she said. And they be just sit there working. This be accept as normal! They be in school, and they should really be hospitalize or place in nutritional rehabilitation. If you saw them in a refugee camp, you would recommend immediate intervention. But with a severely deplete public health and hospital system, that option do not exist, she and others said. many korean doctors do not know how to diagnose or treat malnutrition; few have see it before this decade. And, in any case, the hospitals lack the food and proper nutritional supplements. Swedlund say most hospitals lack medicines, have no glass to replace broken windows and be cold inside than out, have receive no coal since 1994. He say that even in hospitals, sanitation and water purification systems be virtually nonexistent, because the country lack chlorine for purification and fuel to run water pumps. He say that next year, the Red Cross would start to address those problems, spending $3.5 on food for hospital patients and $1 million on water treatment. With few other options, vast numbers of North Koreans have resort to eat substitute food, hard cakes and noodles make from a mix of nutritional plants, like soybeans and sweet potatoes, combine with indigestible filler, like cornstalks and straw. This now constitute 40 percent of food intake, Swedlund said. It's become a regular part of the food basket. Doctors in North Korea say many people suffer from stomachaches after eat this partly indigestible material, he said, but added, If you're very hungry, it fill your stomach. Although the North Koreans date their food problems to a series of floods and droughts in the mid-1990's, the foreign researchers who have work in North Korea say medical records and childhood growth patterns indicate that the hunger begin several years before that and be link to the collapse of the Soviet Union, which have long be North Korea's main supplier of food, fuel and fertilizer. North Korea be a mountainous country, with less than 20 percent arable land. It have be a food importer for decades, mostly from the former soviet union, but also from China. The country have to come to grips with the fact that this be part of a structural problem and can't just be blame on the weather anymore, Ms. Cheng-Hopkins said. Still, she and others praise the normally rigid and secretive government for slowly loosen its restrictions. Swedlund say that after three years in the country, the international Red Cross, which collaborate with the north korean Red Cross, have find officials increasingly responsive and doctors more willing to share medical records and bring up problems. Travel be still restricted. There be more than 100 counties, home to 30 percent of the population, to which aid groups have no access and where they have therefore refuse to provide food or medical supplies. Still, the number of counties open to the workers have increase steadily, and freedom to move about have improved. Ms. Cheng-Hopkins say about half of follow-up inspections be now unannounced, and she note that the researchers in the nutritional survey be allow to select villages to visit and enter homes at random. Workers from the Red Cross and the World Food Program say they have not observe extreme scenes of people die of acute starvation and believe that they would have if they be occur frequently. I have not see acute starvation like I have see in Bangladesh, Dr. Katona-Apte said. But that doesn't mean it can't exist. We're still really limit in what we can see. Swedlund say it be unlikely that the counties still close to foreigners be markedly different from the open ones. And while some have surmise that the closed counties might harbor pockets of death and devastation, he say he accept North Korea's explanation that they have be exclude from some areas for national security reasons. One thing I've learn be how important national security issues be to the North Koreans, say Swedlund, a retired admiral in the swedish Navy. And I really think these areas be important from that standpoint, he added, go through a map of closed areas and describe what western intelligence experts know about military installations there. He also reject the notion that the north korean military be steal donate food, a charge level by the organization Doctors Without Borders, when it angrily pull out of North Korea last summer to protest the many restrictions on groups work there. now that aid groups say they be start to get somewhat good cooperation from the North Koreans, they hope to repeat their nutrition survey every 6 to 12 months. And they be still analyze some tantalize findings: Boys be twice as likely to suffer from stunted growth as girls, and every child whose mother be dead be malnourished. A generation of north korean children be already scar for life, say Astrid Heiberg, president of the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies, in an interview in Beijing after a trip to North Korea. We need to continue to mobilize resources to prevent an even great catastrophe. The founder of South Korea's large conglomerate plans to visit his native North Korea again next week with a gift of 501 cattle, company officials say Thursday. The visit have be delay a month because of a dispute over 500 cattle donate by Chung Ju-yung, founder of the Hyundai group, during a trip to the North in June. North Korea claim 71 of those cattle die because Seoul government agents force-feed them indigestible vinyl strips and lumps of rope before ship them to the North. Calling the North's claim nonsense, Seoul's Ministry of National Unification order Hyundai to check thousands of other cattle be raise at its ranch on the west coast. The ministry later acknowledge that lumps of rope be find in the stomach of some cattle on the ranch, but say the material didn't kill the animals donate to North Korea. It blame the deaths on stress cause by the long shipment by truck to the North. The south korean government say it would not authorize a second shipment of cattle unless the North retract its accusations. On Thursday, South Korean Unification Minister Kang In-duk say North Korea send a letter to Hyundai last week, say that the misunderstanding with the southern authorities on the issue of the dead cattle be cleared. Kang say the North's letter clear a stumbling block for Hyundai's additional cattle donation. During his visit, Chung be expect to reach agreement on details of Hyundai's plan to start sightsee tours of a scenic mountain in the North. The tours, originally schedule to begin in September, have be delay because of cost, security and other matters. Hyundai hop to send by ship up to 2,000 tourists a week for four-day tours of Diamond Mountain on the North's east coast beginning in November. Animosity and distrust between the two Koreas run deep. The korean states be separate into the communist North and the capitalist South in 1945. They fight a three-year war in the early 1950s. Years of food shortages have stunt the growth of millions of north korean children, with two-thirds of children under age seven suffer malnourishment, U.N. experts say Wednesday. Several years of flooding and droughts couple with an economic downturn have heavily damage North Korea's crop production and capacity to import food in the closed, communist nation. A survey carry out in September and October also show that 16 percent of children in North Korea be acutely malnourished, with a body weight too low for their height. That figure, which reflect ongoing shortages, be exceed in Asia only by Bangladesh, India and Sri Lanka. Eighteen teams, each head by a foreign official from the World Food Program, the U.N. Children's Fund or the european Union, carry out the study. They measure the weight and height of 1,800 north korean children from infants up to age seven in homes randomly select in areas where aid agencies have access. Those areas cover around 70 percent of the population. It be the first technically sound survey of the problem, UNICEF official Kirsi Madi tell reporters. The most alarming findings be for toddlers age one to two, 30 percent of whom be acutely malnourished. At that age, malnutrition can permanently impair physical and intellectual growth, say Judy Cheng-Hopkins, WFP director for the region. Children in North Korea's three large cities Pyongyang, Wonsan and Nampo be good off than their counterparts elsewhere, with 11 percent acutely malnourished. Boys be almost twice as badly affect as girls. Police in northeastern China's Jilin province say Monday they have round up at least 100 north Koreans and send them back to endure a famine in their reclusive country. A police official in the Jilin city of Tonghua, near the north korean border, say the North Koreans be force to repatriate because some have resettle illegally in China, have form criminal gangs or engage in prostitution. The official, who speak on condition of anonymity, denied reports in the south korean press that the Chinese have disregard requests for political asylum in force the refugees back across the border. He say they have cross into China seek food, not because of political repression in North Korea. Citing a north korean human rights group and japanese tourists visit the region, South Korea's Yonhap News Agency report Monday that 150 North Koreans have be send home from China, despite have present petitions for political asylum. North Korea be enter its fourth winter of chronic food shortages, have harvest only 3 million tons of grain this year, about two-thirds of the minimum need by its 23 million people.

20,"Thai police have detain more than 300 beggars, most from neighbor countries, in a campaign to make Bangkok's streets safer for spectators and athletes arrive for the upcoming asian Games, a senior police officer say Friday. Arrests be make throughout Bangkok during a four-day crackdown on panhandlers. About 100 of those detain be display Friday to local and foreign press at a detention center in Bangkok. Most come here because of economic hardship, say Maj. Gen. Chanvut Vajrabukka, deputy commissioner for the immigration police. There be some beggars, however, who be under control of gangsters. They could cause trouble for tourists and athletes. other groups target by police in advance of the asian Games be foreign criminal gangs believe to operate in Bangkok and other major cities in Thailand. The asian Games will be hold from the Dec. 6-20. Saudi Arabia be consider send a small team to the Bangkok asian Games from which it pull out unexpectedly this week, a Saudi official say Saturday. Saudi Arabia's top sports official, prince Faisal bin Fahd, be study a proposal by the Olympic Council of Asia to at least send a symbolic delegation to the Dec. 6-20 Games, say the official, speaking on condition of anonymity. The plea to reconsider be make by Sheik Ahmad al-fahd al Sabah, president of the Olympic Council of Asia. Sheik Ahmad, a member of the Kuwaiti royal family, be a friend of Prince Faisal. Saudi Arabia's sudden announcement Wednesday that it be withdraw its 105-member team shock hosts Thailand, who remain skeptical about the official reasons offered. Saudi sports authorities say the Games conflict with national centenary celebrations and the Muslim holy month of Ramadan. But observers point rather to Saudi anger at the failure of Thai authorities to solve two, decade-old criminal cases involve their nationals: the theft of dlrs 20 million worth of jewels from a Saudi prince and the murder of three Saudi diplomats in Bangkok. The cases be widely believe to involve people high up in the power hierarchy, who in Thailand rarely face prosecution. Saudi Arabia have in the past say relations would only be normalize when the two cases be solved. Thai newspapers report Saturday that attempt to convince Saudi Arabia to participate in the upcoming 13th asian Games have failed. Thai Olympic Committee Chairman Gen. Chettha Thanajaro tell the Bangkok Post he send a last-minute plea to his Saudi counterpart but have receive no response. I have do my best. We have to respect their decision, he tell the Post. The withdrawal have throw the Games' schedules into disarray. China's national soccer team could call back four players from overseas to boost its chances at the asian Games in Thailand in December, an official newspaper report Monday. Two of the players, Fan Zhiyi and Sun Jihai, play for Crystal Palace in the English First Division. Another, Yang Chen, play in Germany, while Li Jinyu be with Nantes in France. Englishman Bob Houghton, who coach the national team, say recall Fan and Sun for the asian Games would allow him to see if they can bring the things they have learn recently in England to the national team, the China Sports Daily said. Houghton also say that Yang, who play in Frankfurt, very possibly could become an extremely important player in the national team, the newspaper reported. Li, who have not have many chances to play since his move to France, also be very willing to come back, the newspaper said. China and South Korea will both field their asian Games teams at a friendly warm-up match Nov. 22, the newspaper said. The asian Games be hold every four years. Horses belonging to Iran's equestrian team will not be allow to compete in next month's asian Games because they fail to meet the requirements of the games' veterinary commission, the Thai organizers announce Thursday. The three horses originally come from Iran, but arrive in Thailand after a training period in the United States. They do not have the necessary health certificates guarantee that they be disease-free, say Siraya Chunekamrai, president of the Veterinary Commission for the games. This be the first asian Games in which competitors have be allow to bring their own horses from abroad. accord to regulations, all participate horses have to be screen for a number of diseases before arrive in Thailand. Siraya say she felt sorry for the iranian team because the problem result from ignorance of the rules. Iran be the only country that do not pass the requirements. They be the most beautiful horses of all, she said. I be so sorry for the team but cannot allow them to compete because it be against the rules and it might affect other horses' good health. There be only one Thai horse available on standby for the Iranians, as Thailand be not prepared for such a problem, Siraya said. If the iranian team can borrow a couple of more horses from other participate countries, they still can compete, she said. There be 106 horses and 12 countries participate in the equestrian events. most of the horses actually come from Europe and the United States. Thailand have provide a climate-controlled stable and field clear of contaminants to help the horses become acclimatize to the tropical heat before the competition begin Dec. 8. Many of the horses be suffer stress from the journey here, but those from asian countries be adjust faster than those from cold countries, Siraya said. Organizers of December's Asian Games have dismiss press reports that a sports complex would not be complete on time, say preparations be well in hand, a local newspaper say Friday. Santiparb Tejavanija, deputy secretary of the Bangkok Asian Games Organizing Committee, say construction of the sports complex at the Muang Thong Thani housing estate be 95 percent complete and will be finish this month, the Bangkok Post reported. Liquidity problems at Bangkok Land, the company that own the housing estate, threaten to prevent the company from finish the complex in time for the Dec. 6-20 games. Deputy Prime Minister Bhichai Rattakul, who chair the organize committee, express doubt last month that the complex would be complete on time because of the financial problems. Santiparb tell the Post the money problems have be overcome by shift 200 million baht (dlrs 5 million) worth of credit guarantees from a project that have be scrap to cover the construction cost of the complex. Preparations for the games have be plague by political interference by previous governments, allege corruption and incompetence. The decision to award the contract for the sports complex be controversial, with critics call it an attempt to bail out the property developer's fail housing estate. Doubts over Thailand's ability to stage the games increase over the past year-and-a-half after the country enter its bad economic downturn in decades. The body govern the games threaten several times to award Asia's version of the Olympics to other countries, but Thailand argue that all would be ready by open day. The Bangkok games be expect to attract more than 10,000 athletes from 43 nations. For some teams, out of bounds at the asian Games mean more than just a line on a soccer field or basketball floor. That's because the host city offer the punchy mix of Viagra and notorious night life. The Pakistanis say all their athletes and officials for the games open Sunday have be tell not to even think of the wonder drug and night life ideas. The indian team's solution be mandatory meetings for all athletes before bedtime. The Sri Lankan participants, who have to sign a code of conduct before come to Bangkok, be be watch by an army brigadier with a track record of high discipline. The Chinese have do their homework on stay out of trouble. Thailand, especially the capital Bangkok, be know worldwide for its titillate night life. From taxi drivers to local tourist magazines distribute free at hotels, there be messengers aplenty to advertise massage parlors and escort services. Minutely detail photo albums seek to arouse sensual fantasies. Estimates of the number of female sex workers in Thailand, a country of 60 million, range from more than 300,000 to 2 million. Under Thailand's drug rules, Viagra be not available in drug stores, but be sell only in hospital pharmacies with a prescription from a urologist, cardiologist, endocrinologist or psychiatrist for 400 baht (about dlrs 10) a dose. But there be a black market in the drug that might prove an attraction for some among the more than 15,000 athletes, officials and media personnel in Bangkok. No way, say Gurdayal Singh Mander, leader of the indian contingent, when ask if there be a risk of lack in discipline. I believe no one will try anything silly in Bangkok. even if they try, our watching system be watertight and we will know, say Mander, a former police officer. indian officials in charge of various sports meet their athletes at 10 p.m. before bedtime at the asian Games village. The Pakistanis have opt for trust and nationalism. Oh, Viagra, exclaim Pakistani medical officer Yousef Baig. They know all about it and they know all about Bangkok. We have tell them, don't break our trust and keep the good name of Pakistan fly high, Dr. Baig said. China have take a similar approach. We don't treat them as kids, tell them don't do this, don't do that. We just tell them to leave a good impression of Chinese athletes, say Li Furong, deputy head of the chinese delegation. For the Sri Lankans, we have tell them that they will not be allow outside the games village until they finish their discipline, say Upali Bandaratillaka, a serve brigadier in the Sri Lankan army. even if they want to go to shopping, one of us will accompany them, Bandaratillaka said. His deputy be a police officer. Host Thailand be stress that sex isn't lurk around every corner. A Traditional Thai Massage Parlor have be open at the games' village. Thai traditional massage be consider an art form, say Prarop Laovanich, secretary of the asian Games Sub-Committee for Culture and Performance. A skilled masseur can cure ailments and muscular fatigue. And one must wear baggy white pajama before a traditional Thai massage. In rites build from low flares symbolize dawn to a fiery cauldron lighting, Thailand's king open the asian Games Sunday night, give Thais some respite from an economic crisis that once threaten the continent's olympic-style event. King Bhumibol Adulyadej, the world's longest-reigning monarch, be upstage slightly by Japan's Naoko Takahashi. In a marathon run in early morning, to avoid the bad of Bangkok's tropical heat, she win the games' first gold medal in a time just one minute off the world record. Her medal ceremony immediately precede the official opening festivities for two weeks of competition among 6,000 athletes from 41 nations. In all, 377 gold medals be at stake in 36 sports, include asian specialities such as kabaddi and sepak takraw. But the king not only make the key proclamation and release the royal pigeon, he also anoint a plaque for the Royal Main Stadium and compose some of the music. Songs write by the king, a talented jazz composer, be play by the Bangkok Symphony Orchestra. Thai officials who approach him at the ceremony do so on their knees. Others greet the king include International Olympic Committee President Juan Antonio Samaranch. A cascade of fireworks in honor of his 71st birthday Saturday and dancers who prostrate themselves on the field welcome the monarch to his seat in the royal box. then come the athletes, start with Cambodia and end with the host Thai team. Saudi Arabia, which withdraw its team at the last minute, be represent by only a flag bearer. The Sri Lankan team be lead by six dancers in bright costumes, who delight the crowd in the 60,000-seat stadium with acrobatic maneuvers. Each team be lead by a Thai beauty queen hold its signboard. After the parade, five of the women collapsed, and three be take out on stretchers. A giant cauldron atop the stadium be light by touch a torch to a small cauldron inside a model of a temple, which then be lift on an elevator and send an explosion of sparks into the games' flame receptacle. Outside the stadium before the ceremony, long lines of people wait to take photos of themselves in front of a plastic statue of the games' elephant mascot, Chai-yo. One, Sakchai Pungsrinon, a 30-year-old piping engineer, who pay 1,000 baht (dlrs 26) for his ceremonies ticket, said, Thailand have many problems. Asia also have many problems. For two weeks, maybe we can forget about all these problems. Several thousand people without tickets mill around outside, wave small Thai flags and wait for a glimpse of the king. They also could watch the ceremony on a large television screen. Security measure include bomb-sniffing dogs. For the compete nations many send reduced teams to ease the pinch of the asian crisis the games be a prove ground for the 2000 Olympics in Sydney, Australia. It's not just get a gold, it's get a gold with a result that be close or at world standards, say Li Furong, deputy head of China's Asian Games delegation. The main target be the 2000 Olympics. Sunday's focus be more on pageantry, begin with slightly build Prime Minister Chuan Leekpai lead off a torch relay at 9:09 a.m. (0209 GMT), reflect popular belief that nine be a lucky number. Bhumibol be the ninth king of the current dynasty. The three-hour ceremonies feature 7,614 performers in lavishly produce acts with the theme Friendship Beyond Frontiers. Performers in ancient Thai garb parade across the field, follow by people-drawn chariots. A martial arts display celebrate asian unity, and hundreds of primary school students dress in colorful outfits introduce the games' mascot. Parts of the ceremony be build around the indian Ramayana epic, the basis for much of traditional Thai mythology, literature and performing and fine arts. The field become a swirl of giant snakes, swans, birds, angels, and other mystical creatures. Another performance celebrate the unity of Asia cap the show, with four large swan floats pull to the middle of the field, each tether to a giant balloon symbolize the sun, moon, earth and a giant lotus. Fireworks burst overhead, searchlights play across the stadium and lasers split the darkness before the royal anthem conclude the program. The combined budget for the opening and closing ceremonies be 70 million baht (dlrs 1.94 million), include a large share of donate and at-cost labor part of Thailand's remedy for overcome financial problems that hit the games. In warm up the audience before the ceremonies, a Thai comedian jested: If you're Saudi, raise your hand. Saudi Arabia withdraw from the games at the last minute, throw some of the scheduling into disarray. It cite a national holiday and the Muslim fast month of Ramadan, but many Thais saw the move as retaliation for the failure of Thai police to solve a number of serious crimes against Saudi citizens. Thailand show its nearly complete facilities for the asian Games to a tough jury Thursday the heads of the organize committees from the 43 nations compete in the December event. Thailand win host rights for the quadrennial games in 1995, but setbacks in preparations lead officials of the Olympic Council of Asia late last year to threaten to move the games to another country. They complain that the Thai organizers be behind in construct facilities and have fail to keep them informed. It appear that Thursday's tour be successful in reassure everyone. We have a strong of sense of relief, say Abdul Muttaleb al-ahmad, director general of the kuwait-based Olympic Council of Asia and a frequent critic of Thailand's organize committee. Everything be 99 percent completed. In a welcoming speech, Thai Deputy Prime Minister Bhichai Rattakul, also chairman of the Thai organize committee, tell delegation members to cast aside any doubts over whether the Dec. 6-20 games will be a success. I can hereby confirm that regardless of what Thailand have faced, we ... have try to accommodate all requests for the 13th asian Games, say Bhichai. Since the Thai organizers begin their preparations, they have face many difficulties, most of them result from the country's financial crisis, he said. But the country be able to pull it through, he added. This be an example of Asia's resiliency. We have financial problems in all of Asia but still we be able to prepare commendably, say Manuel Veguillas, head of the Philippine delegation. I be impressed, say Tu Mingde, secretary-general of China's Olympic Committee. The games will be a success. Still, Bangkok's infamous traffic jams do not go overlooked. My only concern now be the road construction lead to the site, say Kenji Ono from Japan. Construction workers be try to ensure that the road lead to the stadium, include a flyover at a key intersection, will be complete on time for the games. The Olympic Council of Asia, meanwhile, be work with the Bangkok Organizing Committee to come up with a contingency plan in case of any possible emergency, say its director general, Muttaleb. You cannot really anticipate anything, he said, as he tour the main stadium of the Sports Authority of Thailand. Any venue can have a problem, such as electrical failure. Saudi Arabia's abrupt withdrawal from the asian Games leave organizers scramble Thursday to change schedules and Thai diplomats mull a decade of relations strain by jewel theft and the murder of diplomats. Bhichai Rattakul, deputy prime minister and president of the Bangkok Asian Games Organizing Committee, ask the Foreign Ministry to urge the saudi government to reconsider withdraw its 105-strong team. The games open Dec. 6. We're not sure if this be relate to the Saudi jewel scandal, Bhichai tell Thai radio. But regardless, we should not mix sports with politics. In a letter to the Thai prime minister's office, report Thursday by Bangkok newspapers, Saudi sports authorities cite the looming Muslim holy month of Ramadan and national centenary celebrations as reasons for suddenly pull out. But suspicion immediately arise that the real reason be the continued strain in relations since a Thai janitor steal precious jewelry from the palace of a Saudi prince in 1989 and flee home. Thai police recover the jewels and return them, but many be fakes lead the Saudis to conclude that corrupt officers and members of Thailand's power elite keep the loot. The real jewels have never be recovered. Tensions be aggravate in 1990 and 1991, when three Saudi diplomats be murder in Bangkok. In retaliation, the Saudis bar new Thai guest workers and refuse to renew the visa of the thousands already in the desert kingdom. The killings remain unsolved. Saudi Arabia have say relations would be normalize only when the two cases be solved. Kobsak Chutikul, a Foreign Ministry spokesman, say it would be understandable if Saudi Arabia pull out because of Ramadan fasting. If there be any other reason behind this, such as the jewelry case and the murders, we will regret it very much because sports should be separate from politics, Kobsak said. Organizers note that 10 other Muslim nations be send teams. Suggestions be make that in the future, the Olympic Council of Asia should consider punish last-minute withdrawals. Organizers need to hold new draws for both handball and basketball because of the pullout, but say the live television coverage schedule will not be affected. The withdrawal be expect to cost 30 million baht (dlrs 830,000) to cover the committee's expenses for organize programs, accommodation and television schedules. They say they would consult with the council, which oversee the organization of the games, about the impact of the Saudi withdrawal. Officials, meanwhile, express shock over a brawl that erupt Tuesday during a friendly soccer match between Thailand and Qatar. The scoreless match be suspend without further play after players from both sides kicked, punch and body-slammed each other for about 10 minutes. several suffer light injuries. As a host, surely the melee will have an impact on the image and reputation of Thailand, say Santiparb Tejavanija, chairman of the administrative committee. nobody want that incident to happen. Officials say that forgiveness be a good option than punishment and that both sides would be admonish not to let a repeat brawl occur. A snooker game between longtime asian rivals India and Pakistan lead to a flareup of tempers Sunday, show a depth of differences that shock Thai organizers and spectators at the asian Games. India and Pakistan have fight three wars since become independent in 1947. A Thai referee's decision that India's Yashin Merchant have commit a foul during a decisive frame spark a fierce debate with the referee that force stoppage of play for 15 minutes. Merchant defeat Mohammad Saleh 5-4 after order be restored, but the incident not only violate the sport's strict etiquette, but show the distrust between the two neighbors that often have spill over into sports. The referee rule that Merchant's white cue ball have first touch the black before hit the target, red. Merchant protested. With the referee refuse to reverse his decision, Merchant seek help from the indian team. Several Indian team members go to the playing arena, and one of them write a quick protest letter use the snooker table as a write platform. disgust spectators view it as a breach of snooker etiquette. It do not look nice for grownup men wear neckties to fight, say Pakistani team manager Shahnawaz Khan. We just watch the whole drama, he said. Pakistani team officials do not intervene, instead stay in their allocated seats. It be make very clear to everybody that a referee's decision will be final, but now that the Indians have lodge a formal complaint, we have also do so, Khan said. The indian complaint, however, have no meaning now as Merchant have won. indian officials be not available for comment. Tournament director Surasak Werapong say both complaints be throw out because neither side pay the required dlrs 50 filing fee. The match be one of the first as snooker make its asian Games debut in style, with elated officials greet the opening with muffled clapping, in keep with the sport's etiquette. A total of 19 countries be vie for 10 gold medals in snooker and billiards. The preliminary elimination rounds begin Sunday. This be the bright day for us, say Manmohanjit Singh, the Singapore-born president of the International Billiards and Snooker Federation, the sport's world govern body. This be indeed a high step and this will greatly help to make the sport more popular in Asia, which be come up fast, say Singh, whose family migrate to Singapore from India several decades ago. With the addition of snooker, the asian Games now have 36 sports. ","Despite economic problems and threats from the Asian Olympic Committee that it would move the games, Thailand was able to meet construction deadlines and open the 13th annual Asian Games to participants from 43 countries.The games have not been without controversy.In a surprise move, Saudi Arabia pulled its athletes from the games, probably in reprisal for a jewel theft and the murder of three of its diplomats.There was speculation that the Saudis would send a ceremonial delegation.National rivalries also were Apparent in a snooker game between India and Pakistan when an argument Arose following a disputed call.","Bangkok prepared for the 6000 athletes from 41 nations to compete in the Asian Games.Thai police detained more than 300 beggars to make the city's streets safer, but its notorious night life concerned some team managers.China considered recalling overseas soccer players to bolster chances at the Games.Saudi Arabia abruptly withdrew its 105-man team citing the approach of Ramadan but more likely for past grievances with the Thais.Later, they considered sending a ""small team"".The Iranian equestrian team's horses failed the vet's exam.The Thai King opened the Games with an elaborate ceremony.Rivals India and Pakistan argued during a snooker match.","Despite concern that corruption, incompetence and financial failure would delay or prevent Thailand's ability to host the Asian Games, Bangkok was ready for the December 6 deadline.After an extravagant opening ceremony, the games went well despite a brief soccer brawl, a snooker game incident, the banning of Iran's equestrian team horses for not being disease free, and the withdrawal of Saudi Arabia over strained relations with Thailand.Thai police cleared the streets of beggars and criminals, and athletes were disciplined to avoid Bangkok's night life.China's recall of four soccer players from Europe is testimony of the importance of the games.","The Asian Games scheduled for Bangkok Dec. 6-20, 1998 were never a sure thing.Thailand was in economic doldrums and there was question whether the sports complex for the games would be completed in time.By late October, however, it was clear the games could take place.Thai police rounded up beggars who might intimidate spectators, but then in late November Saudi Arabia withdrew its teams and there was concern that athletes might be tempted by Bangkok's nightlife and the availability of Viagra.But on Dec. 6 the games opened as scheduled as 6,000 athletes from 41 nations competed, including a heated snooker match between India and Pakistan."
22,"china's central government order the arrest of a prominent democracy campaigner and may use his contacts with exiled chinese dissidents to charge him with harm national security, a colleague say Wednesday. Two Beijing police officers spend 30 minutes tell Zha Jianguo to stop try to set up a political opposition party. underscore the warning, they say his colleague, Xu Wenli, won't be release soon and may be charge for have links to reactionary groups, Zha said. Xu and another influential dissident, Qin Yongmin, be arrest Monday night in police raids in two cities that deliver the stern blow so far to a five-month campaign to establish the China Democracy Party and challenge the ruling Communist Party's monopoly on power. Qin be arrest for plot to overthrow the government, a crime that could land him in jail for life. A third Democracy Party advocate, Wang Youcai, already in custody for a month, be also formally arrest Monday although his family have not be inform of the charges. Zha, who help xu organize would-be party members in Beijing and the nearby port of Tianjin, say police officers tell him Xu's arrest be order by the central government, not Beijing police. He take the police reference to reactionary groups to mean exiled dissidents in the United States. Under China's vague State Security Law, such links may also be punishable by up to life in prison. Zha pledge to work with dissidents in China and exiles in the United States to campaign to save Xu Wenli. On Wednesday, 190 dissidents from around the country demand in an open letter that the government release Xu, Qin and Wang Youcai, say the arrests run counter to U.N. human rights treaties China have sign over the past 14 months. The authorities be deceive and cheat international public opinion while on the other hand they be suppress and persecute domestic political dissidents, say the letter fax to foreign news agencies. In Washington, White House spokesman Joe Lockhart say the United States deplore the detention and arrests of Xu and Qin. We believe the peaceful political activities of this kind and other forms of peaceful expression that they've be involve in be fundamental human rights that should be protect by all governments, Lockart said. We call on the chinese government to assure the protection in these cases of Mr. Xu and Mr. Qin. State Department spokesman James P. Rubin say U.S. officials convey their concerns to the chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs and urge that xu be release immediately. U.S. officials receive confirmation Wednesday that Xu be be detain on suspicion of have conduct activities damage to China's national security, Rubin said. He say he have no information from chinese authorities about Qin or Wang. Two other democracy party supporters take into custody in central Wuhan city along with Qin Chen Zhonghe and Xiao Shichang be release Wednesday morning, say He Xintong, Xu Wenli's wife. She add that police question the pair about the party as well as Qin's human rights monitoring organizations. Qin and Xu be tower figures in China's persecute dissident community. Their activism dates to the seminal Democracy Wall movement of the 1970s. Wang be a student leader in 1989's influential Tiananmen Square democracy movement. All have spend time in prison, xu for 12 years, much of it in solitary confinement. Xu's wife say she do not know where he be be hold and, in her 20-year experience with the authorities, believe they be unlikely to tell her. release in 1993, xu pick up his campaigning for political change soon after his parole end last year. He have try to use China's nascent legal system and the international treaties it sign to push for reform. My husband be innocent and there's nothing he can be criticize for, say his wife, He xintong. They're go to have to expend a lot of effort to make him a criminal. One leader of a suppressed new political party will be try on Dec. 17 on a charge of collude with foreign enemies of China to incite the subversion of state power, accord to court documents give to his wife on Monday. The decision to try the leader, Wang Youcai, a founder of the China Democracy Party, with unusual speed suggest how serious the Communist authorities be in their campaign to destroy the fledgling party and silence dissidents who have begin to speak out over the last year. The charges that Wang faces, in a trial that will almost certainly be secret and quick, could bring a sentence of five years or more. Wang, 32, have be imprison in his home city, Hangzhou in eastern China, for a month, but be not formally arrest until Nov. 30. On that day two prominent dissidents, both promoters of the new party, be detained. One, Qin Yongmin, 45, of the central city of Wuhan, and the other, Xu Wenli, 55, of Beijing, be be hold on suspicion of subversive activities. detail charges have not be filed. Wang be a student leader in the pro-democracy demonstrations in Tiananmen Square in 1989. After the army have crush the movement, Wang be arrest and serve two years in prison. Qin and Xu become know as democracy advocates in the late 1970s. Qin be imprison for eight years. In 1993 he be put in a labor camp for two years. xu spent 12 years in prison. When President Clinton visit in the spring, Wang announce the formation of the Democracy Party. He and other dissidents hop that China's new friendship with the United States and its decision to sign a global covenant on political and civil rights would give them room to promote political alternatives. After Clinton return home Wang be detained, warned and released, only to be re-arrested as authorities begin what now appear to be a major crackdown on dissent. Monday, Wang's wife, Hu Jiangxia, be hand the bill of prosecution, accord to the Information Center of Human Rights and democratic Movement in Hong Kong. Wang be charge with help draft a party manifesto that states, in part, only by establish an opposition party can we be rid of this despotism. That be cite as grounds for the subversion charge, the information center said. In addition to detail Wang's organize activities, the prosecutors charge that he collude with enemies of the state abroad, make his crime far more serious under chinese law. He use e-mail to send 18 copies of the party's found documents abroad, meet with a member of a subversive foreign organization and receive money from foreign sources to buy a computer, the indictment reportedly says. China's government say Thursday that two prominent dissidents arrest this week be suspect of endanger national security the clear sign yet chinese leaders plan to quash a would-be opposition party. Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhu Bangzao refuse to specify what laws be break or how xu Wenli and Qin Yongmin endanger the state. A third lead advocate of the China Democracy Party who have be in custody for a month, Wang Youcai, be accuse of incite the overthrow of the government, the Hong kong-based Information Center of Human Rights and democratic Movement in China reported. All three men could face up to life in prison if convict of the harsh measures under China's vague state security law. The ruling Communist Party have resort to the law to silence dissent since it go into effect last year. The arrests of Xu and Qin at their homes Monday night and the accusations against them and Wang be the sharp action chinese leaders have take since dissidents begin push to set up and legally register the China Democracy Party in June. Xu and Qin be suspect of involvement in activities endanger state security and their behavior breach relevant provisions of the criminal laws of the People's Republic of China, Zhu say at a twice-weekly briefing. Police in Hangzhou city notify Wang's wife Wednesday that charges have already be submit to prosecutors, bring him a step closer to trial, the Information Center said. Xu and Qin be influential figures in the dissident community, have start their campaign for change 20 years ago in the seminal Democracy Wall movement. Wang be a student leader in the 1989 Tiananmen Square democracy demonstrations. Both have serve time in prison. Xu spend 12 years in jail, much of it in solitary confinement. Since dissidents begin organize and try to legally register the China Democracy Party, police have harass and briefly detain more than two dozen members, but until now the government have not level such politically charge allegations. The Communist Party have never allow another political party to form since it take power in 1949. In Washington on Wednesday, White House spokesman Joe Lockhart say the United States deplore the arrests and say the dissidents' peaceful political activities be fundamental human rights that all governments should protect. U.S. officials convey their concerns to the chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs and urge that Xu and Qin be release immediately. Zhu criticize the United States for condemn the arrests, say that no country, include the United States, should interfere in China's internal affairs. China in October sign a key U.N. treaty on civil and political rights that guarantee freedom of expression and freedom of association. It be the 17th international human rights treaty China have signed. Zhu tell reporters there be absolutely no contradiction at all between China's support for these treaties and its arrests of the two dissidents. In response to criticism from home and abroad, Chinese officials break their silence Wednesday to defend their arrest this week of a prominent dissident who be try to form an opposition political party. Xu Wenli be suspect of involvement in activities damage to national security and have violate relevant criminal codes of the People's Republic of China, say a statement from the Foreign Ministry, which on Tuesday decline to comment on the arrest. The sudden arrest on Monday night of Xu, as well as several other activists involve with him in try to form the China Democratic Party, set off strong protests from human rights groups, other chinese dissidents and Washington. We view his detention for peacefully exercise fundamental freedoms guarantee by international human rights instruments as a serious step in the wrong direction, State Department spokesman James P. Rubin say in Washington on Tuesday. U.S. officials in Beijing urge the government to release Xu and ask for clarification as to the exact nature of his crime. China sign the International Covenant of Civil and Political Rights with great fanfare in October, and Xu's arrest be see by human rights groups as a test of the nation's commitment to its tenets. Dissidents in and out of China rise to xu's defense, with more than a dozen activists around the country announce that they would begin fasts in support of Xu and another leader of the China Democratic Party, Qin Yongmin, who be arrest in his home in Wuhan on Monday. Almost 200 dissidents sign a letter to the chinese government protest the detentions, say the Information Center for Human Rights and democratic Movement in Hong Kong. Three other Democratic Party organizers be also detain on Monday, although two of them be release early Wednesday. But the two more prominent dissidents, Xu and Qin, be likely to face a much longer haul since both have be charge with criminal acts. Xu's wife, He Xintong, say Wednesday night that she have still not be inform of the specific charge against her husband, although she surmise from the aggressive behavior of the arrest officers that the sentence could be long. Qin's family be tell that he be charge with plot to subvert the government, a crime that for serious offenses command sentences of three years to life. In the chinese criminal code, this charge come under a grab-bag section call threaten state security, which make almost any political activity that questions or hampers the authority of the Communist Party illegal, from violent or nonviolent activities aim at overthrow the government authorities, to activities design to change the basic nature of the state. Xu's and Qin's trouble almost certainly stem from their efforts to gain recognition for the China Democratic Party, a loose network of pro-democracy activists in more than a dozen cities around China that be form this year. In the last six months they have become increasingly aggressive and defiant in their attempts to register the party with the government, submit repeat applications even after local authorities have declare the concept of an opposition party illegal. They say the chinese constitution do not specifically forbid the formation of new political parties, although there have be no new parties since the founding of the People's Republic in 1949. In fact, the by-laws of the China Democratic Party be fairly tame; they carefully acknowledge the central role of the Communist Party, but also support free speech and free elections for public officials. My husband think the time be right to begin work to form a new party, since China recently sign the covenant on human rights, Ms. He said. In September, a few Democratic Party members get some slightly encouraging signals from local governments, which initially accept their applications to form a social organization to develop a party. But in recent weeks, as organizers like Xu become more insistent and defiant, harassment by the police increased. All this past week we felt something be go to happen, Ms. He said. It seem that anyone who come to visit us be later detain for a while. And there have be a lot more cars from the Public Security Bureau park outside than be usual. Hours before China be expect to sign a key U.N. human rights treaty and host british Prime Minister Tony Blair, police haul a prominent human rights campaigner in for question Monday. Qin Yongmin's late run-in with the authorities come as he try for the second time in a week to legally register a human rights monitoring group. Qin say a civil affairs official in the Hubei provincial capital of Wuhan accuse him of engage in illegal activities. The police come soon after he return home. As I'm send this statement, the Wuhan Public Security Bureau be again take me away, Qin say in a hastily scrawl message on the bottom of the typed statement fax to reporters. Qin, detain briefly two weeks ago, be question for about three hours before be release and threaten with prosecution if he persist in try to set up his China Human Rights Observer. Qin hop the harassment would stop after China signs the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, but he say if local authorities don't observe the treaty we will unswervingly push ahead with protect human rights to the last. China plan to sign the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights on Monday at the United Nations. By the time the ink be dry, Blair should be land in Beijing on Tuesday morning for the first visit by a british prime minister in seven years. The treaty be suppose to guarantee freedoms of speech and assembly. But even after China signs, the treaty would not come into force until ratify by the legislature, which may attach reservations effectively nullify some provisions. Blair have vow to discuss differences over human rights with chinese leaders. His visit have draw appeals from dissidents and an international press freedom group urge him to persuade chinese leaders to free political prisoners. In an open letter, three dissident say that while chinese leaders say they respect human rights principles, in law and practice the government allow rights abuses and persecution of dissidents. Thousands of political prisoners be believe to remain in chinese prisons, labor camps or detention centers, say the letter, a copy of which be release by the Hong kong-based Information Center of Human Rights and democratic Movement in China. The letter call for the release of Shi Binhai, a journalist who compile a popular book on political change; Fang Jue, a businessman who call openly for political reform; and other imprisoned activists. paris-based Reporters Without Borders urge Blair to call for the release of Gao Yu, Liu Xiaobo and Liu Jingsheng. The three be among 13 journalists imprison simply for attempt to practice their profession, it say in a statement. protest the lack of a defense lawyer, the father of a prominent dissident be to seek a delay in his son's subversion trial, schedule to start on Thursday in the central city of Wuhan. The defendant be Qin Yongmin, 45, a democracy advocate who have spend 10 years in prison and labor camps and have recently promote an alternative, non-communist political party. In a telephone interview Wednesday evening, his father, Qin Qinguo, 76, say that before the trial begins, he plan to hand the court a write plea for postponement. If the plea be ignored, he say he will walk out. I wouldn't be able to stand it, the father, a retired steelworker, said, cite his frail health and high blood pressure. Under China's code of criminal procedure, a defendant have the right to a defense lawyer. But in this case, the elder Qin said, some lawyers he approach decline to take the case, while others be warn by security officials not to get involved. The father say he do not agree with his son's political tactics but now he felt he have no choice but to protest his treatment. Qin Yongmin be arrest on Nov. 30, only hours after his mother die of a stroke. He wasn't even allow to attend the funeral, Qin Qinguo said. And now he's not allow to find a lawyer. On Thursday morning, a few hundred miles to the east in the city of Hangzhou, Wang Youcai, 33, be to go on trial on similar charges of incite subversion. He, too, have no defense lawyer. Wang be a leader of student demonstrations in Tiananmen Square in 1989 and serve two years in prison after they be put down by military force. As the founder of the suppressed new political party, the China Democracy Party, he publicly announce its charter in June during President Clinton's visit to China. Scores of people around the country begin to champion the new party, hopeful that close ties between China and the United States, and China's signing of the international covenant on political and civil rights, would mean a loose political climate. But the party be soon declared illegal and many adherents be detained, at least temporarily. Wang now face charges that could land him in prison for five years or more. A third veteran dissident and promoter of the new party, Xu Wenli, have be detain for weeks in Beijing and be expect to face similar subversion charges. In the last two days, at least 10 Democracy Party members or supporters in the Hangzhou area have be detain by the police and others have have their phone lines cut, report the Information Center of Human Rights and democratic Movement in China, base in Hong Kong. The separate trials of two prominent democracy advocates for incite subversion of the state open Thursday morning, with the families of both defendants protest their inability to hire defense lawyers. The trial in the eastern city of Hangzhou of Wang Youcai, 32, founder of the China Democracy Party, which be now suppressed, be in session for just two hours and 10 minutes. It appear to be finished, although the court do not announce a decision or say when it would. I don't know what happen from here, say Wang's wife, Hu Jiangxia, who be one of three relatives allow to attend the trial. I don't hold much hope, she add in a telephone interview. Wang, who spend two years in prison after the 1989 student demonstrations in Tiananmen Square, be accuse of organize a political party that seek to overturn Communist Party rule and of collude with foreign enemies of the state. He could face five years or more in prison. Since all the lawyers his family approach be intimidate by security agents, Ms. Hu said, Wang try to mount his own defense Thursday morning after prosecutors lay out their case. But the judge frequently interrupt him and cut him off after half an hour, say he be not respond to the specific facts of the case, she added. Wang argue that his activities be legal under China's constitution and under an international covenant on political rights that China have signed, Ms. Hu said. In the central city of Wuhan, the trial on similar charges of Qin Yongmin, 45, a veteran dissident, also continue for something over two hours. It will apparently be continued, say Qin's father, Qin Qingguo, since the session end after the prosecution present its charges. In that case, too, prospective lawyers have be intimidate or detained, family members said. The elderly father's request to the court Thursday morning for a postponement be ignored, so he and one of the defendant's brothers stay outside the court building in protest, leave another brother inside. We didn't feel there be any reason to observe the trial because if Qin Yongmin do not have a defense attorney, then as far as we be concern the proceedings be meaningless, the father say by telephone. The U.S. Embassy ask to observe the trials. When an embassy official arrive at the court in Hangzhou Thursday morning, he be tell that there be no seats available and instead wait outside, greet Ms. Hu when she emerged, shaken, from the brief trial. Police detain and question the organizer of a group set up by dissidents to monitor official corruption and tell him the group's activities must cease, a human rights group say Thursday. Police in Xinyang, in central China's Henan province, take An Jun away Wednesday afternoon and hold him until past midnight for question about the group's members, say the Information Center of Human Rights and democratic Movement in China. Police want a list of members with their work and home addresses, a demand An Jun refuse for fear of get them into trouble, the Hong kong-based Information Center said. Corruption Watch, found by nine dissidents in seven provinces, now have nearly 100 members, the center said. It apply last month to the government to register officially, but receive no response, the center added. The police officers who question An Jun say that without official permission, the group must cease its activities, the center said. Rampant official corruption be a major public gripe in China. The Information Center say Corruption Watch have already receive reports of graft in its first month of operation. In a separate report, the center say that an official in the Sichuan provincial government refuse Thursday to accept an application by three dissidents to form a branch of a would-be opposition group, the China Democracy Party. Groups of dissidents in cities across China have attempt to register the group, as require by law, but authorities have reject those applications. signal that the Communist Party's 49-year-old ban on opposition groups remain intact, police have detain and question many dissidents associate with the group. With attorneys lock up, harass or plain scared, two prominent dissidents will defend themselves against charges of subversion Thursday in China's highest-profile dissident trials in two years. Qin Yongmin's and Wang Youcai's families be run out of options Wednesday to help the pair, lead organizers of a budding opposition political party. Qin's family plead for a postponement at Wuhan's Intermediate People's Court, but court officials deny the request. Police have detain one lawyer and threaten another, and subtler pressures have be use on others, family members said. give the interference, Wang Youcai's wife assume he will be convicted. Whether he have a lawyer or not, whatever he says, the government have already decided, Hu Jiangxia said. Qin and Wang will be try separately, in cities 500 kilometers (300 miles) apart and in proceedings attend only by family and a few observers select by the courts. Qin, 44, and Wang, 31, be accuse of incite the subversion of state power, apparently for help to organize the China Democracy Party. They face from 10 years to life imprisonment if convict under the harsh aspects of the law. By move against Qin, Wang and the China Democracy Party, the rule Communist Party appear to be signal its determination to crush challenges to its monopoly on power. Authorities have detain or question more than 30 people associate with the party in a 17-day-old crackdown. Qin, a democracy campaigner for 20 years, and Wang, a student leader of the 1989 Tiananmen Square democracy movement, be among the most active and influential members of China's dissident community. A third prominent member of the dissident community, Xu Wenli, be also arrest in the crackdown, but not yet charged. To prevent displays of solidarity outside Wang's trial, police have detain at least ten dissidents in the eastern city of Hangzhou, a Hong kong-based rights group reported. The Information Center of Human Rights and democratic Movement in China say many more be miss and believe to be in custody. To prosecute Wang, authorities violate the minimal rights guarantee suspects under chinese law and ignore court orders, his wife said. even the judge ask me to hire a lawyer, but while I be do this, some people be do things to stop me, Hu Jiangxia said. During one meeting with a potential defense attorney, a police official storm in and said, `Don't do anything for them. Don't take this case. Whoever take the case, you can't win,' Hu recounted. Four law firms refuse to take Qin's case, his brother Qin Xiaoguang said. The Information Center say one lawyer who initially agree to represent Qin on Monday go miss for four hours and then call Qin's family to withdraw. dispirit by the harsh treatment, Qin's family argue over whether to attend the trial. Qin Xiaoguang say he and his father have decide to stay away to protest the unfairness, but another brother will go. Three dissidents from northeastern China send an open letter to China's legislature and the Supreme People's Court appeal for fair trials, the Information Center said. It add that authorities violate China's own laws by not ensure Wang and Qin have adequate representation. The letter be the late in a string of petitions demonstrate the appeal of both Wang and Qin and the idea of the China Democracy Party. Since Wang publicly announce in June that he and others in Hangzhou be set up the party, dissidents in at least 14 provinces and cities have set up party branches. Authorities have refuse their applications to register the party as require by law. Wang and Qin be the most well-known dissidents China have put on trial since Tiananmen Square student leader Wang Dan in 1996. He be convict of subversion and serve less than two of an 11-year sentence. In return for his release, he agree to go into exile. A Chinese dissident flee a new round of arrests of democracy activists in Shanghai arrive here Wednesday and announce that he and other opponents of the chinese government plan a demonstration Thursday at the United Nations to protest the crackdown. The dissident, Yao Zhenxian, who be release in April from a chinese labor camp, be a leader of the China Democracy Party, which be form in June during President Clinton's visit to China. Speaking through an interpreter at Kennedy International Airport, Yao, 44, say little about why he have leave Shanghai, except that he and his young brother, Yao Zhenxiang, 38, have be send to a labor camp in 1996 on a trumped-up charge of publish pornography. The young Yao, who be also a prominent figure in the China Democracy Party, be schedule for release in April. last week the chinese government arrest 10 members and sympathizers of the China Democracy Party, one of whom, Wang Youcai, be to go on trial Dec. 17. The chinese government feels it expand too quickly, Yao say at the airport, refer to his party. Washington give Yao a special visa, which expire in February. Dr. Wang Bingzhang, 50, an adviser to the overseas committee of the party, say later that Yao have leave China for personal and political reasons. They be scar all the time, he said, refer to Yao's wife, Yu Yingzhang, and daughter, Yao Yiting, 14, who accompany him. The family have a terrible life, especially the daughter. Secret agents follow them all the time. The family trading business, which be 12 years old, be shutter by the government in 1996, say Wang, a former surgeon in Beijing, so they have no way of living. In addition, after Yao make organizational trips to several provinces, democracy activists urge him to go abroad, Wang said. They want him to tell the truth about what be really happen in China and to call on the whole world to pay attention, Wang said. Beatrice Laroche, liaison at the United Nations for Human Rights in China, a New york-based group, say the China Democracy Party be a grow presence in some of China's most populous provinces, include Sichuan. But their most vocal leaders have all recently be detained, she added. Ms. Laroche say the Yao brothers, especially the young man, win prominence by help to finance predecessors of the China Democracy Party with money from the family business before it be close by the government.

24,"This be what Newt Gingrich be suppose to do well. The planning. The strategy. The big picture. The vision. His vision bring the GOP to the majority in Congress in 1994 and make him the first Republican House Speaker in 40 years. But by his own admission, Gingrich's vision seem to have blur this time around, cost Republicans a net of five seats in Tuesday's election and leave the party's narrow govern majority even narrower. The disappointing election results also leave Gingrich open to a fractious challenge for his post as speaker. Members and aides say Wednesday that a fury at the speaker have bubble up overnight and that some members be try to organize a slate of candidates to replace Gingrich and his leadership team when House Republicans convene on Nov. 18 to select their leaders for next year. As Rep. Mark Sanford, R-S.C., put it, When a company's stock price go down, it's usually the ceo who get fired. top Republican aides, speak anonymously, be even blunter. People be very angry last night, one aide said. Today it's a mixture of seethe and dismay. It's just ugly. And Newt know it. His career be on the line. Another aide said, most people be really angry with Newt, and no one know what to do with it. But some be dip their toe in the water and see what the temperature is. A possible slate could contain the names of Reps. Robert L. Livingston of Louisiana to replace Gingrich, Steve Largent of Oklahoma to replace Dick Armey of Texas as majority leader, and Jennifer Dunn of Washington to replace John A. Boehner of Ohio as conference chairman. Rep. David M. McIntosh of Indiana be also say to be consider a run for speaker, but it be not clear whether he would be part of any slate. Rep. Tom DeLay of Texas, the majority whip, be say to be secure. Armey bluntly acknowledge the scramble go on in the wings to oust the leadership. tell on Nightline that there be Republicans after his head, Armey replied: They're welcome to it if they're big enough to take it. Publicly, Gingrich have express confidence about keep his job as speaker. But he have be grim-faced over the last 24 hours and closet himself Wednesday with his top strategists make calls to shore up his support among members. He look like the victim of an accident, say Rep. Peter King, R-N.Y., who support Gingrich. He's very somber in tone. The question, as it always be with Gingrich, be how many members be prepared to rebel against his leadership. In the past, no more than a couple of dozen members have openly express their dissatisfaction with him, and a coup attempt last year fizzle for lack of support. I'm hop more people will understand the need for a serious reassessment this year, say Rep. Charles T. Canady, R-Fla., who say he have hop for a challenge to the speaker after the 1996 elections, when the Republicans also lose seats. The reality be this: Our majority keep shrinking, Canady said. If it shrink any more, it will be gone. But Gingrich have build support among moderates, and some perceive the election as a repudiation of the conservatives. Rep. Sherwood L. Boehlert, R-Utah, say the results show that this be the right direction for the party. To maintain our majority, we've get to moderate some of our views, Boehlert said. Thomas Mann, a congressional scholar at the Brookings Institution, say that moderates support Gingrich in part because no appeal alternative have emerged. They know he see the broad world and be prepare to moderate if it make sense, Mann said. Newt's go out of his way to support the moderates. He's nurture a relationship with them. But Mann and others say that anger have be build at Gingrich for several reasons, include his signing on to a budget deal last month that seem to capitulate to President Clinton, not offer a clear legislative agenda for Republicans and not communicate a clear political message. We be most define by who we hate say Rep. Mark Souder, R-Ind. But voters be more sophisticated than that, and Republicans good have something to say about where we're going. The anger grow in the last few days when the speaker approve a $10-million anti-clinton advertising campaign that allow Democrats to turn the election into a referendum on Gingrich, who have never be nearly as popular with the public as Clinton have been. As if only slowly absorb the implications of the loss, the speaker seem unable at a news conference here Wednesday morning to pinpoint why the party suffer a net drop of five seats in the House. As late as Tuesday afternoon, he be predict a net pickup of between 10 and 30. Until we look at it better, I frankly don't understand all the things that happen yesterday, he said, and I'm not sure anybody else in the country do either. But he say Republicans should have maniacally focus on a basic message of cut taxes, save Social Security and prevent drug abuse, and campaign aggressively on those themes. He contrast the lack of focus this year with the Contract With America that prove so successful in 1994. People think we stand for something pretty big, he said. But Gingrich also seem aware of the mounting concern about his leadership, repeatedly cast the election results as a victory for his leadership team because Republicans have stay in the majority for three elections in a row for the first time in 70 years. He also suggest that those who would challenge him have little support. The people who normally be quote on this be people who would in fact take the party to a narrow base, Gingrich said, refer to the periodic eruptions of concern among conservatives about his leadership. I'd like to see who it be that have a plan that they be confident over the last 60 days would have be more successful and why they didn't share it. An intense struggle for control of the House be underway, with Rep. Bob Livingston conduct a telephone campaign to replace Rep. Newt Gingrich as speaker and Gingrich fight with a counter-campaign that have give some members pause about oust him. At the same time, a small band of Republicans vow on Thursday that they would not vote to re-elect Gingrich under any circumstances, a move that, because of the Republicans' shrunken House majority, could tie the party in knots for months because it could throw the speakership to a Democrat. Rep. Matt Salmon, R-Ariz., said: I personally have make the decision that I cannot vote for Newt Gingrich for speaker in January, and there be six others who have tell me they feel the same way, seven people who just will not, and it take six to deadlock the vote. Fury at the speaker have boil over since Tuesday's elections, when Republicans suffer a net loss of five seats in the House. They blame Gingrich, the party's chief strategist. But many be already angry at him for what they say be his failure to articulate a clear message for the party go into the elections and for a messy budget process that give President Clinton a political edge and contradicted Republican principles of fiscal conservativism by contain massive amounts of pork spending. House Republicans be to meet Nov. 18 to vote by secret ballot for their leaders. Whoever win the party's nomination for speaker then stand for election by the full House in January. even if Gingrich win the secret ballot, he could be deny re-election as speaker in January if Salmon and at least five others refuse to vote for him. Because the Republicans now control the House by only 12 seats, it would take just six votes against Gingrich to deny him a majority and allow Democrats to potentially elect one of their own as speaker. With such a chaotic and unacceptable prospect looming, Livingston tell Gingrich that he should step aside for the good of the party, accord to Republican officials. The officials say that Livingston speak to Gingrich shortly after the disastrous election returns but also before the election, reflect Livingston's earlier displeasure with the speaker over the budget process. Several Republicans say that both Livingston, the chairman of the Appropriations Committee and one of the few members with the stature to stand for speaker, and Gingrich be work the phones on Thursday in a struggle for votes. Livingston have say nothing publicly about a challenge to Gingrich, but several members and aides say on Thursday that he would announce his intentions, possibly as soon as Friday, after he have determine if he could win. He won't do it 'til he have his ducks in a row, and right now a lot of people be still loyal to the speaker, say an aide to a republican who, like many others, be try to straddle the line between fealty to a speaker who may retain power and encouragement to a challenger who offer a salve to an embattled party. stun by the democratic resurgence in the mid-term elections, congressional Republicans tore into each other Wednesday over who be to blame for their failure to make the traditional opposition party gains in an off-year election. The soul-searching and recriminations and a possibility of congressional leadership challenges come as election results show that Republicans have be unable to increase their 55-45 hold over the Senate and that Democrats have pick up five seats in the House. The democratic surge mark the first time since 1934 that the president's party have gain seats in a midterm election, and it whittle the Republican House majority down to a mere six votes. The democratic victories be even more remarkable in a political year mark by the months-long scandal over President Clinton's affair with Monica Lewinsky. The Republicans' new 223-211 majority (assuming a Democrat lead in Oregon hold on to win), with one independent, amount to the small congressional majority since the republican-controlled Congress of 1953, the last time Republicans control the House until they capture it again in 1994. With attention now shift to the House Judiciary Committee and its impeachment inquiry, Rep. Henry Hyde tell fellow Republicans on the panel in a conference call Wednesday that the only witness Republicans be likely to call would be the independent counsel, Kenneth Starr. Hyde, the chairman, tell lawmakers he hop to have the committee vote on possible articles of impeachment by Thanksgiving, an act that would take the issue out of his hands and put it into Gingrich's. Committee Democrats decline comment Wednesday until they could discuss Hyde's plan among themselves. try to put the best face on the results, Speaker Newt Gingrich say in Marietta, Ga., that the Republicans still hold onto the House for three elections in a row for the first time since the election of 1932. But furious rank and file Republicans burn up the phone lines to each other, discuss whether to mount leadership challenges in both chambers in the next few weeks. We've get to reach out and have more than southern white males run the Washington Republican Party, say Rep. Joe Scarborough, a conservative from Florida. He say that Republicans this year have be leave without any accomplishments to run on. We need an agenda first of all, he said. We go an entire calendar year without an agenda. Rep. Chris Shays, a moderate from Connecticut call the election a devastating loss and say simply, There be go to be major changes in our leadership. All segments of our party want to see change. At the White House, Clinton call the election results a vindication of his party's policies. If you look at all the results, he said, they be clear and unambiguous. The american people want their business, their concerns, their children, their families, their future address here. That's what the messag e of the election was. One of the first difficult questions now face Congress be how to proceed with the impeachment inquiry in the face of public resistance to remove Clinton from office, and with a republican majority now so slim that it be almost certain that the 218 votes require for impeachment cannot be assembled. In a public statement release Wednesday, Hyde say The Committee continue to have a clear constituional duty to complete its work in a fair and expeditious manner. Our duty have not change becasue the constitution have not changed. But Sen. Robert Torricelli, D-N.J., say the election results guarantee that impeachment will fail. I think any serious effort to remove President Clinton from office be effectively over, he said. It be simply for Newt Gingrich and Trent Lott to decide on an exit strategy. From the other side of the aisle, Rep. Rick Lazio, a Long Island Republican, said, The inquiry should be wrap up expeditiously, fairly and it ought to be resolve in the immediate future. For the past year, Republicans struggle to keep control of the House with a 228-207 majority and to find consensus among their party's compete factions. With their numbers reduced, the republican leadership will need to carry out a tortuous balancing act to unite a hard-core conservative faction that want a more aggressive social agenda with a bloc of moderates who want their party to return to the center. Any small Republican faction will now have enormous leverage. The new arithmetic of the House may even lead to Democrats' and moderate Republicans' forming ad hoc majorities on issues, take control away from republican leaders. Already see some of the possibilities, Rep. Peter King of Long Island, N.Y., say northeastern Republicans would be strengthened. It give us much more leverage with the leadership and make it easy to protect New York, he said. It's go to weaken the position of the strident conservatives and the anti-northeast conservatives. Just two weeks ago, Gingrich have foreseen election gains range from 10 seats to more than 40. seem uncharacteristically uncertain Wednesday, he say he have trouble accounting for the results. Things be happen out there that none of us fully understand--neither party in my judgment, he said. take his share of the blame for his party's losses, the Georgia Republican say he have misjudge how the public would recoil from the Clinton scandal as amplify in the modern media world and how the scandal would drown out other Republican themes. I mean I totally underestimate the degree to which people would just get sick of 24-hour-a day talk television and talk radio and then the degree to which this whole scandal become just sort of disgusting by sheer repetition, he said. And as a result I think we probably underestimate the need to really aggressively push a much strong message about cut taxes and save Social Security, win the war on drugs, reform education and national defense. Majority Leader Sen. Trent Lott of Mississippi also admit mistakes, say his party have not present a clear enough message in the final 96 hours of the campaign. He also concede that Congress' final scramble to pass a $500 billion budget bill hurt his party. One of this lessons for Republicans out of this be that we need to listen more carefully to the people and we need to have a clear understanding and concise message that we do apply across the nation, he say in Washington. Both Lott and Gingrich say Republicans would put an emphasis next year on tax-cutting and shore up the Social Security system. even as the two leaders spoke, their angry rank-and-file lawmakers be make phone calls try to assess whether to mount challenges against the republican leaders who have steer the Congress since the Republican's assume control four years ago. One senior Republican staffer say the House have become a tinderbox of intrigue. Scarborough said, The long distance charges in Washington offices probably be go through the roof today. Everybody's call everybody. everybody recognize that something's terribly wrong with the direction of Washington Republicans when republican governors be do so well in New York, Massachusetts, Florida and Texas. And while Gingrich have not go out of his way to identify himself with the republican campaign's last-minute ad blitz attack President Clinton, his caucus know he be responsible. Gingrich have face down an uprising before, foil a coup attempt against him by disgruntle conservatives and some of his own leadership team in the summer of 1997. Any move to remove him remain a long-shot. But with House leadership elections now set for mid-november, Republicans say this time the dissatisfaction in their caucus have cross ideological lines to moderates like Shays as well. We get shellacked, say Rep. Christopher Cannon, a conserative from Utah. We beat ourselves because we have no agenda. Republicans be discuss possible challenges to gingrich, his second-in-command, Rep. Dick Armey, and other members of the senior leadership team. Some be envision try to run an entire new ticket head by Rep. Bob Livingston, the Appropriations Committee chairman from Louisiana and include Rep. Steve Largent, an Oklahoma conservative. ask whether Tuesday's election results could cost him the speakership, Gingrich said, I'm not particularly concerned. Republicans close to him say they expect the anger to dissipate. In the Senate, where leadership races take place in early December, some Republicans be talk of mount challenges against mid-level leadership figures. several senators express particular pique toward the re-election chairman, Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, who pour party dollars and much of his own time into try to defeat the democratic champion of campaign finance overhaul, Russell Feingold of Wisconsin. Feingold win in a close race. Some lawmakers on Wednesday approach Sen. Chuck Hagel of Nebraska to see if he would replace McConnell. Hagel confirm he have talk to more than eight senators, and be consider whether to challenge McConnell. Hagel lambast the republican leadership for the election outcome. This be a big loss for us, he said. We squander a very historic opportunity last night. To just break even be a loss. most incumbents coast to victory Tuesday night. But some will not be returning. Five House Republicans be defeated: Vince Snowbarger of Kansas, Bill Redmond of New Mexico, Jon Fox of Pennsylvania, Mike Pappas of New Jersey, and Rick White of Washington. One Democrat also lose his re-election bid Rep. Jay Johnson of Wisconsin. The new House members include 17 Republicans and at least 22 Democrats. David Wu, a Democrat be lead molly Bordonaro, a Republican in the race for one House seat in Oregon, but the final victory announcement be not expect until Friday after absentee ballots be counted. Unlike the self-proclaimed revolutionaries of the Republican class of 1994, many of the newly elect members be career politicians who rise through the ranks of local and state government. Three of the Democrats be the sons of former lawmakers, Mark Udall of Colorado, son of Morris Udall who represent Arizona; Tom Udall of New Mexico, son of the other Udall brother, Stewart, a former Congressman and Secretary of the Interior, and Charlie Gonzalez, who o win the Texas seat of his father, Henry. stun by the democratic resurgence in the mid-term elections, congressional Republicans tore into each other Wednesday over who be to blame for their failure to make the traditional opposition party gains in an off-year election. The soul-searching and recriminations and a possibility of congressional leadership challenges come as election results show that Republicans have be unable to increase their 55-45 hold over the Senate and that Democrats have pick up five seats in the House.

Things be happen out there that none of us fully understand--neither party in my judgment, he said. take his share of the blame for his party's losses, the Georgia Republican say he have misjudge how the public would recoil from the Clinton scandal as amplify in the modern media world and how the scandal would drown out other Republican themes. I mean I totally underestimate the degree to which people would just get sick of 24-hour-a day talk television and talk radio and then the degree to which this whole scandal become just sort of disgusting by sheer repetition, he said. And as a result I think we probably underestimate the need to really aggressively push a much strong message about cut taxes and save Social Security, win the war on drugs, reform education and national defense. Majority Leader Sen. Trent Lott of Mississippi also admit mistakes, say his party have not present a clear enough message in the final 96 hours of the campaign. He also concede that Congress' final scramble to pass a $500 billion budget bill hurt his party. One of this lessons for Republicans out of this be that we need to listen more carefully to the people and we need to have a clear understanding and concise message that we do apply across the nation, he say in Washington. Both Lott and Gingrich say Republicans would put an emphasis next year on tax-cutting and shore up the Social Security system. even as the two leaders spoke, their angry rank-and-file lawmakers be make phone calls try to assess whether to mount challenges against the republican leaders who have steer the Congress since the Republican's assume control four years ago. One senior Republican staffer say the House have become a tinderbox of intrigue. Scarborough said, The long distance charges in Washington offices probably be go through the roof today. Everybody's call everybody. everybody recognize that something's terribly wrong with the direction of Washington Republicans when republican governors be do so well in New York, Massachusetts, Florida and Texas. And while Gingrich have not go out of his way to identify himself with the republican campaign's last-minute ad blitz attack President Clinton, his caucus know he be responsible. Gingrich have face down an uprising before, foil a coup attempt against him by disgruntle conservatives and some of his own leadership team in the summer of 1997. Any move to remove him remain a long-shot. But with House leadership elections now set for mid-november, Republicans say this time the dissatisfaction in their caucus have cross ideological lines to moderates like Shays as well. We get shellacked, say Rep. Christopher Cannon, a conservative from Utah. We beat ourselves because we have no agenda. Republicans be discuss possible challenges to gingrich, his second-in-command, Rep. Dick Armey, and other members of the senior leadership team. Some be envision try to run an entire new ticket head by Rep. Bob Livingston, the Appropriations Committee chairman from Louisiana and include Rep. Steve Largent, an Oklahoma conservative. ask whether Tuesday's election results could cost him the speakership, Gingrich said, I'm not particularly concerned. Republicans close to him say they expect the anger to dissipate. In the Senate, where leadership races take place in early December, some Republicans be talk of mount challenges against mid-level leadership figures. several senators express particular pique toward the re-election chairman, Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, who pour party dollars and much of his own time into try to defeat the democratic champion of campaign finance overhaul, Russell Feingold of Wisconsin. Feingold win in a close race. Some lawmakers on Wednesday approach Sen. Chuck Hagel of Nebraska to see if he would replace McConnell. Hagel confirm he have talk to more than eight senators, and be consider whether to challenge McConnell. Hagel lambast the republican leadership for the election outcome. This be a big loss for us, he said. We squander a very historic opportunity last night. To just break even be a loss. most incumbents coast to victory Tuesday night. But some will not be returning. Five House Republicans be defeated: Vince Snowbarger of Kansas, Bill Redmond of New Mexico, Jon Fox of Pennsylvania, Mike Pappas of New Jersey, and Rick White of Washington. One Democrat also lose his re-election bid Rep. Jay Johnson of Wisconsin. The new House members include 17 Republicans and at least 22 Democrats. David Wu, a Democrat be lead molly Bordonaro, a Republican in the race for one House seat in Oregon, but the final victory announcement be not expect until Friday after absentee ballots be counted. Unlike the self-proclaimed revolutionaries of the Republican class of 1994, many of the newly elect members be career politicians who rise through the ranks of local and state government. Three of the Democrats be the sons of former lawmakers, Mark Udall of Colorado, son of Morris Udall who represent Arizona; Tom Udall of New Mexico, son of the other Udall brother, Stewart, a former congressman and secretary of the Interior, and Charlie Gonzalez, who win the Texas seat of his father, Henry. A week after the White House and congressional Democrats disavow his war on Speaker Newt Gingrich, James Carville, President Clinton's former campaign strategist and chief outside defender, put forth a new battle cry Wednesday: He will not be muzzled. not only that, but Carville go beyond his customary denunciations of Gingrich and the Republicans and, in an interview, train his fire on leaders in his own party for not be sufficiently aggressive four weeks before Election Day. My sense of frustration be that I believe the Democrats have a much good chance of do much good than anyone expects, Carville said. And I don't think anyone's emerge to try to pull it together. Everybody ought to be pushing, the leadership in the Congress, the White House, the DNC. We ought to hammer Gingrich every day. How can you take the Congress back if you don't make a case against the people who be run it? I have never hear of a strategy like that. Sounding increasingly agitated, he go on: The only people leave to be activate in this election be Democrats. The right wing, they're bounce off the walls. They're go out to vote. Rep. Dick Gephardt, the minority leader, complain to Erskine Bowles, the White House chief of staff, after Carville appear on the NBC News program Meet the Press on Sept. 27 and declared, Cpl. Cue Ball Carville will be roll into battle against Newt Gingrich. The concern among House Democrats, one express by some White House officials as well, be that Carville's vitriol would make the Democrats appear overly partisan and could be especially damage to Democrats in marginal districts who do not want to appear too easy on the president. But on Wednesday, Carville be anything but timid. If Gephardt people think they've quiet me down, he said, I'm not quieted. Carville say he tell officials at the White House, Don't waste your breath about call me and tell me not to say this. Carville insist that he would rather do battle with Republicans than with his fellow Democrats. If they want to fight with me, they can, he said. I'm go to fight with the Republicans. Yet he could not help but ridicule his party. ask to describe the Democrats' strategy for the election, Carville said, If there be one, no one's share it with me. Just four years ago, it be a good bet that Newt Gingrich would be the pivotal figure in U.S. politics at the turn of the millennium. seemingly overnight he have take a moribund minority party and turn it into a pumped-up, issue-driven House majority. With a promise to balance the budget, end welfare and represent more conservative social values, he appear to have rearrange the political map for Congress just as Ronald Reagan have do for the presidency. But Gingrich's leadership be now so shaky that even if he maintain his hold on the speaker's office, he be in danger of marginalization. A change this dramatic suggest something far more profound than a miscalculation about election tactics. What look like one of the major realignments in U.S. political history might turn out to have be nothing but a temporary shift. The Gingrich revolution be fuel by anger, a revolt of white working-class Americans against what they perceive as a democratic bias in favor of blacks and other minorities, and a middle-class rejection of the politics of big government and big deficits. They be the same resentments that Ronald Reagan have exploit so successfully. But old political habits and a moribund Republican leadership allow the Democrats to retain control of Congress throughout the 1980s, and turn Reagan's economic program into an undisciplined tax-cutting spree that create prosperity along with huge budget gaps. Gingrich's attention-grabbing rhetoric, energy and talent for political organization finally take Reagan's formula for success to the congressional elections in 1994. But once in power, he run head on into Bill Clinton, whose political instincts be even better. The president co-opted parts of the Contract With America, particularly the balanced budget and welfare reform. He adapt the Republican social message into a call for things like school uniforms and television rating systems, which symbolize more responsibility and parental control without support government intrusion into private lives. The Republican right's genuine contempt for Clinton be base in part on the well-known flaws in the president's character. But it be mainly a reaction to the ease with which he have divert what be suppose to be the flood tide of their revolution. They expect that the genuine successes of Gingrich's first year in office would lead to still large victories for minimal government and taxes, unfettered free enterprise and a return to conservative christian values. But the public be happy to be lead in another direction, and focus on the concerns of age baby boomers about health care and Social Security. The government that be see as the enemy when the issues be budgetary once again look like a potential ally. Back in 1994, both parties be so stun by the sudden change in their congressional fortunes that they may have overestimate what it all meant. In particular they may not have realize how quickly good economic times, a drop in crime and national welfare reform could blunt the power of race in U.S. politics. The Democrats have become literally a minority party as white voters resentfully identify their policies with cities, blacks and immigrants. But last week union workers and Catholics return to the democratic fold. Without race as a wedge issue, the solid black democratic vote become a powerful advantage in key states. Blacks, women and Latinos angry at Republican anti-immigration initiatives be the win coalition in California, North Carolina and New York. The speaker be right to say this be not the election we expected. There may indeed be a republican majority in America, but it appear to resemble the Republicanism of Dwight Eisenhower rather than Newt Gingrich pro-business, wary of debt and with an inherent distaste for bring up messy social issues like abortion. The Republicans who have begin talk about compassionate conservatism and the politics of inclusion may be peddle political mush, but they peddle it to victory on Tuesday. The congressional Republican Party's long sojourn in the wilderness of the House minority may have leave it too accustom to opposition to figure out what it can be for, and too attach to the politics of anger to make sense of a nation in the mood for moderation. Gingrich have suggest that his mistake be to let the Republicans drift along on the politics of impeachment when they should have be almost maniacally focus on things like tax cuts. But look maniacal be what get them into trouble in the first place. Winning control of Congress after so many years be very tough for Gingrich in 1994. But it will be ten times tougher to forge a politics that do not depend on rage. House Speaker Newt Gingrich, who orchestrate the republican revolution of recent years and be oversee the impeachment inquiry into President Clinton, be drive from office Friday by a party that swiftly turn on him after its unexpected losses in Tuesday's midterm elections. Catching virtually everyone on Capitol Hill by surprise, Gingrich announce Friday night in two conference calls to other Republicans that he would not seek re-election as Speaker in the Nov. 18 vote and would leave Congress altogether when his term expire in January. This will give us a chance to purge some of the poison that be in the system, Gingrich said, accord to a party aide who listen to one of the calls. Gingrich's resignation be a stunning reversal for one of the most combative and personally confrontational politicians in America. He make his name a decade ago by bring down one democratic speaker, Jim Wright, and continue his assaultive style through Tuesday's elections with last-minute commercials remind voters of the Clinton scandal. His reflexive pugilistic response be evident even Friday night. In his second conference call, accord to several people who listened, Gingrich blame House conservatives for his downfall. Although it be their revolutionary zeal he harness to take control of Congress in 1994, they have become his most bitter critics in the last two years of his tumultuous speakership. Friday night he call them cannibals who have blackmail him into quitting. Rep. Michael P. Forbes, R-N.Y., said: Newt say all those who have marginalize the Republican Party have engage in cannibalism. He said, `refer to the clips.' He's blame others. Another republican describe the conference call this way: He start off very statesmanlike, but then you could see the anger building. When someone ask him why he be leaving, he said, `a handful of members have blackmail the conference.' He said, `they're hateful.' And he said, `They're cannibals.' Gingrich announce his move just hours after Rep. Robert L. Livingston of Louisiana announce he be run for speaker, put himself forward as a pragmatist and a manager. After the Gingrich calls, Rep. Bill Archer of Texas announce he be consider his own run for speaker. Livingston and Archer be chairmen of the two most powerful committees in the House. In a statement Gingrich said, The Republican conference needs to be unified, and it be time for me to move forward. He say he hop his colleagues would pick a successor who can both reconcile and discipline, who can work together and communicate effectively. refer to his wife, he tell his colleagues he be resign from Congress because Marianne and I be tired. We need time off to get to know each other again. He also acknowledge his own knack for bring negative attention to himself and his party. If I stay, he tell his colleagues Friday night, my controversial nature would overshadow any successes we might have, an understatement to those who recall his suggestion two years ago that he force a shutdown of the government because he be miff about have to sit in the back of Air Force One on a trip with President Clinton. accord to another Republican who take notes, Gingrich say of his resignation: There be a lot of bitterness amongst some of the members. so long as I be around, I will always be a target in the news media, which would mean we would never be able to get our message out. Clinton said: Newt Gingrich have be a worthy adversary lead the Republican Party to a majority in the House and join me in a great national debate over how best to prepare America for the 21st century. Despite our profound differences, I appreciate those times we be able to work together in the national interest, especially Speaker Gingrich's strong support for America's continue leadership for freedom, peace and prosperity in the world. many Republicans take the opportunity to portray Gingrich as a visionary. Rep. Sherwood Boehlert of New York say that during the first conference call, there be shock and surprise and strong expressions of appreciation for lead us to the promise Land. His supporters say Gingrich have the votes to win the election to nominate a speaker, which be to be conduct by secret ballot. But, they agreed, the party's slim, six-vote majority meant every vote would be a battle. Kenneth Duberstein, a former official in the Reagan administration, said, I have no doubt he have the votes to be speaker, but I'm not sure he have the votes to govern. He say that because of the deep rift in the party, Gingrich would not have be able to implement his plans. In an unusually biting reaction, Rep. Dick Gephardt of Missouri, the democratic leader, say he hop that Gingrich's resignation would clear the fierce partisan air that he have fostered. I hope that whoever succeed Newt Gingrich as speaker will immediately begin the process of repair the damage that be work on this institution over the last four years, Gephardt said. House Republicans predict that Gingrich's resignation would set off a more wide-ranging and hectic scramble to replace him than have be anticipated. There will be a lot of pretenders to the throne who will test the waters, say Boehlert, who have support Gingrich for re-election as speaker. There won't be any shortage of candidates. The presidential campaign of 2000 begin Wednesday, like it or not. The millennial election will be fight on a political playing field whose rough outlines, if not its exact boundaries, be draw by the voters in Tuesday's elections, which deliver a crushing disappointment to the giddy hopes of the Republicans and an unexpected elixir to the recently ail Democrats. President Clinton call it an astonishing triumph of issues over investigations and say the Democrats have win so many major victories because they have a clear message. Republicans agreed. Of course the next 18 months will bring many surprises and many reversals of fortune. But the election results offer important guidelines. Tuesday be a great day for Vice President Al Gore, for at least three reasons. He work furiously and successfully in the last ten days before the balloting to persuade democratic loyalists not to stay home and sulk, appear on behalf of no few than 224 candidates, accord to his office. A moderate within the spectrum of his own party, he watch moderates win crucial elections, notably in the California gubernatorial race, where Lt. Gov. Gray Davis, a cautious pragmatist like Gore, win a smashing victory. The returns an even break in the Senate and a democratic gain of five in the House of Representatives also make the impeachment of President Clinton less likely. And the good shape Clinton be in as his term ends, the good chance Gore, his sidekick for six years now, stands in the presidential nomination process and, ultimately, the election. But California voters also complicate the nominating process and set Gore strategists to work on tactics to uncomplicate it, because he and they consider the state absolutely central to his presidential aspirations. In a referendum in 1996, California adopt a primary system under which Republicans, Democrats and independent voters would all receive the same ballot, with candidates of all parties listed. That violate the rules of both major parties, and a measure on the ballot Tuesday, Proposition 3, would have rescind the 1996 change. But it failed, raise the possibility that California's March 7 primary will be a mere political popularity poll, with convention delegates choose in caucus or convention a nightmare. Tuesday be a bad day for the Republican right. High-profile right-wingers lose across the country, from Attorney General Dan Lungren in the California governor's race to Sen. Lauch Faircloth, deny re-election in North Carolina, to Rep. Mark Neumann of Wisconsin, who fail in a Senate race despite a huge spending advantage over Sen. Russell Feingold, to Ellen Sauerbrey in Maryland, who prove unable on her second try to prevail over an unpopular democratic governor, Parris Glendening. Both conservatives and moderates in the party say the Republicans have to get back to basics. even Speaker Newt Gingrich concede that the results should sober every Republican and call for new strategic thinking. If you make it a referendum on a president with a 67 per cent approval rating, as they try to do, you shouldn't be surprise if the election go against you, say Gov. Tom Ridge of Pennsylvania, a moderate whose promoters mention him weekly as a possible vice-presidential nominee. Sen. John McCain of Arizona, a conservative who tend to steer away from divisive social issues, win re-election with 68 per cent of the vote. He be study the possibility of a presidential race, but before he or any other republican nominee can hope to win, he say in an interview Wednesday, congressional Republicans and their leaders need to learn some lessons. I just hope this debacle be a wake-up call for our people, he said. You've get to be for something small government, better education, something. We're see as the party that's against everything. Polls take late in this year's campaign bore McCain out. They show that the Republicans be no longer identify with issues that be once their electoral bread and butter, such as low taxes and law and order. Tuesday be also a fresh demonstration, for anyone who need one, of the political utility of pitch a tent big enough for almost everyone. Black politicians in North Carolina, Maryland and California report that their fears of an indifferent black turnout have prove groundless. Black vote prove indispensable to a considerable number of hard-pressed democratic candidates, especially where they felt their interests directly threatened. The figures on hispanic voting, assemble from exit polls and from the candidates' own precinct analyses, show dramatic differences. In California, where the outgoing Republican governor, Pete Wilson, have play the anti-immigration card with a vengeance, both major democratic candidates Davis and Sen. Barbara Boxer, who win re-election after trail in early polls clean up among hispanic voters. He take 78 percent, she 72. But both of the Bush brothers, Jeb in Florida and George W. in Texas, take more than half the hispanic vote in their highly successful gubernatorial campaigns. so do McCain. Jeb Bush be marry to a hispanic woman, he and his brother both speak Spanish fluently and frequently, and Senator McCain have long espouse hispanic causes. Both George W. Bush and McCain will draw strength, if they decide to run, from their proven ability to appeal to Hispanic voters, as well as their general electoral strength. George W. Bush take 69 percent of the vote in Texas, where a Democrat sat in the governor's chair only four years ago, and which have the second-largest bloc of electoral votes. Florida have the fourth-largest. Governor Bush of Texas utter a rallying cry for the moderates. A leader who be compassionate and conservative, he say in his victory speech, can erase the gender gap and open the Republican party to new face and new voices. But figures on the right saw things differently. James Dobson, a lead religious broadcaster, say that Republicans have fare poorly because Gingrich and Sen. Trent Lott of Mississippi, the majority leader, have cave in to the president on the budget and de-emphasized social issues such as abortion and flag desecration. He call all but explicitly for the ouster of Gingrich. Likewise, the millionaire publisher Steve Forbes, another probable candidate in 2000, say the leadership will have a lot to answer for. Tuesday prove the potency of education as an issue, and suggest that it will emerge as a major theme of the 2000 campaign. Clinton, in his limited involvement in the campaign, and Gore, in his extensive participation, both stress democratic programs to build more schools and hire more teachers. almost a quarter of California voters and there be now almost twice as many voters in California as in any other state name education as their most press concern. Elsewhere, Democrats win the governorships of Alabama and South Carolina against the odds, partly by emphasize their rivals' opposition to lotteries that will help to pay for schools. In Iowa, a Democrat be elect governor for the first time since 1969 on a platform that feature the dilapidated condition of the state's schools and a promise to remedy it. Tuesday demonstrate the override importance of money in modern american politics. Feingold, one of the principal backers of campaign-finance reform, survive to fight another day, but so do opponents of reform. And the returns in House races, show that all but six of 401 members who seek re-election have won, underline once again how hard it is, under the present system, for a challenger to raise enough money to compete effectively. The difficulties of raise money may doom many would-be presidential candidacies. Gore will have what he needs, as will Bush, Forbes and former Gov. Lamar Alexander of Tennessee. But how many others will? Finally, Tuesday deliver an indecisive message about impeachment. Close to two-thirds of voters nationwide tell exit pollsters that they intend to send no message about Clinton, but they make it clear in response to other questions that they dislike the House inquiry into the president's allege misdeeds and want to see it end. In only two states, Kansas and Nebraska, do a majority of voters say they favor even a congressional censure of Clinton, a much mild form of punishment advocate by many Clinton backers. Some Republicans say privately that there should be no hearings at all in the Clinton matter, and some Democrats begin talk about a deal, the equivalent of a plea bargain that would bring the matter to an early close. Nevertheless, Republican members of the House Judiciary Committee say they need to press ahead with the Constitutional process that the House have set in motion. Among those take that view be Rep. Bob Barr of Georgia, a fierce foe of the president, and Rep. Mary Bono of California, whose tone have be more muted. But Rep. David Dreier of California, the incoming Rules Committee chairman, say that the election have play a role in ensure that one of us have a desire to drag that out. stun by the democratic resurgence in the mid-term elections, congressional Republicans tore into each other Wednesday over who be to blame for their failure to make the traditional opposition party gains in an off-year election. The soul-searching and recriminations and a possibility of congressional leadership challenges come as election results show that Republicans have be unable to increase their 55-45 hold over the Senate and that Democrats have pick up five seats in the House. The democratic surge mark the first time since 1934 that the president's party have gain seats in a midterm election, and it whittle the Republican House majority down to a mere six votes. The democratic victories be even more remarkable in a political year mark by the months-long scandal over President Clinton's affair with Monica Lewinsky. The Republicans' new 223-211 majority (assuming a Democrat lead in Oregon hold on to win), with one independent, amount to the small congressional majority since the republican-controlled Congress of 1953, the last time Republicans control the House until they capture it again in 1994. With attention now shift to the House Judiciary Committee and its impeachment inquiry, Rep. Henry Hyde tell fellow Republicans on the panel in a conference call Wednesday that the only witness Republicans be likely to call would be the independent counsel, Kenneth Starr. Hyde, the chairman, tell lawmakers he hop to have the committee vote on possible articles of impeachment by Thanksgiving, an act that would take the issue out of his hands and put it into Gingrich's. Committee Democrats decline comment Wednesday until they could discuss Hyde's plan among themselves. try to put the best face on the results, Speaker Newt Gingrich say in Marietta, Ga., that the Republicans still hold onto the House for three elections in a row for the first time since the election of 1932. But furious rank and file Republicans burn up the phone lines to each other, discuss whether to mount leadership challenges in both chambers in the next few weeks. We've get to reach out and have more than southern white males run the Washington Republican Party, say Rep. Joe Scarborough, a conservative from Florida. He say that Republicans this year have be leave without any accomplishments to run on. We need an agenda first of all, he said. We go an entire calendar year without an agenda. Rep. Chris Shays, a moderate from Connecticut call the election a devastating loss and say simply, There be go to be major changes in our leadership. All segments of our party want to see change. At the White House, Clinton call the election results a vindication of his party's policies. If you look at all the results, he said, they be clear and unambiguous. The american people want their business, their concerns, their children, their families, their future address here. That's what the message of the election was. One of the first difficult questions now face Congress be how to proceed with the impeachment inquiry in the face of public resistance to remove Clinton from office, and with a republican majority now so slim that it be almost certain that the 218 votes require for impeachment cannot be assembled. In a public statement release Wednesday, Hyde say The Committee continue to have a clear constitutional duty to complete its work in a fair and expeditious manner. Our duty have not change because the constitution have not changed. But Sen. Robert Torricelli, D-N.J., say the election results guarantee that impeachment will fail. I think any serious effort to remove President Clinton from office be effectively over, he said. It be simply for Newt Gingrich and Trent Lott to decide on an exit strategy. From the other side of the aisle, Rep. Rick Lazio, a Long Island Republican, said, The inquiry should be wrap up expeditiously, fairly and it ought to be resolve in the immediate future. For the past year, Republicans struggle to keep control of the House with 228 seats and to find consensus among their party's compete factions. With their numbers reduced, the republican leadership will need to carry out a tortuous balancing act to unite a hard-core conservative faction that want a more aggressive social agenda with a bloc of moderates who want their party to return to the center. The Democrats hold 206 seats, and one be hold by an indepenndent. Any small Republican faction will now have enormous leverage. The new arithmetic of the House may even lead to Democrats' and moderate Republicans' forming ad hoc majorities on issues, take control away from republican leaders. Already see some of the possibilities, Rep. Peter King of Long Island, N.Y., say northeastern Republicans would be strengthened. It give us much more leverage with the leadership and make it easy to protect New York, he said. It's go to weaken the position of the strident conservatives and the anti-northeast conservatives. Just two weeks ago, Gingrich have foreseen election gains range from 10 seats to more than 40. seem uncharacteristically uncertain Wednesday, he say he have trouble accounting for the results. Things be happen out there that none of us fully understand--neither party in my judgment, he said. take his share of the blame for his party's losses, the Georgia Republican say he have misjudge how the public would recoil from the Clinton scandal as amplify in the modern media world and how the scandal would drown out other Republican themes. I mean I totally underestimate the degree to which people would just get sick of 24-hour-a day talk television and talk radio and then the degree to which this whole scandal become just sort of disgusting by sheer repetition, he said. And as a result I think we probably underestimate the need to really aggressively push a much strong message about cut taxes and save Social Security, win the war on drugs, reform education and national defense. Majority Leader Sen. Trent Lott of Mississippi also admit mistakes, say his party have not present a clear enough message in the final 96 hours of the campaign. He also concede that Congress' final scramble to pass a $500 billion budget bill hurt his party. One of this lessons for Republicans out of this be that we need to listen more carefully to the people and we need to have a clear understanding and concise message that we do apply across the nation, he say in Washington. Both Lott and Gingrich say Republicans would put an emphasis next year on tax-cutting and shore up the Social Security system. even as the two leaders spoke, their angry rank-and-file lawmakers be make phone calls try to assess whether to mount challenges against the republican leaders who have steer the Congress since the Republican's assume control four years ago. One senior Republican staffer say the House have become a tinderbox of intrigue. Scarborough said, The long distance charges in Washington offices probably be go through the roof today. Everybody's call everybody. everybody recognize that something's terribly wrong with the direction of Washington Republicans when republican governors be do so well in New York, Massachusetts, Florida and Texas. And while Gingrich have not go out of his way to identify himself with the republican campaign's last-minute ad blitz attack President Clinton, his caucus know he be responsible. Gingrich have face down an uprising before, foil a coup attempt against him by disgruntle conservatives and some of his own leadership team in the summer of 1997. Any move to remove him remain a long-shot. But with House leadership elections now set for mid-november, Republicans say this time the dissatisfaction in their caucus have cross ideological lines to moderates like Shays as well. We get shellacked, say Rep. Christopher Cannon, a conservative from Utah. We beat ourselves because we have no agenda. Republicans be discuss possible challenges to gingrich, his second-in-command, Rep. Dick Armey, and other members of the senior leadership team. Some be envision try to run an entire new ticket head by Rep. Bob Livingston, the Appropriations Committee chairman from Louisiana and include Rep. Steve Largent, an Oklahoma conservative. ask whether Tuesday's election results could cost him the speakership, Gingrich said, I'm not particularly concerned. Republicans close to him say they expect the anger to dissipate. In the Senate, where leadership races take place in early December, some Republicans be talk of mount challenges against mid-level leadership figures. several senators express particular pique toward the re-election chairman, Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, who pour party dollars and much of his own time into try to defeat the democratic champion of campaign finance overhaul, Russell Feingold of Wisconsin. Feingold win in a close race. Some lawmakers on Wednesday approach Sen. Chuck Hagel of Nebraska to see if he would replace McConnell. Hagel confirm he have talk to more than eight senators, and be consider whether to challenge McConnell. Hagel lambast the republican leadership for the election outcome. This be a big loss for us, he said. We squander a very historic opportunity last night. To just break even be a loss. most incumbents coast to victory Tuesday night. But some will not be returning. Five House Republicans be defeated: Vince Snowbarger of Kansas, Bill Redmond of New Mexico, Jon Fox of Pennsylvania, Mike Pappas of New Jersey, and Rick White of Washington. One Democrat also lose his re-election bid Rep. Jay Johnson of Wisconsin. The new House members include 17 Republicans and at least 22 Democrats. David Wu, a Democrat be lead molly Bordonaro, a Republican in the race for one House seat in Oregon, but the final victory announcement be not expect until Friday after absentee ballots be counted. Unlike the self-proclaimed revolutionaries of the Republican class of 1994, many of the newly elect members be career politicians who rise through the ranks of local and state government. Three of the Democrats be the sons of former lawmakers, Mark Udall of Colorado, son of Morris Udall who represent Arizona; Tom Udall of New Mexico, son of the other Udall brother, Stewart, a former congressman and secretary of the Interior, and Charlie Gonzalez, who win the Texas seat of his father, Henry. A struggle for control of the House be under way, with Rep. Robert Livingston conduct a telephone campaign that could lead to him run against Newt Gingrich as speaker. But Gingrich's counter-campaign have give some members pause about oust him. At the same time, a small band of Republicans vow on Thursday that they would not vote to re-elect Gingrich under any circumstances, a move that, because of the Republicans' shrunken House majority, could tie the party in knots for months. Rep. Matt Salmon, R-Ariz., said: I personally have make the decision that I cannot vote for Newt Gingrich for speaker in January, and there be six others who have tell me they feel the same way, seven people who just will not, and it take six to deadlock the vote. Fury at the speaker have boil over since Tuesday's elections, when Republicans suffer a net loss of five seats in the House. They blame Gingrich, the party's chief strategist. But many be already angry at him for what they say be his failure to articulate a clear message for the party go into the elections and for a messy budget process that give President Clinton a political edge and contradicted Republican principles of fiscal conservativism by contain massive amounts of spending for local projects. House Republicans be to meet Nov. 18 to vote by secret ballot for their leaders. Whoever win the republican nomination for speaker must stand for election by the full House in January. even if Gingrich win the secret ballot, he could be deny re-election as speaker in January if Salmon and at least five others refuse to vote for him. Because the Republicans now control the House by only 12 seats, it would take just six votes against Gingrich to deny him a majority. With such a chaotic and unacceptable prospect looming, Livingston tell Gingrich that he should step aside for the good of the party, Republican officials said. The officials say that Livingston speak to Gingrich shortly after the election returns but also before the election, reflect Livingston's earlier displeasure with the speaker over the budget process. Several Republicans say that both Livingston, the chairman of the Appropriations Committee and one of the few members with the stature to stand for speaker, and Gingrich be work the phones on Thursday in a struggle for votes. Livingston have say nothing publicly about a challenge to Gingrich, but several members and aides say on Thursday that he would announce his intentions, possibly as soon as Friday, only after he have determine if he could win. Rep. Peter King, R-N.Y., be one of several members who speak with Livingston on Thursday. He tell me he's make a number of phone calls, that he's get a very positive response about run for speaker, and he'll decide within the next 48 hours, King said. He won't do it till he have his ducks in a row, and right now a lot of people be still loyal to the speaker, say an aide to a republican who, like many others, be try to straddle the line between fealty to a speaker who may retain power and encouragement to a challenger who offer a salve to an embattled party. many Republicans immediately blame Gingrich for the party's losses on Tuesday. Talk quickly emerge the next day of a slate of candidates to oppose Gingrich and his lieutenants. The list of possible candidates for leadership positions include Rep.e Steve Largent of Oklahoma, who talk with Livingston on Thursday about challenge Gingrich, Republican officials said, speak on the condition that their names not be reported. Those officials say that Largent tell Livingston that he want to run with him on a ticket and that he would challenge Rep. Dick Armey, the majority leader. But, these officials say that if Livingston do not challenge Gingrich, Largent would run for speaker instead. other names be float Wednesday for leadership posts. They include Reps. David McIntosh of Indiana for speaker and Jennifer Dunn of Washington as conference chairman. add to the mix on Thursday be the name of Rep. Christopher Cox, a California conservative. As a sign of the uncertainty prevailing among House members on Thursday, Rep. Henry Hyde, the chairman of the Judiciary Committee and one of the House's most venerable members, rebuff a chance to endorse Gingrich as speaker. Hyde say that Gingrich bore responsibility for the party's losses Tuesday. Leadership take credit when things go right, he said. They ought to take the blame when things go wrong. ask if Gingrich should remain speaker, Hyde said: I rather think he will, but that remain to be seen. The energy that many vent publicly on Wednesday as anger toward Gingrich seem devote on Thursday to intense internal political calculations about whether Livingston could succeed in topple Gingrich and whether he should succeed. While many support him as a veteran who understand the House and have show shrewd political skills in manage the massive federal budget, others be revive images of the Louisianan as a hot-head who give the party a bad name during the government shutdown two years ago and who tend toward arm-flailing in heated moments. One conservative leader say that he and his allies have reservations about Livingston because he be obsess about try to keep social issues out of the budget process. The budget, he said, have be a vehicle for conservatives over the years to add restrictions on federal money for abortion and other things you can't get through the Senate or past a presidential veto. If Livingston be the challenger, I doubt that will cause a rallying of the real conservatives in Congress. Some moderates say they be prepare to support him. Rep. Marge Roukema, R-N.J., said, I would be amenable to Livingston. Still, she cautioned, I'm not after Newt. But it's wrong not to sit down and seriously look at our options. Ken Johnson, an aide to Rep. W.J. (Billy) Tauzin, R-La., say that his bos be emblematic of the confusion among the broad base of House Republicans. Billy have be loyal to both Speaker Gingrich and Dick Armey, and he's still loyal to them, but he also want to hear what they have to say before commit to them in the next election, Johnson said. Everyone be ask the same question: Can we refocus the message and re-energize our base without re-aligning the leadership? Salmon say his refusal to support Gingrich no matter what be base on Gingrich's track record of one fail strategy after another, include the impeachment process and the pork-laden budget. With the challenge under way, Gingrich have be try to show members that he be responsive to their concerns. After an election night in which he portray the Republicans as victorious even as they lose seats, the next day he take responsibility for the losses. In another move, Gingrich have indicate that he be willing to cede control over the party's congressional campaign committee, allow the whole House to select its members. Gingrich be also make strong personal appeals to Republicans. Said one top House aide: He'll get support. How much? only his own vote-counters know. ","Speaker of the House Newt Gingrich has announced that he will not seek re-election to the post when the vote comes up on November 18th.He also announced that he would be leaving the House when his current term as Speaker expires in January.This announcement comes on the heels of a poor Republican showing in the mid-term elections.Although the Republicans retained a majority in the House, the Margin of Republican control shrank in the face of Democratic gains.Gingrich had been seen as the man who led the Republicans our of the doldrums into control of the House and the Senate.","Most Democrats, except for former Clinton strategist James Carville, were hesitant to attack Speaker Newt Gingrich as the 1998 elections approached.Republicans were expected to add to their majority in Congress.However, Republicans lost seats in both the House and Senate.Republicans became disenchanted with the Gingrich ""vision"" and blamed him for the losses.An active campaign began to replace Gingrich as Speaker with Louisiana Congressman Robert Livingston as the main actor.After a losing struggle to maintain his position, Gingrich resigned as Speaker.House Republicans then turned their attention to impeachment proceedings of President Clinton.","The 1998 election ended the political career of Newt Gingrich, who had become Speaker in 1994, leading a conservative, issue-driven, GOP majority.In Oct Democrats were urged to go after him.Although both houses retained a narrowed GOP majority, Newt, with his combativeness and Impeachment-fixation, was blamed for the failures by both wings of his party.The 1998 winners were Gore, Clinton, and moderates.Newt's issues seemed dead in the booming economy and old Democratic loyalists ignored Clinton's morals and returned to the fold.As fellow Republicans jockeyed for his positions, Newt resigned as Speaker on Nov 6 and also decided to leave his House seat.","James Carville complained that fellow Democrats didn't join his war against Speaker Newt Gingrich leading up to the congressional elections of 1998.Gingrich had led the impeachment inquiry against President Clinton in the House.When, contrary to all predictions, the Democrats gained five seats in the House and held their own in the Senate, Republicans enlisted in Carville's cause, blaming Gingrich for the election results.Gingrich battled fiercely as Rep. Livingston rallied forces against him, but ultimately Gingrich accepted defeat agreeing to cede the speakership and his seat in the House.He blamed his defeat on blackmail by Republican cannibals."
26,"America Online be on the verge of agree to purchase Netscape Communications Corp., the Internet pioneer at the center of the government's antitrust suit against Microsoft Corp., executives involve in the talks say Sunday. The propose deal be a complex, three-way transaction involve AOL, Netscape and Sun Microsystems Inc. AOL, the lead on-line service with more than 14 million subscribers, would acquire Netscape's popular site on the World Wide Web and its software business. AOL would also enter into a joint marketing and development partnership with Sun Microsystems to strengthen Netscape's other business of sell to large corporations the heavy-duty software need to serve up Web pages and other Internet technologies to many thousands of users at the same time. The purchase, an exchange of AOL shares for Netscape stock, be value at roughly $4 billion. A complete deal could be announce as soon as Monday morning. But executives involve in the talks caution Sunday night that some details remain to be negotiated. The Netscape deal, if consummated, would realign three businesses at the forefront of the modern economy on-line services, Internet software and electronic commerce. It would strengthen two of Microsoft's lead rivals, AOL and Sun Microsystems. At the same time, however, it would end the independent existence of Netscape, an Internet software maker once regard as the most serious challenger to Microsoft's dominance of the personal computer software market. Netscape, found in 1994, have struggle over the last 18 months under an assault from Microsoft. Its Navigator be the runaway leader in the market for the browser software use to navigate the World Wide Web. But Microsoft, respond to the Internet revolution, enter the market aggressively, quickly match the quality of Netscape's technology and then bundle the Microsoft browser, Internet Explorer, into its industry-standard Windows operating system and give it away free. Eventually, Microsoft's browser technology catch up to Netscape's. Earlier this year, Netscape announce layoffs and start distribute Navigator for free as well, as Microsoft steadily gain in the browser market. Since then, Netscape have focus mainly on two businesses advertising and transaction fees from its Netcenter Web site and sell industrial-strength software to corporations that be build their own Internet sites on which to conduct electronic commerce. AOL believe it have the expertise to increase revenues from Netscape's Web site and, help by Sun's programmers and vast corporate sales force, to accelerate Netscape's software sales as well, executives involve in the negotiations said. Among large corporations, Sun's version of Unix, Solaris, be among the most popular operating systems for the powerful computers that run Netscape's server software. The much small Netscape would be place under the wing of AOL and Sun Microsystems. The three companies have combine revenues of more than $12.4 billion last year. Microsoft, by comparison, have revenues of more than $14 billion. This deal would insure that the fundamental elements of Netscape survive within big companies that can drive its technologies forward, say David B. Yoffie, a professor at the Harvard business school and co-author with Michael A. Cusumano of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology of a recent book, compete on Internet Time: Lessons from Netscape and Its Battle with Microsoft. The impact of the deal, if any, on the government's antitrust suit against Microsoft be uncertain. It do appear to support a key theme of Microsoft's defense namely, that it operate in a fast-moving industry where corporate alliances shift all the time. Thus, Microsoft argues, antitrust policy should tread gently. But the deal, government officials insist, should have no direct effect on the current case. No matter how much the alliances shift, it doesn't affect the central fact of Microsoft's monopoly and how it have use and abuse its market power to protect its monopoly, say David Boies, the Justice Department's lead trial lawyer in the Microsoft case. Executives represent Netscape, AOL and Sun Microsystems be government witnesses at the Microsoft trial. And the serious merger talks between Netscape Chief Executive Officer James Barksdale and AOL Chairman Steve Case begin about a month ago, or just after the start of the Microsoft trial, accord to people close to the talks. Industry analysts suggest that the companies may have be embolden to take strong anti-microsoft steps base partly on the perception that the antitrust case would weaken Microsoft. And representatives of Kleiner Perkins Caufield &AMP; Byers, a Silicon Valley venture capital firm regard as a power broker among Microsoft's rivals, sit on the boards of Netscape, Sun and AOL. Still, executives involve in the talks say that the timing of the propose deal be unrelated to the antitrust trial. Nor should it, one person noted, be regard as a single-minded attempt to circle the wagons against Microsoft. Indeed, AOL, accord to one person close to the talks, plans to keep Microsoft's Internet Explorer browser as the default choice on its on-line service. One of the government's allegations in the antitrust suit be that Microsoft win out over Netscape as the main browser for AOL because Microsoft use its Windows monopoly as a bargaining chip. To win the browser deal, Microsoft offer AOL prime real estate on the Windows desktop, the main screen on more than 90 percent of personal computers sell today. stay with Microsoft's browser can be see as proof that AOL still regard placement on the Windows desktop as crucial, as well as a careful step to avoid undermine one of the allegations in the government's case. For AOL, the Netscape purchase would accelerate its evolution toward the Internet. At present, its flagship on-line service be a hybrid to its own proprietary service, it have add a gateway to the World Wide Web. In addition, for consumers who do not subscribe to AOL's dial-up service, it also have its own Web site, aol.com, which attract about 24 million visitors a month, accord to Media Metrix/Relevant Knowledge, a market research firm. Its big Web site offer a wide range of information, entertainment, Internet chat and e-mail, a leading example of the all-in-one sit that have become know as portals. Netscape's Netcenter traffic have slip a bit in recent months, to under 16 million visitors a month, but it, too, be a major portal. Together, they should be a huge player in the intensifying portal battle for viewers and result advertising revenues. Yahoo be the current leader among portal sites with more than 25 million monthly visitors, while Microsoft's site attract more than 20 million a month. Though know as a new-media company for consumers, AOL be also interested in boost its electronic commerce business with the Netscape purchase. AOL have recently do work with Eastman Kodak, American Greetings and other companies, not only promote their products to on-line subscribers but also build the Internet infrastructure of software to conduct electronic commerce. AOL note projections like a recent one from Forrester Research Inc., which predict that worldwide Internet commerce could reach as high as $3.2 trillion by 2003, or 5 percent of global sales. Sun Microsystems, analysts say, could be a strong partner for AOL in the market for Internet commerce software. Sun be a corporate software company with a sales force of several thousand. As it move increasingly to Internet technology, AOL should prove an excellent partner for Sun in terms of develop and use Sun's Java, an Internet programming language. And while Netscape's browser no longer generate revenue on its own, it be a distribution channel for Java technology. Having Netscape's browser safely in the hands of a friendly company be of strategic importance for Sun, since Microsoft own the alternative in the browser market. AOL be expect pay little, if any, premium over Netscape's stock price on Friday, executives close to the deal said, since Netscape shares have more than double in the last month. In the last week alone, Netscape's stock have jump about $12, or nearly 45 percent, follow reports that it be discuss a possible partnership with AOL. The stock close Friday at $39.1875, up $2.625. AOL's shares gain $1.50 Friday, closing at $84.875. envision a thoroughly networked world in which the World Wide Web be a limitless marketplace of information, entertainment, products and services, America Online Inc. Tuesday lay out the details of its agreement to buy the Netscape Communications Corporation for $4.2 billion. By move quickly toward what both companies have recently come to see as the inevitable convergence of technology and media, America Online hop that it will secure a solid lead in a battle already join by giants like the Microsoft Corp. and the International Business Machines Corp. to transform the great part of cyberspace into a vast virtual mall. Part of that vision rest on an alliance with Sun Microsystems that America Online negotiate as part of the deal. Sun not only bring a cyber-savvy sales force to the effort but, even more importantly, a strong technology partner in develop Netscape's industrial-strength software for run Internet sites. Sun be indeed a technology heavyweight. It own the Java programming language specially design for Internet applications, and Solaris, among the most popular commercial operating systems for the powerful computers that big corporations use to serve up Internet services like the World Wide Web, e-mail and retail transactions. It also manufacture a highly respected line of powerful computers base on its own microprocessor chips. But for America Online and for the big internet players against which it will compete the real potential gold mine lie further down the road, perhaps five years away, when people will venture on line for information or shopping not only from personal computers but from inexpensive Internet appliances cost $200 each, or maybe included free as part of a subscription service, just as some cellular phones be now. Today, be wire remain a comparatively elitist activity an estimate 25 percent of american households have access to the Internet last year, and 5 percent of households buy merchandise on line. But the executives at America Online and Netscape hope that their deal will accelerate the timetable for the day when the Net be ubiquitous, when people will tap into the World Wide Web from appliance-like devices, pagers, cell phones, television set-top boxes or computers as routinely as they use the telephone today. A new generation of Internet devices to be able to deliver our service anywhere be a key part of what this deal be about in the long run, say Stephen M. Case, 40, the chairman of America Online. For the present, however, the idea be to make America Online, the nation's leading online service, the standard way to get onto the Internet, the executives explained. Netscape, the Internet pioneer, be a crucial part of that effort, they said. There be no assurance that this vision of the technological future will prove accurate or, even if it does, that the America Online-Netscape combination will lead the way. Still, the long-range game plan help explain what bring America Online and Netscape together. And the ability of the companies' executives to sell that vision to Netscape's whiz-kid programmers in particular will determine whether the merger succeeds. Netscape's headquarters in Mountain View, Calif., be likely become a prime target for Silicon Valley headhunters. As be the case with any software company, Netscape's key asset be its talented programmers, and many of these code hackers may be reluctant to work for America Online, which still have a reputation as a middle-brow service cater to online newcomers, know derisively as newbies. Stock options and other financial incentives will be tailor to try to keep Netscape employees on board. But these people want to change the world, and we've get to be clear that join with America Online, along with the Sun component, really be a big opportunity for us, say Marc Andreessen, the 26-year-old cofounder of Netscape who lead a team of young programmers from the supercomputing center at the University of Illinois to Silicon Valley to start the Internet software company in 1994. This ought to be the preeminent Internet company over the next decade, Andreessen declared, speak from a cell phone on a streetcorner in Palo Alto, Calif. For his part, Andreessen, a Netscape executive vice president, will become Netscape's chief technology officer for the next three or four months, until the merger be completed. His new job at America Online have not yet be determined, but it be likely to be chief technology officer of the combined company as well, an America Online executive said. Already, accord to one Netscape board member, Andreessen have deliver a 12-page single-spaced memorandum to Case, set out his view of the technological road map the new company should follow into the future, emphasize the opportunities for electronic commerce in an environment in which most people be link to the Internet. Netscape, populate with compute sophisticates, and America Online, know as an on-ramp to the Internet for the technologically challenged, seem a corporate odd couple. But the two companies, its executives explained, have be evolve toward each other for more than a year. In a telephone interview from America Online's headquarters in Dulles, Va., Case describe Netscape as an enterprise that have morph itself from a company dependent on sales of its software use to browse the World Wide Web and in Microsoft's cross-hairs into a business that rely on advertising and other revenues from its popular Netcenter Web site and from sell software to corporations to handle electronic commerce. The Netscape transformation be largely a reaction to Microsoft's competitive assault on its browser business a central element in the government's antitrust suit against Microsoft. Microsoft bundle its browser into its industry-standard Windows operating system, and give away the browser for free. The government allege these steps be part of a pattern of anticompetitive practices, while Microsoft maintain the moves be intend mainly to benefit consumers. Early this year, after lay off workers and suffer a large loss last year, Netscape announce that it would also distribute its browser for free. It seem to have stabilize its business around its new model. Netscape announce Tuesday that it earn $2.7 million on revenues of $162 million in its fourth fiscal quarter, which end in September. Yet America Online have also change in the last couple of years, move well beyond its reputation as an online service for beginners. It now have an Internet chat service and run its own all-in-one site on the Web, know as a portal, which include e-mail, Internet searching, news, entertainment and online shopping. America Online have really change from a closed online service for novice users to an Internet media and technology company with a diverse set of brands, Andreessen said. These two companies have be move in the same direction, and the fit be a good one. America Online Inc. want to become the next Microsoft in two promising information-age fields where Microsoft Corp. be just another company the Internet media business and electronic commerce. With its propose purchase of Netscape Communications Corp., AOL, the nation's large dial-up online service with more than 14 million subscribers, hop to take a significant step toward that ambitious goal. If the $4 billion deal be complete the companies have not reach a final agreement as of Monday night AOL would acquire a leading Internet brand and enlarge its wired audience by absorb the millions who regularly visit Netscape's popular NetCenter site on the World Wide Web. Acquiring Netscape would really enhance America Online's role as the premier Internet media company, say James F. Moore, president of Geopartners Inc., a consult firm. America Online be assemble the kind of audience numbers that will convince people the Internet be become a mainstream media. In the new media business, as in traditional media like television or newspapers, eyeballs translate into advertising revenue. But what really intrigues media executives and consumer marketers about the new media news, entertainment and services render in computer code be that it be inherently a two-way medium with which people can interact with the tap of a key or the click of a mouse button The interaction that advertisers and marketers want to see, of course, be buying. And it be the potential for exploit an instant, direct connection to consumers that have fuel all the recent optimism about electronic commerce. Today, companies be sell everything from books to baby clothes over the Internet. most companies have not progress beyond the experimentation stage, but there be a handful of encourage success stories like Amazon.com, the on-line bookstore. By 2003, Forrester Research Inc., whose business be analyze trends in cyberspace, projects that Internet commerce could reach $3.2 trillion, or 5 percent of all sales worldwide. AOL be at the forefront of this convergence of media and commerce converge, and integration reflect in the lineage of its leaders. Steve Case, the chairman, be once a new-product manager for Pepsico's Pizza Hut chain, while Robert Pittman, the president, be a former MTV executive. Microsoft be also invest heavily in new media and electronic commerce. It have an online service, MSN, which compete with AOL, as well as information-and commerce Web sit that focus on travel, cars and real estate. It also own Sidewalk, a network of local sites that list movies, restaurants and stores in cities around the country include Seattle and New York. Its MSNBC Internet news service be half of a joint venture with NBC. Microsoft be expect to be a formidable competitor in the media-and-commerce business. It have no shortage of bright people and it have more money than any rival. Besides deep pockets, Microsoft have the built-in advantage in any computer-based medium because its Windows operating system run more than 90 percent of personal computers sell today. Its control of the Windows desktop give it the most valuable piece of commercial real estate in the information age. In theory, at least, owning that desktop screen should help Microsoft steer consumers to its online offerings an issue that be key to the government's antitrust suit against Microsoft. But so far, Microsoft have start slowly in the fields of Internet media and electronic commerce. Microsoft may want to, but it do not dominate these new markets, say Richard Shaffer, a principal of Technologic Partners, a research firm. America Online recognize that the big opportunity be in these emerge growth businesses like electronic commerce instead of try to take Microsoft on head-on. Still, if the Netscape deal be completed, AOL will also find itself in the software business in a way it have never be in the past. Netscape be know as the pioneer in the commercial development of software use to navigate the World Wide Web. Microsoft saw the browser software as a direct threat to its industry dominance and pursue that market aggressively, bundle its own browser with its Windows and give it away free tactics that have be challenge by the government. But Netscape no longer generate revenues from its browser, which it now also distribute for free, but from the sale of heavy-duty software sell to corporations. much of this software be use as the technological back office for electronic commerce use in build Web sites and process transactions. A surprising element in the propose deal be that AOL intend to hold onto Netscape's corporate software business instead of sell it off to an establish software company. America Online just doesn't have credibility in that market, observe Michael A. Cusumano, a professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology's Sloan School of Management. Executives close to AOL explain the decision as the need to provide full-line offerings for electronic commerce, from corporate Web site to the computer screens of consumers. But AOL have decide it need help to preserve and strengthen Netscape's corporate software business. To do that, it have bring in Sun Microsystems Inc. in a side deal, which have complicate the transaction considerably. AOL, accord to executives close to the propose deal, will own Netscape, but it will have a joint marketing and development partnership with Sun. As part of the deal, AOL will agree to purchase about $300 million worth of Sun's computers for its service, while Sun will apparently agree to purchase sizeable amounts of Netscape software, which Sun's sales force must sell. Still, AOL and Sun have a longer-term objective as well one that promise to place them in more direct conflict with Microsoft. For nearly a year, William J. Raduchel, Sun's chief strategist, have be work closely with AOL, accord to Sun executives. A former Harvard economics professor who teach Scott McNealy, the Sun chairman, Raduchel have focus on Sun's Internet program technologies, call Java and Jini, both of which be see as potential threats to Microsoft's dominance. By combine Sun's technology prowess with AOL's powerful consumer brand, the Sun executives say, there be the potential for a kind end-run around Microsoft's grip on desktop computing. In its research laboratories, Sun have be work on a stripped-down network computer a simple-to-use information appliance, which could cost as little as $200 or be give away as part of a subscription service. The concept be that AOL's Internet media and electronic commerce services could be deliver to many more homes than today because many people still shun the expense and difficulty of use a personal computer. The appliance would be mainly a receiver and screen, with most of the compute power reside on vast central computers serve up information as users request by tap a few buttons. Sun's technological specialty be this kind of centralized network computing. If the long-term AOL-Sun vision ever materialize certainly a three-to-five year bet, at the least it could give both companies a boost and technological independence from Microsoft. Microsoft Corp. argue in federal court Monday that the proposed acquisition of Netscape Communications Corp. by America Online seriously undermine the government's antitrust suit against the software giant. From a legal standpoint, this propose deal pull the rug out from under the government, William Neukom, Microsoft's senior vice president for legal affairs, say Monday morning on the courthouse steps. The reasoning behind this assertion, Microsoft says, be that the propose deal demonstrate that Netscape and the large software industry be healthy and vibrant even with all of the illegal and anti-competitive practices allege in the government's suit. But David Boies, the government's lead attorney, say all of that be irrelevant. Whatever the deal end up be if there end up be a deal be not go to remove any of the obstacles that Microsoft have place in the path of competition in this industry, he said. Michael Lacovara, a Microsoft lawyer who be question a government witness, economist Frederick Warren-Boulton, suggest to him during the trial Monday that the proposed acquisition undermine Warren-Boulton's argument, that Microsoft seem head toward obtain a monopoly in Internet browser software to match the one it apparently hold in operating systems. After all, about 22 percent of Americans who use the Internet reach it through America Online. And at present AOL use Microsoft's Web browser, Internet Explorer, as the service's default choice. In exchange for that, Microsoft place an AOL advertisement and Internet link in Windows 98. Lacovara ask the witness whether, once AOL's service contract expire in January, he would expect AOL to continue to distribute Microsoft software. Yes, Warren-Boulton responded. It be not at all clear to me that AOL's incentive to do this be change by this propose merger with Netscape. He note that America Online officials have say their need to be among the online services feature in Windows force them to accept Microsoft terms establish Internet Explorer as the default choice. Lacovara then ask Warren-Boulton the question that lay under his entire cross-examination of the witness and Microsoft's large assertion Monday about the propose Netscape-AOL deal. surely this combination, he asked, tells you something about the nature of competition in the software industry? Warren-Boulton's answer be probably not the one Lacovara have be after. To the extent that this potential merger be the result of Microsoft's actions with these exclusive contracts and other actions, he said, it be unfortunate to see the disappearance of a firm like Netscape, the brightest, new star. warren-boulton's purpose on the stand for the government be to establish that Microsoft do have a monopoly in operating-system software; more than 90 percent of the world's computers use a Microsoft operate system. That be the foundation under most of the government's case since federal antitrust law forbids certain behavior by a monopolist that would be legal for a firm that face healthy competition. Through repeated, often circumlocutious questioning, Lacovara try to make the case that Microsoft's overwhelm market share be ephemeral. The software industry be so vibrant and fast moving, he suggested, that Microsoft could be topple from its position at any moment a point of view the company encourage among its employees. On Friday and Monday, Lacovara repeatedly point out that other companies be place other operate systems on the market, and some software companies principally Microsoft's great rivals be write software for these new systems. But Warren-Boulton argue that the existence of these fringe competitors in the operating system market do not mean in any way that Microsoft do not have monopoly power. On Monday afternoon, Lacovara make an issue of the success Apple Computer Co. be have sell its new imac computer. He enter into evidence an Apple news release issue last month showing, among other things, that 12.5 percent of the people buy Apple's new imac computer have previously own a Windows machine. Apple computers use a different operating system, Mac-OS. The outcome of the Microsoft antitrust case may be a long way off, but one thing be already clear: This be the first major e-mail trial. The government's prosecution and Microsoft Corp.'s defense, to a striking degree, be legal campaigns wag with electronic messages. The human testimony often pal next to the e-mail evidence. On the stand or in videotaped testimony, the people be question shrug, mumble and forget. The e-mail be alive with ideas and competitive zeal, punctuate with profanity and exclamation points. The second week of the trial end with the prosecutors be frustrate because a lengthy cross-examination by Microsoft's lead lawyer leave no time for the government to show several hours of a videotaped deposition of Bill Gates, the Microsoft chairman. With a new witness, an executive of Apple Computer Inc., take the stand Monday, it be uncertain when the Gates tape will be played. The Justice Department and the 20 states sue Microsoft believe that the tape will strengthen their case because it show gate say he be not involve in plans to take what the government alleges be illegal steps to stifle competition in the Internet software market. The Gates videotape, say David Boies, the Justice Department's trial lawyer, offer an opportunity to judge Gates' credibility. But the Gates credibility gap, if there be one, becomes an issue not because of the videotape but because his taped remarks can be compare and contrast with the e-mail he write and received. The e-mail record, the government insists, show gate waist-deep in plot the anti-competitive deals and bully tactics that he deny or professes to have never hear of in his taped deposition. If his machinations be central to the government's case, why not summon Gates to the trial? The government do not need to put Gates on the stand, because we have his e-mail and memoranda, Stephen Houck, a lawyer for the states, tell the court. The Microsoft legal team have for months be prepare its e-mail defense. First, Microsoft argues, anything that look damaging be take out of context. I urge your honor, John Warden, Microsoft's lead lawyer, tell Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson, to view with considerable skepticism the crazy quilt of e-mail fragments that seem to form the core of the government's case. But Microsoft have also mount an e-mail counterattack, cull from the millions of messages it obtain by subpoena from competitors in pretrial discovery. Warden's cross-examination ritual be to present a government witness with an internal e-mail from his company and then pose a declaration as a question. These interrogations have two refrains: Isn't it true your company do exactly what you be accuse Microsoft of doing, and isn't it true that Microsoft prevail not because it be a predatory monopolist but because of its superior technology? Microsoft be accuse of try to prod companies to stay out of its way. So last week, for example, Warden produce e-mail from Stephen Case, the chairman of America Online, suggest a partnership with Netscape Communications Corp. in which both companies would focus on their respective strengths. That division of labor, Case wrote, would be the best way to achieve the goal that Marc Andreessen, Netscape's cofounder, describe in an early e-mail as beat the Beast From Redmond that want to see us both dead a reference to Microsoft's headquarters in Redmond, Wash. Printouts of e-mail be just another form of write communication. By the 1920s, as typewriters become common, type memoranda start to be use in court cases. From the 1950s through the 1980s, legal experts say, there be an explosion of documentation fuel by the new technologies of electric typewriters, photocopying and fax machines, and then personal computers. And e-mail, they add, have play an important role in legal inquiries for years, like the Iran-contra case in the 1980s when e-mail find in Oliver North's computer prove crucial. But the Microsoft case be the result of a sweeping government antitrust investigation of a high-technology company where e-mail have supplant the telephone as the most common instrument of communication. E-mail have just revolutionize investigations of this kind, one senior Justice Department official said. While under investigation, Microsoft have hand over to the government an estimate 30 million documents, mostly e-mail. In the trial, the two sides have submit about 3,000 exhibits, mainly e-mail. And in their e-mail, people often communicate more frankly and informally than when write a letter or a report tap it out, punch a button and it's go into cyberspace. But e-mail communication be documentary evidence, which in legal cases provide a rich, contemporaneous record of what people be think and plan at the time. It can be a sharp contrast to formal oral testimony, so often coach by lawyers and craft by selective memory. The e-mail record certainly make the i-don't-recall line of response harder to sustain, say Robert Litan, a former senior official in the Justice Department's antitrust division who be now at the Brookings Institution. It can also be powerful ammunition for point to contradictions in testimony. And that be what the government will do in attack Gates' credibility with his videotaped deposition, take over three days in August. The government offer a glimpse of that strategy on the first day of the trial. It show a few brief clips of a point in the deposition when Gates be ask about a meeting on June 21, 1995, at which, the government alleges, Microsoft offer to divide the browser market with Netscape and to make an investment in the company, which be its chief rival in that market. In the taped deposition, Gates say he recall be ask by one of his subordinates whether he think it make sense to invest in Netscape. He say that he be ask about it after the June 1995 meeting and replied, I didn't see that as something that make sense. But in an e-mail on May 31, 1995, Gates urge an alliance with Netscape. We could even pay them money as part of the deal, he wrote, buy a piece of them or something. The contradiction between Gates' deposition and his e-mail, though, do not of itself speak to the issue of whether Microsoft make an illegal offer to netscape. To be sure, it be what Microsoft do not what it say in e-mail communications that count most. But once the e-mail that look bad get in the record, you end up do what Microsoft's lawyers be go to spend much of this trial do try to explain it away, say Stephen Axinn, a lead antitrust litigator with the firm Axinn, Veltrop &AMP; Harkrider in New York. America Online build itself into the most potent force in cyberspace largely by appeal to families with chatty teen-agers who want to flirt online and adults look for an easy way to send electronic mail while check the weather and sports scores. Now, the company have to get serious if it be to win the hearts and minds of corporate executives in pin-stripe suits. nearly lose in the complexity of America Online's deal to buy Netscape Communication Corp. be America Online's announcement that it will enter an entirely new market: work behind the computer screen to help companies open and operate online stores. Netscape already have create software that make it a player in provide support for what be already know as electronic commerce. But America Online now say it have ambitions to offer a much wide array of software, consulting and services for online merchants. most companies that sell to consumers realize that they need to get into the e-commerce space, say America Online president Robert Pittman in a news conference Tuesday. We see a major business in offer them an end-to-end solution. The market be big and grow big by the day. Forrester Research estimate that $325 million will be spend this year on electronic commerce software and another $5.3 billion on services that range from graphic design to the turn-key operation of entire online stores. By 2002, Forrester estimates, the combined market for electronic commerce services and software should top $35 billion. E-commerce services be the silver bullet that will enable companies to be able to take advantage of the true business opportunities on the Web, say Traci Gere, an analyst at International Data Corp. The market be grow very rapidly, but it be very fragmented. Analysts say the leader today in e-commerce services be IBM, which have a full line of offerings from sophisticated software products to hand-holding consulting. other competitors include well-known information technology consult companies such as Andersen Consulting, the spin-off from the Arthur Andersen account firm; Electronic Data Systems, which run computer systems for big companies, and PricewaterhouseCoopers, which offer accounting and consult separately but under one umbrella. Software companies like Microsoft and Netscape sell package programs, typically with little or no consult to help customers use them. There be also plenty of new companies that have sprout up to provide electronic commerce services. Some, like Agency.Com and Organic Online, start basically as advertising and design firms. Others, include U S Web and Viant, have emphasize programming and consulting. In fact, those two strains be blur together, as exemplify by U S Web's pending merger with CKS Group. America Online argue that its advantage in this increasingly crowd bazaar be its ability to combine a broad subscriber base of about 15 million customers with Netscape software, plus hardware from Sun Microsystems, which have join in America Online's venture into electronic commerce engineering. This be the first time anyone have put a true end-to-end solution that start with the silicon and end with the audience, say Barry Schuler, America Online's president for interactive services. We start with Sun's line of servers, then the commerce tools to build a store, the support services to process orders and then a deal for online real estate that can drive the traffic. Despite the advantages Netscape and Sun bring, analysts say that America Online face a variety of problems in its new quest. Chief among them be whether it can appear to have the consistency, focus and follow-through that corporate customers demand. AOL be not the first company that come to my mind when it come to business-quality software, say Robert Chatham, a senior analyst with Forrester Research. Its decision to keep Netscape as a separate unit and offer electronic commerce services in partnership with Sun will not enhance its credibility, Chatham said. America Online doesn't look like a homogenous vendor, he added. It look like customers will have to tangle with a menage a trois of AOL, Netscape and Sun. Nor have Internet service providers and other telecommunications-oriented companies show much evidence, Ms. Gere of International Data said, that they be capable of offer the highly specific customize services that big corporate clients demand. Telecommunications companies that try to do things efficiently for a large number of customers have not be able to offer customized one-to-one relationships, she said. Pittman say that America Online have be drive to the e-commerce business because companies that approach it want to sell their goods need more help than simply advertise online. We be find people who be expert in run bricks-and-mortar stores be limit by their infrastructure, he said. They have an online store, but their square footage be too small. even before the Netscape deal, America Online be move to provide some electronic commerce software and services. It have be rewrite the software that let companies open online stores to be base on universally accept Internet standards rather than the specific computer language use only on America Online. This new software, which now will be combine with Netscape's online store services, will be available for companies to use both on America Online and on the Internet. Similarly, it have develop a service that let users create a file with their credit card numbers and ship address so they can make online purchases without retyping all that information each time. America Online be work to offer it for a fee to stores on the broad Internet. There be a wide range of services that be incorporate in electronic commerce. These include high-end strategy consulting to help companies decide whether and how to sell online without hurt their traditional sale in stores. There be all sorts of computer systems to be developed, range from the online stores themselves to connect those sites to a company's exist inventory and accounting systems. There be creative services that include graphic design, media buying, customer list analysis and other marketing and promotional efforts. And there be operational services that involve actually maintain the big servers that users connect to when they use the online stores that display catalogs, take orders and process payments. America Online, Schuler said, will emphasize services that relate to market rather than back-office functions. We will consult on how to merchandise and sell online, he said. We understand the consumer piece of the puzzle. Some competitors worry that America Online's electronic commerce services may simply be a device to sell its software and hardware. The challenge be to prove that clients be get the best possible solution for their business, say Robert Gett, the chief executive of Viant. If they offer AOL and Netscape and Sun, their answer be a bit tainted. Netscape do have an expand force of about 700 people who provide consult and custom programming. But they have be most competitive, Gett said, in compete for nuts-and-bolts projects rather than the more lucrative assignments to develop and carry out a full-fledged strategy on the Web. They say, `who know our software better than Netscape?' Gett said. We help customers decide which platform be best for them. But America Online argue that the combined might of it, Netscape and Sun be just what the business needs. We always believe that commerce, that be buy goods and services, be the huge revenue stream of the future, Schuler said. We have only see the tiny tip of the iceberg. America Online build itself into the most potent force in cyberspace largely by appeal to families with chatty teen-agers who want to flirt online and adults look for an easy way to send electronic mail while check the weather and sports scores. Now, the company have to get serious if it be to win the hearts and minds of corporate executives in pin-stripe suits. nearly lose in the complexity of America Online's deal to buy Netscape Communication Corp. be America Online's announcement that it will enter an entirely new market: work behind the computer screen to help companies open and operate online stores.

There be all sorts of computer systems to be developed, range from the online stores themselves to connect those sites to a company's exist inventory and accounting systems. America Online be on the verge of agree to purchase Netscape Communications Corp., the Internet pioneer at the center of the government's antitrust suit against Microsoft Corp., executives involve in the talks say Sunday. The propose deal be a complex, three-way transaction involve AOL, Netscape and Sun Microsystems Inc. AOL, the lead on-line service with more than 14 million subscribers, would acquire Netscape's popular site on the World Wide Web and its software business. But as part of the deal, AOL would also enter into a joint marketing and development partnership with Sun Microsystems to strengthen Netscape's other business of sell to large corporations the heavy-duty software need to serve up Web pages and other Internet technologies to many thousands of users at the same time. The purchase, an exchange of AOL shares for Netscape stock, be value at roughly $4 billion. A complete deal could be announce as soon as Monday morning. But executives involve in the talks caution Sunday night that some details remain to be negotiated. The Netscape deal, if consummated, would realign three businesses at the forefront of the modern economy on-line services, Internet software and electronic commerce. It would strengthen two of Microsoft's lead rivals, AOL and Sun Microsystems. At the same time, however, it would subsume Netscape, an Internet software maker once regard as the most serious challenger to Microsoft's dominance of the personal computer software market. Netscape, found in 1994, have struggle over the last 18 months under an assault from Microsoft. Its Navigator be the runaway leader in the market for the browser software use to navigate the World Wide Web. But Microsoft, respond to the Internet revolution, enter the market aggressively, quickly match the quality of Netscape's technology and then bundle the Microsoft browser, Internet Explorer, into its industry-standard Windows operating system and give it away free. Earlier this year, Netscape announce layoffs and start distribute Navigator for free as well, as Microsoft steadily gain in the browser market. Since then, Netscape have focus mainly on two businesses advertising and transaction fees from its Netcenter Web site and sell industrial-strength software to corporations that be build their own Internet sites on which to conduct electronic commerce. AOL believe it have the expertise to increase revenues from Netscape's Web site and, help by Sun's programmers and vast corporate sales force, to accelerate Netscape's software sales as well, executives involve in the negotiations said. Sun's version of Unix, Solaris, be among the most popular operating systems for the large, powerful computers that run Netscape's server software. This deal would insure that the fundamental elements of Netscape survive within big companies that can drive its technologies forward, say David B. Yoffie, a professor at the Harvard business school and co-author with Michael A. Cusumano of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology of a recent book, compete on Internet Time: Lessons from Netscape and Its Battle with Microsoft. The impact of the deal, if any, on the government's antitrust suit against Microsoft be uncertain. It do appear to support a key theme of Microsoft's defense namely, that it operate in a fast-moving industry where corporate alliances shift all the time. Thus, Microsoft argues, antitrust policy should tread gently. But the deal, government officials insist, should have no direct effect on the current case. No matter how much the alliances shift, it doesn't affect the central fact of Microsoft's monopoly and how it have use and abuse its market power to protect its monopoly, say David Boies, the Justice Department's lead trial lawyer in the Microsoft case. Executives represent Netscape, AOL and Sun Microsystems be government witnesses at the Microsoft trial. And the serious merger talks between Netscape Chief Executive Officer James Barksdale and AOL Chairman Steve Case begin about a month ago, or just after the start of the Microsoft trial, accord to people close to the talks. Industry analysts suggest that the companies may have be embolden to take strong anti-microsoft steps base partly on the perception that the antitrust case would weaken Microsoft. And representatives of Kleiner Perkins Caufield &AMP; Byers, a Silicon Valley venture capital firm regard as a power broker among Microsoft's rivals, sit on the boards of Netscape, Sun and AOL. Stock prices vault to record levels Monday, further a recovery that as recently as two months ago seem nearly unthinkable. I think we be in the most serious correction since 1990, but I never think or write that the bull market be over, say Byron Wien, U.S. equity strategist at Morgan Stanley Dean Witter &AMP; Co. now it seem all of that be behind us. The Dow Jones industrial average rise 214.72 points, or 2.34 percent, to 9,374.27. The record be the first since July 17, when the Dow close at 9,337.97. Since Aug. 31, when the Dow stand at 7,539.07 after a steep slide, the blue-chip gauge have rise more than 24 percent. For the year, the Dow be up 18.54 percent and have a chance of rise more than 20 percent for a fourth consecutive year, something never accomplish before. Broader averages also climbed. The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock index set a record, rise 24.66 points, or 2.12 percent, to 1,188.21. The Nasdaq composite index do not reach a new high but post the big percentage gain Monday, rise 49.21 points, or 2.55 percent, to 1,977.42. And the Russell 2000 index of smaller-company issues gain 3.86 points, or nearly 1 percent, to 398.15. Monday's action be energize by a daily record for the number of mergers and acquisitions value at $1 billion or more. The merger announcements not only prompt investors to change estimates of how much companies be worth but also indicate come declines in the outstanding shares of stock. This may be a supply-demand story, where demand for stocks be rise and the supply of stock be reduce as one company after another merges, say Hugh Johnson, chief investment officer at First Albany Corp. The flow of money into mutual funds be fairly strong, and there be pressure on managers to put that money to work. Two deals seem to be catalysts for broad swaths of stocks. News that Bankers Trust may be close to accept an $8.9 billion offer from Deutsche Bank of Germany heighten interest in financial-services and bank stocks. And word that America Online may acquire Netscape Communications for $4 billion in stock power Internet and other technology stocks to even lofty valuations. Among financial companies, J.P. Morgan gain 6 1/16, to 115 11/16. American Express be up 4 3/8, to 108 15/16. Merrill Lynch jump 4 3/8, to 76. And Donaldson, Lufkin &AMP; Jenrette rise 3 9/16, to 42}. Netscape be the most active stock Monday, gain 2}, to 41 15/16. America Online gain 4 3/8, to 89\. other Internet stocks also surged, and analysts say the group, which have see meteoric gains in recent weeks, be ripe for a steep correction. Yahoo and Amazon.com both become $200 stocks on Monday. Yahoo rise 30 7/16, to 221 7/16. And Amazon.com gain 37 3/8, to 218. The performance of the Internet stocks be an unsettling sign, Wien said. Still, more-established technology shares also have a very good day. IBM rise 7, to 166 5/8. Microsoft jump 5 9/16, to 119 3/16. And Intel close at 113 9/16, up 1{. After Monday's big price moves, Wien say that accord to his calculations, stocks be about 10 percent overvalued. By contrast, in the middle of July the market be 20 percent overvalued, he said. Nonetheless, the market's recovery, which have be buttress by three cuts in interest rates by the Federal Reserve Board, have leave many longtime Wall Street hands grasp for historical parallels. At this point we be in new ground, say Laszlo Birinyi, who head his own market research firm. At the beginning of the year, I say my target for the Dow be 10,000 by the end of 1998. If anyone have ask when the market go through what now look like a corrective blip, I would have say my new target would have be about 9,000. I be surprise the 10,000 figure come back on the table for this year. The New York Times say in an editorial for Wednesday, Nov. 25: America Online's effort to acquire Netscape and set up a partnership with Sun Microsystems be a reminder of how rapidly the corporate landscape can change in fast-moving technical fields. But it do not lessen the need for the Justice Department to vigorously pursue its antitrust suit against Microsoft, the dominant player in software. The department have present solid evidence that Microsoft have use its monopoly in operate systems to muscle rivals and partners so as to head off competition in other software realms. The Internet have rise so quickly as an information medium that only four years ago, in his book The Road Ahead, Bill Gates scarcely mention it. In addition, only a couple of years ago America Online, the world's big online service, be have so much trouble get rid of the bugs in the system it be widely deride as America On Hold. now Microsoft have move so aggressively into the Internet that the Justice Department be accuse it of predatory behavior, and America Online have rocket forward to make deals with other Internet players. In its antitrust suit against Microsoft, the federal government charges that the company have illegally bundle its own browser with its Windows operating system to smother Netscape's chances of market its browser. now in the corridors outside the antitrust trial Microsoft's lawyers maintain that Netscape have find a new partner in America Online and have no need of protection from the government. But it could be as easily argue that Microsoft have bludgeon Netscape into dissolution, force a distress sale to America Online. Nor be it clear that customers of America Online will choose Netscape's browser as a vehicle for buy and sell on the Internet. Even in its newly musclebound form, America Online remain dependent on Microsoft's good will for favorable placement of an AOL icon on the main desktop screen. It may be that, years hence, America Online, Netscape and Sun will put together an alternative means to the Internet through telephone lines, cables or the like. But until that day, fairness require Justice Department action to insure that Microsoft not use its current position to thwart consumer choice. only when companies know they can get their products to the consumer will they have the incentive to innovate and turn the Internet into the revolutionary medium it promise to be. ","As the government continued to press its anti-trust suit against Microsoft, AOL has begun negotiations to purchase Netscape.Netscape is at the heart of the antitrust suit.Netscape alleges that Microsoft marketing practices, packaging its Internet Explorer in its operating system denied market opportunities to Netscape.The AOL deal, a three-way negotiation between AOL, Sun Microsystems and Netscape, would combined three Microsoft rivals.AOL is counting on the Netscape purchase to allow it to expand its internet Market by helping business operate on the internet in an effort to join Media and technology.","In a bid to become a leader in the lucrative cyberspace economy, AOL will buy Netscape and set up a partnership with Sun.The venture will let AOL offer corporations end-to-end services, including servers, software, and accessibility to consumers.Eventually, AOL hopes to capitalize on the production of cheap devices offering Internet access to more homes.News of the deal helped push the Dow Jones to a new high.Meanwhile, Microsoft, accused by the Justice Department of using its operating system dominance to squelch competition in the browser market, claims the deal shows the software industry is healthy and that Netscape needs no government protection.","As the U.S. government pressed its antitrust case against Microsoft Corp. in November 1998, America Online (AOL) proposed an alliance with Netscape Communications and Sun Microsystems.The three-pronged deal promised to provide on-line services, Internet software and electronic commerce.AOL was to buy Netscape and forge a partnership with Sun, benefiting all three and giving technological independence from Microsoft.Microsoft lawyers argued unconvincingly that AOL's purchase of Netscape would undermine the government's antitrust case, based in large part on Netscape's complaint.It remained to be seen whether AOL could achieve a vast virtual mall.","America Online became the leading force in cyberspace for individuals to exchange e-mail and check the latest news.AOL saw a bright day ahead as a company that could provide online services, Internet software, and electronic commerce.To position itself better in this growing market, AOL sought to buy Netscape and work an alliance with Sun Microsystems.Netscape has faltered because of the ubiquity of the Microsoft Windows operating system requiring its browser.Microsoft argued that a vibrant technology market and rising stock prices undercut antitrust charges against it.At the trial the government presented thousands of e-mails supporting its case."
27,"President Leonid Kuchma call Friday for corrections to Ukraine's program of market reforms, but pledge that reforms would continue. Kuchma do not elaborate in his comments to a group of ukrainian economists, say only that the changes be necessary because of the country's economic problems. Kuchma urge the economists to come up with recommendations before a national meeting of economists in November, the Interfax news agency reported. Ukraine have suffer economic problems since the 1991 collapse of the Soviet Union and it have be especially hard hit by the financial crisis in neighbor Russia, its main trading partner. The russian crisis have hurt bilateral trade, cause the ukrainian currency to fall and lead to a withdrawal of investors from Ukraine. In recent months, Kuchma have implement some economic reforms by decree, prompt the International Monetary Fund to release the first installment of a long-awaited dlrs 2.2 billion loan. many reforms, however, remain stalled. National Bank chairman Viktor Yushchenko be in Washington this week for consultations with IMF officials. Yushchenko have warn that the bank would not spend its dwindle reserves to support the hryvna currency, but have avoid comments on the currency in recent days. Kuchma meet Friday with Yushchenko, Prime Minister Valery Pustovoitenko and other senior officials to discuss ways to stabilize the hryvna. The government's press service say they focus on possible ways to keep the hryvna under 3.5 to the U.S. dollar through the end of the year. The hryvna have be trade at 3.4 to the dollar in recent days but trading have be limited. There be wide expectations in Ukraine that the hryvna will fall even further, and Ukrainians have be stock up on food, clothing and household goods to save their fast-devaluing money. When the world's finance ministers and central bankers gather last year in Hong Kong, they nervously congratulate each other for contain at least for the moment a nasty financial brush fire in Asia. In a year's time, many predict in hallway chatter, the troubles in Thailand and Indonesia would look like a replay of Mexico in 1995 a rough bump in the road for a world enjoy remarkable prosperity. talk about bad market calls. Twelve months later, as the same financial mandarins clog Washington with their limousines and glide through endless receptions at the annual meeting of the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank, just about everything that could have go wrong in the world economy has: the bad downturn in Japan since World War II, economic meltdown in Russia, a depression in Indonesia that be plunge 100 million people below the poverty line, and deep fears over what happen next in Latin America. What make this year's IMF meeting most remarkable, though, be that the harsh criticisms be direct at the monetary fund itself, and, by extension, at the U.S. Treasury, which be view as the power behind the IMF. This year, in place of confident predictions, there be mutual recriminations. Arguments be break out over whether the true culprits be crony capitalists and weaken leaders like Russian President Boris Yeltsin, or huge investors who pour money into the world's emerge markets with reckless abandon in the mid-1990s and panic in the past twelve months. Whatever the reason, one reality prevails: Hundreds of billions of dollars have flee from economies on four continents seek the safe havens possible, often in the United States and the money be not return anytime soon. And the subtext of every seminar on capital flows and every conclave of nervous ministers will be some painfully blunt questions: Can this be stopped? Or be the world head for a global recession? Fifty-three years ago the IMF be create after the Bretton Woods conference which seek to stabilize the world economy and secure the peace after World War II. now it be under attack from all sides, charge not only with worsen a bad situation by misjudge the economics, but with be politically tone-deaf in some of the most volatile capitals in the world, from Jakarta, Indonesia, to Moscow. For the first time, there be disturb questions about whether the institution itself be still capable, financially or politically, of contain the kind of economic contagion that catch the world unaware. Once, the IMF's critics be largely find in Africa and South Asia, be the fund be often view as arrogant; today they include Wall Street's big players and top officials in the most powerful economies of Asia and Europe. only a few include former Secretary of State George Schultz and members of Congress who be increasingly suspicious of all international institutions be talk about scrap the IMF altogether. But almost everyone be talk about create a new financial architecture that can do what the old one clearly cannot: smother financial wildfires before they leap around the globe. President Clinton, British Prime Minister Tony Blair and other leaders, after months of silence, have edge into the debate, in some cases wrest the issue for the first time from their finance ministers and central banks. Their fear, their advisers say, be that 15 months of financial turmoil be now threaten political stability. such concerns have turn this year's meeting into a tumbled mass of worries and a groping for short and long-term solutions. The Japanese, the French, the Southeast Asians be all arrive in Washington with different diagnoses of what go wrong, and different solutions about how to set it right. The United States have its own set of plans, a mix of suggestions to force more disclosure of financial data in countries around the world and to impose more american-style financial standards and regulation. Meanwhile, an ideological argument be break out over whether the world should slow down a long march toward more free and open markets a strategy press by the Clinton administration for the past six years. Others argue that it be unwise to start rebuild the hospital while the patients be still on the operating tables. last year the standard answer that all of us be give come down to this: `We have the IMF and the World Bank, and they know best,' Indonesian Foreign Minister Ali Alatas say over breakfast in Washington the other day, reflect on how the crisis turn 30 years of astound growth in his country into an overnight depression. then they say everything that go wrong be our fault, he said. But now, now I think people know that much of the problem come from the outside, and we need something better. And the IMF itself be begin to fight back, an awkward role for an institution dominate by Ph.D. economists who be unaccustomed to be openly challenged. Every place you turn you read the same story, that we come in, that we make things worse, say Stanley Fischer, the deputy manage director of the fund, who be bear in Northern Rhodesia now Zambia and become chairman of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology's economics department before take a job that have now put him in the center of the financial storm. We frequently get the blame, some of it well-deserved, he said. But it be politically convenient for governments around the world to cry, `The IMF make us do it,' and pin their mistakes on us. That's fine. We'd rather be loved, but more than that we'd like to be effective. MISCALCULATIONS, POLITICS AND SAFETY NETS On a steaming January day, Michel Camdessus, the IMF's top official, slip into Jakarta to the private residence of President Suharto and sit down for a four-hour meeting to tick off, line by line, the huge reforms Indonesia would have to implement in return for tens of billions of dollars in emergency aid. Two previous deals have collapse when Suharto ignore the fund's conditions, so Camdessus insist that he strike a deal directly with Suharto, then Asia's longest-serving leader. It be a meeting of men who know different worlds of power politics: Suharto rise as a general in central Java, and Camdessus have detonate mines in Algeria for the french army before enter the french Treasury on his way to become head of France's central bank. It be all there, a senior IMF official recalled. He be tell he have to dismantle the national airplane project, the clove monopoly, all the distribution monopolies. At one point, Camdessus look at the impassive Suharto and said, You see what this mean for your family, a reference to their vast investments in the country's key industries. He said, `I call in my children, and they all understand.' But within months, that exchange in Jakarta come to symbolize the IMF's twin troubles: Its inability to understand and reckon with the national politics of countries in need of radical reform, and its focus on economic stabilization rather than the social costs of its actions. Suharto have no intention of fulfil the agreement. It was, one of his former Cabinet members said, a delaying move that be obvious to everyone except Camdessus. perhaps one reason why the IMF sometimes appear tone-deaf be that its senior staff be almost entirely compose of Ph.D. economists. There be few officials with deep experience in international politics, much less the complexities of javanese culture that be at work in Indonesia. Historically, experts in politics and security have gravitate to the United Nations, development experts to the World Bank, and economists to the IMF create dangerous gaps in a crisis like this one. As a result, the fund have only a rudimentary understanding of what would happen if its demands be meet and all Indonesia's state monopolies be quickly dissolved. While that system line the pockets of the Suhartos and their friends, it also distribute food, gasoline and other staples to a country that stretch for 3,000 miles over thousands of islands. To help balance the budget, the fund demand a quick end to expensive subsidies that keep the price of food and gasoline artificially low. But that, combine with the huge currency devaluation that spark the crisis, result in high prices and shortages that fuel riots that continue to this day, as millions of Indonesians lose their jobs. The IMF unintentionally, its officials insist also speed Suharto's resignation, insist on the elimination of crony capitalism, code words for remove the Suharto family from the center of the economy. Ultimately, that may prove to be Indonesia's salvation, if the new government can contain the rioting against the ethnic chinese minority whose money be desperately need to save the country's fast-shrinking economy. It be worth noting, Fischer say this week, that our programs in Asia in Indonesia, Korea and Thailand only take hold after there be a change in government. Nonetheless, the Indonesia experience have revive the argument that the IMF be so focused on stabilize banks and currencies, on prevent capital flight and free up markets, that it be blind to the social costs of its actions. Among the tough critics have be its sister institution, the World Bank, whose main charge be alleviate poverty. You've see the tension almost every day, one senior World Bank official say recently. The bank have go to extraordinary lengths in recent months to differentiate its role from that of the fund, and to announce a tripling of aid to the poor in the countries hit by the economic chaos. even U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan have join the argument, warning in a speech at Harvard recently that if globalization be to succeed, it must succeed for poor and rich alike. It must deliver rights no less than riches. It must be harness to the cause not of capital alone, but of development and prosperity for the poor of the world. IMF officials say they be change strategies when they see they be exact too great a social cost. It's a very difficult formula to get exactly right, Fischer say in August, as Russia be teeter and the IMF be send in $4.8 billion in aid that be rapidly wasted. You need enough discipline to send the right message to the markets and keep investors from fleeing. But you need enough leeway to keep people from suffer more than they otherwise would. In recent months, he noted, the IMF have allow more spending to sustain subsidies for basic goods for long periods in Indonesia, Korea and elsewhere. There be a new flexibility at the IMF a senior indonesian official conclude recently. It be a lot better. A U.S. PAWN, OR A RUNAWAY AGENCY? The Clinton administration admit that the IMF have many failings, many of them on display this year. But it insist that the world have go through global financial crises without an IMF once before in this century and the result be the 1930s. I have no doubt the situation over the past year would have be much bad with great devaluations, more defaults, more contagion, and great trade dislocations without the program agree with the IMF and the finance it have provided, Deputy Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers tell Congress last week. many Republicans and some Democrats be unconvinced. even though the Senate have overwhelmingly approve an $18 billion contribution to the fund to help it fight new crises, the House defeat that measure two weeks ago. The fund's last hope of get the money, which will free up nearly $100 billion in contributions from other nations wait for the United States to act, will come when the House and Senate try to resolve their budget differences in a conference committee in the next 10 days. A rejection, Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin insists, would send a message around the world that the United States be turn its back on the one institution charge with restore economic stability. Everywhere else in the world, though, politicians and businessmen insist that one of the big problems with the IMF be that, contrary to the view of Congress, it act as the U.S. Treasury's lap dog. Ask in Jakarta or Moscow, and the response be the same: The IMF never ventures far without look back for the approve nod of its master. When the United States weigh in, however, be when the IMF be call on to rescue a country in deep trouble. only then do the IMF and the U.S. Treasury have the leverage to extract commitments in return for billions in aid. In theory, the U.S. influence be limited: It have an 18.5 percent vote in the fund. Germany, Japan, France and Britain have about 5 percent each. But in practice the United States usually get its way, exercise its influence behind the scenes, often in interactions between Fischer and Summers. The two meet when Fischer be on the MIT faculty and Summers be a graduate student take one of his classes, later become a colleague at MIT. Each serve as chief economist of the World Bank. It be Summers who be instrumental in place Fischer in the fund's no. 2 job, and these days they talk constantly. It's usually a warm relationship, Fischer say this summer. Remember, this be a job where you cannot turn to outsiders for advice you can't call the chief economist at a Wall Street firm, or even many of your academic friends, because so many of the issues be confidential. The Treasury's relations with Camdessus be often more strained as he play the role of world diplomat, travel the globe and try to coax along political leaders. The tensions be obvious from the start of the Asia crisis. The fund make little secret of its displeasure that the United States be not offer direct aid to thailand, a major U.S. ally, as a sign of support and confidence. Mindful of the backlash in Congress when Mexico be bail out with U.S. money, that be the last thing the Treasury plan to do. Summers, in turn, think the fund be not force the Thais to implement its reform commitments rigorously enough or disclose their true financial picture. Within the U.S. government there be other dissension: The State and Defense Departments felt the United States should do more for Thailand, but back off when the Treasury ask if they would like to pony up some aid out of their own budgets. There be other conflicts. When Japan use the last IMF meeting to propose set up a $100 billion Asia Fund one that would exclude the United States and would probably offer aid under much more relaxed conditions than the IMF does. Rubin call up Camdessus at breakfast one morning and tell him that the japanese proposal would undercut the IMF's authority. We've just have a dispute with Michel, Rubin report to his aides as he return to his orange juice and croissant. One of them shoot back: And it's only 8 a.m. Camdessus back down at Rubin's insistence and walk away from money that Asia could have used. Japan say it will be back with a similar proposal this weekend, this time for a $30 billion fund. Camdessus have also rankle U.S. officials with statements that amount to cheerlead to reassure the markets sometimes in the face of the facts. In June, with Russia on its way to collapse, Camdessus declare that contrary to what markets and commentators be imagine about the slow collapse of Russia's economy, this be not a crisis. This be not a major development. The bailouts of Russia and South Korea be prime examples of how Washington muscle into the IMF's turf as soon as major U.S. strategic interests be involved. last Christmas, as South Korea slip within days of run out of hard currency to pay its debts in December, it send a secret envoy, Kim Kihwan, to work out a rescue package. I didn't bother go to the IMF, Kim recall recently. I call Summers' office at the Treasury from my home in Seoul, fly to Washington and go directly there. I know that be how this would get done. Within days the Treasury dispatch David Lipton, its most experienced veteran of emergency bailouts, who be leave his post as undersecretary for international affairs this month, to shadow the IMF staff's negotiations with the government in Seoul. Fischer be displeased. To make a negotiation effective, it have to be clear who have the authority to do the negotiating, he said. WHO LOST RUSSIA? The pattern be repeat this summer, when the United States race to put together a $17 billion package for Russia. The IMF's staff in Moscow declare that Russia need no money at all it just need to enact policies that would restore confidence in investors. The Americans and Germans come to a different conclusion. Soon after, U.S. officials gather in the White House situation room to consider what might happen to russia if the ruble be devalue and market reforms collapse and to push the IMF to come up with emergency money. So the fund begin assemble a last-ditch program to prop up a country that have resist its reform plans for seven years. Camdessus, though, be still hesitant, question whether the IMF should risk its scarce resources in Russia. We have to pull Michel along, a senior Treasury official recalled. As it turn out, Camdessus' instincts be right while the approach champion by Rubin and Summers prove disastrously wrong. The first installment of that payment $4.8 billion be wasted, prop up the currency long enough, in the words of one IMF official, to let the oligarchs get their money out of the country. then Yeltsin reverse his commitments, let the ruble devalue anyway, begin print money with abandon and fire virtually every reformer in his government result in a collapse of the IMF agreements and the indefinite suspension of its aid program. Now, inside the IMF and on Capitol Hill, there be recriminations over who lose Russia. Publicly, Fischer argue that there be no apologies owe for what we attempt in Russia. But some IMF officials complain privately that they let Rubin and Summers run roughshod over them, strike a deal that fell apart within weeks as the Russian parliament rebel and Yeltsin back away from his commitments. Summers respond that the United States take a calculated risk because it be vastly good that Russia succeed than not succeed. The russian collapse touch off new rounds of economic contagion, with investors flee Latin America, and trigger huge losses in hedge funds like Long Term Capital, the Greenwich, Conn., investment firm that need to be rescue by Wall Street powerhouses whose money it have invested. Russia be a turning point, say Robert Hormats, the vice chairman of Goldman, Sachs &AMP; Co. It make the world realize that some countries can fail, even if the IMF and the Treasury intercede. And that change the perception of risk. Now, as the countries meet to face a future that the IMF have warn could be very bleak, they need to reverse those perceptions, or watch countries slowly starve for lack of capital. The emerge markets be call for controls on short term investments. The french want a strong IMF. The Americans say the answer be more disclosure, so that investors be good warned, and tough regulation. These be usually nice, quiet meetings; everyone very polite, a top U.S. official say earlier this week. not this year. Ukraine's parliament on Friday refuse to approve President Leonid Kuchma's decree establish a state fund to compensate people for savings lose in banks. Deputies vote 240-47 to prepare a revised version of the decree and debate it later in the month. They must consider the decree by Oct. 10, or else it automatically take effect under the constitution. Leftist factions, which vote against the propose legislation, say it would not fully guarantee the return of savings lose during the financial instability that have recently hit Ukraine. The fund Kuchma propose to establish would have accumulate money in a special National Bank account and repay people in case the bank they keep their savings in go bankrupt or become insolvent. Although the decree provide for compensation of deposits amount only to 500 hryvna (dlrs 147 at the current exchange rate), its authors say it would cover more than 90 percent of Ukrainians who keep their money in banks. The measure be mean to prevent mass withdrawals of deposits that most ukrainian banks have already experience as people, scar by the fall of the national currency and the turmoil in neighbor Russia, start to stock up on food, clothing and household goods. Government officials say that Ukrainians have recently withdraw at least 10 percent of the 3 billion hryvna (dlrs 882 million) they deposit in banks. Russia's new prime minister pick an unusual way to reassure the nation Thursday. After two weeks of deliberations he announce that he still have no plan to rescue the country from its economic crisis. I want to repeat once more there be no program, Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov said. It have yet to be work out. In most nations such a statement might provoke alarm. But Primakov be seek to calm an anxious public that be worry that the Kremlin's cure could be bad than the disease. It be not as if Russians do not have something to be concern about. Thursday Primakov convene a meeting of top aides to try to hammer out a strategy for overcome the economic woes. A main item on the agenda be the plan draft by Yuri Maslyukov, a Communist and the government's senior policy maker on economic issues. It do not take long for Maslyukov's plan to hit the street. A newspaper, Kommersant Daily, publish it in full Thursday morning. not surprisingly Maslyukov's plan call for a great state role in the economy, include controls on hard currency. A new State Bank for Reconstruction and Development would be establish use the nationalized assets of failed commercial banks. Wages and pensions would be pay in two months, and the minimum wage would be index to inflation. There would be huge tax cuts, a combination that suggest that the government be commit to print additional money. The exchange rate of the ruble would be set by the central bank, base on changes in inflation and the balance of payments. Maslyukov's plan also imply that Russians would be able to buy dollars at exchanges through the country. It stipulate that hard currency could enter the country only with special authorization. Exporters would be require to sell most of their hard currency reserves. That be an allusion to currency controls that send shock waves through the russian public. Russians have come to treat the dollar as a second currency, and many people have squirreled away dollars as a hedge against inflation. It be an obvious stupidity, Otto Latsis, a commentator with the newspaper Noviye Izvestiya, said. People won't give their dollars away. They will go to the black market if they need to. Yegor Gaidar, the former prime minister who favor free markets, say the plan be a war against the dollar and predict that it would lead to a shortage of imports. As the criticism grew, Primakov rush to distance himself from the talk of currency controls. The rumors of the state's become a monopolist on the inflow of hard currency into the country be nonsense, he said, assert that the document publish by Kommersant Daily be just one of six possible plans. Primakov may be oppose to wildly unpopular currency controls. He may be worry that the plan would would set off the panic buying of dollars, further depress the ruble. Or he may simply be try to keep his distance from Maslyukov's plan while Russia tries to wrangle its next disbursement, $4.3 billion, from the International Monetary Fund. The particulars could be modified, but many people follow the maneuver say they believe that it represent the basic thrust of the government's thinking. Primakov have call for great state regulation and an expansion of the money supply, two themes of Maslyukov's plan. The plan also have many similarities with the plan present to the government by Gorbachev-era advisers. We think it be close to be a final document, say the United Financial Group, a russian investment business. It be unclear how long Primakov can carry on without spell out a detailed strategy. The oust tax chief, Boris Fyodorov, have argue that the IMF should not provide further aid until Primakov have take tough measures to build a free market. Primakov has, however, seek to turn that logic on its head, arguing that his government's economic strategy will depend on the fund's willingness to provide aid. His aim appear to be to pressure the fund by imply that it will be the fund's fault if Russia be force to default on its loans or take draconian measures at home. Or as Primakov put it Thursday, without the fund's money, Russia will have to impose unpopular measures. Wall Street extend a global stock selloff Thursday with the Dow industrials tumble more than 200 points for a second straight day. The Dow Jones industrial average, which plunge 237.90 points on Wednesday, fell an additional 210.09, or by 2.7 percent, to close at 7,632.53. broad market indicators also sink sharply in heavy trading. Bank and technology stocks be particularly hard hit. The selling spree, amid worries about shrink corporate profits and fears of new financial crises, leave the Dow 18.3 percent, or more than 1,700 points, below the all-time high of 9,337.97 reach on July 17. It be get closer to the low of 7,400 that be reach during trading Sept. 1, before Wall Street's best-known indicator begin a comeback bid that bring it above 8,100 as recently as Monday. The Dow's 12.4 percent slide in the third quarter, which end Wednesday, be its bad quarterly performance in eight years. It now be 3.5 percent below where it begin this year. Stock prices earlier plunge in Asia, with Tokyo shares fall 1.6 percent to a new 12-year low, and shares be fall sharply in Europe, where Germany's central bank leave interest rates unchanged. Blue chips in London sink 3.1 percent to close at new lows for the year, while the key index in Frankfurt, Germany, close down 5.5 percent and the main indicator in Paris be off 5 percent. The selloff in stocks have send a flood of money into U.S. Treasury securities, a traditional haven in times of uncertainty. Yields on 30-year Treasury bonds fell far below 5 percent Thursday, reaching levels unseen for long-term government bonds since 1967. Traders be alarm to see prices on the New York Stock Exchange nosedive 2.9 percent on Wednesday, even though the Federal Reserve have lower a key interest rate one-quarter percentage point on Tuesday. Some traders be disappoint that the cut be not deep amid fears a go-slow approach would not do enough to counter the economic crises that have sweep through Asia and Russia and be threaten Latin America. The smaller-than-expected lowering of interest rates by the U.S. Federal Reserve have a chain reaction, say Lee Won-ho, an analyst at Samsung Securities Co. in Seoul, South Korea, where the main stock index fell by 1.5 percent. It be affect Wall Street, the japanese market, ours and others. The manage director of the International Monetary Fund, Michel Camdessus, on Thursday say the Fed make the right decision in cut rates and that global powers now must push for strong growth to offset steep recessions in Asia and Russia. Asked why stock markets, particularly in the United States, have react so negatively to the Fed rate cut, Camdessus say he believe confidence will soon be restored, especially if financial leaders show resolve in their discussions over the next week. There also be worries about where the next financial market crisis may erupt after last week's dlrs 3.6 billion private bailout of Long-Term Capital Management LP of Greenwich, Connecticut. In addition, investors worldwide worry that the downturn on Wall Street could signal a possible slowdown in economic growth a bad omen for the many foreign companies dependent on exports to the huge U.S. market. There's a psychological impact overall, but there's also a direct impact on companies like Sony and TDK which derive a high percentage of their earnings from overseas markets, say Pelham Smithers, a stock strategist in Tokyo at ING Baring Securities (Japan) Ltd. A new survey in Japan say confidence among small- and medium-sized businesses about the economy plunge to its bad level since the Bank of Japan begin the quarterly samplings in 1967. The United States be disappoint by the economic confusion within the new russian government of Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov, say Secretary of State Madeleine Albright on Friday, and she warn Russia about the dangers of an anti-western policy. In her first comprehensive review of u.s.-russian relations since Primakov be confirm as prime minister last month, Albright say Washington be deeply concern about Russia's direction and do not think the crisis there would soon abate. We have hear a lot of talk in recent days about print new money, index wages, imposing price and capital controls and restore state management of parts of the economy, she tell the U.S.-Russia Business Council in Chicago. We can only wonder if some members of Primakov's team understand the basic arithmetic of the global economy. While praise Primakov, once her counterpart when he be foreign minister, as a pragmatist able to cooperate on key issues with Washington, she have harsh words of warn for him. Our initial reaction to some of the direction he's go in have not be particularly positive, she said, adding, The question now be whether that cooperation can continue. The United States must keep up its aid to Russia but be adjust it to promote the building of democracy and student exchanges as well as arms control, Albright said. Washington do not favor more direct aid. more big bailouts be not by themselves go to restore investor confidence in Russia, she said. In the long run, the gap between Russia's needs and its resources must be meet not by foreign bailouts but by foreign investment. Albright sharply criticize as self-defeating the many voices in Russia who want to shift the emphasis in Russia's interaction with America and our allies from one of partnership to one of assertiveness, opposition and defiance for its own stake. Russia could not stand alone in the world, she said, and the United States' ability to help Russians help themselves will go from be merely very, very difficult to be absolutely impossible. At the same time, she said, Washington would not assume the worst, for there be still plenty of people in Russia who will fight against turn back the clock. And she urge the world and american critics to be patient with the workings of the democratic process in Russia and not start each day by take a census of reformers in the Kremlin, a census that american officials themselves promote before President Boris Yeltsin dismiss the previous government. While Moscow may continue to oppose any NATO use of force against serbian forces in the southern province of Kosovo, Albright said, NATO must be prepare to act regardless. If the Communist Party have its way and it have be plan for months millions of Russians will take to the streets on Wednesday for some of the big demonstrations in years. But now that Communists or politicians with the Communist stamp of approval be run the country and its economy the question be what the marchers will be demonstrate against. President Boris Yeltsin and his economic advisers be easy targets two months ago. But Yeltsin seem but a shadow of himself today, and his advisers be gone. The Communists, who have undergo a sort of resurgence by play on the discontent, be work hard to cast themselves as outsiders in the government that they help run and to keep the focus of the protests on Wednesday on Yeltsin and his policies. even that strategy may backfire, however, because discontent over Yeltsin do not necessarily translate into support for his predecessors. An adviser to the Communist Party leader, Gennadi Zyuganov, make headlines not long ago when he call the new government bourgeois. The characterization be striking, because the new prime minister, Yevgeny Primakov, be one of Zyuganov's top choices for the post. The deputy prime minister in charge of the economy, Yuri Maslyukov, be a Communist Party figure who once head Gosplan, the infamous central-planning program that help bring the Soviet Union to ruin. We don't have slogans that be aim against the government, the first secretary of the Moscow Communist Party committee, Alexander Kuvayev, say in a recent interview. All the slogans be aim against the president and the economic course of the country. only the president can fully be blame for the course that have bring the country to this situation. Anger over Russia's fate, and their own, be draw some Russians back to soviet-style slogans and old-style hostility toward capitalism. The ardently pro-communist newspaper Sovietskaya Rossiya devote most of its front page on Thursday to what it say be the results of a contest among readers for protest slogans. The entries range from catchy to kitschy, from, Legislator, official, banker study the Constitution; the exam be Oct. 7, to, Imperialist! Help Russia return the exported capital, and we will pay the debts at once. Russia have see nothing approach this sort of economic chaos and despair since 1993, when hyperinflation sweep the economy. There be no real way of know whether the late travails will produce huge and ugly crowds or small, peaceful ones. A deputy editor and political analyst at a newsweekly, Itogi, Masha Lipman, say the situation be not unlike that of 1993, when Yeltsin sought, and won, a popular mandate in a referendum. He use it to dissolve the communist-dominated Parliament and increase his own power. That lead to an autumn showdown, the shelling of Parliament by tanks and the total defeat, for the time being, of Yeltsin's legislative opponents. You can interpret this demonstration as a Communist mandate, but I don't think they will act like Yeltsin, Ms. Lipman said. Support for the Communists be at its small level, maybe 20 percent. In a survey of 1,714 people that be release last week the all-russian Public Opinion Center say that nearly half the population support the idea of demonstrations against Yeltsin, but that barely one-tenth be likely to participate in any way. nobody be interested in any sort of struggle, Yuri Levada, who head the center, say in an interview. This be mainly a general expression of a great wave of distrust of authorities, mainly the president. He's the great scapegoat for all our sins. There seem to be little enthusiasm for demonstrations of any sort. only a few thousand people turn out Sunday for the fifth anniversary of the shelling of Parliament and Yeltsin's subsequent triumph over the Communists. The Communist Party and the Federation of Independent Russian Unions, a leftist organization that say it be the main sponsor of the protests, predict that 9 million Russians will participate on Wednesday. The government have vow to keep order without resort to force. But it be concern enough that it have summon 11,000 police officers to patrol Moscow and 6,000 military troops to intervene if violence erupts. Protests since 1993 have generally be tepid, a deep-seated feeling here. Some demonstrations last week, more or less practice runs, hint at similarly dampen marches this year. President Boris Yeltsin would respond strongly to any effort to prohibit Russians from buy foreign currencies, believe the move would be like bring another Iron Curtain down on the country, his spokesman say Friday. The president clearly understand that such a ban would be a clear violation of our rights ... that would mean a return to the Iron Curtain in everyday life, say presidential spokesman Dmitry yakushin. The remarks come after media reports of a government economic plan in the works that would prohibit Russians from buy U.S. dollars and other foreign currencies, and institute other strict economic controls, roll back seven years of reforms. Though government officials say such a plan be only one of six possibilities, Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov warn Thursday that he might be force to take unpopular measures to rescue the russian economy if it do not receive the next installment in a dlrs 22.6 billion loan from the International Monetary Fund. Central Bank Chairman Viktor Gerashchenko and Finance Minister Mikhail Zadornov fly to Washington on Friday for negotiations with the IMF over the dlrs 4.3 billion installment. IMF officials have say they want the russian government to come up with a sound economic program before the loan be given, and have make it clear that currency controls and boost the money supply by print rubles be not acceptable. But Primakov say that the country's plan would be dependent on the IMF loan, not the other way around. No short-term economic plan will be know for another three weeks, long after the IMF be set to make its decision, say First Deputy Prime Minister Vadim Gustov. A draft version of the government's fourth-quarter budget would rely heavily on the IMF loan, the Kommersant newspaper said. Without the loan, the government would have to engage in major deficit spending. Calls for Soviet-style controls part of the plan draft by First Deputy Prime Minister Yuri Maslyukov and leak to the press have apparently create a rift within the Cabinet. The plan draw heavy criticism from Zadornov, and Gerashchenko call the idea of ban foreign currency sales a mad idea. Meanwhile, Russia's stock market drop by 5 percent to 38.8 Friday, but trading be so light the downward move mean little. The stock market have continue to fall since the crisis hit Aug. 17. And tax collection be down in September, the result of the collapse in Russia's banking system, say Alexander Pochinok, head of the government's finance and credit department. Revenues total 14.3 billion rubles (dlrs 875 million), 700 million rubles (dlrs 43 million) less than expected. The government want to reverse this trend by raise taxes for oil and gas companies, but the idea be expect to meet sharp resistance in the low house of Russia's parliament, which want to cut tax rates, Pochinok said. Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov say Saturday that the economic crisis would not bring an end to the government's program of privatize state property. Privatization will be accomplish for growth of production, growth of investment and growth of production effectiveness through renewal of major funds, Primakov say during a meeting of western businessmen. We shall conduct privatization so that it serve the interests of the people, the state, and business, he said, accord to the ITAR-Tass news agency. Primakov reassure the businessmen, members of the prime minister's consultive council on foreign investment in Russia, that the government have no plans to ban the circulation of U.S. dollars in Russia. But, he said, the government would take steps to staunch the flow of dollars from Russia. respond to media reports of a government economic plan that would prohibit Russians from buy U.S. dollars and other foreign currency, Primakov say the reports absolutely do not correspond to reality, ITAR-Tass quote him as saying. He say there be no need to regulate the influx of dollars into Russia, but the government should take steps to prevent what he call the dollar drain. russian companies stash about dlrs 2.5 billion outside the country in September alone, the Interfax news agency report Friday, quote central bank figures. Primakov say foreign investors be the force that will help Russia to minimize its losses from the current economic crisis. We be very much interested in foreign investments, especially in ones that go into the real production sector, Primakov said, accord to Interfax. We need a continuous dialogue with foreign investors, without whom it will be difficult for us to overcome the current difficulties. He say Russia want long-term investments. Foreign capital have be come to the country via short-term operations, Primakov said. This, he said, be not to our liking or yours. Viktor Gerashchenko, the central bank chairman, say on Friday that the government must act to stem the flow of dollars from Russia. Gerashchenko and Finance Minister Mikhail Zadornov be in Washington Saturday for the annual meeting of the International Monetary Fund, where they plan to spell out the measures Russia be take to bail out its finance system. Russia want the IMF to release the second dlrs 4.3 billion installment of a loan that be approve in July, a month before the country's economy crash and the government effectively default on its foreign loans. IMF officials have say they want the russian government to come up with a sound economic program before the installment be given, and have make it clear that currency controls and boost the money supply by print rubles be not acceptable. In a season of crash banks, plunge rubles, bounce paychecks, fail cropsand rotate governments, maybe it be not the ultimate insult. But the nation that bore Tolstoy and Chekhov, and still regard a well-written letter as a labor of love, be buckle a little this week, because it can no longer wish good health to Baba Anya in Omsk. The Post Office be broke. In 60 of the country's 89 statelike regions, more than 1,000 mail cars have be sidetracked, many stuffed with up to 18 tons of letters, newspapers and parcels. The state Railway Ministry refuse to carry more mail until the Post Office make good on some 210 million rubles in old bills about $13 million in today's dollars, or $35 million in dollars six weeks ago. Air mail, which amounts to one of every four or five letters, be also suspend at one of Moscow's major airports until this week, when the Post Office cough up 5 million rubles for old bills. A second airport be still demand 3 million rubles for past-due debts. so much mail be back up that post offices in Moscow and elsewhere have simply stop accept out-of-town mail, except for areas that can be easily reach by truck. Delivery schedules have fall weeks, and perhaps months, behind. The situation be really extraordinary, say Vladimir Sherekhov, the deputy chief of mail service administration in the government's Communications Committee. We've never have anything like this before. maybe the Post Office have be lucky. Extraordinary be the rule elsewhere in Russia. Until Friday, the low house of Parliament be prepare to sue the government for failure to provide soap, heat, toilet paper and copy-machine paper in the legislature's monumental downtown offices. It turn out that politicians have exhaust their funds by cut short their recess and return to address the nation's economic crisis. Earlier in the week, officials say Russia's Arctic shipping routes may close next month because half the nation's icebreakers be in disrepair and there be no money to fix them. The old of the ships be so ancient that its nickname be Granny. such anecdotal evidence that Russia be lose its wheels, like one of its old, ill-maintained Volga sedans, be everywhere. But oddly, real signs of public distress be not particularly common, perhaps because the system rarely seem to shed a part as big as a postal system. If the U.S. Postal Service be increasingly a pipeline for sweepstakes notices and bills, the Russian Post Office still hold a special place in the national conversation. Russians still write letters to each other, frequently and fervently, and many in remote regions get their news through the mail. Millions use the mails to ship canned goods and other provisions to needy relatives and friends in faraway areas, an especially vital service in winter. And in the last few years, the Post Office have become a vehicle for a grow mail-order trade in books, clothes and other catalog items not readily available outside big cities. exactly why all this have rumble to a halt be in some dispute. What be clear be that the Post Office and the Railway Ministry both suffer from what ail every russian venture, private and public alike: nobody pay his bills. The state Railway Ministry complain that it be continually stiffed by customers who believe the railroads be honor-bound to carry freight whether they be pay or not. The government have specify nearly 40 categories of freight which the railroads must carry for next to nothing. Among the big deadbeats be the power ministries the military and interior departments which do not pay during soviet times and feel little need to pay now. It's a psychology form during the socialist period, say Tatiana Pashkova, the deputy spokeswoman for the ministry, and the same situation exist with the Post Office. We've be in dispute for a very long time. Always we try to understand their differences. But we can't carry cargo for free. No kidding, say the Post Office: It, too, be owe 200 million rubles by government agencies, and be bar from raise rates even though freight costs be outstrip revenues. Moreover, the Post Office be also require by the government to carry some forms of mail, such as pension checks, at reduced rates. Officials at the state Communications Department say they also suspect an ulterior motive in the railroads' actions: a struggle to dominate the thrive mail-order business. Here's competition between us and the railroads for the delivery of parcels, and I think decisions make by the railroads be mainly explain by this competition, Sherekhov said. They blame us for carry some commercial cargoes instead of mail. The Railways Ministry's spokeswoman, Ms. Pashkova, say such commercial cargoes be indeed a problem, but only because the railroads know that the Post Office have already get cash to transport the packages. The railroads be still wait for their share of that money, she said. In the meantime, the situation have come to a boil. In late September the railroads cut mail service in and out of Moscow, effectively decapitate the postal system and force officials to draft a fleet of trucks to move letters in and out of the city. Hundreds of empty and full rail cars have clog some local yards to the point where move cars into position for unload have become difficult. At last count, 39 loaded cars be await service at one yard. And customers be get angry. We've get all kinds of complaints, say Viktor Salikov, a deputy in the Communications Department's mail shipping center. People be even come to us, search for mail that be send weeks ago.

A total of 37 yachts have be force to retire from the 630-nautical-mile race, many have be dismasted or suffer injuries to crew. Meanwhile, American maxi Sayonara be narrowly ahead of last year's line winner Brindabella. Although the two be force to reduce sail and cut speed, they be still well inside the race record for the 630-nautical-mile race of 2 days, 14 hours, seven minutes and 10 seconds set by german maxi Morning Glory in 1996. (djp) Gale-force winds and high seas batter yachts in the Sydney-to-Hobart race Monday, kill at least two crew members and leave two yachts missing. The two dead be find on the 40-foot vessel Business Post Naiad, about 100 kilometers (60 miles) off the New South Wales state town of Merimbula, accord to the australian Search and Rescue Coordination Center (AusSAR) in Canberra. One of the miss yachts B-52 be find mid-morning Monday and be make its way towards Eden on the New South Wales coast, an AusSAR spokesman said. The nine crew on board be think to be safe and the vessel be sail unassisted. The spokesman say no word have be receive on the fate of the Winston Churchill or the sailor swept from the deck of Sword of Orion on Sunday night. As of mid-morning Monday, he have be in the water for 15 hours. The yacht, which have a crew of 11, be halfway across Bass Strait when it overturned. The Navy send a Sea King helicopter with night-vision and heat-seeking equipment to search the area and the frigate HMAS Newcastle be on its way to the area. Rescuers in more than 30 search aircraft be similarly unsure of the whereabouts and condition of Solo Globe and its crew. Seven others on board the Business Post Naiad be put aboard a helicopter and fly to Merimbula Hospital, the center said. The center be unable to identify the sailors, say how they die or give details on the injuries sustain by survive crewmen. There be unconfirmed reports that one of the dead sailors be British. With winds gusting to 80 knots and seas swell to 10 meters (35 feet), the race continue even as rescue teams search for the three miss yachts. Race spokesman Peter Campbell say it be not know how long the sailor wash overboard could survive in the water. It's supposition, Campbell said. We have John Quinn survive for 5 1-2 hours in 1993 and that be in the middle of the night in very severe conditions. A police helicopter rescue a yachtsman sweep overboard when Kingurra roll over 35 kilometers (22 miles) south of Gabo Island. John Campbell, an American, be in the water for about 40 minutes and have hypothermia when he be take to safety by Senior Constable Barry Barclay, who drop into large swells to secure Campbell. Despite the conditions, Peter Campbell say it be unlikely the race would be call off. It do say in the instructions that it be the sole responsibility of the skipper of each yacht to decide whether he continue in the race or retires, he said. The australian Maritime Safety Authority (AMSA) alert all shipping in Bass Strait as high winds and huge sea smash into the remnants of the 115-boat fleet. A total of 37 yachts have be force out of the 1,160-kilometer (725-mile) race. Many lose their masts or have injure crew. The american maxi Sayonara be narrowly ahead of last year's winner, Brindabella. Although the two be force to reduce sail and cut speed, they be still well inside the race record of 2 days, 14 hours, 7 minutes, 10 seconds, set by german maxi Morning Glory in 1996. United States maxi Sayonara look set to continue the foreign domination of line honors in Australia's famous Sydney to Hobart yacht race, which start Saturday. Sayonara, race by american computer billionaire Larry Ellison, have only be beat once since it be launch in 1995 and be aim for its second win in the 630 nautical mile bluewater classic. If the 80-footer beats the local boat home into Hobart, it will be third time in four years a foreign yacht have finish first. New Zealand Endeavour trump the locals in 1992, Sayonara win in 1995 and German's Morning Glory set a race record of two days, 14 hours, seven minutes and 10 seconds the following year. Sayonara's rivals be expect to be last year's line honors winner Brindabella of Sydney and new australian maxi Wild Thing. The contest for handicap honors appear more open, but there be many who believe Sayonara could become the sixth yacht to do the line honors and handicap double. Ellison believe unforeseen damage be the only major barrier to victory. She be a much more modern boat than Brindabella, if we don't break, we should beat Brindabella, we should beat anybody, Ellison said. If we hold together we should win the race, the question be if this boat come through and pays us a favor we would just love to knock off the record. Ellison say Sayonara can knock half a day off morning Glory's record give the right conditions. Brindabella's captain and owner George Snow believe a new record be possible. I think the front boats will be very close all the way down, which will be a great challenge, say Snow. We be well set up, we've get the best crew we've ever have and I think the boat be in great shape, Snow added. The race be tip to start Saturday under freshen north easters with the prospect of showers and a thunder storm before a southerly change of around 25-30 knots later in the day. The southerly be expect to ease to 15-20 knots over Sunday before swing back to the north on Monday with a west to south westerly change expect to move through Tasmania and Bass Strait on Tuesday when the first yacht be anticipate to finish. Two sailors die and 15 others be miss after gale-force winds and high seas batter yachts in the Sydney-to-Hobart yacht race Monday. There be two that have be confirm deceased which be tragedy because in the 54-year history of the race I think there's only two people who have die in it before, say australian Maritime Safety Authority spokesman David Gray. The two dead be find on the 40-foot vessel Business Post Naiad, about 100 kilometers (60 miles) off the New South Wales state town of Merimbula. Gray say Business Post Naiad owner-skipper Bruce Guy and first-time race participant Phil Skeggs be killed. Both men be from Launceston in northern Tasmania. Guy suffer a heart attack during one of the two occasions the yacht rolled, Gray said, while Skeggs drown when he be unable to free himself from a safety harness. Their bodies be leave on board the boat but attempts be be make to recover them as soon as possible. Race officials say Guy sail in two previous Sydney to Hobart yacht races. Grave fears be hold for the safety of the nine crew on miss cutter Winston Churchill, while contact have be lose with the five crew aboard Solo Globe. British sailor Glyn Charles be sweep off the Sword of Orion on Sunday night when the boat roll in wild seas. At 12:30 p.m. local time (0130 GMT) Monday Charles have be miss for about 17 hours. Race officials say Charles have sail in four Admiral's Cups and represent Britain in the Star Class at the 1996 Atlanta Olympics where he finish 11th. Race spokesman Peter Campbell say it be not know how long Gray could survive in the water. It's supposition, Campbell said. We have John Quinn survive for 5 1-2 hours in 1993 and that be in the middle of the night in very severe conditions. Gray say about 56 sailors have be winch to safety. There's just many many injuries on those yachts that get knock down. A lot of them roll over one roll over twice, Gray said. They've get hand, leg, facial injuries, they really get pounded yesterday. One of the miss yachts B-52 be find mid-morning Monday and be make its way towards Eden on the New South Wales coast. The nine crew on board be think to be safe and the vessel be sail unassisted. american John Campbell be rescue by a police helicopter after be swerpt overboard when Kingurra roll over 35 kilometers (22 miles) south of Gabo Island. Campbell be in the water for about 40 minutes and have hypothermia when he be take to safety by Senior Constable Barry Barclay, who drop into large swells to secure Campbell. I be definitely worried, Campbell tell United States television in Seattle. There be a point I didn't think I be go to survive. (barclay) come down into the water only about 5, 10 feet away from me and I swim to him pretty quicky. I just throw my arms into the harness and they hoist me up. At least 37 yachts have be force out of the 1,160-kilometer (725-mile) race. The australian Maritime Safety Authority alert all shipping in Bass Strait as high winds and huge sea smash into the remnants of the 115-boat fleet. The american maxi Sayonara be narrowly ahead of last year's winner, Brindabella. Although the two be force to reduce sail and cut speed, they be still well inside the race record of 2 days, 14 hours, 7 minutes, 10 seconds, set by german maxi Morning Glory in 1996. british sailor Glyn Charles be miss and presume drowned become the third fatality in the Sydney-to-Hobart yacht race while three others remain miss in rough seas after nightfall Monday. Robin Poke, a spokesman for the australian Maritime Safety Authority (AMSA), admit it be unlikely the 33-year-old Charles could survive more than 24 hours at sea after be wash off Sword of Orion on Sunday night. He have be out there in 10-meter (30-feet) waves and 80-kilometer (50-mile) winds, Poke say Monday. He will be a superman if he make it. Charles sail in four Admiral's Cups and represent Britain in the Star Class at the 1996 Atlanta Olympics where he finish 11th. Two sailors die after gale-force winds and high seas batter the entrants. Four members from the veteran cutter Winston Churchill be winch to safety from a liferaft before dark Monday. Two more crew from the Winston Churchill be pluck from a second liferaft late Monday night, but three others who have be aboard the liferaft be still missing. We be unsure about what have happen to the other three, it appear they be wash out of the liferaft, a spokesman for the authority said. The two dead, both Australians, be find on the 40-foot vessel Business Post Naiad, about 100 kilometers (60 miles) off the New South Wales state town of Merimbula. The yacht's owner-skipper Bruce Guy and first-time race participant Phil Skeggs be killed. Guy suffer a heart attack during one of the two occasions the yacht roll while Skeggs drown when he be unable to free himself from a safety harness. Their bodies be leave on board the boat but attempts be be make to recover them as soon as possible, rescue officials said. Dad love sailing, say Bruce Guy's son Mark Guy. He love the competition. He also love a beer and a talk after the race. Dad simply love life. Winston Churchill skipper Richard Winning be one of the four rescued. The bad thing of the whole affair be that after we get into the life raft and become separate from the others, the damned thing capsize twice on these great seas at night which be bloody frightening, let me tell you, Winning said. You have get four of us underneath this little canopy and the next thing be you be upside down. I wouldn't want to have spend another night out there. The first record death in the race, which start in 1945, be in 1984 when a 72-year-old yachtsman be wash overboard from Yahoo 2 and presumed drowned. In 1989, a 58-year-old man die from head injuries on the yacht Flying Colours after a 45-knot gale off the southern NSW coast snap the boat's mast. AMSA spokesman David Gray say about 50 sailors have be winch to safety in this year's race. There's just many, many injuries on those yachts that get knock down. A lot of them roll over one roll over twice, Gray said. They've get hand, leg, facial injuries, they really get pounded yesterday. american John Campbell be rescue by a police helicopter after be swerpt overboard when Kingurra roll over 35 kilometers (22 miles) south of Gabo Island. Campbell be in the water for about 40 minutes and have hypothermia when he be take to safety by Senior Constable Barry Barclay, who drop into large swells to secure Campbell. I be definitely worried, Campbell tell United States television in Seattle. There be a point I didn't think I be go to survive. (barclay) come down into the water only about 5, 10 feet away from me and I swim to him pretty quickly. I just throw my arms into the harness and they hoist me up. About half of the 115-yacht fleet have be force out of the 1,160-kilometer (725-mile) race. The american maxi Sayonara be narrowly ahead of last year's winner, Brindabella, and expect to cross the line Tuesday. Leading maxi yachts Brindabella, Sayonara and Marchioness be lock in a three-way duel down the New South Wales state coast Saturday as the Sydney to Hobart fleet face deteriorate weather. All three maxis report in at the same latitude during Saturday night's position report when they be about 30 nautical miles south of Jervis Bay on the New South Wales south coast. american maxi Sayonara and Sydney boat Brindabella report they be about 50 kilometers (30 miles) offshore while Marchioness be a couple of miles far inshore. In fourth spot be australian maxi Wild Thing. The three leaders cover 105 nautical miles in the first 7 1-2 hours of the race. propel for the most part by favorable northerly breezes, the leaders rocket along at an average speed of 14 knots in the first part of the 630-nautical-mile race to Hobart on the island state of Tasmania. The fast early pace put the leaders well on schedule to eclipse Morning Glory's 1996 race record but that be before the far tough conditions forecast for overnight Saturday night. Morning Glory, a german maxi, break the 21-year-old race record two years ago, arrive in Hobart 2 days, 14 hours, seven minutes and 10 seconds after she leave Sydney. While the annual event start in friendly and favorable northeasterly breezes, the 115-strong fleet report cloudy conditions as it move down the coast. The yachts be brace for a tough night with thunderstorms predict ahead of a west-southwesterly change expect to lash the south coast by Sunday morning. Earlier, a crowd of around 300,000 people on the Sydney headlands and water witness the start of the annual blue water classic. Sayonara take the initial honors when she beat Brindabella though Sydney heads, but the 1997 line honors winner draw level when the American maxi's spinnaker blow out and have to be replaced. Two yacht crew members be dead, three yachts remain missing and rescue resources be stretch to the limit Monday as huge seas and gale-force winds continue to batter the Sydney-to-Hobart race fleet. A helicopter rescue team fly to a spot about 50 nautical miles off the far south New South Wales town of Merimbula early Monday morning. Two crew find dead on the stricken 40-foot vessel Business Post Naiad be leave behind while seven colleagues be winch aboard the helicopter and fly to Merimbula Hospital, he said. The deaths be confirm by an australian search and Rescue Coordination Center spokesman in Canberra a short time later. Neither organization be able to say how the sailors die or give details on the injuries suffer by survive crewmen. Three yachts remain missing and there be no sign of a sailor sweep off the Sword of Orion when the boat roll in wild seas on Sunday night. The miss boats be veteran cutter Winston Churchill, which sail in the inaugural 1945 race, B-52 and Solo Globe Challenger. A major search involve Australia's navy continue Monday morning for those missing. Race spokesman Peter Campbell say it be not know how long the sailor wash overboard could survive in the water. It's supposition. We have John Quinn survive for 5 1-2 hours in 1993 and that be in the middle of the night in very severe conditions, Campbell said. Despite the horrendous conditions it be unlikely the race would be call off, he said. It do say in the instructions that it be the sole responsibility of the skipper of each yacht to decide whether he continue in the race or retires, he said. The australian Maritime Safety Authority (AMSA) have alert all shipping in Bass Strait as high winds and huge sea smash into the remnants of the 115-boat fleet. An AMSA spokesman say they be alert that the 30-foot Sydney yacht Sword of Orion have roll in heavy seas near Gabo Island about 450 kilometers (280 miles) east of Melbourne. Several crewmen be injure include one with a broken leg. The yacht, which have a crew of 11, be halfway across Bass Strait when it overturned. The Navy send a Sea King helicopter with night-vision and heat-seeking equipment to search the area and the frigate HMAS Newcastle be on its way to the area. Earlier, as winds gusting to 80 knots and seas of 35 feet cause havoc to the fleet, several rescues take place. A police helicopter rescue a yachtsman sweep overboard when the victorian yacht Kingurra be roll over in huge seas 19 nautical miles south of Gabo Island. John Campbell, an American, be in the water for about 40 minutes and be suffer from hypothermia when he be winch to safety by senior constable Barry Barclay, who drop into large swells to secure Campbell. A total of 37 yachts have be force to retire from the 630-nautical-mile race, many have be dismasted or suffer injuries to crew. Meanwhile, American maxi Sayonara be narrowly ahead of last year's line winner Brindabella. Although the two be force to reduce sail and cut speed, they be still well inside the race record for the 630-nautical-mile race of 2 days, 14 hours, seven minutes and 10 seconds set by german maxi Morning Glory in 1996.

31,"Endeavour's astronauts connect the first two building blocks of the international space station on Sunday, create a seven-story tower in the shuttle cargo bay. It be the first time that the Russian-built Zarya control module and the made-in-america Unity chamber have ever touched. It look to be a perfect and, hopefully, long-lasting fit. We have capture of Zarya, commander Robert Cabana announce the two pieces come together. Congratulations to the crew of the good ship Endeavour, reply Mission Control. That's terrific. The 240-mile-high construction job begin two hours earlier with Nancy Currie's capture of Zarya (russian for Sunrise) use the shuttle robot arm. We're halfway home, Cabana said. then come the hard part: stack the two giant cylinders in the cargo bay. The two station pieces be so big 77 feet from the tip of one to the tip of the other with a combined mass of 70,000 pounds that Currie and her crewmates have to rely on a computerize vision system and camera views, rather than direct line of sight. This be the first time such a blind docking have ever be attempted. Currie position the solar-winged Zarya, still on the end of the shuttle robot arm, several inches directly above Unity. It be slow going; she want and need perfect alignment. Once she be sure she have it, Cabana fire Endeavour's thrusters, and the brief burst raise the shuttle and thereby Unity enough for the dock mechanisms on the two station components to snap together. The historical moment occur above the South Pacific. The union intend to last the station's 15-year or more lifetime set the stage for a spacewalk by two astronauts on Monday to attach electrical connectors and cables between the two components. Mission Control think Sunday's work might take hours long than plan and give the six astronauts plenty of time for the tasks. But everything occur more or less when and how it be suppose to, aside from a piece of space junk that stray too close. Before begin their final approach to zarya, the six astronauts have to steer clear of a chunk of a rocket launch last month from California. Mission Control order the pilots to fire the shuttle thrusters to put an extra three miles between Endeavour and the space junk, put Endeavour a total of five miles from the orbit debris. The small gap would have be probably a little too close for comfort, Mission Control said. The big worry, by far, be over Endeavour's pursuit and capture of Zarya, and its coupling with Unity. The shuttle's 50-foot robot arm have never before handle an object as massive as the 41-foot, 44,000-pound Zarya, a power and propulsion module that be launch from Kazakstan on Nov. 20. It will provide all of the necessary electricity and steer for the fledgling space station until a permanent control module can be launch next summer. Minutes after Zarya's capture, Cabana call down that two antennas on the module be still undeployed as russian flight controllers have feared. The antenna must be fully deploy in order for Zarya's manual docking system to work; that system won't be need before next summer, officials said. The only other problem be with a Zarya battery; the astronauts take up a replacement part. The 36-foot, 25,000-pound Unity, the first american-made component, will serve as a connect passageway, or vestibule, for future modules. It be crucial that Zarya and Unity be joined; if they could not be connect with the robot arm, NASA would have send out two spacewalk astronauts to manually fit them together. In all, three spacewalks be plan for Endeavour's 12-day flight, not only to hook up electrical connections between the two modules but to install handrails and other tools for future crews. The joined modules will be release from Endeavour once all of the work be completed. NASA estimate 43 more launches and 159 more spacewalks will be need after this mission to assemble the entire orbiting complex. Once completed, the 16-nation space station will have a mass of 1 million pounds, be long than a football field, and house up to seven astronauts and cosmonauts. WASHINGTON NASA and the russian Space Agency have agree to set aside a last-minute russian request to launch an international space station into an orbit closer to Mir, officials announce Friday. While put the new station closer to Russia's 12-year-old Mir station would make it easy to transfer equipment and supplies from the old outpost to the new one, the request come too late to be act on, say Randy Brinkley, NASA's space station program manager. NASA be surprise last week when Russia's prime station contractor propose the orbital position change just two-and-a-half weeks before launch of the first part of the new station. delay the Nov. 20 flight by 10 hours to match the orbits would have force similar shifts in the subsequent assembly flights, and result in potentially unfavorable sun angles on the solar-powered station, engineers said. We have mutually conclude that it would not be prudent to make these changes, Brinkley say during a news conference hold at the Johnson Space Center in Houston. It add technical complexity and risks to the mission that be not justified. The decision, which follow frank and candid discussions between the two partners, be not impose by the United States, he said. The conclusions be mutual, Brinkley said. Both sides conclude that it do not make sense. The Russians, struggle to find money for their space program with their nation in economic collapse, have say they want to transfer thousands of pounds of newer equipment and scientific instruments from Mir as an economy move. However, some critics question the Russians' motives, wonder if the requested orbital change be part of plan to delay the decommissioning and destruction of Mir, which the Russians have agree to do next summer. The Russians have so little money that the United States and other partners in the international station fear that money spend on Mir will prevent Russia from meet its obligations with the new project. The Mir compete with the international space station for very critical resources and for funding, Brinkley said. NASA will consider ideas for salvage Mir's research equipment to use on the international space station, he said, but only if it do not interfere with assemble the new station. The United States and 15 other nations plan to begin build the new station in orbit next week when the Russians launch a module that will supply power and propulsion during the early stages of the five-year construction period. The space shuttle Endeavor be to follow on Dec. 3 with the second station part, a u.s.-built connecting passageway that attach to the first module.

The two station pieces be so big 77 feet from the tip of one to the tip of the other with a combined mass of 70,000 pounds that Currie and her crewmates have to rely on a computerize vision system and camera views, rather than direct line of sight. This be the first time such a blind docking have ever be attempted. Currie position the solar-winged Zarya, still on the end of the shuttle robot arm, several inches directly above Unity. It be slow going; she want and need perfect alignment. Once she be sure she have it, Cabana fire Endeavour's thrusters, and the brief burst raise the shuttle and thereby Unity enough for the dock mechanisms on the two station components to snap together. The historical moment occur above the South Pacific. It take several tries, however, for Zarya and Unity to be pull tightly together. The dock ring between them would not retract properly; Mission Control quickly trace the problem to the attach robot arm and ask the crew to release its hold on the docked Zarya. That do the trick. The union intend to last the station's 15-year or more lifetime set the stage for a spacewalk by two astronauts on Monday to attach electrical connectors and cables between the two components. Mission Control think Sunday's work might take hours long than plan and give the six astronauts plenty of time for the tasks. But everything occur more or less when and how it be suppose to, aside from a piece of space junk that stray too close. Before begin their final approach to zarya, the six astronauts have to steer clear of a chunk of a rocket launch last month from California. Mission Control order the pilots to fire the shuttle thrusters to put an extra three miles between Endeavour and the space junk, put Endeavour a total of five miles from the orbit debris. The small gap would have be probably a little too close for comfort, Mission Control said. The big worry, by far, be over Endeavour's pursuit and capture of Zarya, and its coupling with Unity. The shuttle's 50-foot robot arm have never before handle an object as massive as the 41-foot, 44,000-pound Zarya, a power and propulsion module that be launch from Kazakstan on Nov. 20. It will provide all of the necessary electricity and steer for the fledgling space station until a permanent control module can be launch next summer. Minutes after Zarya's capture, Cabana call down that two antennas on the module be still undeployed as russian flight controllers have feared. The antenna must be fully deploy in order for Zarya's manual docking system to work; that system won't be need before next summer, officials said. The only other problem be with a Zarya battery; the astronauts take up a replacement part. The 36-foot, 25,000-pound Unity, the first american-made component, will serve as a connect passageway, or vestibule, for future modules. It be crucial that Zarya and Unity be joined; if they could not be connect with the robot arm, NASA would have send out two spacewalk astronauts to manually fit them together. In all, three spacewalks be plan for Endeavour's 12-day flight, not only to hook up electrical connections between the two modules but to install handrails and other tools for future crews. The joined modules will be release from Endeavour once all of the work be completed. NASA estimate 43 more launches and 159 more spacewalks will be need after this mission to assemble the entire orbiting complex. Once completed, the 16-nation space station will have a mass of 1 million pounds, be long than a football field, and house up to seven astronauts and cosmonauts. For the second day in a row, astronauts boarded space shuttle Endeavour on Friday for liftoff on NASA's first space station construction flight. Let's go do this, say commander Robert Cabana. Amen, reply a launch controller. Rain and cloudy skies be once again a threat. But NASA be confident the master alarm in Endeavour's cockpit would behave; it go off with just 4{ minutes to go in the countdown Thursday, force a delay. NASA have only five minutes or less each day to launch Endeavour in order to meet up with the first space station part, which be put in orbit two weeks ago by the Russians. The shuttle contain the second station component. The master alarm blare and red lights flash just before the shuttle be to lift off early thursday. By the time controllers trace the problem to a momentary drop in hydraulic pressure and decide to press ahead, it be too late they have miss the cutoff by a second or two. Sure, it's frustrating, say Bill Readdy, shuttle program director and a veteran shuttle commander. But we do things right. We do things by the book, and we're not go to cut any corners even if it mean just shave a second or two. The six astronauts crawl out of the shuttle, and two throw up their hands. Cabana hold up his thumb and index finger a half-inch apart: We be that close. The problem be confine to one of Endeavour's three hydraulic pressure units. The pressure drop just long enough to trigger the alarm, evidently because of a sensitive switch, then return to normal. NASA engineers spend the day examine the problem, but find nothing wrong with any of the systems and be confident it would not reoccur. Endeavour's flight be already a year late because of a cash crunch in Russia, one of NASA's partners in build the international space station. The one-day delay cost NASA about $600,000, mostly in fuel and overtime pay. Aboard Endeavour be an american-made connecting passageway name Unity. The astronauts will use the shuttle robot arm to capture the russian space station piece and attach it to Unity. Then, two spacewalkers will hook up all the electrical connections and cables between the two cylinders, and attach handrails and tools for future crews. Until the alarm sounded, it look as though the weather would be the only problem. Rain and clouds move in from the Atlantic 1{ hours before liftoff, but drift away with minutes to spare. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright and other dignitaries from around the world have gather in the drizzle to see Endeavour and its crew off. here we have 16 countries cooperate on a venture to the future, say Albright, who be expect back for Friday's attempt. This be a good investment. The planet's most daring construction job begin Friday as the shuttle Endeavour carry into orbit six astronauts and the first u.s.-built part of an international space station that be expect to cost more than $100 billion. After a last-minute alarm on the shuttle force a postponement early Thursday, the launch go off flawlessly at 3:36 Friday morning, right on schedule. The night sky be clear, and the moon full. With a roar, Endeavour make its fiery ascent and briefly turn the Florida coastline from night to day. more than five minutes and 500 miles later, the spaceship's main engines could still be see in the distance, twinkle like a new star. On their 12-day flight, Endeavour's astronauts be to locate a russian part already in orbit, grasp it with the shuttle's robot arm and attach the new U.S. module. Wielding tool hundreds of miles above Earth, work methodically in the cold void, the astronauts will be start a five-year assembly that be likely to make the construction of the Pyramids and the great cathedrals look like child's play. construction of the station, which will be a research facility, will require an estimated 160 space walks, which, for safety reasons, will always be do by two people. When complete, the international space station, dominate by solar power arrays, will cover an area equal to that of two football fields. Modules of interconnected laboratories and live quarters for up to seven astronauts be to form a habitat equal to that of two 747 jetliners. The station's batteries alone, if line up, would extend a half-mile. The project entail high risk, because of the technical difficulty of put all this together in the unforgiving environment of space, along with the dangers inherent in fly the space shuttle to the construction site. The work be far complicate by international politics and worries about money. The Russians, whose participation in the partnership clinch the post-cold War deal five years ago, be now a wild card. Moscow's economic and political woes have leave western officials unsure of its ability and willingness to come up with its share of money and technology. At the same time, the station's costs be rising, and its critics among scientists worry that its appetite for money will consume their own federal financing. The project's total cost be a subject of debate, but the most credible estimates now put the price of assembly and of operation for a decade, the station's estimate lifetime, at $110 billion. Of that, american taxpayers be to spend roughly $96 billion, and the project's 15 foreign partners about $14 billion. The station be intend to be a grand laboratory where, in the environment of weightlessness, investigators can develop new materials and new drugs and explore physiology's remain mysteries, in part so that humans may someday know how to adapt for long space flight to other worlds. Friday, in any case, little be hear about the project but praise. Great show, Endeavour, mission control in Houston radioed to the six astronauts as the shuttle go into orbit. At the Florida spaceport, Secretary of State Madeleine Albright laud the launching team and the new venture. That be truly, truly fantastic, she tell the team after the liftoff. And it be important, she added, to have so many nations work together on the kinds of issues that the 21st century be go to be concern with. So my congratulations to all of you, the secretary said. Stupendous work. The main cargo Thursday be the Unity module, the first u.s.-built station part. Small compare with the giants to come in three dozen shuttle flights during assembly, the unit be 18 feet long, weighs 13 tons and be to serve as a connecting hub for other modules. Saturday, one of the astronauts, Lt. Col. Nancy Currie of the Army, be to have the shuttle's robot arm hoist unity from the payload bay and secure it to Endeavour's dock system, move the unit from a horizontal to a vertical position. Then, Sunday, the astronauts be to rendezvous with the module know as Zarya, or Sunrise, which Russia launch into orbit from Kazakhstan on Nov. 20. Financed by the United States but build in Russia, Zarya, 41 feet long, be be a kind of tugboat for the embryonic station, furnish power and propulsion as well as communication and rendezvous abilities. When Endeavour's payload bay be within 10 feet of Zarya, Colonel Currie be to reach out with the robot arm and pull the russian module into position over Unity. The mechanical arm have never before move anything so big. Zarya, while completely weightless in space, have 21 tons of mass. If mishandled, it can crush and kill. As Col. Currie hold Zarya steady, Endeavour's commander, Col. Robert Cabana of the Marine Corps, a veteran of three space flights, be to nudge the shuttle forward to join the two station pieces together. When mat with special attachments, Zarya and Unity will form the station's first element, 63 feet long and 78 feet wide out to the tips of the solar arrays. start Monday, a pair of space-walking astronauts be to hook up electrical connections and data cables between the units, attach antenna and install tools and handrails for future visitors. The builders will be Col. Jerry Ross of the Air Force, 50, and Dr. James Newman, 42, a physicist. Their series of three space walks will continue Wednesday and end Saturday, Dec. 12. As construction go on outside, the astronauts inside Endeavour will be busy make preparations to enter the new station through a connecting tunnel and dock system. Next Thursday, the crew will enter the embryonic station for the first time, instal portable fans and lights. Friday they will again enter, to prepare for the arrival in 1999 of the next major element, the first one both build and finance by Russia. The other astronauts on Endeavour be its pilot, Maj. Frederick Sturckow of the Marine Corps, and a mission specialist, Sergei Krikalev of the russian Space Agency. After separate from the new outpost, the crew be to bring Endeavour back to the Kennedy Space Center on Dec. 15, with the mission length just shy of 12 days. Gretchen McClain, NASA's director in Washington for the international space station, say in an interview here that its overall costs be actually small for individual Americans. Over its lifetime, she said, the annual cost will equal that of a pizza and a soft drink for each of the nation's 96 million taxpayers. U.S. costs for construction, she added, be $24 billion, and for operations through the year 2012 be $10.4 billion, for a total of $34.4 billion. most experts outside the agency consider this figure ridiculously low because it ignore many billions of dollars spend in early development work as well as the cost of numerous shuttle flights, which run about $800 million apiece. follow a series of intricate maneuvers and the skillful use of the space shuttle Endeavour's robot arm, astronauts on Sunday join the first two of many segments that will form the international space station. The shuttle and its crew of six snare the russian-made Zarya control module after chase it around the Earth in ever-closing orbits throughout the day. Less than an hour after a rendezvous 240 miles above the Earth shortly before 6 p.m., Lt. Col. Nancy Currie of the Army deftly use the 50-foot arm to grab the 40,000-pound cylinder as the craft pass above Russia and to slowly pull it toward the shuttle. see Zarya up close, Col. Robert Cabana of the Marines, the shuttle commander, confirm that two antennas have fail to deploy from the module follow its launch from Kazakhstan on Nov. 20. There be early indications that the antennas, which will be use later by the station to manually assist spacecraft dockings, have not extended. Currie take almost two hours to painstakingly move Zarya above the american-made Unity dock port position in Endeavour's cargo bay. When the two pieces be align within inches of one another, Cabana fire small thruster rockets that raise the shuttle, allow the modules to clamp together. The two station pieces, together measure about 77 feet from end to end and have a combined mass of 70,000 pounds, be the first of 100 major components to be unite in space over the next five years to form an orbiting outpost that would weigh almost a million pounds and span an area the size of two football fields. more than 40 additional missions by U.S. shuttles and russian rockets will be use to haul all of the components and other supplies into orbit, and astronauts from both nations be to spend almost 1,800 hours do spacewalks to assemble the entire structure. The spece station be expect to cost its partnership of 16 nations more than $40 billion just to construct. bring the pieces together be only the first step in mat them. A pair of astronauts be to make three spacewalks this week, the first on Monday, during which they will hook up electrical and communications cables, remove covers, attach handrails and perform other tasks to get the modules to work as one unit. The most difficult part of Sunday's mating of the $240 million Zarya to the $300 million Unity be bring them together after the shuttle catch up with the russian unit. Currie have to use the canadian-built robot arm to place Zarya on top of Unity without be able to see where the pieces joined. Unity, raise in Endeavour's cargo bay on Saturday, be so large that it block Currie's view of the mating fixtures from the shuttle's windows. She use views from remote cameras and a computerized vision system build on the arm to estimate the relative positions of the two large segments. The computerized system examine markings on both modules, compute their relationship to one another use the marks and display the results on a laptop computer. We've never do anything like this before, Currie say before the flight, add that she have practice the difficult maneuver more than 100 times over the last two years. The flight of Endeavour, which take off from Cape Canaveral, Fla., last Friday, have go accord to plan until early Sunday, when mission control order the shuttle to change its orbit slightly to avoid a piece of space debris. Air Force space debris trackers note that the shuttle be to pass within 1.6 miles of a spent stage of an american booster rocket launch last month. Although this be consider a safe distance, shuttle controllers decide to widen the separation to five miles as an extra precaution. Endeavour and its astronauts close in Sunday to capture the first piece of the international space station, the russian-made Zarya control module that have to be connect to the Unity chamber aboard the shuttle. stack the two giant cylinders 240 miles above the earth be consider the most difficult part of the mission. The job fell to Nancy Currie, the shuttle crane operator who have deftly hoist and reposition Unity in the cargo bay on Saturday. The two station pieces be so big 77 feet from the tip of one to the tip of the other with a combined mass of 70,000 pounds that Currie and her crewmates be go to have to rely on a computerize vision system and camera views, rather than direct line of sight. such a blind docking have never be attempt before. Mission Control give the astronauts plenty of time for the tasks. The main thing I've try to do for the last two years work on this flight be make sure we have time. We have margin on everything, say flight director Bob Castle. Before begin their final approach to Zarya Russian for Sunrise the shuttle's six astronauts have to steer clear of a chunk of a rocket launch last month from California. Mission Control order the pilots to fire the shuttle thrusters to put an extra three miles between Endeavour and the space junk, put Endeavour a total of five miles from the orbit debris. The small gap would have be probably a little too close for comfort, Mission Control said. The big worry, by far, be over Endeavour's pursuit and capture of Zarya, and its coupling with Unity. The shuttle's 50-foot robot arm have never before be assign to handle an object as massive as the 44,000-pound Zarya, a power and propulsion module that be launch from Kazakhstan on Nov. 20. It will provide all the necessary electricity and steer for the fledgling space station until a permanent control module can be launch next summer. The 36-foot, 25,000-pound Unity will serve as a connect passageway, or vestibule, for future modules. In case Zarya and Unity could not be connect with the robot arm, two spacewalking astronauts would have to manually fit them together. The astronauts would be go out anyway Monday to attach electrical connectors and cables between the two components. In all, three spacewalks be plan for Endeavour's 12-day flight. NASA estimate 43 more launches and 159 more spacewalks will be need after this mission to assemble the entire orbiting complex. Once completed, the 16-nation space station will have a mass of 1 million pounds, be long than a football field, and house up to seven astronauts and cosmonauts. Endeavour's astronauts connect the first two building blocks of the international space station on Sunday, create a seven-story tower in the shuttle cargo bay. It be the first time that the Russian-built Zarya control module and the made-in-america Unity chamber have ever touched. It look to be a perfect and, hopefully, long-lasting fit. We have capture of Zarya, commander Robert Cabana announce the moment the two pieces come together. Congratulations to the crew of the good ship Endeavour, reply Mission Control. That's terrific. The 240-mile-high construction job begin two hours earlier with Nancy Currie's capture of Zarya (russian for Sunrise) use the shuttle robot arm. We're halfway home, Cabana said. then come the hard part: stack the two giant cylinders in the cargo bay.

Once completed, the 16-nation space station will have a mass of 1 million pounds, be long than a football field, and house up to seven astronauts and cosmonauts. A last-minute alarm force NASA to halt Thursday's launching of the space shuttle Endeavour, on a mission to start assemble the international space station. Another attempt for Endeavour and its crew of six astronauts be schedule for Friday at 3:36 a.m. This be the first time in three years, and 19 flights, that a shuttle countdown have be stop after the spaceship be fuel and the crew aboard the craft and ready to go. The uncommon delay prompt frowns and furrow brows here, although officials stress that it be entirely warranted. We want to err on the conservative side, Ralph Roe, launch director at the Kennedy Space Center, say at a news conference after the sudden halt of the countdown just 19 seconds before liftoff. everything have be go smoothly for a rare nighttime launching, set for 3:58 on Thursday morning. The weather, forecast to be iffy, turn out to be fine, and the sky be alight with a nearly full moon. But the length of the so-called launching window was, as planned, unusually short only 10 minutes. That brevity be a result of Endeavour's have to rendezvous with a space-station part that Russia put into orbit last month. The show-stopper arose about four minutes before liftoff when the computer in the space shuttle set off a master alarm. Controllers study the data and discover a momentary pressure drop on one of the hydraulic systems that control the movements of the shuttle's engines and its rudder and other flight surfaces. Officials eventually decide that the pressure drop be insignificant, and they resolve to press ahead. But by then it be too late: time have run out for one of the procedures need to keep the shuttle's fuel supercold. So the countdown be abort just 19 seconds from blastoff. The six astronauts begin to emerge from the shuttle an hour later and ultimately head for bed to rest up for another attempt early Friday. ","On Friday the shuttle Endeavor carried six astronauts into orbit to start building an international space station.The launch occurred after Russia and U.S. officials agreed not to delay the flight in order to orbit closer to MIR, and after a last-minute alarm forced a postponement.On Sunday astronauts joining the Russian-made Zarya control module cylinder with the American-made module to form a 70,000 pounds mass 77 feet long.NASA estimates 43 more launches and 159 more space walks are needed to assemble the complex.When completed the 16-nation space station will be longer than a football field.It will be used to study adaptation to space flight.","Russia and NASA jointly decided against a Russian cost-cutting proposal to orbit the 2nd space station, a 16-country cooperative project, closer to Mir, citing complexity, risk, and bad sun angles.After 5 years of assembly, the research station will house 7 people.A 12-day shuttle mission will attach the US Unity module to the Russian Zarya, already in orbit.Thursday's launch was delayed by a pressure drop.A 2nd attempt Friday was perfect.Unity was attached to Zarya in a blind docking using cameras and computer images.Electrical and cable connections come next.Unity will serve as a passageway for future modules.Two Zarya antennas failed to deploy.","After discarding a suggested change of orbit, the Russian Space Agency went ahead with plans to launch its Zarya module of the international space station on Nov. 20, 1998.Although delayed for a day, U.S. plans to launch the space shuttle Endeavour carrying the U.S. module Unity and six astronauts were carried out on Dec. 4.The astronauts' job was to connect Unity with the already-orbiting Zarya as the first step in assembling 100 major components of the planned space station.Using the shuttle's 50-foot robot arm, the two modules were joined setting the stage for a spacewalk by two astronauts the next day to attach electrical connectors and cables.","The International Space Station when completed will have a million pound mass and be longer than a football field.It will house up to seven space explorers.The initial assembly of space station components involves linking the US Unity, carried into space by the shuttle Endeavour, with the Russian Zarya.The Russians had asked for a different launch profile in order to be able to transfer equipment from its MIR station, but that was not possible.Endeavour astronauts successfully completed the complicated maneuvers to join the two space objects.NASA estimates that 43 more launches will be required to completely assemble the 16-nation space station."
33,"make their first collective decision about monetary policy, the 11 european nations launch a common currency on Jan. 1 cut interest rates Thursday in a surprise move that win market confidence. Ten of the 11 countries join european economic union drop their key interest rate to 3 percent, with Portugal make the most significant plunge, from 3.75 percent. Austria make the small cut, from 3.2 percent. The exception be Italy, which cut from 4 to 3.5 percent. It be expect to drop to the common rate by the time the euro be launched. unify the interest rate be a critical step in lay the groundwork for monetary union, and analysts generally expect rates to settle at around the level of Germany's, 3.3 percent before the cut, now 3 percent. However, interest rate levels have become a contentious political issue with center-left governments in Germany and France push for rate cuts to help spur growth and combat unemployment, stick at 10.9 percent in the nations adopt the euro. The head of the european Central Bank that will set monetary policy for the euro nations, Wim Duisenberg, again on Thursday suggest governments should reform rigid labor markets to create jobs, and not pressure him to cut rates. The remarks in Brussels before the cuts be make give no hint that a rate drop be imminent, but make clear his resistance to political pressure be as strong as ever. So strong, in fact, that Dutch Finance Minister Gerrit Zalm say he have fear the bank would delay the decision. What have be fear be that, in order to prove its independence, the ECB would go against its own analysis and would wait longer, which would have be nonsensical, Zalm said. Hans Tietmeyer, who run the german Bundesbank on which the ECB be modeled, hint the rate cut be design to boost confidence in the new currency, dampen by global economic crises and Europe's worsen outlook. The coordinate rate cut could lead to a reduction in the current pessimism and a reduction in financial market turbulence, Tietmeyer said. The cuts seem to have the desire impact. Frankfurt's main index close up 2.1 percent, while France's be up 1.8 percent. The cuts also boost markets in Spain, Belgium, Italy and even Britain, which be not among the nations launch the euro. The reaction is, `Oh good, they're do a little bit to prop up the euro economy.' But confidence have take quite a hit across Europe recently, and I think further action from the ECB will be need next year, maybe down to 2.5 percent, James Mitchell, senior london-based strategist with Nomura. An economist at the Banque Bruxelles Lambert, Liesbeth Van de Craen, say the cuts be timely. We be clearly head for a slowdown, she said. Until recently, Europe's economies have hold out relatively well against damage from Asia and Russia's economic crises and unstable financial markets. But just two days ago, Duisenberg paint the bleak picture yet of Europe's economies, warn growth will likely slow to 2.5 percent next year from early expectations of 3 percent. The rate cuts may help. By make it cheap to borrow money, rate cuts can lead to more investment and new businesses, make it less worthwhile to save and induce people to spend. That expand the economy. The 11 countries launch the euro be Austria, Belgium, Ireland, Italy, Finland, France, Germany, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Spain and Portugal. Wim Duisenberg, the head of the new european Central Bank, say in an interview publish Wednesday that he won't step down after complete half his term as early agreed. I have hop you wouldn't ask me that question. The answer be no, Duisenberg tell the Le Monde daily, which have ask him if he would step down after four years on the job. Duisenberg be name this spring as head of the new european Central Bank, which will govern the policies of the euro, the new single currency which go into effect Jan. 1. France surprise its euro partners by propose its central banker, Jean-Claude Trichet, at the last minute for the job Duisenberg be expect to secure easily. Although he be elect easily, Duisenberg agree to step down after four years of his eight year term although he have since say no such gentleman's agreement exists. Duisenberg tell Le Monde, a newspaper that fervently have back the euro, that the the introduction of the new currency be the most significant step so far toward european unification. However, he say that he would like to see further political integration, especially in the area of foreign tax and social policies. China make trading in the euro official Monday, announce authorization for the european common currency's use in trade and financial dealings start Jan. 1. The expect announcement from the central People's Bank of China and the State Administration of Foreign Exchange, carry by the official Xinhua News Agency, also authorize the opening of euro accounts. Financial institutions, enterprises and individuals in China can accept and use the euro in economic, trade and financial exchanges with 11 members of the European Union effective January 1, 1999, Xinhua reported. In addition, they can convert, use and open the euro accounts, it said. chinese officials have say the government may convert a proportion of its dlrs 145 billion worth of foreign exchange reserves into the euro after the currency's Jan. 1 debut. The 11 countries launch the common currency be Austria, Belgium, Ireland, Italy, Finland, France, Germany, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Spain and Portugal. The annual inflation rate in the 11 nations that adopt the euro as their shared currency on Jan. 1 fell to 0.9 percent in November, the European Union's statistics agency report Wednesday. The fall continue the steady decline of inflation in the euro-zone over the past year. Annual inflation stand at 1 percent in October and 1.6 percent in November 1997, accord to Eurostat's monthly report. In the 15 nation EU as a whole, inflation fell to 1 percent in November compare to 1.5 percent in the United States and 0.8 percent in Japan. Germany, France, Italy, Spain, the Netherlands, Belgium, Austria, Portugal, Finland, Ireland and Luxembourg be set to adopt the euro as a common currency at midnight on New Year's Eve. The late figures may hint at trouble ahead for the euro-zone with significant increases over the year in Portugal and Ireland. With the european Central Bank set a common interest rate for the whole bloc, some economists fear the low rate design to boost core EU economies like France and Germany may bring overheat in small nations with fast growth. There be good news for Greece which be keep out of the euro-zone for fail to meet economic conditions for joining, include low inflation. It's rate be 3.9 percent in November down from 5 percent a year before. Greece hop to join the euro-zone in 2001. Denmark, Sweden and Britain decide to stay out of the euro for political reasons. Eurostat give the following rates for November 1998, with November 1997 in brackets: Sweden, 0.1 (2.7); France, 0.2 (1.4); Germany, 0.6 (1.4); Austria, 0.5 (1.1); Luxembourg, 0.5 (1.5); Belgium, 0.6 (1.3 percent); Denmark, 1.1 (1.6); Netherlands, 1.5 (2.5); Finland, 0.9 (1.8); Britain, 1.4 (1.9); Spain, 1.4 (1.9); Italy, 1.7 (1.8); Portugal, 2.6 (1.9); Ireland, 2.2 (1.1); Greece, 3.9 (5). In his most candid remarks yet on the economy, european Central Bank President Wim Duisenberg say Friday that growth appear to be slow in the 11 countries adopt the EU common currency or euro on Jan. 1. Despite an area-wide survey that suggest a moderation in the pace of growth, Duisenberg say domestic demand will continue to boost the economy. He point also to a gradual improvement in labor market conditions as support growth, as well as interest-rate cuts toward the 3.3 percent level of the euro-zone's lowest rate countries. Duisenberg, who speak at an event in London, say the Dec. 1 and Dec. 22 meetings of the Central Bank's policy-making body will gauge the outlook for inflation and the EU economy. The bank, which will set monetary policy for the currency bloc, have be under pressure from politicians to keep interest rates low to help boost growth and create jobs. While inflation be at its low levels in decades just 1 percent in the euro-zone unemployment in the 11 nations remain stubbornly high at 10.9 percent. struggle to avoid be sideline in the continent-wide equities market promise by Europe's soon-to-be-introduced single currency, French authorities say Thursday that the Paris stock exchange would join an alliance between London and Frankfurt that be see as the precursor of a pan-european market. The Bourse in Paris also announce that it would play host to a meeting Nov. 27 of nine other european exchanges to discuss the steps and conditions need to create a unifying and competitive pan-european equity market. The two announcements show how the introduction of the currency, the euro, be reshape Europe's financial landscape, require Europeans to think in Continental rather than national terms in finance and business. And it suggest that exchange authorities in Paris, ruffle by the announcement in July of a strategic alliance between the London Stock Exchange and the Deutsche Borse in Frankfurt, have not only abandon an effort to set up a rival market but be also seek to gain the initiative by organize the Nov. 27 gathering. Some doubt remained, however, about the timing and technicalities of the french entry into the alliance. Foreign Minister Dominique Strauss-Kahn said, Paris be join this alliance with the creation from January 1999 of a joint company. However, officials in London and Frankfurt who welcome the idea in principle decline to say whether the timing and the arrangements be as far advanced as Strauss-Kahn implied. I'm afraid I can't confirm anything like that, a spokeswoman at the London Stock Exchange said. The appearances be well ahead of the reality at this point, say an american banker, who speak on the condition of anonymity. not only that, the notion of a europe-wide exchange raise technical questions about the compatibility not just of trade systems but also of the regulations govern stock market operations in the countries that will use the euro beginning in January. That have lead some analysts to forecast that a pan-european exchange could not be up and run before 2000. There be an awful lot of issues to be resolved, the american banker said. The euro be to be introduce for electronic trading of equities, bonds and futures and for intergovernmental transfers. Notes and coin the pocket money that shoppers and travelers will carry will be introduce only in 2002. Initially, the currency will group 11 european nations in a euro zone, leave Britain, Denmark, Sweden and Greece on the outside. With its concentration of banking and trading, however, London be expect to continue as the main market center. The prospect have heighten pressure for consolidation among exchanges. Stock market officials in Milan, Madrid, Amsterdam and Brussels have indicate they would be interested in join the London-Frankfurt alliance, which will initially create a single point of liquidity for trading in British and german blue-chip issues. The London exchange estimates that a pan-european stock exchange would group together companies with a market capitalization of $5.5 trillion, compare with $8.7 trillion on the New York Stock Exchange. The Paris Bourse, the third large of the european exchanges and the last major holdout toward a pan-european market, say that it have also invite officials from exchanges in Zurich and Stockholm to attend the Nov. 27 meeting. A spokeswoman say officials from the London Stock Exchange would be at the meeting. also Thursday, the New York Mercantile Exchange and the International Petroleum Exchange here acknowledge that they be consider a merger that would bring together the two big energy futures markets. Discussions begin in July, and the exchanges have form a work group to study a merger. They already cooperate in the development of a system intend to coordinate after-hours electronic trading. Palm Pilot in one hand, cellular phone in the other, Jean-Marc Routiers, 26, be juggle business call halfway between London and Paris. When his phone go dead as the high-speed Eurostar train pull into the underwater tunnel that link England to the Continent, the london-based french banker loosen his italian silk tie and introduce himself. I definitely describe myself as a European, he say in the fluent English he perfect work at an australian bank. I may get sentimental when they play the Marseillaise, but for all the practical things, I see myself as a citizen of Europe. I like the lifestyle in France, but I don't make my living there. The year 1999 be the official start-up date of the euro, the common european currency that will unite 11 countries monetarily. But throughout Europe, a different kind of integration have already take root. Routiers, who be spend a day in Paris to meet with his bank's french clients, be at the vanguard of a new generation of Europeans who do not have to brace themselves for a shock in the new year. Mobile, fluent in several languages and aggressively non-nationalistic, they be already live the kind of borderless, cosmopolitan existence that the single european currency be suppose to advance. They do not share their parents' memories of World War II or their parents' sense of national identity. People worry when they hear talk of a common european defense policy because it suggest that at the end of the day, we have one government, say Kleon Papadopoulos, a greek banker base in London. Countries be afraid to lose their sovereignty, but I don't see it as a bad thing. If a government be good, stable and efficient, who care if it be base in Berlin or Athens? Papadopoulos, 36, who study business in the United States and Britain, could serve as a model for the new Europeans. He work for a swiss bank in London, speaks Greek, English and French, and in the past year have traveled, among other places, to belgium, the United States, Cuba, Switzerland and Italy. Like hundreds of thousands of other Europeans, he choose London and its busy financial markets as the best place to work. He say he do not feel as if he live in England. He live in London, the clubhouse of financial Europe. And membership have its privileges. Papadopoulos live in the fashionable Knightsbridge area, drive a Porsche he buy in Brussels, and work out at the fashionable gym of the Carleton Towers. I go to the London School of Economics in 1984, and the only other `foreigners' I meet be from the Middle East, he says. now friends and co-workers be Italian, French, Greek, Spanish, German, even Russian. You feel it everywhere. The streets be jam with foreigners. not tourists people who live and work here. Baby-boomers in Europe often describe themselves as the 1968 generation, wean on the protest and social turmoil that convulse european societies 30 years ago. Less dramatic but equally significant be a 1968 law guarantee freedom of movement within what be then the six countries of the Common Market. A Frenchman could work in Holland, an italian could work in Germany without a permit. Back then some economists dourly predict huge migrations, particularly of unskilled laborers move from southern countries to the more prosperous north. Actually, as huge industries like steel shrank in the 1970s and '80s, so do the job opportunities for working-class Europeans. There be 15 countries within what be now the european Union, but only a small percentage of their citizens have move to other countries, accord to estimates prepare by Eurostat. Those who do mostly find jobs in the service industry as waiters, maids or garbage collectors. There be still legal barriers prevent most doctors, lawyers and academics from find work in other countries. so far the European Union have be most profitably put to use by white-collar business executives who eagerly follow career opportunities across national borders, time zones and language barriers. Twenty-five years ago that kind of mobility be the preserve of a far small elite, the top executives of major companies or multinational corporations. Technology, from high-speed trains to the ever-evolving apparatus of business lap-top computers, cell phones, fax machines have make european mobility accessible to mid-level managers, young entrepreneurs and even students. Cable television, which allow Germans to watch italian game shows or Swedes to watch french news programs, have spread the Zeitgeist to the masses. This year Superga, an italian brand of sports clothes and shoes, open a major advertising campaign with a series of magazine ads that show fashionable young people saucily cavort with european leaders a leggy young woman push her bicycle up the steps of the Elysee Palace to greet President Jacques Chirac, a young man playfully stick his tongue out the window of the plane of the former German chancellor, Helmut Kohl. This kind of ad would not have be possible five or 10 years ago, say Aldo Cernuto, executive creative director of the Milan office of Pirella Gottsche Lowe, an international advertising agency. now european unification be on the tv all the time; it have seep into people's unconscious. even people who do not care about politics recognize the face of a Tony Blair or Jacques Chirac. Ten years ago, very few people did. accord to the European Union, Britain have twice as many EU citizens as France, but it be not the country with the high concentration of residents from other european countries. accord to estimates base on surveys prepare by Eurostat, nearly a third of the residents of tiny Luxembourg, which have low unemployment and a high standard of living, be from other european countries. Belgium, which have the european Commission and NATO headquarters, be second, with 5.4 percent. Paradoxically, perhaps, Britain, the one major european nation that have hold off from join the euro, be widely view as the nerve center of the new cosmopolitanism, headquarters for the New Europeans bankers and business executives draw by London's financial district, a more flexible bureaucracy and the universality of the English language. perhaps just as surprisingly, London also serve as an example of another less obvious aspect of european cosmopolitanism the breakdown of certain social barriers. study abroad be once a privilege reserve to the sons and daughters of Europe's elite. now the European Union have a 12-year-old scholarship program, call Socrates-Erasmus, that this year allow 200,000 european university students 5 percent of the EU's entire university population to study in other countries within the Union for up to a year, free. In the last 20 years, business schools in Europe have multiplied, and most offer u.s.-style MBA programs that teach an american approach to business. This too have allow a measure of meritocracy to creep into european business. Juergen Schrempp, the head of Daimler, start as a car mechanic, note Stephen Szabo, a professor of european Affairs at the Johns Hopkins University School for International Studies in Washington. That would have be unthinkable in Germany 20 years ago. Social mobility, moreover, be fuel by movement. When people transfer to another country, they find it easy to shed the psychological or cultural trappings of home. I could never have the kind of job I have have I stay in Paris, Routier explained. France be still very hierarchical. Bosses want to know where you go to school, what your father does. In London, none of that matters as long as you make money. many Britons still view their country as weigh down by heavy class distinctions. For example, Tony Smith, 36, editor of several Portuguese magazines in Lisbon, seize an opportunity to study in Vienna 14 years ago, and never look back. He have live all over Europe, and be fluent in Portuguese, Spanish, German, French and Serbo-Croatian. His father, a car mechanic, have not travel out of Britain until 1992. Smith say he could never have succeed as well have he stay home. I didn't go to public schools or Oxbridge, he explained. I'm not say its impossible, but it would have be much more difficult in England. Yet Continental Europeans who flock to London find themselves bypass english society and join a cosmopolitan world where birth and breeding do not matter as much. Ildiko Iliffe, 30, chose to work in London to escape the sexism she encounter on the Continent. Mrs. Iliffe, who be Hungarian, speaks fluent English, German, French and Italian, and meet her canadian husband, Roger Iliffe, 30, while both be attend the University of Bocconi business school in Milan in 1995. Like his wife, Iliffe speak four languages and have live and travel all over the world. She work on the eastern european desk of a british bank; he work for a major international consulting firm. originally they plan to work in Italy, but Mrs. Iliffe say the prevailing attitude towards work women there make it impossible for her to find as good a job. I go to job interviews at italian banks and they only ask me about my husband's job, she say with a grimace. And they make it clear that they be afraid I would get pregnant and ask for maternity leave. Philippe Haspeslagh, 48, a professor at Insead, the prestigious international business school in Fontainebleau, outside Paris, call Mrs. Iliffe's choices cherry-picking choose the best deal for herself. As he put it, If they cannot find what they want in one country, they can pick up and seek it elsewhere. twenty-five years ago, Haspeslagh be a pioneer when he do the same thing. A Belgian who study business at Harvard, he live and teaches in France and do consult work all over Europe, from Sweden to the Czech Republic. The message on his cell phone be in three languages French, Flemish and English. His students, a generation behind him, see nothing exceptional in his transnationalism. These Europeans form an advance guard that be still relatively small in numbers, but experts say they carry a disproportionate influence on their societies. In Germany, for example, it be the business people who be push ahead with change and pulling politicians along behind them kick and screaming, Szabo said. They be look at a large market and feel the competitive pressures of globalization. Politicians be respond to a domestic constituency. They be answer to an international one. In a surprise move, nations adopt the new european currency, the euro, drop key interest rates Thursday, effectively set the rate that will be adopt throughout the euro zone on Jan. 1. Ten of the 11 countries adopt the euro drop their interest rate to 3 percent. Italy drop to 3.5 percent from 4 percent. The coordinated move be a key step in prepare for economic union. set a common interest rates have be a particularly contentious issue as center-left governments in Germany and France press for low rates to help boost growth and cut unemployment, a stubborn 10.9 percent in the euro zone. european Central Bank chief, Wim Duisenberg, give no hint of the rate cuts during a speech in Brussels earlier Thursday, instead suggest that governments should reform rigid labor markets to create jobs. In Germany, the big economy in the future euro-zone, central bankers cut the key interest rate to 3 percent from 3.3 percent. Rates before the cuts have vary throughout the future currency zone, from 3.69 percent in Ireland to 3.2 percent in Austria. The European Central Bank say in a statement from its Frankfurt headquarters that the move be decide during a meeting Tuesday of its the policy-making governing council. The govern council comprise the 11 heads of national central banks plus a six-member directorate, include the bank president Duisenberg. The joint reduction in interest rates have to be see as a de facto decision on the level of interest rates with which the (bank) will start ... monetary union, the statement said, add the 3-percent rate would be maintain for the foreseeable future. In Germany, central bank president Hans Tietmeyer say the move reflect the worsen outlook for european economies, and wasn't a capitulation to political pressure Finance Minister Oskar Lafontaine. It's not a dramatic step. It wasn't in response to political pressure, Tietmeyer said, refer to Germany's cut. The coordinate rate cut could lead to a reduction in the current pessimism and a reduction in financial market turbulence, he said. But Tietmeyer, head of the bank on which the ECB be modeled, promise that the rate cut do not signal the start of a volatile monetary policy. It's not a shift from the Bundesbank's steady-hand policy, he said. Growth in Europe have be hit by the Asian and russian economic crises and turbulence on international financial markets. Duisenberg have say growth in the euro area countries next year will be about 2.5 percent, low than the 3 percent predict earlier. Two days before the new euro currency go into effect for 11 European Union members, a grow number of Danes believe their country should take part, accord to a poll publish Tuesday. The survey by the Megaphone polling institute say 54 percent of the 1,009 people survey favor Denmark's participation, while 36 percent oppose that. The remain 10 percent be undecided. The poll, conduct Dec. 18-22, be broadcast by TV2 channel. Denmark be one of four EU countries stay out of the monetary union for the time being. After voters in 1992 reject the Maastricht treaty that establish the system, Denmark win opt-out clauses. The treaty then be approved. danish voters traditionally have be lukewarm supporters of the EU. Although many politicians support the unified currency, they have be wary about bring the issue to voters again. A poll publish last October show 46 percent of Danes favor the single currency, while 44 percent be opposed. It would take another national referendum for Denmark to adopt the new currency. The government have say it have no plans to hold a referendum before the year 2001. Europe's dream of monetary union become reality Thursday when 11 nations irrevocably lock their currencies together to form the euro and create an economic giant whose boundaries stretch from beyond the Arctic Circle to the shores of the Mediterranean. The euro's birth be be hail as a historic turning point in international finance and be arguably the great single step in the drive to create a united Europe from the ruins of World War II. This Dec. 31, 1998, will be one of the great dates in the history of the 20th century, French Finance Minister Dominique Strauss-Kahn, tell France Info radio. It's the beginning of a new era. On what Europeans be call E-day, economic and finance ministers from the 11 nations will huddle at European Union headquarters to agree to the rates at which german marks, italian lira and the rest be absorb into euro. Strauss-Kahn say the euro would likely be worth 6.56 to 6.57 french francs. ","Eleven countries were to adopt a common European currency, the euro, on Dec. 31, 1998.In November and December there were various reactions.France made moves toward a pan-European equity market.Ten of the countries quickly cut interest rates causing fear of overheating in some economies.In Denmark, which had earlier rejected the euro, a majority was now in favor.And in faraway China, the euro was permitted in financial exchanges.Whatever the outcome, the euro's birthday, Dec. 31, 1998, would be an historical date.Some saw it as a step towards political union while others already considered themselves as citizens of Europe.","Eleven European nations are forming a ""Euro zone"".Britain, Denmark, Sweden, and Greece are not part of it.Danes favor joining.The Euro became official for intergovernmental transfers on Dec 31, 1998, but bills and coins will not come until 2002.The Paris, London, and Frankfurt stock exchanges have formed an alliance.Euro nations cut interest rates and inflation fell to an average 0.9%. China has authorized use of the Euro in trade.The president of the European Central Bank warns that growth is slowing and that he plans to complete his term.The EU monetary action has given rise to the new mobile, multi-lingual, non-nationalistic European.","France's offer to host a financial meeting for nine other European nations is seen as a precursor to a pan-European market.It shows how the new currency, the euro, is reshaping Europe financially.Eleven European nations lowered key interest rates in preparation for the conversion.China made trading in euro official Monday when it accepted its use in trade and finance starting Jan. 1.Denmark and Sweden may not join the euro for political reasons.Some smaller nations may become unstable from a growing inflation decline.A new generation, already cosmopolitan, won't be shocked.The head of the new European Central Bank will not step down at half term.","On 1 Jan 1999, the euro, a currency serving 11 European nations, entered the world financial market.As time grew short, questions remained over the pan-European market.When the head--serving an 8-year term--of the European Central Bank, which governs the euro, expressed fear of a slowing economy, the nations simultaneously dropped interest rates, spurring the market.Annual inflation rates also were encouraging.Denmark, who along with Sweden and Britain eschewed the euro, was becoming interested.As a step to a unified Europe, the euro will well serve the new, mobile, multi-lingual, business generation and could portend an economic giant."
34,"bent on revenge for early attacks on churches, mob set fire to four mosques in West Timor Monday after a protest and strike by thousands of Christians degenerate into a riot, the military and a Muslim leader said. A rampaging crowd also burn down a market and a Muslim school. Troops and riot police patrol the streets. There be no immediate reports of serious injuries or arrests as fight between Muslims and Christians continue after dark, say a military officer who speak by telephone on condition of anonymity. The violence in the christian-dominated city of Kupang be in retaliation for the burning and ransacking of 22 churches by Muslim mob in the capital, Jakarta, on Nov. 22, when 14 people be killed. Islamic leaders urge Indonesia's Muslim majority not to retaliate with more violence. Adurrahman Wahid, head of Indonesia's large Muslim grouping, the 30 million-member Nahdlatul Ulama, accuse provocateurs of whip up religious strife when the sprawl Southeast asian nation be try to head toward democracy. I hope Muslims ... be not deceive by such provocations, say Wahid, who have be push for religious unity. West Timor shares the same island as troubled East Timor, a former Portuguese territory dominate by Roman Catholicism and invade by Indonesia in 1975. Christians, mostly Protestants, dominate Kupang, about 1,875 kilometers (1,172 miles) southeast of the indonesian capital. However, a sizable Muslim minority also live there. The Kupang riot break out after thousands of Christians stag a peaceful strike and street protest against the Jakarta church attacks. most offices and shops be close in the city of 120,000, the capital of East Nusa Tenggara province, whose governor call for calm. Organizers of Monday's strike have call for a non-violent day of mourning. However, residents say fires break out in three mosques after rival gangs pelt each other with rocks. Indonesia be the world's most populous Islamic nation. About 90 percent of Indonesia's 202 million people be Muslims, with the rest follow Christian, Hindu, Buddhist or other faiths. Religious diversity base on a belief in God be enshrine in the national philosophy, know as Pancasila, adopt when Indonesia declare independence from Dutch colonial rule in 1945. The upsurge in religious violence follow months of riots and protests in many parts of Indonesia. Social tensions in the sprawling Southeast asian nation have intensify as it grapple with its bad economic crisis in decades. There be also political turmoil as students protesters demand great democracy after 32 years of authoritarian rule by former President Suharto, who be force to quit follow deadly riots in May. Ismalil Hasan Metareum, head of the muslim-dominated opposition United Development Party, urge his followers not to hit back. more than 100,000 party supporters fill a sports stadium in Jakarta Sunday at the opening of a four-day convention. Religious strife erupt recently in the eastern part of the main island of Java, where more than 150 people, many of them Islamic clerics, have be murdered, apparently by rival Muslim groups. Many of the dead be accuse of practice black magic. Representatives of exiled East Timorese pro-independence groups say Friday that indonesian troops attack unarmed civilians in a village in the disputed Southeast Asian territory, kill one East Timorese and wound 22 others. The report could not be independently confirmed, and indonesian officials be not immediately available for comment. The attack take place Tuesday near Cailaco in East Timor, a former Portuguese colony, accord to a statement issue by the pro-independence Christian Democratic Union of East Timor. Placido do Santos, a 28-year-old farmer, be torture and kill by the indonesian military during the attack, the statement, which cite resistance sources in East Timor's capital, Dili. The statement, release in the portuguese capital of Lisbon, also say that 22 people be injure and 26 be missing. The names, ages and occupations of the villagers be listed. Roque Rodrigues, a Lisbon spokesman for the Socialist Party of Timor, another pro-independence group, say he have corroborate the report with six sources inside East Timor and say he have no reasons to doubt the truth of the statement. The United Nations, which be broker talks between Lisbon and Jakarta over the territory's political future, still regard Portugal as the administer power in East Timor. The half-island territory lie some 2,000 kilometers (1,200 miles) southeast of Jakarta. Protesters on Sunday urge australian military leaders to identify indonesian army officers train here to allow close monitoring of human rights abuses in East Timor. The australian military hold joint training exercises with indonesian troops, include the elite commando units accuse ot atrocities in East Timor. In Queensland, about 100 activists gather outside the Canungra Land Warfare Center, south of Brisbane, to mark the 23rd anniversary of the indonesian invasion of East Timor. It be a peaceful protest against Australia train indonesian soldiers, spokesman Jason McLeod said. The protesters want Australia to cut all military ties with Indonesia despite Defence Minister John Moore's recent announcement that joint exercises would resume, he said. The australian government have repeatedly refuse to allow the Indonesians train here to be identified, McLeod said. But we be demand they be name along with their unit and battalion number because this will allow closer monitoring of human rights issues, he said. McLeod say 40,000 East Timorese be kill by japanese soldiers for protect australian commando during World War II. When they finally leave the country the Australians distributed leaflets say they would never forget the people of East Timor, he said. The protesters want to remind Australia's current soldiers of that pledge. After Portugal abandon its former colony in East Timor in 1975, Indonesia invade it and annex it the follow year. The United Nations refuse to recognize the annexation as legitimate; Australia be one of the few nations that recognize indonesian sovereignty over East Timor. Representatives of exiled East Timorese pro-independence groups say Friday that indonesian troops attack unarmed civilians in a village in the disputed Southeast Asian territory, kill one East Timorese and wound 22 others. The attack take place Tuesday near Cailaco in East Timor, a former Portuguese colony, accord to a statement issue by the pro-independence Christian Democratic Union of East Timor. Placido do Santos, a 28-year-old farmer, be torture and kill by the indonesian military during the attack, the statement claimed. Jose Pau Lelo, 38, Rosito Borges, 35, and Leao Soares, 50, be in a coma due to injuries they sustain in the attack, accord to the statement which cite resistance sources in East Timor's capital Dili.

There be no independent confirmation of the attack, and indonesian officials be be not immediately available for comment. Indonesia invade East Timor in Dec. 1975, follow Portugal's colonial rule, and annex it a month later. indonesian troops have since then be fight a small band of pro-independence guerillas. Roque Rodrigues, a Lisbon spokesman for the National Council of Timorese Resistance, say he also have corroborate the report with six sources inside East Timor and say he have no reasons to doubt the truth of the statement. The United Nations, which be broker talks between Lisbon and Jakarta over the territory's political future, still regard Portugal as the administer power in East Timor. The half-island territory lie some 2,000 kilometers (1,200 miles) southeast of Jakarta. Indonesia on Tuesday deny claims that its troops massacre more than 40 East Timorese recently, and criticized Portugal for suspend u.n.-sponsored talks over the future of the troubled territory. Foreign Minister Ali Alatas question whether Portugal truly want to settle the problem of East Timor, a former Portuguese colony, the official Antara news agency reported. Portugal suspend the talks with Indonesia in New York last week follow reports of a massacre of dozens of East Timorese rebels in a series of clashes with indonesian troops. East Timor's spiritual leader, Roman Catholic Bishop Carlos Belo, have say that between 30 and 40 people be reportedly kill near the villages of Alas and Same, 40 kilometers (25 miles) southeast of Dili, East Timor capital. The 1996 Nobel Peace Prize winner say that so far, only 11 bodies have be identified. Alatas say the claims of a massacre be not true. The Portuguese delegation, without check the truth of the information, decide to temporarily suspend the ongoing dialogue, Antara quote Alatas as saying. The New york-based group Human Rights Watch say some deaths have occur in fights between rebels and indonesian forces. However, it could not confirm claims that dozens of people have be killed. Alatas say it be the third time that Portugal have unilaterally suspend talks over East Timor since 1986. base on this, Alatas said, Indonesia be skeptical about Portugal's sincerity, Antara reported. In response, Portugal's Foreign Ministry accuse Indonesia of break promises to reduce its military presence in East Timor and call for a permanent U.N. mission in the disputed territory. Unfortunately, Indonesia have increase its deployment and the brutality of its military actions in East Timor, say ministry spokesman Horacio Cesar. Meanwhile, about 500 students end their noisy but peaceful rally outside the office of East Timor's governor in Dili Tuesday after receive promises that the reported killings would be investigated. In a dialogue with the students' representatives, Governor Abilio Osorio Soares and military chief Col. Suhartono Suratman agree to set up a team to make a thorough investigation. The group earlier have spend one night occupy the provincial Parliament and vow to stay at the governor's office. The students also demand a total withdrawal of indonesian soldiers from East Timor. Meanwhile, an unidentified man, believe to be a rebel, be report to have shoot and wound Izildo Pereira, a civilian, in Baucau, 100 kilometers (62 miles) east of Dili. Izildo, 30, who be shot Sunday, be be treat at a military hospital in Dili. Indonesia invade East Timor in 1975 and annex it the follow year. The United Nations, however, do not recognize Indonesia's claim. Before be suspended, the talks center on an indonesian offer to give East Timor autonomy in return for international recognition of indonesian sovereignty there. In a decision welcome as a landmark by Portugal, European Union leaders Saturday back calls for a referendum to decide the fate of East Timor, the former Portuguese colony occupy by Indonesia since 1975. A definitive solution to the East Timor question will not be possible without free consultation to establish the real will of the East Timorese people, the 15 EU leaders say in statement after their year-end summit. Portuguese Foreign Minister Jaime Gama say the statement mark the first time the EU have back Lisbon's call for the East Timorese to vote on whether to opt for independence or remain under indonesian rule. Indonesia have resist such calls for a referendum and maintain thousands of troops to keep order in the half-island territory. The EU statement also urge Indonesia to bring about a real and substantial reduction in troop levels and call for the establishment of a permanent U.N. presence in East Timor. The leaders repeat a demand that Indonesia release jail timorese rebel leader Xanana Gusmao, and all political prisoners. Indonesia invade East Timor in 1975 as Portugal prepare to grant independence, and annex it the follow year. The United Nations do not recognize indonesian rule. JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) - As a U.N. envoy trot toward an indonesian army helicopter, East Timorese protesters spill onto the runway tarmac and shout their anger at nervous soldiers. Sent to make peace in Indonesian-controlled East Timor, Jamsheed Marker's recent hasty departure from the troubled territory signal how easily tensions there can boil over. Yet Marker, who be visit Indonesia to promote a u.n.-designed blueprint for autonomy in the former Portuguese colony, say Monday that both sides in the bitter conflict be display a newfound taste for compromise. In an interview with The Associated Press, Marker admit that a peaceful solution remain distant. But in a big step forward, he said, many separatist activists be no longer press for an immediate vote on independence. They don't want independence tomorrow, say Marker, who be interview in a Jakarta hotel suite after his trip to East Timor. In other progress, Indonesia and Portugal will send diplomats to open interest sections in each other's capitals next month. Formal diplomatic relations, however, will not be resumed. also in January, the two countries be schedule to embark on a new round of u.n.-sponsored peace talks in New York. Turmoil have plague East Timor ever since indonesian troops invade in 1975, unleash a separatist rebel war and the resentment of a population pummel by human rights abuses. Talks be revive earlier this year after the ouster of authoritarian President Suharto, but differences remain over a definition of autonomy that would suit all parties.

During a visit last year, indonesian soldiers kill two pro-independence demonstrators outside a hotel where Marker be staying. Activists have allege that Indonesia secretly ferry troops into East Timor in spite of pledges to reduce the number. Marker say Jakarta have advise him of troop rotations and that U.N. staff be monitor the situation. Marker be schedule to talk with indonesian President B.J. Habibie on Tuesday and will leave Indonesia on Wednesday to prepare for another batch of meetings in the New Year. If you ask me... `do you have a solution?' then the answer is, `I don't,' he said.

The United Nations refuse to recognize the annexation as legitimate; Australia be one of the few nations that recognize indonesian sovereignty over East Timor.

Saramago (pronounced sah-rah-mah-go) be the fourth consecutive european to win the prestigious prize, and the first laureate to write in Portuguese. He have long be see as one of the strong potential candidates for the prize and the frequent media queries about his prospects contrast with his quiet personality. I be skeptical, reserved, I don't gush, I don't go around smiling, hug people, try to make friends, he tell The Associated Press in a recent interview. I just write. saramago on Thursday have plan to leave Frankfurt, Germany, where he be attend the international book fair for his home in the Canary Islands.

The prize even have go occasionally to writers who do not work in fiction or poetry, notably Winston Churchill and Bertrand Russell. last year's prize go to Dario Fo, the italian playwright whose work combine gut-busting comedy with acid social and political commentary.

Nominations can be make by previous laureates, professors of history and literature, members of the Academy and presidents of some national authors' organizations. The Nobel Prize in Medicine winner will be announce Oct. 12, the physics and chemistry winners on Oct. 13, the economics laureate on Oct. 14 and the peace prize on Occt. 16. All the prize announcements be in Stockholm, except for the peace prize which be give in Oslo, Norway. All the prizes be present on Dec. 10, the anniversary of Nobel's death. Robert F. Furchgott, Louis J. Ignarro and Ferid Murad of the United States on Monday win the Nobel Medicine Prize. They be give the prize for their discoveries concern nitric oxide as a signal molecule in the cardiovascular system, accord to the citiation from the Karolinska lnstitute. Furchgott be a pharmacologist at the State University of New York in Brooklyn, Ignarro be at University of California-Los Angeles and Murad be at the University of Texas Medical School in Houston. The citation say it be a senation that the simple, common air pollutant (nitric oxide), which be form when nitrogen burns ... could exert important functions in the organism. Because of the research, we know today that nitric oxide acts as a signal molecule in the nervous system, as a weapon against infections and as a regulator of blood pressure. The prize amount of 7.6 million kronor (dlrs 978,000) be divide equally among the three. last year, the prize go to Stanley B. Prusiner of the University of California at San Francisco for his discovery of prions, the rogue proteins identify as cause Mad Cow Disease. Winners generally aren't know outside the medical community, although the list of laureates contain a few familiar names include Ivan Pavlov, tuberculosis pioneer Robert Koch, and DNA researchers Francis Crick and James Watson. Generally, they be researchers who have make discoveries that sound small on paper but carry large consequences. Among other well-known names to receive the prize be David Baltimore, although he share the prize in 1975, long before become one of the world's most visible AIDS researchers. Alan Cormack of the United States and Sir Godfrey Hounsfield may not be familiar names, but what they win the prize for in 1979 be a term know by most patients: computer-assisted tomography or CAT scan. The medicine prize be the second of the six Nobels to be announce this year. last Thursday, the literature prize go to Portuguese novelist Jose Saramago. The physics and chemistry prizes will be announce Tuesday, the economics prize on Wednesday and the peace prize on Friday. All the announcements be in Stockholm, except for the peace prize which be give in Oslo, Norway. The prizes be present on Dec. 10, the anniversary of the death of Alfred Nobel, the industrialist and inventor of dynamite whose will establish the prizes. Jose Saramago become the first writer in Portuguese to win the Nobel Prize for Literature on Thursday. His personal delight be second by a burst of public elation in his homeland. Saramago, 75, and Portuguese say they be please the swedish Academy have finally acknowledge the literary contribution of Portugal, a small country of 10 million people border Spain on Europe's southwestern Iberian Peninsula. It have take all of this century to win a Nobel Prize for the Portuguese language, Saramago say at the Frankfurt Book Fair, speak through an interpreter. Saramago, a soft-spoken man know for his hard-edged and iconoclastic views, say he share the honor with his country and he hop win the prize would make Portugal and its language more visible and audible. I'm personally very happy for myself. I'm also happy for my country, he say at the Frankfurt Book Fair in Germany where he be engulf by well-wishers offer roses. Back home, President Jorge Sampaio say the award be a cause for great collective satisfaction. Prime Minister Antonio Guterres say the award be above all a prize for Portugal and the Portuguese language which be speak by 180 million worldwide, mostly in Brazil, but also in Portugal's five former colonies in Africa. Saramago's controversial opinions and atheistic outlook have frequently clash with the establishment and the general public. even on the day he win the prize, the Vatican newspaper L'Osservatore Romano attack the swedish Academy's choice, describe Saramago as an old-school communist who have a substantially antireligious vision. Undersecretary of State Sousa Lara be so upset by one of Saramago's novels in 1992 that he withdraw his name from Portugal's nominees for the european Literature Prize. At the time, Lara say Saramago's 1991 novel O Evangelho Segundo Jesus Cristo (The Gospel accord to Jesus Christ) offend Portugal's Roman Catholic religious convictions and divide the country. The book describe a Christ who, subject to human desires, live with Mary Magdalene and tries to back out of his crucifixion. I have not come to bring peace but the sword, say Saramago, an atheist, at the time. He retreat in disgust with his spanish wife, Pilar del Rio, to his home in Lanzarote in Spain's Canary Islands. He have never court the kind of fame offer by literary prizes, and his bluntness can sometimes offend. I be skeptical, reserved, I don't gush, I don't go around smiling, hug people and try to make friends, he once said. A gaunt man with wisp of white hair, Saramago be bear in Azinhaga, a small town near Lisbon. From a poor family, he never finish university but continue to study part-time while support himself as a metalworker. His first novel, publish in 1947 Terra do Pecado, or Country of Sin be a tale of peasants in moral crisis. It sell badly but win enough recognition to propel him from the welder's shop to a literary magazine. But for the next 18 years, Saramago, a communist who oppose the 41-year conservative dictatorship of Antonio Salazar, publish only a few travel and poetry books while he work as a journalist. He return to fiction only after Salazar's regime be topple by a military uprising in 1974. Since the 1980s, he have be one of Portugal's best-selling contemporary writers and his works have be translate into more than 20 languages. He first win critical acclaim abroad with his 1982 historical fantasy Memorial do Convento, publish in English in 1988 as Baltasar and Blimunda. It be set during the catholic-inspired inquisition and explore the war between individuals and organize religion, pick up Saramago's recur theme of the loner struggle against authority. He be most frequently compare with colombian writer Gabriel Garcia Marquez because his prose be often root in recognizable settings but at the same time ting with magical elements. The Nobel citation praise his work that with parables sustain by imagination, compassion and irony continually enable us to apprehend an elusory reality. Saramago remain a prominent nonconformist through his regular newspaper and radio commentaries, though his views be always inspire by his deep concern for his fellow man. Blindness, his most recent book to be translate into English, be an unsettling allegory about the social meltdown as an inexplicable blindness sweeps through society. This blindness isn't a real blindness, it's a blindness of rationality, he said. We're rational beings but we don't behave rationally. If we did, there'd be no starvation in the world. In the 1989 The History of the Siege of Lisbon, a Lisbon proofreader mischievously insert the word not into a text on the 12th century capture of the portuguese capital from the Moors, thereby fictionally alter the course of european history with a stroke of his pen. such historical and literary mischief be Saramago trademarks. In his 1986 book, The Stone Raft, the Iberian Peninsula snap off from the rest of the European continent and float off into the North Atlantic apparently in a metaphorical search for identity away from the standardize nature of the European Union, of which Portugal and Spain be enthusiastic members. Saramago will receive the dlrs 978,000 prize on Dec. 10 in Stockholm. Former U.S. President Jimmy Carter, who seem a perennial Nobel Peace Prize also-ran, could have win the coveted honor in 1978 have it not be for strict deadline rules for nominations. That prize be share by egyptian President Anwar Sadat and Israeli Prime Minister Menachem Begin for sign the Camp David peace accords. However, the five-member norwegian awards committee also want to honor Carter for broker the pact, only to be foil by their own rules. The Nobel committee want to give the prize to all three, say Geir Lundestad, the current committee's nonvoting secretary, say on Sunday. But Carter have not be nominate when the deadline run out. Nominations postmark by Feb. 1 be accept for that year's prize. The committee can add it own nominations at its first meeting of the year, usually in early March. The Camp David accords be not sign until Sept. 17, 1978, about five weeks before that year's peace prize be annouCkuld not give him the prize, the norwegian committee recognize in the 1978 awards citation the positive initiative take by President Jimmy Carter. Lundestad say the committee, which work in deep secrecy in its five or six meetings a year, try to find a loophole in the rules, which be overseen by the swedish Nobel Foundation. The Nobel Prizes be endow by Alfred Nobel, a swedish industrialist whose 355 inventions include dynamite. In his 1895 will, Nobel endow the prizes, and say the peace prize should be pick by a norwegian committee and the rest by Swedish institutions. Lundestad say the committee turn to the swedish Nobel Foundation for advice on Carter because it be a question of principle. Stig Ramel, a Swede who be then director of the Nobel Foundation, advise against break the rules, Lundestad say by telephone. Normally, the committee refuse to discuss past candidates in keep with a strict policy of secrecy in which selection details be seal for 50 years. Lundestad make an exception because Ramel reveal the Carter dilemma in his 1994 memoirs. Carter have repeatedly be nominate for the Nobel prize for his consistent and wide-ranging peace efforts. He be also among the 139 candidates for the prize be announce in Oslo on Friday. However, early speculation lean more toward someone involve in the Northern Ireland peace process, Czech President Vaclav Havel to mark the 30th anniversary of the soviet invasion of his country, or a human rights activist to mark the 50th anniversary of the U.N. Human Rights Charter. While the committee want to honor Carter and could not, with hindsight some regret the prize for other reasons. Four years after Begin win the prize, the Israeli prime minister order an invasion of southern Lebanon in which thousands of civilians died. Kare Kristiansen, who serve on the peace prize committee from 1991 to 1994, once say that, have the committee waited, Begin probably would not have won. There's room for a few more names on a 20th century honor roll of writers, and one will be add this week when the swedish Academy announce the late nobel Literature laureate. Who be choose and why stimulates animate conversation with readers as well as academics, critics and the authors themselves. This year's winner or, possibly, winners will be announce Thursday, the Academy disclose Tuesday. The joke you hear be that it go to people you never hear of, say Ian Jack, editor of london-based Granta literary magazine. But the Nobel, award most every year since 1901, also shin a light, usually deservedly, on wonderful writers few people have read, he added. His favorites include Trinidad-born V.S. Naipaul, though he's convince Naipaul probably won't win because of his dark ... pessimistic and often scathing portrayals of post-colonial African culture. The academy keep its deliberations secret. Who be consider seriously, even who's nominated, isn't disclosed. A writer's nationality, by the terms of the prize founder Alfred Nobel's will, be suppose to be irrelevant. Two can share the prize, though the last time that happen be 1974. Winners be expect to personally receive it: awards be not give posthumously. look at the process from afar, Harold Bloom, a member of the American Academy of Arts and Letters, say the award committee have an unsettling record of selections that be nationally 'correct' and politically 'correct.' The winners list be prestigious, he concedes, but by no means uniformly lustrous. absolutely not! outrageously not, he say in a telephone interview from New York. They include all kinds of fifth-raters. ... James Joyce never get one, for heaven's sake. Neither do Marcel Proust. Bloom's U.S. favorites include Cormac McCarthy, author of Blood Meridian; Philip Roth, author of american Pastoral; and John Ashbery, the best living poet. A review of recent winners may foreshadow this year's laureate. Seven of the past 10 be men do that favor a woman? Two of the past three be poets do that favor a prose writer? Four of the past 10 write in English, and the last three laureates be European. In comparison, only three asian writers have ever won. Bei Dao be a personal favorite of mine, say Abe Harumasa, editor-in-chief of the Japanese literary magazine Bungei. The choice could be interpret as be motivate partly by politics, give the poet's association with China's democracy movement, but it's clear he's a wonderful poet. Minoru Takeuchi, a professor of chinese literature at Japan's prestigious Kyoto University, cite novelists Pa Kin and Xie Bing Xin as worthy. The latter be know for her portrayals of the struggles of chinese women. China, which translate and publish the works of many Nobel winners, desperately want its first laureate, he added. Spain's Nobel hop be pin on Francisco Ayala, 92, winner of this year's renowned Prince of Asturias prize, say Jose Maria Martinez Cachero, an author, university professor and secretary of the jury that select Ayala. other presume latin candidates be Peru-born Mario Vargas Llosa, a member of the 200-year-old Royal Spanish Language Academy, Martinez Cachero said, and Portugal's Jose Saramago, whose works have be translate into more than 20 languages. For his part, Saramago, 75, say in a recent Associated Press interview that he's weary of speculation that this year, once again, he might win. Let's not get into that, he said. I just write. Jose Saramago, a 75-year-old portuguese writer who take up literature relatively late in life and whose richly imaginative novels soon win him a following of loyal readers across Europe and vocal admirers in the United States, be award this year's Nobel Prize in Literature Thursday by the swedish Academy in Stockholm. A tall, bald man whose large, tint glasses often give him a mien of severity, Saramago be the first portuguese-language writer and one of the first card-carrying Communists to become a Nobel Literature laureate. He be also the fourth successive european to win the prize, after Italy's Dario Fo in 1997, Poland's Wislawa Szymborska in 1996 and Ireland's Seamus Heaney in 1995. In its citation Thursday, the swedish Academy praise Saramago who with parables sustain by imagination, compassion and irony continually enable us once again to apprehend an elusory reality. Although Saramago discount the influence of latin american magical realism on his work, his novels often use the supernatural, allegorical, paradoxical and irrational as ways of address complex questions of faith and existence. Many of his novels be set against a backdrop of political or historical events, but it be his unwavering concern for individual fate that give his fiction its distinctive voice and independent character. His best-known books, all publish in the United States, be Baltasar and Blimunda, The year of the Death of Ricardo Reis, The Stone Raft and The History of the Siege of Lisbon. His late book available in English, Blindness, in which all but one of his characters mysteriously become blind, be describe as his symphonic new novel by Andrew Miller in The New York Times Book Review on Sunday. There be no cynicism and there be no conclusions, just a clear-eyed and compassionate acknowledgment of things as they are, a quality than can only honestly be term as wisdom, Miller, himself a novelist, wrote. We should be grateful when it be hand to us in such generous measures. Saramago learn of his award Thursday at Frankfurt airport, where he be prepare to fly home via Madrid to lanzarote in the Canary Islands after attend the Frankfurt Book Fair. Earlier this week, he participate in a round-table of portuguese writers on the topic, Why I be still a Communist. He immediately return to the fair where he be receive with cheers and bouquets of roses. I be personally very happy for myself, he said. I be also happy for my country. later he tell a news conference: The portuguese language have to wait 100 years for this. There have to be ways and means of protect the language so that it do not become a museum, but be something that be alive. The writer's role be to protect it and work with it. The award be also celebrate in Lisbon, where President Jorge Sampaio describe it as recognition of Portuguese culture, while the local Communist leader, Carlos Carvalho, saw it as a credit to his own party. As a member of our party, he note solemnly, Saramago make a great contribution to our ideals and to the struggle for social change. The laureate's fiction, though, be never overtly political. Saramago, whose body of work include poetry, essays, plays and a journal as well as 10 novels, be unusual for have emerge as a major literary figure only at the age of 60. His novels have since be translate into 30 languages, sell particularly well in Portugal, Brazil, Spain, Italy and Germany. While he have not be well know in the United States, his novels have always be critically well receive there. For all his late blooming, though, Saramago long dream of become a writer. Born into a family of rural laborers and raise in Lisbon, he be force by poverty to leave school while a teen-ager and learn the trade of car mechanic. Yet he manage to publish a small novel at the age of 25. Later, he find work at a Lisbon publishing company, but the oppressive and censorial atmosphere of the Salazar dictatorship discourage him from writing. It be only after Portugal's April 1974 revolution that Saramago felt free to find his voice. A member of the Portuguese Communist Party since 1969, he serve as editor of a Lisbon newspaper, Diario de Noticias, during an 18-month period when the left look likely to seize power in Portugal. But an anti-communist backlash in November 1975 force him out of the newspaper and he begin translate french text into portuguese to make ends meet. In the late 1970s, he also turn to novels, publish three in succession in 1977, 1978 and 1980. But it be in 1982, with Baltasar and Blimunda (Memorial do Convento in Portuguese), that he achieve his international breakthrough. This be a rich, multifaceted and polysemous text that at the same time have a historical, a social and an individual perspective, the swedish Academy note Thursday. The insight and wealth of imagination to which it give expression be characteristic of Saramago's work as a whole. Set in 18th-century Portugal during the Inquisition, the book tells of the baroque efforts of a war veteran, Baltasar, and a visionary, Blimunda, to escape to the heavens aboard a fly machine power by human wills capture by the hypersensory Blimunda. This fantastic story take place against the very real background of the tortuous construction of the massive Mafra Convent by thousands of men hold in the grip of the Inquisition. When the novel be publish in the United States in 1987, Irving Howe acclaim it as brilliant in The New York Times Book Review. Mr. Saramago be constantly present as a voice of european skepticism, a connoisseur of ironies, Howe wrote. I think I hear in his prose echoes of Enlightenment sensibility, caustic and shrewd. In his next novel, The year of the Death of Ricardo Reis, which be also a homage to the great portuguese poet Fernando Pessoa, who appear in it as a ghost, Saramago set his story in the early years of the Salazar dictatorship, with the tale follow the romantic and sexual misadventures of a poet-physician. writing in The New York Times, Herbert Mitgang call it a rare, old-fashioned novel at once lyrical, symbolic and meditative. Saramago, whose sense of literary freedom be evident in his unconventional punctuation and conflict use of tenses, seek a different form of freedom in The Stone Raft, where he imagine the confusion unleash when the Iberian peninsula suddenly break free from the rest of Europe and begin drift toward the New World and threaten to collide with the Azores. To the delight of Britons, Gibraltar be leave behind. Unsurprisingly, the bitter satire, The Gospel accord to Jesus Christ, prove controversial, with God show as use the innocently human Jesus to create a religion that have spawn violence and intolerance. When a Lisbon jury pick the book as Portugal's entry for a 1992 european literary prize, the country's conservative government veto the choice as blasphemous. It be then that Saramago decide to leave his small, crowd apartment in Lisbon for the relative solitude of Lanzarote. The History of the Siege of Lisbon, publish in the United States last year, be a whimsical tale set in motion by the decision of a humble proofreader at a publishing house to insert the word not into a key passage in a standard history of Portugal. With this lunatic creative act, as Edmund White put it in The New York Times Book Review, he totally derail the national saga by affirm that the crusaders do not in fact help liberate 12th-century Lisbon from Moorish occupation. White end his July 1997 review with a prescient remark. Word have it that Saramago be overdue for a Nobel Prize, he noted. No candidate have a good claim to last recognition than this novelist. With the recent publication of Blindness in the United States, only Saramago's late novel, Todos os Nomes, or All the Names still await translation into English. In the tradition of Andre Gide and Julian Green, though, he have now embark on his journals. The fourth volume of these Cadernos de Lanzarote be just publish in Lisbon. Saramago will receive his Nobel Prize, worth the equivalent of $967,500 this year, at a ceremony in Stockholm on Dec. 10. Three american pharmacologists be award the Nobel Prize on Monday for their surprising discoveries of how natural production of a gas, nitric oxide, can mediate a wide variety of bodily actions. Those include widen blood vessels, help to regulate blood pressure, initiate erections, battle infections, prevent formation of blood clots and act as a signal molecule in the nervous system. The prize, for physiology or medicine, go to Dr. Robert Furchgott, 82, of the State University of New York in Brooklyn; Dr. Louis Ignarro, 57, of the University of California at Los Angeles, and Dr. Ferid Murad, 62, of the University of Texas Medical School in Houston. The announcement of a significant phase of the discoveries by two of Monday's winners at a meeting in 1986 elicit an avalanche of research activities in many different laboratories around the world, say the Nobel committee at the Karolinska Institute in Stockholm, which make the awards. Its citation say that the research have lead to new treatments for treat heart and lung diseases, shock and impotence. Ignarro discover the principle that lead to the use of Viagra as an anti-impotency drug, say Dr. Sten Orrenius, a professor of toxicology at the Karolinska Institute. Nitric oxide start the process by which blood vessels in the penis widen to produce an erection. Nitric oxide, a chemical relative of the anesthetic gas nitrous oxide, be well know as a common air pollutant form when nitrogen burns, such as in automobile exhaust fumes. But scientists now know it be distribute widely in the body. The discoveries honor on Monday be make largely during the 1980s at a time when scientists know that bacteria produce nitric oxide but do not think it be important in animals and humans. The award committee say that this be the first discovery that a gas can act as a signal molecule in the organism. The discovery be startle because nitric oxide be totally different from any other know signal molecule and so unstable that it be convert to nitrate and nitrite within 10 seconds. Recipients of the Nobel Prize, include some who have lobby for it for years, often profess surprise on learning of their award. This year's winners be refreshingly candid. Furchgott say he have plan to sleep late on Monday, a holiday, but be awaken at 5:30 at his home in Hewlett, N.Y. He say that he know that previous Nobel prize winners have nominate him for the award, but that he still be somewhat surprised to receive it. I guess I have some good friends voting, Furchgott said. He say he could not get back to sleep. Murad say he have ponder the odds and think that maybe I could win the prize, if not now maybe in a couple of years. He describe the award as the culmination of a career and say that when it happens, it's incredible. Ignarro be travel in Italy. Dr. Gerald Levey, the dean of UCLA, say we actually anticipate this day for about four years now. The three 1998 winners never work together, but we talk a lot of shop talk at meetings, Furchgott said. Dr. Valentin Fuster, the president of the American Heart Association and the head of cardiology at Mt. Sinai Hospital in Manhattan, say that the discovery of nitric oxide and its function be one of the most important in the history of cardiovascular medicine. Doctors have learn from the prize-winning research that in heart disease, the endothelium, or inner lining of arteries, make less nitric oxide. Drugs like nitroglycerine, however, can help replenish stores of nitric oxide. Now, drug companies be try to develop more powerful heart drugs base on new knowledge of nitric oxide's role as a signal molecule. Researchers have also learn that nitric oxide produce in the endothelium rapidly spread through cell membranes to the underlying muscle cells in arteries. then it can shut off muscle contractions in the arteries, thus widen them and reduce blood pressure. Inhalation of nitric oxide gas have save the lives of some people with certain lung diseases, particularly infants who have develop dangerously high pulmonary blood pressure. But regulate the amount of nitric oxygen inhale be critical because too much can be lethal. Nitric oxide play a harmful role in the collapse of the circulatory system, or shock, result from overwhelm microbial infections. Bacteria can release products that cause white blood cells to release enormous amounts of nitric oxide. As a result, blood pressure drops. Scientists be try to develop drugs that can block production of nitric oxide in such infections. White blood cells also play a role in attack cancerous cells. The gas can also induce a type of programmed cell death know as apoptosis. Scientists be study nitric oxide's effects on the immune system to stop the growth of cancers. They be also explore nitric oxide's possible role in regulate body temperature. Doctors be measure the production of nitric oxide in the lungs and intestines to diagnose a number of ailments, include asthma and colitis, and be study its role in menstruation. Nitric oxide form in nerve cells spread rapidly in all directions to activate cells in the vicinity and influence many functions, like behavior and the mobility of the intestinal tract. Nitric oxide be also be study for its role in smell and memory. Nitric oxide's role be still unfolding; scientists have write thousands of scientific papers about it in recent years and have start a journal, Nitric Oxide. The Nobel committee cite Furchgott for perform in 1980 an ingenious experiment that show that a drug, acetylcholine, widen blood vessels only if the inner layer, or endothelium, be intact. Furchgott conclude that blood vessels widen because the endothelial cells produce a signal molecule that he call EDRF, for endothelium-derived relaxing factor, which relax smooth muscle cells in blood vessels. Furchgott's findings lead to a quest to identify the factor, the citation said. (optional TRIM CAN BEGIN HERE) The citation do not refer to an accident in Furchgott's laboratory that play a major role in his discoveries. In 1995, in the Annual Review of Pharmacology and Toxicology, Furchgott write that on May 5, 1978, in the first of a series of planned experiments on arteries from a rabbit, a technician do not follow directions correctly. The technician perform one step of the experiment before instead of after he be suppose to wash out a drug use in an early phase of the experiment. Furchgott expect that the arteries would contract. Instead, they relaxed. It be the first time he have see the drugs under study produce such a reaction, and he use the insight to plan additional experiments. Furchgott omit the technician's name in that paper and in another in 1996 in the Journal of the American Medical Association. On Monday, he say David Davidson be the technician. (OPTIONAL TRIM ENDS HERE) The committee cite Ignarro for conclude in 1986, from a brilliant series of analyses conduct independently of Furchgott, that EDRF be identical to nitric oxide. Furchgott say he and Ignarro make the announcement at the same symposium in 1986 at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minn., but the papers be not publish until 1998. Murad be cite for work conduct over the years while he work at the University of Virginia in Charlottesville, Stanford University in Palo Alto, Calif., and Abbott Laboratories in Illinois. Murad say he felt fortunate to have hear Furchgott report his early work on EDRF in 1980. Murad show that a gas could regulate important cellular functions and study how nitroglycerin and related heart drugs lead to the release of nitric oxide. (OPTIONAL TRIM CAN BEGIN HERE) In his early training at Case Western Reserve University in Cleveland, Murad work in the laboratory of Dr. Theodore Rall, who also train another Nobel prize winner, Dr. Alfred Gilman of the University of Texas Southwestern in Dallas. Gilman say in an interview that he believe Rall, now retire and live in Charlottesville, Va., be the first scientist to have train two Nobel Prize winners. In addition, Rall work with Dr. Earl Sutherland, who also win a Nobel Prize. In his early reseach years, Murad work on a chemical know as cyclic guanosine monophosphate, which later turn out to be critical in the nitric oxide story. Murad's trainees refer to the early work as dump experiments because all they could do in the laboratory at the time be crudely add various hormones and agents to slices of tissue, cell cultures. It take years to develop the more refined techniques that lead to the understanding of nitric oxide's many roles in the body. But for many years, most of the scientific community be skeptical of the ability of a free radical like nitric oxide to activate an enzyme, Murad say in 1996 when he and Furchgott share the Albert Lasker basic medical research award. (OPTIONAL TRIM ENDS HERE) The Nobel Prizes be create by the will of Alfred Nobel, whose invention of dynamite involve the use of nitroglycerine. The award committee note an odd twist to this year's award. When Nobel develop chest pain from heart disease, it said, he refuse to take the nitroglycerine his doctor prescribed because he know it cause headache. Nobel dismiss nitroglycerine's benefit in the relief of chest pain. Nobel die in 1896. The prize that the three scientists will share be now worth $938,000. When Alfred Nobel write the directions establish a literature prize in his name, he choose an unclear word and scratch out a few letters. Questions about the prize have engage and pique the literary world ever since. A new chapter in the mystery will be write Thursday, when the swedish Academy announce this year's winner of the world's most prestigious prize for writers. The prize focus intense media attention on the swedish capital and the clamor of journalists generally drown out a question: Why do the world care so much about the literary choices of a handful of people in a quiet and remote country? do the Nobel Prize really recognize the best? When ask that question, Swedish Academy permanent secretary Sture Allen smile and say Look at the list of prizewinners! The answer obscure as much as it clarifies. On one hand, the Nobel Prize have recognize world-renowned writers such as Isaac Bashevis Singer and bring little-known wonders to light, such as Wislawa Szymborska. But the prize arguably also have honor the mediocre, heap attention on those who would have be more fairly serve by obscurity. Among them be the winner of the first prize in 1901, Sully Prudhomme. That choice be denounce by Sweden's lead literary light, August Strindberg, and a group of Swedes send a letter to Leo Tolstoy apologize for the Academy's slight in not choose him. Arguments over the Academy's choices be inevitable, consider the instructions they be given. Nobel's will say the prize should recognize literature that work in an ideal direction. What, exactly, he meant by ideal** be unclear and the Academy's choices have reflect the confusion. The Academy have choose to interpret the word to apply to work range from the good-hearted charm of Szymborska's poetry to the crush hopelessness of Samuel Beckett's writings. When Nobel write the word ideal in swedish idealisk** he superimpose the last couple of letters over previous one. Allen be so curious to understand Nobel's thoughts that he engage a forensic expert to try to find out what the early letters were. The expert succeed to a point. He find that the first word Nobel write be idealirad, a word that doesn't exist. Despite the inclarity around the edges, Allen say he be confident that the Academy's choices bolster Nobel's core idea that literature would be the basis for some kind of progress. About this year's choice, he won't say more than that: the Academy be bind to keep its deliberations secret. But observers love to speculate on who might win, even who's on the shortlist for the prize, this year worth 7.6 million kronor (about dlrs 974,000). Names that freuqently come up in the guessing include V.S. Naipaul, China's Bei Dao and Pa Kin, American poet John Ashbery, and Jose Saramago of Portugal. A day after win the Nobel Prize for literature, portuguese novelist Jose Saramago insist that while he be delight to win the award, it could just as easily have go to many other Portuguese writers. I'm not the only one who deserve it, say the first portuguese-language author to obtain the prestigious award. There have be other Portuguse authors, like Fernando Pessoa, whose work would justify 1,000 Nobels Speaking at a packed press coference in Madrid, Saramago joke about how he hear he have win the prize from German air hostess at Frankfurt airport as he wait for a flight home to Spain's Canary Islands. The news leave the 75-year-old writer no choice but to leave the airport and return to the city's book fair to meet the press and public. At that moment I be over the moon and return to the book fair the only thing I be worry about be that the whole thing be an error, say Saramago. dismiss the Vatican paper's disapproval Thursday of his achievment, Saramago, a know atheist, quip that he be aware that the Pope have be among the jury, I wouldn't have win the prize. The Vatican be easily upset, say Saramago, I think that the Vatican should keep its mind on its prayers and leave people alone. meanwhile in Portugal, where Saramago be schedule to arrive on Tuesday, the delight at the swedish Academy's award for Saramago be reflect in the daily papers, with even the country's three daily sports papers ample space to the event. The two lead dailies, Publico and Diario de Noticias, give over their entire front pages to Saramago. Lisbon City Hall rush out posters say Congratulations Jose Saramago which be hang up around the capital during the night. Saramago be bear into a poor, illiterate family in Azinhaga, a small town near Lisbon. He never finish university but continue to study part-time while support himself as a metalworker. nothing in my life would have lead one to think I'd win the Nobel Prize, say Saramago. I wasn't bear to win the Nobel. I didn't have my own books until I be 18. His first novel, publish in 1947 Terra do Pecado, or Country of Sin be a tale of peasants in moral crisis. For the next 18 years, Saramago, a communist who oppose the 41-year conservative dictatorship of Antonio Salazar, publish only a few travel and poetry books while he work as a journalist. He return to fiction only after Salazar's regime be topple by a military uprising in 1974. Since the 1980s, his works have be translate into more than 20 languages. regard the future, Saramago say the book he be currently work on will be call The Cavern and deals with a modern version of myth of Plato and the cave. Three American researchers on Monday win the Nobel Medicine Prize for discover how nitric oxide acts as a signal molecule in the cardiovascular system, a breakthrough with applications range from hardening of the arteries to impotence. The prestigious prize go to Robert F. Furchgott, Louis J. Ignarro and Ferid Murad. Furchgott be a pharmacologist at the State University of New York in Brooklyn, Ignarro be at University of California-Los Angeles and Murad be at the University of Texas Medical School in Houston. The citation by the Karolinska Institute say it be a senation that the simple, common air pollutant (nitric oxide), which be form when nitrogen burns ... could exert important functions in the organism. Because of the research, we know today that nitric oxide acts as a signal molecule in the nervous system, as a weapon against infections and as a regulator of blood pressure. Signal transmission by a gas that be produce by one cell, penetrate through membranes and regulate the function of another cell represent an entirely new principle, the citation said. Understanding how nitric oxide transmit the signals have spark research on a wide range of new drugs, include those that can be use in the treatment of heart problems, artherosclerosis, shock and impotence. The prize amount of 7.6 million kronor (dlrs 978,000) be divide equally among the three. last year, the prize go to Stanley B. Prusiner of the University of California at San Francisco for his discovery of prions, the rogue proteins identify as cause Mad Cow Disease. Winners generally aren't know outside the medical community, although the list of laureates contain a few familiar names include Ivan Pavlov, tuberculosis pioneer Robert Koch, and DNA researchers Francis Crick and James Watson. Generally, they be researchers who have make discoveries that sound small on paper but carry large consequences. Among other well-known names to receive the prize be David Baltimore, although he share the prize in 1975, long before become one of the world's most visible AIDS researchers. Alan Cormack of the United States and Sir Godfrey Hounsfield may not be familiar names, but what they win the prize for in 1979 be a term know by most patients: computer-assisted tomography or CAT scan. The medicine prize be the second of the six Nobels to be announce this year. last Thursday, the literature prize go to Portuguese novelist Jose Saramago. The physics and chemistry prizes will be announce Tuesday, the economics prize on Wednesday and the peace prize on Friday. All the announcements be in Stockholm, except for the peace prize which be give in Oslo, Norway. The prizes be present on Dec. 10, the anniversary of the death of Alfred Nobel, the industrialist and inventor of dynamite whose will establish the prizes. ","One of those mentioned for the 1998 Nobel Literature Prize was Jose Saramago, Portuguese writer, atheist and Communist.Saramago was weary of hearing again that this year he might win.But this time he did, much to the delight of Portugal, but not to the Vatican.In speculation on the Peace Prize it came out that only a strict deadline rule denied Jimmy Carter the 1978 prize.The 1998 Medicine Prize went to three American pharmacologists, Robert Furchgott, Louis Ignarro and Ferid Murad for their discovery of the role of nitric oxide in the nervous and cardiovascular systems, one of the most important discoveries in the history of cardiovascular medicine.","Announcement of the Nobel Prize awards always generates great interest.The prize for literature has always been one to receive varying responses.Past selections have been praised, questioned, or even written off as politically or nationally ""correct"".This year's winner is 75-year old Jose Saramago, the first Portuguese language writer to win.It is the fourth straight year that a European won.The Peace Prize always receives critical response.Then President Carter would have shared the 1978 Prize with Sadat and Begin, except for a missed deadline.The 1998 Nobel for medicine was awarded to three US researchers for discoveries with nitric oxide.","Jose Saramago is the first Portuguese-language writer and one of few communists to win the Nobel Prize for Literature.He is widely acclaimed for his imaginative allegories.Three American researchers, Robert Furchgott, Louis Ignarro, and Ferid Murad, shared the 1998 Nobel Prize for Medicine for discovering how nitric oxide acts as a signal molecule in the cardiovascular system.Their research led to new treatments for heart and lung diseases, shock, and impotence.The deliberations surrounding the awards are secret; however, Stig Ramel, a former director of the Nobel Foundation, revealed the committee wanted Jimmy Carter to share the 1978 peace prize.","1998's Nobel prize for literature went to a Portuguese for the 1st time, imaginative novelist Jose Saramago, long a candidate.Portugal celebrated but the Vatican called him a communist and anti-religious.The meaning of Nobel's advice to honor ""literature that works in an ideal direction"" is unclear.3 Americans won in medicine for 1980s discoveries concerning nitric oxide's function in the body, which sparked new research.Nobel nominations are secret.Prizes are awarded on Dec. 10th, the day of Nobel's death, all in Stockholm except the Peace prize in Oslo.The 1978 committee wanted to give the Peace Prize to Jimmy Carter but missed its own deadline."
37,"Ariel Sharon's appointment as the Israeli foreign minister serves as the bullet of mercy for the Middle East peace process, an official syrian newspaper say Saturday. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu name Sharon foreign minister on Friday, effectively put the hard-liner in charge of negotiate Israel's final borders with the Palestinians. Many Arabs know Sharon for his role in Israel's 1982 invasion of Lebanon. An Israeli tribunal look into the invasion find him indirectly responsible for the massacre of hundreds of palestinian refugees by christian lebanese militiamen at two Beirut camps. Sharon's appointment as foreign minister be a bullet of mercy to the (peace) process, which have stop on all tracks, say Tishrin, which often speak for the syrian government. syrian-israel peace talks break off more than two years ago. Syria and the previous israeli government have reach an informal agreement on a full withdrawal from the Golan Heights, which Israel capture from Syria in 1967. But Netanyahu's government reject that agreement, say it be never completed. Netanyahu have send a clear message to all those who be delude themselves and bet on Israel (to) change its anti-peace stand to give up their illusions, the paper said. A senior Palestinian negotiator say the success of a peace summit this week near Washington depend on a clear-cut yes from Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to an american initiative. It be time to deliver, Saeb Erekat tell reporters Sunday night after a meeting of the palestinian Cabinet. palestinian leader Yasser Arafat meet Jordan's Crown Prince Hassan in Amman Monday to brief him on talks with U.S. officials on break the deadlock in the negotiations with Israel. Palestinians also be express grow unease over the naming of hawkish former Israeli general Ariel Sharon as Netanyahu's foreign minister. Sharon, whose appointment last week be widely see as a bid to keep far-right allies from topple Netanyahu's government, have be quote as say he would refuse to shake the hand of palestinian leader Yasser Arafat. It's worrisome, Erekat said. Previously, the palestinian leadership have say the appointment be an internal Israeli affair. Monday be a jewish holiday and there be no immediate israeli comment on summit prospects. However, the Israeli newspaper Yediot Aharonot say over the weekend that Netanyahu's hard-line Cabinet, due to meet Tuesday, be balk at agree to an american-authored plan for an israeli pullback in the West Bank. Erekat say the Palestinians hope the four-day summit, set to begin Thursday outside the U.S. capital, would mark the end of a long round of meetings and the start of implementation of accords. It depend on Mr. Netanyahu. If he say `yes' to the American initiative and stop attempts to change the references of the interim agreement, we will reach an agreement in no time, Erekat said. At the table be a U.S plan for an israeli troop withdrawal from 13 percent from the West Bank. The Palestinians accept the plan, which include security conditions they must fulfill.

Ariel Sharon's appointment as the Israeli foreign minister serves as the bullet of mercy for the Middle East peace process, an official syrian newspaper say Saturday.

Netanyahu have send a clear message to all those who be delude themselves and bet on Israel (to) change its anti-peace stand to give up their illusions, the paper said. Lebanon's peace talks with Israel also have be suspend for more than two years pending progress in Syrian-Israeli negotiations. The independent an-nahar newspaper quote lebanese Prime Minister Rafik Hariri as asking, do the israeli government really want peace as it be try to delude the world? In a front page comment, Sahar Baasiri, say The mere announcement that he (sharon) will lead negotiations (with Arabs) be tantamount to disaster. Ariel Sharon, the hawkish former general tip to be Israel's next foreign minister, say in an interview publish Sunday that if he get the job, he won't shake the hand of palestinian leader Yasser Arafat. Sharon, who oppose cede West Bank land to the Palestinians, be be consider for the government's no. 2 post. In it, he would be a pivotal figure in reach a final peace settlement with the Palestinians. even if I will be appoint foreign minister and run the negotiations, I won't shake Yasser Arafat's hand, Sharon be quote as say in the Yediot Ahronot daily. The newspaper say Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu be close to make a decision on the appointment. Netanyahu himself have be act foreign minister since the post be vacate in January by David Levy, a moderate who oppose Netanyahu's hardline negotiate strategy with the Palestinians. Sharon's appointment would signal a toughening of Israel's positions and could far strain relations with Arab neighbors. Sharon be the general who lead Israel's 1982 invasion of Lebanon, and a former housing minister who strengthen jewish settlement in territories Israel capture from Syria, Jordan and Egypt in the 1967 Mideast war. Sharon tell the Haaretz newspaper he would accept the foreign minister's job if he be allow to act to strengthen the country. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu appoint Ariel Sharon, a hawkish former defense minister, to be Israeli foreign minister on Friday in an effort to placate the far right as he move close to turn over more West Bank land to the Palestinians. With his appointment, Sharon, 70, an ardent advocate for jewish settlements in the West Bank, be expect to quell domestic opposition to the concessions that Netanyahu be supposedly prepared to make at a peace summit conference in the Washington area next week. For months, Sharon, who be currently the minister of national infrastructures, have maintain that redeploy israeli troops from more than an additional 9 percent of the West Bank would be a national disaster. In assume the role of foreign minister, however, he would be force to abandon his public opposition to Netanyahu's decision to withdraw from another 13 percent of the palestinian territory even if he vote against the accord. Sharon will be draw directly into the issue, since Netanyahu have appoint him to direct the final status talks with the Palestinians, which would follow the signing of an interim peace agreement. last week Sharon tell an israeli newspaper that, negotiations or not, he would never shake the hand of Yasser Arafat, the Palestinian leader, whom he have long disdained. palestinian leaders and israeli leftists be divide in their reactions, in similar ways. Some profess to be aghast, and some, like Nabil Sha'ath, the palestinian transportation minister, say they be willing to forget history if Sharon's appointment provide Netanyahu the political backbone to sign a deal. In Washington, White House and State Department officials pledge to work closely with Sharon and emphasize that the personnel in an israeli government be an internal affair. Arik Sharon be the most fitting person in the state of Israel for the position of foreign minister, Netanyahu said, use his nickname. He bring with him rich experience, creativity, proven work ability and I think that he well know both the wounds and damages of war as well as the fruits of peace. Sharon have never hide his beliefs, he continued, and his words have influence the way that the redeployment will be carry out if not its extent. In a nod to Sharon, Netanyahu have decide on a new location for the nature reserve that would constitute 3 percent of the West Bank land. It be suppose to be in the Judean desert near Israel's eastern border, which Sharon argue would pose a strategic security risk. Instead, it be decide on Thursday that the nature reserve would instead be on the slopes of the Hebron hills, much closer to exist jewish settlements. many Israeli political observers believe that Netanyahu have eviscerate his right-wing opposition with this appointment, signal that he genuinely intend to bring home a peace agreement. Who be the right wing now if Sharon be in the foreign ministry and negotiate with the Palestinians? ask Uzi Benziman, an editorial board member of the newspaper Haaretz and author of a critical biography of Sharon. It will be just the settlers and some real hard-liners who don't comprise more than 15 percent of public opinion. so it's really quite an intelligent move, suggest that Netanyahu mean business in try to get an agreement. But the Palestinians take the news hard, and read it differently. I think it's a clear-cut message from Bibi, Saeb Erekat, a lead negotiator for the Palestinians, said, use Netanyahu's nickname. I imagine people will try to explain Netanyahu's intentions as try to get the support of the right. What he be try to do be make peace with the right wing at the expense of make peace with us. It mean he want to continue on the path of non-negotiations, because he want to continue to be prime minister at any cost. Sharon decline to be interview Friday because his appointment must still be approve by the Cabinet on Tuesday, an approval that be expected. An aide, Raanan Gisin, say Sharon accept the position so that he could stem the tide of dangerous developments and contribute to fight the risks face Israel. A retired general who fight in every Israeli war, Sharon, 70, be a leading figure of the Likud Party who have do much battle with the Likud prime minister. At the most recent party convention, he say that Netanyahu didn't know his right hand from his left, which the prime minister dismiss Friday as a comment make in the height of political arguments. And when Netanyahu first form his Cabinet in 1996, the fact that he do not give Sharon a senior position cause an 11th-hour crisis before the swearing-in ceremony. Sharon retreat to his family farm in the Negev, and David Levy, who have be name foreign minister, say he would not serve unless Sharon be give a post. Netanyahu then create a Cabinet job, the minister of infrastructures, especially for Sharon. Levy resign in January after a lengthy power struggle with the prime minister, and since then Netanyahu have be serve as his own foreign minister. Sharon, a member of the old guard, have a complicate political past, highlight by a string of military victories, and checkered, to many, by his indirect role, as defense minister, in the lebanese Christian Phalangist massacre of unarmed civilians in the Sabra and Shatila refugee camps in Lebanon in 1982. many Israelis, even those who despise his politics, see him as a strong, experienced figure who know his mind and who be capable of be moderate when he have power. Friday afternoon, the right-wing political establishment nearly universally applaud the appointment. Uzi Landau, who be a Likud hard-liner, say he be relieve to hear confirm what have be a rumor for weeks. I feel more safe about the negotiations if Minister Sharon be directly involved, say Landau, who head the Parliament's security and foreign affairs committee. Undoubtedly it will facilitate the situation for the prime minister to show the right that Arik Sharon be identify with the program, so therefore they can live with it. Right before the announcement be made, leaders of the National Religious Party, who have threaten to bring down the government, change their combative tone. They emerge mollify from meetings with Netanyahu late Thursday, say they would leave the government intact. Still, they would not connect their change of heart to the nomination of Sharon. Appointing Sharon be a political step we like very much, say Shaul Yahalom, the minister of transportation and a leader of the National Religious Party. But it will have no effect on how we see the peace agreement. Our concern there be on whether any of the 160 jewish settlements be endangered. The appointment of Sharon come against a backdrop of violence that have erupt this week. Friday, a 19-year-old Israeli soldier, Michal Adato, be stab to death by a palestinian man as she get off a bus in her hometown, the settlement of Tomer in the Jordan Valley. Netanyahu report that he have receive a sympathy note from Arafat, who condemn the attack. also Friday, in the continue clashes between palestinian youths and soldiers in the divided city of Hebron, 32 Palestinians be lightly injure by rubber bullets after the funeral of a palestinian protester shoot dead on Thursday. After Netanyahu make the announcement Friday, an Israeli reporter introduce a question by state that Netanyahu have diminish the political threat from the right wing by appoint Sharon. Are you willing to sign on that? Netanyahu said. I do not know that. I do know one thing that when you be dependent on the vote of one or two people you can never know what will be. He be refer to his razor-thin majority in parliament which some analysts perceive to be his key motivator in appoint Sharon. more than anything else, this reflect the political weakness of Netanyahu, say Yaron Ezrahi, a lead intellectual and critic of the prime minister. He have recognize that the next redeployment be inevitable if he doesn't want to be see as contribute to the wave of political violence that would follow a failure. But he doesn't have the domestic political power to carry out the big decision on his own. The New York Times say in an editorial on Saturday, Oct. 10: Just days before head to the United States for critical negotiations with palestinian leaders, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu jolt the Middle East peace effort with the appointment of Ariel Sharon as Israeli foreign minister. The most optimistic reading be that Sharon, long an implacable foe of the Palestinians, be prepared to make peace with them and then sell it to the Israelis who be most opposed. Unfortunately, he be also capable of wreck the entire peace effort. Much will depend on whether Netanyahu can control his strong-willed aide, a goal that have elude other Israeli leaders. Like a political typhoon, Sharon have roar across Israeli life for good than three decades as a brilliant military commander, a reckless defense minister and an ardent conservative, often leave destruction in his wake. He still bear the burden of his role in the massacre of hundreds of Palestinians by christian militiamen in Lebanon in 1982. An Israeli inquiry find he be indirectly responsible for the killings at the Sabra and Shatila refugee camps. As a leader of the most conservative wing of the Likud party, Sharon can help Netanyahu hold together his shaky Cabinet during potentially decisive negotiations with Yasser Arafat, the Palestinian leader. That will be fine if Sharon be willing to play a constructive role in the peace talks himself. But such behavior be not likely to be the first impulse of a man who have famously say he would never shake hands with Arafat. Since Netanyahu have designate Sharon as his chief negotiator, the new foreign minister will soon have the opportunity to act more responsibly. The first order of business when the two sides get together next week outside Washington be to wrap up negotiations over the further withdrawal of israeli forces from the West Bank couple with security guarantees from the Palestinians. Sharon can show statesmanship by help Netanyahu close this deal, even though it be oppose by the Israeli settlers whose cause Sharon have long championed. Success in these talks would clear the way for the last and most difficult negotiations about a permanent settlement, include the shape and status of a palestinian state and the future of Jerusalem. If Sharon ever hop to overcome the shame of Sabra and Shatila, he must become a force for peace in the Middle East. Brief biography of Ariel Sharon, name Israel's foreign minister: 1928: Born in Kfar Mallal in British-ruled Palestine. 1948 Mideast war: Fights as junior officer, wound three times. 1953: Forms elite commando unit 101 and lead it on raids against palestinian guerrillas who have be attack israeli border villages. 1956 Sinai campaign: command a parachute brigade that be drop behind enemy lines, capture a key pas and cuts off egyptian army's retreat. 1967 Mideast war: Commands an armored division that break through into central Sinai Peninsula. 1973 Mideast war: command a division that cross the Suez Canal, turn the tide of the war on the egyptian front. 1977: elect to parliament and appoint minister of agriculture in the government of Menachem Begin. 1981: Defense minister in Begin government. 1982-83: Invades Lebanon in June 1982 to drive out PLO guerrillas, but be hold indirectly responsible for lebanese Christian militiamen's September 1982 massacre of hundreds of palestinian civilians in the Sabra and Shatilla refugee camps south of Beirut. As a result, Sharon resign as defense minister and hold only second-rank posts for next 15 years. 1984-90: Serves as trade minister in national unity government head by Yitzhak Shamir of Likud and Shimon Peres of Labor. 1990-92: Serves as housing minister, preside over settlement drive in the West Bank and Gaza Strip. 1996: Named infrastructure minister in Netanyahu government. Oct. 9, 1998: Netanyahu appoints him foreign minister, places him in charge of negotiations with the Palestinians, mark his return to the center of Israeli politics and world political arena. Ariel Sharon's appointment as the Israeli foreign minister serves as the bullet of mercy for the Middle East peace process, an official syrian newspaper say Saturday. In Beirut, Lebanese newspapers denounce the appointment as a disaster for peace. many Arabs know Sharon for his role in Israel's 1982 invasion of Lebanon. An Israeli tribunal look into the invasion find him indirectly responsible for the massacre of hundreds of palestinian refugees by pro-israeli Christian Lebanese militiamen at two Beirut camps. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu name Sharon foreign minister on Friday, effectively put the hard-liner in charge of negotiate Israel's final borders with the Palestinians. The appointment be a bullet of mercy to the (peace) process, which have stop on all tracks, say Tishrin newspaper, which often speak for the syrian government. It say Netanyahu have send a clear message to all those who be delude themselves into think that Israel will change its anti-peace stand. syrian-israeli peace talks break off more than two years ago. Syria and the previous israeli government have reach an informal agreement on a full withdrawal from the Golan Heights, which Israel capture from Syria in 1967. But Netanyahu's government reject that agreement, say it be never completed. Lebanon's peace talks with Israel also have be suspend for more than two years pending progress in Syrian-Israeli negotiations. The independent an-nahar newspaper quote lebanese Prime Minister Rafik Hariri as saying: Sharon's appointment make Lebanon and most world states ask: do the israeli government really want peace as it be try to delude the world? An-Nahar's columnist, Sahar Baasiri, say in a front-page comment: `the mere announcement that he (sharon) will lead negotiations (with Arabs) be tantamount to disaster. The man be a hero of Arab defeats; he be the firm believer in the expansion of the land of Israel and in resolve the palestinian problem at the expense of Jordan. He be a liar, Baasiri wrote. The conservative Ad-Diyar newspaper say in a front-page comment: The history of Ariel Sharon be known. He have call for burn Beirut, annex the Golan, occupy the (West) Bank and slaughter and displace the Arabs everywhere. Ariel Sharon have a law degree, and fancies himself a farmer. But for more than three decades his role in Israeli public life have be that of an unapologetic warrior, first on the battlefield and later in the bare-knuckled combat of domestic partisan politics. With his blunt tongue, barrel chest and bar-scrapper's demeanor, Sharon at 70 be to his many critics here a caricature of right-wing intransigence. To his equally numerous admirers he be a living symbol of unrelenting dedication to Israel's national survival. still convey physical vigor within an impressively expand frame, he remain pugnacious to a fault. Both his friends and foes would agree that the new foreign minister be not a natural diplomat. A Zionist underground operative as a teen-ager and an infantry commander wound in the 1948 war of independence, Sharon have fought, and fight memorably, in virtually every major military engagement in his country's history. He command the legendary armored division that cross and seize control of the Sinai in the 1967 arab-israeli war. He return to active service after a three-month retirement to lead Israel's badly outgunned armored divisions to victory, again in the Sinai, in the war of 1973. As defense minister in 982, Sharon lead Israel's invasion of Lebanon, defy international condemnation with unrelenting artillery assaults on Beirut neighborhoods and palestinian refugee camps believe by the Israeli high command to be Palestine Liberation Organization redoubts. To some, both in Israel and abroad, Sharon's Lebanese incursion will forever be associate with the massacres by lebanese Christian Phalangists, allies of the Israelis, of a report 460 unarmed Palestinians in the Sabra and Shatila refugee camps. In an official inquiry in Jerusalem and in a subsequent libel trial he bring in New York, Sharon be see to have effectively refute charges that he know of and condone the Phalangists' attacks beforehand. But the government investigate commission hold that his failure to prevent the killings constitute grounds for his dismissal from the Defense Ministry. Since the 1982 invasion, Israel have be mire in an unpopular open-ended occupation of southern Lebanon, an operation with constant casualties among young inductees for which Sharon be still often blamed. To many Israelis, however, the lebanese incursion be ultimately a risk worth taking, as it succeed in crush the PLO militarily and drive its forces far from Israel's borders. The PLO's defeat at Sharon's hands in Lebanon lead eventually to its renunciation of armed warfare against Israel and embrace of the peace negotiation process for which Sharon as Foreign Minister will now be responsible. In civilian life he prove as savvy a political operator as he be a military strategist, help to break Labor's hold on the Knesset and make himself an indispensable binding force within successive fractious Likud coalitions. His investiture as foreign minister next week will mark his sixth Cabinet appointment in 21 years. He previously hold the agriculture and defense portfolios under Prime Minister Menachem Begin, trade and housing in Yitzhak Shamir's government, and national infrastructure essentially, a settlements support directorate in the administration of Benjamin Netanyahu. As a key member of the inner cabinet in Begin's first government, Sharon begin the construction and systematic expansion of new Israeli housing developments throughout the West Bank, Gaza Strip and Galilee area territories occupy by Israel since 1967, a policy that he and his opponents alike would agree remain his signal domestic political achievement. At 70, Sharon remain one of the great polarizing fixtures of Israeli political life. An acerbic critic of the other lead soldier-politician of his generation, Yitzhak Rabin, Sharon attack the Oslo peace accords as terrible and dangerous and condemn Rabin's negotiate partner, Yasser Arafat, as a war criminal. He angrily oppose any diplomatic discussions of the return of even an internationally demilitarized Golan Heights to syria. A secular Jew in the manner typical of his generation of native-born Israelis, Sharon become an outspoken and effective defender of new Orthodox jewish settlements in the predominantly palestinian areas of the West Bank, cement his position as a bridge between the traditional secular right and the new militant religious factions within the Likud coalition. ","Ariel Sharon was named Israeli foreign minister just weeks before a scheduled peace summit in the US, aimed at negotiating an Israeli withdrawal from 13% of the West Bank.Arabs reacted strongly and said the hard-line, right-wing, warrior and former defense minister would kill any progress for a settlement in the mid-East.Many blame Sharon for a 1982 massacre of Palestinian civilians at refugee camps in Lebanon.Others believed his appointment was an effort to placate the far right and gain their support for the Netanyahu government and the concessions necessary for the peace process.Sharon vowed not to shake Yasser Arafat's hand.","Prior to his appointment as foreign minister by Israeli Prime Minister Natanyahu in 1998, seasoned warrior Ariel Sharon announced that if appointed, he would not shake hands with Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat.The remark fit Sharon's long history of unyielding bellicosity towards Palestine.When he was appointed some thought that Netanyahu was placating Israel's far right wing while striving for peace.Others saw it as a move to scuttle the peace effort.Arab commentary deemed the appointment ""tantamount to disaster"" and ""the bullet of mercy"" to the peace process.Peace talks in the U.S. were in the offing with the outcome in doubt.","Appointment of Ariel Sharon as Foreign Minister by PM Netanyahu does not bode well for the peace process.His appointment is surprising in that the two have differed on withdrawal from Palestinian territory and is seen as an effort to placate the right.Sharon, 70, is an unapologetic warrior on the battlefield and in partisan politics.He brings heavy baggage: right-wing intransigence and responsibility for failing to prevent the killings of 460 unarmed Palestinians in refugee camps during the Lebanon incursion.Sharon has said that he will not shake Arafat's hand and his appointment is seen as a ""bullet of mercy"" for the Middle East peace process.","In a move widely viewed as an effort to placate the far right as he moves to withdraw from more West Bank land, Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu named hardliner Ariel Sharon foreign minister and chief peace negotiator.Sharon, a military leader with legendary victories in the 1967 and 1973 Mideast wars, is infamous in the Arab world as the defense minister in the 1982 invasion of Lebanon during which Lebanese Christian militiamen, Israeli allies, slaughtered hundreds of unarmed Palestinians.His appointment as lead negotiator was denounced as a ""disaster"" in the Lebanese press and ""a bullet of mercy to the peace process"" in a Syrian paper."
38,"follow be the text of the rules on gifts and benefits that be in force during the bidding for the 2002 Winter Olympics: The finalist cities as well as third parties act for them or on their behalf or in their favor, be forbid to give IOC members as well as their blood relations, relatives by marriage, guests or companions any presents, liberalities or direct or indirect benefits other than souvenirs ot small presents of a total value which shall in no case exceed U.S. dlrs 150 per person. Finalist cities and any third parties act for them or on their behalf or in their favor be forbid to conclude with IOC members, their relations, relatives by marriage, their guests or companions, agreements, transactions or any other contracts. In the event of a serious breach of the present regulations, the IOC executive board may far propose to the IOC session that it exclude the city have breach the regulation from the contest for the games. Swiss IOC executive board member Marc Hodler say Sunday he might be throw out of the International Olympic Committee for make allegations of corruption within the Olympic movement. ask whether he might resign, Hodler said, No, I don't resign. But maybe I will be expelled. You never know. Hodler, who make the allegations Saturday, say he have since be muzzle by IOC president Juan Antonio Samaranch. His comments come as the leader of the Salt Lake organize committee apologize Sunday for the allege rules violations during the city's successful bid for the 2002 Winter Games. The IOC, meanwhile, say it be prepare to investigate allegations make by Hodler of bribery in the selection of Olympic host cities. Frank Joklik, 4th graf pvs A top IOC official on Saturday make explosive allegations of widespread Olympic corruption, say agents demand up to dlrs 1 million to deliver votes in the selection of host cities. Marc Hodler, a senior member of the International Olympic Committee executive board, allege malpractices in the voting for the 1996 Atlanta Games, 2000 Sydney Olympics and 2002 Salt Lake Games. Hodler say a group of four agents, include one IOC member, have be involve in promising votes for payment. He decline to identify them. The four agents try to make a live out of this, he said. I miss a chance to be a rich man. Some of the agents do the following: they say, `I can offer this or that number of votes.' The price wold be between dlrs 500,000 and dlrs 1 million for a number of votes, a bloc. Hodler add that the agents then charge the city win the bid something like dlrs 3 million to dlrs 5 millon. Hodler, an 80-year-old swiss lawyer, say there be one agent who boast that no city have ever win the Olympic Games without his help. No one can prove that, Hodler said. IOC president Juan Antonio Samaranch immediately disassociate himself from Hodler's allegations. The only official spokeman for the IOC executive board be (director general) Francois Carrard, Samaranch said. All the other comments be personal comments. They be not official comments. Hodler's allegations, make to a group of reporters, come as the IOC continue investigations into alleged financial misconduct by the Salt Lake City group which win the bid for the 2002 games. Hodler have describe as a bribe the dlrs 500,000 scholarship fund set up by Salt Lake which benefit the relatives of six IOC members. It also come as the former minister in charge of Sydney's 2000 Olympic bid reveal he be ask to offer bribes in exchange for votes. Bruce Baird, the former New South Wales minister, say he refused. ask whether Atlanta's victory in the vote for the 1996 games be clean, Hodler said, Certainly not.' ask whether Sydney's election be clean, he said, I would be surprised. I know what happen but I don't want to disclose it. I can't imagine that Sydney be different from the others, he said. Sydney pretends it be completely clean, clean, clean. Hodler contest the argument by the current Salt Lake organize committee that it be not directly involve in the controversial scholarship program and that the onus be on former bid chief Thomas Welch. yesterday the lawyer of Salt Lake City said, `everything have be do by Tom Welch, who be not there any more. We know nothing.' My experience be that this be not true. The controversy centers on scholarships include tuition assistance and athlete training programs pay to relatives of IOC members by the Salt Lake bid committee. From 1991 to 1995, the committee under the direction of Welch spend nearly dlrs 400,000 on scholarships to 13 individuals six of them relatives of IOC members, mostly from Africa. The current SLOC president, Frank Joklik, be chairman of the bid committee at the time. SLOC vice president Dave Johnson be also a high official on the bid committee. The mayor of the japanese city of Nagano, site of the 1998 Winter Olympics, deny allegations that city officials bribe members of the International Olympic Committee to win the right to host the games. Nagano Mayor Tasuku Tsukada be respond to allegations by Marc Hodler, the swiss member of the IOC executive board, of systematic buying and selling of the Olympic Games. I have never hear of such a thing, Tsukada tell the Associated Press Sunday. As far as Nagano be concerned, we haven't do anything wrong. We be select as host of the Olympics through our efforts. We can't believe that Mr. Hodler have make such a statement, he said. Tsukada be vice chairman of the japanese committee to invite the Olympics to Nagano. Nagano have be criticize for spend a large amount of money to win the games. Sports Nippon, a lead japanese sports newspaper, say more than 2 billion yen (dlrs 17 million) of the money Nagano spent to bring the games there have not be account for. Japan Olympic Committee have warn cities seek to host the games in the future that they should not entertain IOC members excessively, the newspaper said. Holder's accusation might effect the invitation activities for the 2008 summer Olympics by Osaka, Japan's second large city, the paper said. Osaka be compete with Beijing, China and other cities for the right to host the games. Nagano become the first asian city to host the Winter Games since Sapporo, Japan play host to the 1972 games. Eighty-eight IOC members take part in a secret vote in 1991 to decide who would host the 1998 games. Nagano lead in each of the five rounds, beat out Salt Lake city 46 votes to 42 in the final ballot. What start as a local controversy in Salt Lake City have evolve into a full-blown international scandal. The International Olympic Committee have order a top-level investigation into the payment of nearly dlrs 400,000 in scholarships to relatives of IOC members by the Salt Lake group which win the bid for the 2002 Winter Games. IOC executive board member Marc Hodler say the scholarship fund describe as humanitarian aid by Salt Lake officials amount to a bribe. I'm terribly sorry that even Salt Lake City by far the best place to hold the winter games have to use certain methods in order to get the vote, Hodler said. IOC president Juan Antonio Samaranch assign the international body's juridical commission which deal with legal and ethical issues to investigate. The inquiry will be head by IOC vice president Keba Mbaye of Senegal, a highly respect former World Court judge. The scholarship fund be first disclose two weeks ago by a Salt Lake radio station. The controversy be now bind to overshadow the routine progress report which the Salt Lake Olympic Committee (SLOC) be schedule to make to the IOC executive board this weekend. SLOC president Frank Joklik, who arrive in Lausanne Friday, welcome the IOC investigation. I think that's who the matter should be take up by, he tell The Associated Press. Of course, we intend to collaborate fully with the IOC and its investigation. Joklik express concern that the case have harm Salt Lake's image. I appreciate the perception of this matter be bad now, he said. ask about Hodler's accusation of bribery, Joklik say he hadn't see the remarks yet and couldn't reply directly. But he seek to distance himself from the allegations by make a distinction between the actions of the bidding committee and the current organizing committee. Presumably (Hodler's) remarks be relate to actions of the bid commitee before 1995, Joklik said. The organize committee certainly have people of integrity and ethical standards that would stand any investigation. The facts be in the early 1990s when the bid committee be operating. U.S. Olympic Committee deputy secretary general John Krimsky describe the controversy as disruptive for Salt Lake's image and preparations for the games. It doesn't do us any good at all, he said. I hope we see a speedy resolution to Judge Mbaye's review. I hope it will be a footnote. I hope it never become a chapter. Salt Lake organizers, 10th graf pvs LAUSANNE, Switzerland (AP) IOC president Juan Antonio Samaranch on Sunday promise to expel any members if they be find guilty of accept bribes. Samaranch say he be surprise at the allegations of corruption in the International Olympic Committee make by senior swiss member Marc Hodler. But he say the allegations would be consider by a special IOC panel look into allege rules violations by the Salt Lake group which win the 2002 Winter Games. If it be necessary, we will expel members if this commission feel these members be guilty, Samaranch say at a news conference. After we get the recommendations of the panel, we will take the measures necessary to arrange the problem. Samaranch say the IOC be intent on protect the integrity of the organization and the Olympics as a whole. If we have to clean, we will clean, he said. After, the IOC will be even strong than before. Samaranch say he be take aback by Hodler's allegations, which be make to reporters Saturday. Samaranch say Hodler should have bring his allegations first to the IOC executive board. For me, I be really surprised. If he have names and evidence, he must go to the executive board. Hodler say he believe four agents include one IOC member have be involve in vote-buying over the past 10 years. He say he think 5 to 7 percent of the IOC members currently number 115 be open to bribery. Samaranch deny that he muzzle Hodler, as the Swiss official claim earlier Sunday. He say he have tell all members of the executive board that only himself and director general Francois Carrad could speak to the media. This be not the first time I do this, he said. samaranch express his respect and admiration for Hodler and rule out the possbility of expel him from the IOC, an option the swiss member have raised. Never, never, be anyone think to expel Mr. Hodler, Samaranch said. The IOC also rule out any possibility of strip Salt Lake City of the games over alleged rules violations during the bid. No, there be not any kind of possibiity, he said. We trust the organize committee of Salt Lake City. The Salt Lake controvery centers on a scholarship program that provide nearly dlrs 400,000 in tuition and other assistance to 13 individuals include six relatives of IOC members, mostly from Africa. Samaranch say the IOC would possibly consider a new procedure to eliminate the tempations for corruption in the selection of host cities. Under current rules, all IOC members have a vote. Samaranch note the IOC could adopt the formula use by sports federations such as FIFA, world soccer's govern body, which assign their executive boards to select sites. say if we have to clean, we will clean, Juan Antonio Samaranch respond on Sunday to allegations of corruption in the Olympic bidding process by declare that IOC members who be find to have accept bribes from candidate cities could be expelled. It be a serious problem we have before us, Samaranch, president of the International Olympic Committee, say in a hastily arrange news conference at a tumultuous meeting of the IOC executive board. Samaranch compare the current climate to the Soviet boycott of the 1984 Olympics in Los Angeles and the sprinter Ben Johnson's expulsion from the 1988 Olympics in Seoul, South Korea. Those be difficult moments, Samaranch said. now we be face another difficult moment, but I'm sure we will solve this problem. Samaranch express surprise at allegations make by the IOC executive board member Marc Hodler of Switzerland that agents be offer to sell I.O.C. members' votes for payments from bid cities. Hodler, the second most senior member of the IOC, say Saturday that he know of four agents, include one IOC member, who engage in such activities. Hodler say he believe that 5 to 7 percent of the IOC membership, which currently numbers 115, ask for some sort of compensation for their vote. He have call for a new electoral process, in which the executive board or some other select IOC group would decide which cities become Olympic hosts instead of the full IOC membership. Samaranch agree Sunday that the time have come to explore change. The system we have now be very complicated, very slow and very expensive, he said. Hodler, the former head of the International Ski Federation, also claim that the Fiat tycoon Gianni Agnelli have give free vans to influence votes for the italian resort of Sestriere to hold the 1997 world ski championships. Fiat deny the claims on Saturday, but Sunday Howard Peterson, a former senior american delegate to the ski federation, say he have be offer cars by two Fiat executives. The issue of vote-buying come to the fore in Lausanne because of the recent disclosure of scholarship payments make to six relatives of IOC members by Salt Lake City officials during their successful bid to play host to the 2002 Winter Games. The Salt Lake Organizing Committee have say the payments, which amount to slightly less than $400,000, come from a privately finance fund that be start in 1991. And Intermountain Health Care, Utah's large health care provider, confirm Sunday that it give free surgical services to at least two people associate with the IOC in 1994. A special commission head by the IOC vice president Dick Pound be appoint on Friday to investigate the issue and have meet with Salt Lake officials. Sunday, Frank Joklik, president of the Salt Lake Organizing Committee, issue a public apology to the Olympic family and the citizens of Utah for the embarrassment cause by the scholarships program. samaranch Sunday rule out take the Games from Salt Lake City. He said, If necessary we will expel members if this ad hoc commission think these members be guilty. Pound say his commission be already satisfied Salt Lake City win the 2002 Games on the merit of the bid. He also say that his commission would expand its inquiry beyond the Salt Lake City bid only if it be present with evidence and not simply rumors of corruption in other bids. On Saturday, Hodler have suggest the bidding teams from Atlanta and Nagano, Japan, that win the 1996 Summer Olympics and 1998 Winter Olympics have not run clean campaigns. Billy Payne, who preside over Atlanta's bid, and Makoto Kobayashi, the general secretary of the Nagano organize committee, deny those claims. ask whether he regret his statements Sunday, Hodler said, not at all and later say that the cities have be the victims and not the villains. Pound say there have be concern in the IOC for some time about agents. There always have be lobbyists, he said. In recent years, especially with the Olympics come up every two years, there seem to be a professional class be created. Hodler, when press for further comment this afternoon at Olympic headquarters, initially cover his mouth with both hands and then said, Muzzle impose by the president. Hodler, 80, be one of only four IOC members with life membership because he be appoint before age limits be impose in 1966. Asked if he might resign he said, I'm not go to resign, but I might be expelled. But the 78-year-old samaranch say he have great respect for Hodler and no intention of ask for his resignation or push for his expulsion. move quickly to tackle an escalate corruption scandal, IOC leaders question Salt Lake City officials Friday in the first ever investigation into allege vote-buying by an Olympic city. act with unusual speed, the International Olympic Committee set up a special investigative panel that immediately summon the organizers of the 2002 Salt Lake Games to address the bribery allegations. The chief investigator refuse to rule out the possibility of take the games away from Salt Lake City though that scenario be consider highly unlikely. Frank Joklik, president of the Salt Lake Organizing Committee, and SLOC senior vice president Dave Johnson appear before the IOC panel for 90 minutes Friday night. Both sides decline to comment after the talks, say the inquiry be still in process. Earlier, Joklik meet with IOC president Juan Antonio Samaranch and other top officials to provide information and documents on the case. The controversy centers on the payment of nearly dlrs 400,000 in scholarships to relatives of IOC members by the Salt Lake bid committee which win the right to stage the 2002 games. Senior IOC executive board member Marc Hodler say the scholarship fund describe as humanitarian aid by Salt Lake officials amount to a bribe to sway votes in the 1995 election. It's the most serious case of alleged ethical misconduct investigate by the IOC since former U.S. member Robert Helmick be accuse of conflict of interest in 1991. Helmick eventually resign both as an IOC member and as president of the U.S. Olympic Committee. This be the first time the IOC have ever investigate possible bribery by bid cities, despite previous rumors and allegations of corruption in other Olympic votes. The executive board take this matter very seriously, say Dick Pound, the IOC vice president head the Salt Lake inquiry. Despite many requests make in the past or evidence to support rumors that have be float around, we have never have anything come forward. specific allegations have now be made. The executive board act very quickly to investigate. also on the investigative panel be IOC vice president Keba Mbaye, executive board members Jacques Rogge and Thomas Bach, and IOC director general Francois Carrard. Pound say the panel would investigate allegations that there may or may not have be payments for the benefit of members of the IOC or their families connect with the Salt Lake City bid. Pound, a Canadian lawyer, say there be no deadline for completion of the investigation but say it be possible the inquiry could be wrap up this weekend. Pound decline to speculate on what if any sanctions could be take against Salt Lake but do not rule out move the games elsewhere. We're not go to make any conclusions or any speculations as to what we may decide until we know what the facts are, he said. move the games would be unprecedented and, with just over three years to go, would be a logistical nightmare. most of the facilities need for the games in Salt Lake already be built. John Krimsky, deputy secretary general of the U.S. Olympic Committee, discount any possibility of the games be moved. There be no chance at all, absolutely none in my mind, he said. I can't be strong in say I don't consider it a possibility whatsoever of the games be withdrawn from Salt Lake City. Salt Lake organizers have deny that the bid committee's dlrs 500,000 project be an effort to buy key IOC members' support in the four years between votes on the 1998 and 2002 Winter Games. Salt Lake lose the '98 race to Nagano, Japan, in 1991, when the program be begun. It win a landslide vote over Sion, Switzerland, for the 2002 Games in the 1995 balloting. From 1991 to 1995, the bid committee under the direction of former president Thomas Welch spend nearly dlrs 400,000 on scholarships to 13 individuals six of them relatives of IOC members, mostly from Africa. Olympic rules prohibit bid cities from give IOC members or their relatives any presents or benefits exceed a value of dlrs 150. I've already state I do not regard what be do as a bribe, Joklik say Friday. I recognize there have be perceptions contrary to that. I regret those perceptions, but I don't feel they be justified. Joklik be chairman of the bid committee at the time, the no. 2 official behind Welch. Welch resign last year as president of the organize committee after be accuse of domestic violence against his wife. He currently serve as a SLOC consultant. The organize committee certainly have people of integrity and ethical standards that would stand any investigation, Joklik said. The facts be in the early 1990s when the bid committee be operating. Among those identify as receive scholarship funds be Sonia Essomba, the daughter of the late Rene Essomba of Cameroon. The elder Essomba, a prominent surgeon, be the secretary general of the National Olympic Committees of Africa. A top IOC official on Saturday make explosive allegations of widespread Olympic corruption, say agents demand up to dlrs 1 million to deliver votes in the selection of host cities. Marc Hodler, a senior member of the International Olympic Committee executive board, allege malpractices in the bid campaigns for the games of 1996, 1998, 2000 and 2002. Hodler say a group of four agents, include one IOC member, have be involve in promising votes for payment. He decline to identify them. The four agents try to make a live out of this, he said. I miss a chance to be a rich man. Some of the agents do the following: they say, `I can offer this or that number of votes.' The price would be between dlrs 500,000 and dlrs 1 million for a number of votes, a bloc. Hodler add that the agents then charge the city win the bid something like dlrs 3 million to dlrs 5 millon. Hodler, an 80-year-old swiss lawyer, say there be one agent who boast that no city have ever win the Olympic Games without his help. No one can prove that, Hodler said. It could be possible. He say he believe agents have be buy and sell votes for the past 10 years. There be four agents we know, he said. One be an IOC member. He promise he will give enough votes so (the biddding city) can win. Asked whether all Olympic votes be tainted, Hodler said, I know of so many times. There be a good chance it be always the case. IOC president Juan Antonio Samaranch immediately disassociate himself from Hodler's allegations. The only official spokeman for the IOC executive board be (director general) Francois Carrard, Samaranch said. All the other comments be personal comments. They be not official comments. Hodler's allegations, make to a group of reporters, come as the IOC continue investigations into alleged financial misconduct by the Salt Lake City group which win the bid for the 2002 games. Hodler have describe as a bribe the dlrs 500,000 scholarship fund set up by Salt Lake which benefit the relatives of six IOC members. It also come as the former minister in charge of Sydney's 2000 Olympic bid reveal he be ask to offer bribes in exchange for votes. Bruce Baird, the former New South Wales minister, say he refused. ask whether Atlanta's victory in the vote for the 1996 games be clean, Hodler said, Certainly not. John Krimsky, deputy secretary general of the U.S. Olympic Committee, dispute Hodler's assertion. There be no basis for the charges against Atlanta at this point, Krimsky said. All these issues should be put to the IOC review commission. Hodler also level allegations against the head of the Athens bid which lose to Atlanta in the 1996 vote. Hodler say he overheard spyros Metaxa, a wealthy greek businessman who lead the bid, describe Samaranch and IOC members as stupid for impose restrictions on the bidding process. For me there be only one purpose: win the games, Hodler quote Metaxa as saying. I will do whatever be necessary to win the games if it cost me dlrs 100,000, dlrs 10 million or dlrs 100 million. Hodler say he didn't know of any misconduct in Athens' successful bid for the 2004 games. ask whether Sydney's election for the 2000 games be clean, Hodler said, I would be surprised. I know what happen but I don't want to disclose it. I can't imagine that Sydney be different from the others, he said. Sydney pretends it be completely clean, clean, clean. The committee which win the 1998 games for Nagano certainly have to do things which be not legitimate, Hodler said.

Secretary-General Kofi Annan arrive in Libya Saturday for talks aim at bring to trial two libyan suspects in the 1988 Pan be bomb over Lockerbie, Scotland. Annan's one-day visit to meet with Libyan leader Col. Moammar Gadhafi follow reports in the libyan media that Gadhafi have no authority to hand over the suspects. This position would indicate that Gadhafi be give himself enough diplomatic room in the event he decide against give up the suspects. Annan fly aboard a special plane from the tunisian resort island of Jerba after receive a clearance from the U.N. Sanctions Committee to make the flight. A Libyan official, speak on condition of anonymity, say Annan have arrive in the country but refuse to give details. Libyan media, control by the government, do not report on the visit in a sign that the subject be of great sensitivity. It be not know where Annan will meet with Gadhafi but diplomats say Friday the meeting will likely take place in the northern coastal town of Sirte, 400 kilometers (250 miles) east of the Libyan capital of Tripoli. Libya have be under U.N. sanctions since 1992 for its refusal to hand over the two allege intelligence agents, Abdel Basset Ali al-megrahi and Lamen Khalifa Fhimah. They be accuse by the United States and Britain of blow up a Pan Am airliner over the scottish village of Lockerbie on Dec. 21, 1988. All 259 people aboard the Boeing 747 and 11 people on ground be killed. A Libyan legal team have be meet regularly with Annan's legal counsel to discuss a u.s.-british proposal to try the suspects in the Netherlands accord to scottish law and use scottish judges. Dutch authorities say they have make arrangements to hold the trial at Camp Zeist, a former air force base near Utrecht. On Friday, Annan say the U.N. team have do some good work on the Lockerbie dossier. We will try to resolve some problems and to find solutions together once and for all, Annan said. But in an apparent bid to distance the libyan leader from a decision on the suspects, Libya's official news agency JANA say Friday that Gadhafi be neither president nor prime minister nor foreign minister, but only the leader of the Libyan revolution. As such, Col. Gadhafi be not empower to sign an agreement, the report said. JANA suggest that a decision on hand over the suspects would have to be approve by some 500 grassroots national committees before be decide by the Parliament. The Netherlands be choose as a venue for the trial after Libya itself propose the trial be hold in a third country. Since then a new hurdle have crop up over the imprisonment of the suspects, if convicted. Libya want them jail in the Netherlands or Libya, but the United States and Britain say they should be imprison in Scotland and refuse to negotiate the issue. The U.N. sanctions on Libya do not cover oil exports, Libya's economic lifeblood. They ban air travel to and from the country and arms sales. Some Libyan assets abroad have also be frozen. But many african countries have defy the air ban and their leaders have fly in and out of Libya. Libya's justice minister on Wednesday say the two suspects in the 1988 bombing of a Pan Am jetliner should not become victims of western politics when they go on trial. We want to be sure that the only aim of the trial be to show the truth ... and that it be hold without a political or security background, Justice Minister Mohammed Belgasim al-zuwiy said. He be address the General People's Congress, or Parliament, which open a debate that will decide the fate of the two men who be want in connection with the Dec. 21, 1988 bombing. A total of 270 people on board and on ground be kill when the jetliner blow up over the scottish town of Lockerbie. Libya have accept in principle to a trial before a panel of scottish judges in the Netherlands. But the hand over of the suspects have be hold up over Libya's demand for a guarantee that the two men, if convicted, will be jail in Libya. The United States and Britain insist that the two suspects serve their prison term in Britain. The Parliament meeting, expect to last five days, be be hold in the northern coastal town of Sirte and be broadcast live on national television. Libyan media have suggest that libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi do not have the authority to hand over the suspects and that any decision would have to be approve by the Congress. Our argument be that since this be an exceptional trial, therefore this exception should include serve the jail term in Libya, maybe under U.N. supervision, al-zuwiy said. He say Libya be seek the guarantees from the West to ensure that the trial will be honest, just .. and without loopholes that (would) leave our citizens in illegal, unjust and inappropriate circumstances. open the debate, Foreign Minister Omar al-muntasser give the background to the controversy since the Security Council impose sanctions on Libya in 1992 to force it to hand over the Lockerbie suspect for trial. The sanctions include a ban on air travel from and to Libya, restrict diplomatic personnel and ban the purchase of oil equipment. Al-Zuwiy, the justice minister, say the two suspects will have the right to an appeal in the same court if it find them guilty. On Saturday, U.N.

Kurds in Italy, Germany, Austria and Romania launch protests and hunger strikes in fervent shows of solidarity with the rebel leader. Kurds come to rome by bus and car from across Western Europe for a 1,500-strong protest outside the military hospital where Ocalan be believe held under tight security.

And very possibly he'll be killed. Ocalan be arrest Thursday at the Rome airport as soon as he step off a plane from Moscow, where he have seek asylum after flee his hideout in Syria. He lead the outlawed Kurdistan Workers Party, PKK, which have be fight for Kurdish autonomy in southeastern Turkey since 1984. The conflict have kill nearly 37,000 people. To Turkey, Ocalan be the nation's most-wanted criminal. If western european nations open their arms (to the rebels) they will be take on this great terrorism problem, Deputy Premier Bulent Ecevit tell reporters in Ankara. If Italy continue to show the tolerance it show yesterday, it will be open its doors to terrorism, Ecevit added, refer to Italy's handling of brawl that break out during the first day of protests Saturday outside the Rome military hospital. The protest in Rome be peaceful Sunday. Elsewhere in Europe, dozens of Kurds protest in Bucharest until chase away by police; 1,000 Kurds rally in Bonn, some wave pictures of the Kurd leader; and 100 Kurds in Vienna set up tents outside Parliament and declare a hunger strike. In Turkey, four Kurdish prison inmates be in critical condition after set themselves on fire to protest Ocalan's arrest, the independent Human Rights Association said. Ocalan face the death penalty in Turkey, a fact that have heighten opposition in Italy to his extradition. Although there have be no executions in Turkey since 1984, Italy have consistently refuse to extradite anyone if there be even a risk of capital punishment. Foreign Minister Ismail Cem leave for Rome on Sunday to attend a meeting of european defense and foreign ministers, say he would tell Italian Foreign Minister Lamberto Dini that we expect a serious and fair approach. He criticize an italian Justice Ministry official, who reportedly say Italy would deny Turkey's extradition request. To announce the results of an extradition trial that have not yet even begin do not go hand in hand with justice, Cem tell reporters before departing. Turkish Defense Minister Ismet Sezgin indicate to reporters in Rome that italian companies could be shut out of Turkey's billions of dollars of defense contracts if it fail to turn over the Kurd. In Italy, Dini tell reporters in the city of Trento that the government would decide Ocalan's request for asylum in a clear and responsible manner.

In Istanbul, Turkish inmates at a prison take an italian prisoner hostage to increase pressure for Ocalan's extradition. Metris prison officials say the jail director be talk to the inmate captors. Ocalan found the Marxist-inspired PKK in 1978. He turn the group toward arm struggle in 1984, find wide support among poor Kurds in the underdeveloped southeast. The turkish army claims to have all but wipe out the PKK within Turkey but the rebels have havens in Iran, Syria, and Iraq and the fighting continues. INNSBRUCK, Austria (AP) -- italian authorities have turn back at least 136 people along the austro-italian border during an immigration crackdown prompt by the arrest of kurdish leader Abdullah Ocalan, Austrian officials say Monday. Most of those send back since the crackdown begin Saturday be refused entry into Italy because they have no visa or residence permits, the Austrians said. On Monday alone, about 70 people be refused entry at the Brenner Pass cross point. They include Pakistanis, Indians, Yugoslavs and Chinese as well as Kurds, the Austrians said. The border crackdown appear design to prevent large numbers of Kurds living in western Europe from flock to Rome for protests in connection with Ocalan's arrest. Turkey have ask for Ocalan's extradition. Austrian authorities say many of those turn back have come from Germany. A Red Cross station be set up at the border to assist those turn away to return to Germany if their residence permits be in order. Those without proper papers be detain by austrian immigration. greek media and officials level strong opposition Sunday to the possible extradition of Abdullah Ocalan, the arrested Kurdish guerrilla leader, to Greece's traditional rival Turkey. Ocalan, whose Kurdistan Workers Party have wag a 14-year war with Turkey for autonomy in southeastern Turkey, be in prison custody in Rome where his arrest be announce Friday. We do not give advise to other countries, say parliament speaker Apostolos Kaklamanis. Europe have a tradition of civilization and human rights and I think as a rule it abide by that tradition. Greece have not officially respond to Ocalan's arrest, which be welcome by the United States. But greek government officials have stress support for kurdish self-determination. We have repeatedly bring attention to the problems create by the blatant violation of human rights in southeast Turkey, government spokesman Dimitris Reppas say late Saturday. In the past, Greece have accuse Ankara of wag a campaign of genocide against its Kurdish population. Ankara counters that Greece be harbor PKK terrorists. Both sides angrily deny the charges. Thousands of Kurdish refugees from northern Iraq and Turkey have seek refuge in Greece. A group of more than 100 Kurds begin a three-day fast in a downtown Athens square Saturday in support of Ocalan. Within hours of the PKK leader's arrest, Turkey request his extradition to face a number of terrorism-related charges, which could carry the death penalty. Italy know what the fate of the Kurdish rebel will be if he fall into the hands of the turkish military regime, say an editorial Saturday in the greek daily Eleftherotypia. Ocalan have request political asylum in Italy as head of the Kurdish liberation movement and should be allow to remain in a democratic country. He must not be extradite to Turkey. Greece's Communist party and a small leftist opposition party call on the government to exercise its influence on Italy to keep Ocalan there. The move be also support by a number of parliamentary deputies from the govern Socialist party. Earlier this month, a bloc of 109 lawmakers in the 300-member parliament issue an invitation for Ocalan to visit Greece. Turkish authorities negotiate with an imprisoned mob leader for a second day Monday to secure the release of an italian inmate hold hostage to pressure Italy into extradite a kurdish rebel leader, a prosecutor said. The Italian, Mario Calascibetta, be take hostage Sunday by a group of inmates affiliate with mob leader Yasar Oz, to push for the return to Turkey of rebel leader Abdullah Ocalan, Turkey's most-wanted man. Ocalan be currently be hold in Rome. Calascibetta, imprison in Istanbul's Metris jail since his detention in August, be due to be hand over to swiss police Monday. He be want for question in Switzerland in connection with a killing. Turkey's Anatolia news agency say Oz be determine not to free his hostage until Italy agree to Turkey's demand to send back Ocalan who be Turkey's most want man. He be not in any life threaten danger. We be not alarm for his safety, say prosecutor Celil Demircioglu. The negotiations be continuing, we believe he will be free very soon. Demircioglu say Calascibetta's extradition would now be delay by a few days. He deny turkish press reports that the Italian be be hold at gun point. Oz be currently on trial on drugs-related charges. The mob have often support right-wing parties and ultranationalist causes. At a time when the state be under pressure to crack down on the mob, it seem convenient for Oz to show he be back the government's cause. A Kurdish rebel group fight for autonomy in Turkey's southeast face an uncertain future follow the detention in Rome of its founder and leader. italian authorities capture Abdullah Ocalan at Rome's international airport Thursday. Turkey have ask for his extradition and Ocalan have ask for political asylum. Some believe that without Ocalan, who rule some 10,000 loyal rebels with an iron fist, his Kurdistan Workers Party, or PKK, will be leave in disarray. If the head be dethroned, the rebellion get a mortal blow, say Cengiz Candar who have be follow the Kurdish insurgency for daily Sabah. But Ocalan have be absent from the battlefield for at least a month, and others contend that the PKK be capable of operate without him. Let us not fall into false expectations that this will be the end of the PKK. The PKK have already be act like a headless monster for too long, say Ilnur Cevik of the english-language turkish Daily News. Turkish newspapers have carry frequent reports of power struggles within the PKK and say that Ocalan's grip on the PKK be begin to waver. Better know as Apo, Ocalan found the Kurdistan Workers Party, PKK, in 1978. The movement turn to arm struggle in 1984, mainly focus on guerrilla-style warfare in the southeast, but also carry out bomb attacks on civilians in western Turkey. Close to 37,000 people die in the conflict. His presence in Europe could also be a blessing in disguise for the group, force the PKK to transform itself from a rebel army into a political movement. Ocalan seem to be move in this direction before his detention. While living in Damacus, he increase his meetings with european deputies. This may be the PKK's best option. The turkish military claims it have make important battlefield gains and capture the PKK's second-in-command this year. The rebels also seem to have lose the support of Syria, which appear to have force Ocalan to leave after Turkey threaten to attack it. Two Iraqi Kurdish groups control Turkey's border with Iraq have also grow lukewarm. The PKK have use their bases in Syria and Iraq to wage cross-border operations. The PKK have two options. Either they choose to fight until they get control of the area, regardless of what image they project abroad, or they try to take on a political image. I believe (ocalan) want to leave the Middle East so he could become a political figure, say Hikmet Tavak, manage director of the london-based Kurdish television, MED-TV. In Rome, spokesmen for the PKK say Ocalan have carefully select Italy because he felt there be sympathy there for his cause. They also say italian authorities be warn that Ocalan would be arriving. There be a fair amount of sympathy for the Kurds in Europe, and if the movement gains political momentum, Turkey could come under more pressure from its western allies to grant the Kurds minority rights. There be an estimated 8 to 15 million Kurds in Turkey. They be not recognize as an official minority and bar from use Kurdish in education or broadcasting. kurdish politicians have be jail and groups ban on charges of support the PKK. About 1,000 policemen be assign to protect Turkish President Suleyman Demirel, who arrive Tuesday on a three-day official visit. President Thomas Klestil's invitation for the visit be issue to take place during Austria's European Union presidency. austrian government officials reportedly will try to open up a longer-term perspective for Turkey's EU membership. A related topic certain to come up be Cyprus, among six countries with whom the European Union start formal membership talks on Nov. 10. In a rare joint statement, the Netherlands, Germany and France say the inability of Greek and Turkish Cypriots to reconcile their differences weigh heavily on their island's membership chances. They speak of fundamental problems in the Cyprus negotiate process, add a political solution be urgently required. austrian police take special measures to ensure the safety of the Turkish visitor. The political situation require comprehensive security measures, the Austria Press Agency quote Walter Zehetmayr, a senior police officer, as saying. The extra effort be prompt by the arrest last week in Rome of Abdullah Ocalan, the chief of the turkish Workers Party PKK, Zehetmayr said. He hint that he expect large protests of turkish groups in Vienna. Demirel, who be accompany by five Cabinet members and a large trade delegation, be the first head of state of the Turkish Republic to visit Austria, APA said. follow his talks with Klestil and a luncheon in the president's residence, Demirel be schedule to meet Parliament president Heinz Fischer and other senior officials. He be also to deliver a speech to the Foreign Policy Society later Tuesday. face his first real foreign policy test, Prime Minister Massimo D'Alema must decide what to do with a prominent Kurdish rebel leader who be arrest at the Rome airport on Thursday. Turkey want Italy to extradite the rebel, Abdullah Ocalan, leader of the Kurdistan Workers' Party, which be seek kurdish autonomy in southeastern Turkey. He be view in Turkey as a terrorist. Germany also have a warrant out for his arrest on homicide charges. But D'Alema, a former communist who be appoint prime minister last month, be under pressure from leftists in his coalition to offer Ocalan political asylum. In a news conference Monday, D'Alema recognize the extent of the problem. The last thing we want be an awkward and complicate situation like this one, he said. He note that italian law prohibit extradition of suspects to countries that have the death penalty. Turkey have capital punishment, though it say it will soon abolish it. Ocalan be be try in absentia there on charges that could bring the death penalty. D'Alema say a committee in the Interior Ministry would determine whether Ocalan would qualify for political asylum, which would be possible if Ocalan's promise to renounce terrorism, issue Monday, hold up. We do not want someone who organize terrorism in Italy, D'Alema said. This be an opportunity to find an exit from a bloody conflict. Earlier Monday, while members of D'Alema's government meet with turkish officials who be in Rome for a european ministerial meeting, thousands of Kurds flood into Rome to hold a demonstration and hunger strike in support of Ocalan. D'Alema's decision be far complicate on Sunday when turkish inmates in a prison in Istanbul take an italian prisoner hostage, say they would release him only after Italy extradite Ocalan. Monday, D'Alema say he would not bow to pressure. Turkey step up the pressure on Italy for the extradition of captured Kurdish rebel leader Abdullah Ocalan, warn Sunday that grant him asylum would amount to open doors to terrorism. In Rome, 1,500 Kurds mass for a second day of demonstrations outside the military hospital where Ocalan be believe to be held.

45,"Whether or not the talks between Exxon and Mobil lead to a merger or some other business combination, America's economic history be already be rewritten. In energy as in businesses like financial services, telecommunications and automobiles, global competition and technology have make unthinkable combinations practical, even necessary. oil companies like Exxon Corp. and Mobil Corp. have an additional pressure, one unthinkable less than two decades ago. Crude oil prices have fall sharply, plunge 40 percent just this year to levels, adjust for inflation, not see since before the first oil embargo 25 years ago. As such, the oil companies, have spent years cut their costs, be desperate for further savings in order to continue operate profitably with such low prices. Exxon and Mobil be the two largest, strong competitors to emerge from the nation's most famous antitrust case, the 1911 breakup of John D. Rockefeller's Standard Oil Trust. now they face a Royal Dutch/Shell Group that be large than either of them. They will also confront a british Petroleum PLC make far more potent in the United States by its agreement this summer to buy Amoco Corp. for $48.2 billion. Industry executives say further deals on this scale be inevitable. Executives at both companies do not return calls Thursday for comment on the talks, and it be unclear Thursday night what the outcome might be. But if Exxon and Mobil agree to become one, antitrust regulators be likely to be cautious about put back together much of what they long ago break apart. even so, most oil industry analysts contend that improved efficiency from combine giant energy companies would do more to low costs than the more concentrated ownership of gas stations and refineries would do to raise them. The ultimate beneficiary of all this will be the consumer, say Daniel Yergin, the chairman of Cambridge Energy Research Associates. If Exxon and Mobil ultimately do combine, the costs could prove heavy for energy industry employees. Analysts say that of the about 80,000 global employees at Exxon, base in Irving, Texas, and the more than 40,000 at Mobil, in Fairfax, Va., thousands would be likely to lose their jobs. Exxon, with Lee R. Raymond, and Mobil, with Lucio a. Noto, both have chief executives who have be preoccupy with the humbling accommodations that low oil prices have make necessary. oil companies be everybody's favorite targets during the trust-busting era early this century and again during the arab oil embargoes of the 1970s. now they seem especially vulnerable as demand weaken in much of the world, especially in economically troubled Asia, weigh far on already depress prices. They're pitiful, helpless giants, say Ronald Chernow, the author of Titan, a biography of John D. Rockefeller, Standard Oil's founder. As such, these giants be compel to continue cut costs and spread the risks of their huge, expensive international projects that be need to develop oil reserves need for the next century. Mobil, with $58.4 billion in sales last year, might seem large enough to undertake anything. But in compete for rights to develop huge natural gas fields in Turkmenistan, a former soviet republic, Mobil be unable to match Shell's offer to build a pipeline for $1 billion or more. oil companies have decide that they cannot count on a rebound in oil prices to revive their fortunes any time soon. Earlier this month, the Energy Department predict that the collapse of asian demand would continue to depress oil prices for nearly a decade, and by as much as $5.50 a barrel in the year 2000. And Thursday, the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries put off until March any decision on extend their oil production cutbacks to prop up prices. Moreover, improve technology for exploration and production and the opening of new regions to development have add to the already huge supply of oil that be on hand now. In response, many energy companies have already begin a new wave of cutbacks in their staffs and operations. To further reduce costs, companies like Mobil be form partnerships that stop short of full mergers. Two years ago, Mobil agree to combine its european refining and marketing operations with British Petroleum's, result in annual savings of about $500 million. Shell and Texaco then form a refining partnership in the United States. In the face of these partnerships, say Amy Jaffe, an energy analysts with the James A. Baker III Institute for Public Policy in Houston, if you're an Exxon, how do you compete? Though Mobil and Exxon might have high concentrations of gas stations in certain areas of the United States, analysts say they have far more competition at the pump than before oil prices collapse in the 1980s. Thousands of convenience stores now also sell gasoline produce by a variety of refine companies, and foreign national oil companies, like Venezuela's, sell their supplies through acquire companies like Citgo. Under Noto, Mobil have be hunt for ways of become large and lean enough to survive. He take the lead in the deal with British Petroleum and have consider buy up small companies. And he have make it clear that corporate or personal pride would never block a deal. In the european agreement with british Petroleum, Mobil's red fly horses have come down from the fronts of many gas stations, while the green and yellow BP logos have go up. As major oil companies team up, say John Hervey, an analyst with Donaldson Lufkin &AMP; Jenrette, If the price be right, egos will not get in the way. In the past, Mobil reportedly have further talks with British Petroleum about other combinations, as well as talks with Amoco about form an american refining venture. The company be also interested in Conoco Inc. when DuPont Co. begin look to divest itself of that oil and gas business. But no deals be reached. more recently, there be speculation on Wall Street that Mobil have be talk with Chevron Corp. British Petroleum purchase of Amoco put more pressure on Noto to seek a deal, Hervey said. I don't think this whole thing would have start if British Petroleum have not pull the trigger, he said. The british Petroleum-Amoco deal, progress quickly since the August announcement towards an expect $2 billion in annual savings, have put even companies as large as Exxon on the spot. There, Raymond have so far concentrate more on make his operations more efficient than on find allies. Though Royal Dutch/Shell's financial resources be great than Exxon's, some analysts say Exxon still have the size and soundness to absorb a company of Mobil's size. only the large oil companies can afford to take advantage of today's best opportunities. find new fields in the deep waters off the coast of West Africa or in the Gulf of Mexico can require platforms cost $1 billion or more. produce oil in the states of the former Soviet Union have take more time and money than many investors anticipated. In September, Noto be among the american executives invite by a Saudi leader visit Washington to greatly step up investments in his country, too. Noto spent from 1977 to 1985 in Saudi Arabia himself, build up Mobil operations include a huge refinery. But any new partnerships with the Saudis might require both Mobil's connections and Exxon's capital. Back when Standard Oil organize its operations by state, Exxon be Standard Oil of New Jersey, while Mobil be Standard Oil of New York. even after the Standard Oil monopoly be break up, they remain for several years in the same building in Manhattan. Chernow, the Rockefeller biographer, note that two pieces of the Standard Oil trust be already likely to be united. British Petroleum buy Standard Oil of Ohio in the 1970s, and Amoco be once standard Oil of Indiana. The break-up of Standard Oil and the result competition have often be cite as a precedent for the current antitrust action against Microsoft. Chernow see no reason why allow an Exxon acquisition of Mobil to go through should suggest more leniency for Microsoft. Exxon would not be obviously large than its leading competitors, the way Microsoft is, he said. In the energy business today, he added, there be other large dinosaurs that stalk that particular jungle. The boards of Exxon Corp. and Mobil Corp. be expect to meet Tuesday to consider a possible merger agreement that would form the world's large oil company, a source close to the negotiations say Friday. The source, who speak on condition of anonymity, say the prospects be good for complete an agreement. Exxon and Mobil confirm Friday that they be discuss ways to combine. They cautioned, however, that no agreement have be reach and there be no assurance they would reach one. The statement send the stock of both companies surging, suggest investors believe the companies will combine. Shares of Exxon, the big U.S. oil company, rise $1.6875, or 2.3 percent, to $74.375. Shares of Mobil, the no. 2 U.S. oil company, rise $7.625, or 9.7 percent, to $86. Some analysts say that if the two giants reach an agreement, it be likely to be in the form of a takeover by Exxon of Mobil. Exxon be far large and financially stronger. Analysts predict that there would be huge cuts in duplicate staff from both companies, which employ 122,700 people. Adam Sieminski, an oil analyst for BT Alex. Brown, say that the companies would probably make cuts to save about $3 billion to $5 billion a year. Sieminski and other analysts say Exxon would have to offer a premium of about 15 to 20 percent over its price prior to Monday, when serious speculation of an Exxon takeover of Mobil first circulate and send Mobil shares up sharply. They say the transaction would probably be an exchange of Mobil shares for Exxon shares. base on Mobil's $75.25 share price a week ago, a takeover of the company would be worth about $70 billion. The merger discussions come against a backdrop of particularly severe pressure on Lucio Noto, the chairman, president and chief executive of Mobil, to find new reserves of oil and natural gas and to keep big projects profitable at a time of a deep decline in crude oil prices. This be one of the most intelligent chief executives in the business and a man of considerable ability but he inherit some serious structural problems in his company, say J. Robin West, the chairman of Petroleum Finance Co., a consult group to the energy industry base in Washington. He say that Mobil's prime assets include the Arun natural gas field in Indonesia, one of the large in the world, which have contribute up to one-third of Mobil's profits for years but be begin to run down. The field, in production since 1977, supplies liquefy natural gas to Japan and Korea. Although Mobil under Noto have move quickly to cut costs and muscle its way into promise new areas such as Kazakhstan, where it be a partner in a joint venture to develop the huge Tengiz oil field, the payoff from such ventures be many years away. other companies face similar strains. The challenge be to replace their crown jewels and grow in an increasingly competitive environment, West said. Noto have not be shy about sit down with other companies such as British Petroleum and Amoco this year to see if a combination make sense. Although Exxon chairman Lee Raymond head a much strong and big company than Mobil, he have not be immune to the strains on the global petroleum business. Those strains intensify this year when Russia's economic collapse raise the risks of Exxon's extensive exploration venture in that country. Exxon have also be more of a follower than a leader in huge projects in the deep offshore fields, where major finds have be make near West Africa and in the Gulf of Mexico. News that Exxon and Mobil, two giants in the energy patch, be in merger talks last week be the big sign yet that corporate marriages be back in vogue. even before that combination come to light, deal-making be fast and furious. On Monday alone, $40.4 billion in corporate acquisitions be either announce or declare imminent. drive the resurgence in mergers be a roar stock market, the recognition by major corporations that it be get harder to increase revenues internally and grow confidence among market players that the economy will not plunge into a recession next year. There be also industry-specific issues, like low crude-oil prices that be drive oil giants into one another's arms. But for investors, mega-marriages be not where the real money be to be made. Rather, it be among small companies, whose still-depressed stock prices be lure big acquirers with stocks that again be near their peaks. If Exxon buy Mobil at close to current prices, deals this month will have a total value of more than $140 billion off from April's peak of $244 billion but three times the volume in September, when the stock market be falling. Which industries be likely to witness the most mergers? Tom Burnett, director of Merger Insight, an institutional investment advisory firm in New York, say more deals be a certainty in energy, which be suffer from low crude-oil prices. Burnett also say health care executives be find it tough than ever to lift earnings. But small companies may be a good way to play the takeover game. Charles LaLoggia, editor of the special Situation Investor newsletter in Potomac, Md., said: Some of the premiums in high-profile mergers aren't so great anymore. The values be in small-cap stocks. Another reason be that deals involve smaller-cap candidates be less likely to incur the wrath of antitrust regulators. LaLoggia reckons that the odds of pick takeover winners increase if an investor focus on companies already partially own by another. In the energy sector, Houston Exploration qualifies, he says; the oil and gas driller be 66 percent own by Keyspan Energy. He also believe more deals be imminent among drug chains and supermarkets. Longs Drug Stores and Drug Emporium, he says, remain acquisition candidates, though neither be control by another concern. In supermarkets, LaLoggia like the Great Atlantic &AMP; Pacific Tea Co., 55 percent own by Tengelmann Group of Germany. Another pick be Smart and Final, an operator of warehouse-style stores that be 55 percent own by the U.S. subsidiary of Groupe Casino, France's large supermarket chain. Both A&AMP;P and Smart and Final be trade at just about book value, LaLoggia said. Takeovers typically occur above book value. Finally, he recommend National Presto Industries, a maker of housewares and electrical appliances, which be trade near $39, close to its low for the year. The company have $30 a share in cash on its balance sheet, no debt and a dividend yield of 5 percent. After last month's announce acquisition of Rubbermaid by the Newell Co., LaLoggia think National Presto could find itself in an acquirer's cross-hairs. It be new highs again for the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock and Nasdaq composite indexes Friday as anticipation of a new wave of mergers and a general rush by investors to join the equity rebound push stocks up. Oil stocks lead the way as investors soak up the news of continue talks between Exxon and Mobil on a merger that would create the world's large oil company. Internet and computer stocks also rallied, help in part by the announcement on Tuesday of America Online's purchase of Netscape Communications in a three-way deal involve Sun Microsystems. At the same time, Germany's Deutsche Bank and Bankers Trust be schedule to formally announce their merger on Monday. There be no question that the merger euphoria be the headline, say Hugh Johnson, chief investment officer at the First Albany Corp. But the flow into mutual funds be also strong. Exxon rise 1 11/16, to 74], while Mobil jump 7|, to 86. Chevron, reflect the bounce that other oil companies get from the merger news, climb 5\, to 85|. Exxon and Chevron, along with IBM, which rise 3\, to 170, be the main drivers of the Dow Jones industrial average. It climb 18.80 points, or two-tenths of a percent, to 9,333.08. It now stand just 41 points short of the record it set Monday and up 1.9 percent for the week. Mobil, along with Exxon, Chevron, IBM and Microsoft, which rise 3 13/16, to 128 1/16, be the power behind the S &AMP; P. It climb 5.46 points, or five-tenths of a percent, to 1,192.33, a new high, the second of the week. It jump 2.5 percent in the last five trading days. Cisco Systems, up 2 15/16, to 80; MCI Worldcom, up 1 11/16, to 62 7/16; Sun Microsystems, up 4|, to 80], and Microsoft push the Nasdaq index to its first new high since July 20. The technology-heavy index finish 31.23 points, or 1.57 percent, higher, at 2,016.44. It be up 4.6 percent for the week. Whether Friday's gains will stick will not be know before Monday. It be a shortened trading session, with the New York Stock Exchange closing at 1 p.m., and trading volume, at 257 million shares, make it the light day of the year. In the bond market, which also close early because of the Thanksgiving weekend, the price of the 30-year Treasury bond rise 11/32, to 101 12/32. The bond's yield, which move in the opposite direction from the price, fell to 5.16 percent from 5.18 percent on Wednesday. Long-term and short-term yields all slip low this week despite new economic data that indicate the economy be strong in the third quarter than expect and seem to be move along at a good pace in the current quarter. This small recovery in the face of strong growth be probably because new inflation numbers show that prices be in check and analysts be still forecast that the economy will begin to slow down next year. many analysts have note during the eight-week stock market rally, in which the Nasdaq composite index jump 42 percent, that investors be buy again even though major financial problems around the world include a slumping Asia, a weakening Latin America and a troubled russia have not be resolved. Johnson say he think that investors, inspire by the Federal Reserve's three interest rate cuts in two months and by the new stimulus package in Japan, assume that these problems will be solved. Investors be look over the valley and they like what they see, he said. But he worry that the financial crisis, which begin in Thailand in July 1997 and be intensify by the effective default of Russia in August, will not go away quickly. It seem that in every financial crisis, everybody get the impression that the storm have passed, Johnson said. But it be never that easy. Exxon Corp. and Mobil Corp. have hold discussions about combine their business operations, a person involve in the talks say Wednesday. It be unclear Wednesday whether talks be continuing. If the companies be to merge, it would create the large U.S. company in terms of revenue. A possible merger be report separately by both The Financial Times of London and Bloomberg News. The report talks between Exxon, whose annual revenue exceed that of Wal-Mart and General Electric, and Mobil, the no. 2 U.S. oil company, come as oil prices have sink to their low in almost 12 years. A combine company would be big than Royal Dutch/Shell Group, the world's large oil company by revenue. Financial terms of the discussions could not be determine Wednesday. Neither Exxon or Mobil would comment. Any union would reunite two parts of John D. Rockefeller's Standard Oil Trust, which be break up by the Supreme Court in 1911. Exxon be then know as Standard Oil of New Jersey, and Mobil consist of two companies: Standard Oil of New York and Vacuum Oil. Both Exxon, which have a market value of $176.7 billion, and Mobil, which have a market value of $61.1 billion, have a history of be fiercely independence. Both have already cut back on staff and make themselves lean in order to survive long periods when oil prices be low. But this have be a particularly unsettling year for the oil industry, and there be little prospect that crude oil prices will recover soon. Consequently, chief executives of most oil companies have have to swallow their pride and look for suitable partners. This summer, British Petroleum announce a $48.2 billion agreement to buy Amoco Corp., create the world's third-largest oil company and prompt analysts to predict even more widespread consolidation. It show that megamergers be doable, say Adam Sieminski, an analyst for BT Alex. Brown. He added, however, that a combination between Exxon and Mobil would not be an easy match because Mobil have be know for be a proud company that have say in the past that it would not want to merge. Exxon, he added, be a well run company that like to grow its own businesses. He add that the heads of both companies, Lee Raymond, the chairman of Exxon, which be base in Irving, Texas, and Lucio Noto, the chairman, president and chief executive of Mobil, which be base in Fairfax, Va., be different personalities. It will not be easy, he say of combine the two far-flung companies, which have vast networks of refineries and gas stations that overlap in the United States and Europe. If you offer enough money you can make anything happen, he added. Both companies be under pressure to find new fields of oil to help them survive in the long term. Like other oil companies, they have hop to quickly tap into the vast reserves of Russia. Even though they be prepare to spend billions, they have hold back because of the political and economic crisis in Russia and great reluctance by russian officials and oil companies to give up control of vast fields. Thus they have have to fall back on their own exploration areas such as the deep waters in the Gulf of Mexico and West Africa. such exploration be very expensive, and even when large fields be find it often take platforms cost $1 billion to bring the oil into production. oil prices have be under pressure for more than a year, fall more than 40 percent from the $20-a-barrel level because of grow inventories of petroleum and decline asian demand cause by the economic crisis there. On Wednesday, crude oil for January delivery fell 29 cents, or 2.6 percent, to $11.86 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange, close to the 12-year low of $11.42 reach on June 15. Members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries and some other oil-producing nations, notably Mexico, have try to stem the price drops with pledges to cut back on production. But those pledges have not always be honored, and rallies in the oil market this year have prove short-lived. OPEC members on Wednesday continue their discussion on extend their production cutbacks, and an agreement be expect as early as Thursday. In the spring, OPEC agree to reduce production by 2.6 million barrels a day, about 3 percent of the daily world supply of 74 million barrels. The main result of that agreement appear to have be to keep oil prices from fall below $10 a barrel. Washington regulators say Wednesday that they have not be notify about the Exxon-Mobil discussions. The Federal Trade Commission be still review british Petroleum's pending purchase of Amoco. An exxon-mobil deal would be certain to receive several months' worth of scrutiny by the commission, which would review how much of the industry such a merger would control. Analysts and investment bankers be split about the logic of the possible merger. Some point to difficulties that the companies could face if they be combined. If you ask me if Exxon need to be bigger, the answer be probably no, say Garfield Miller, president of Aegis Energy Advisors Corp., a small independent investment bank base in New York. It be hard to say that there be anything in particular to gain. In particular, Miller said, the two companies have enormous similarities in their domestic refining and marketing businesses. They really do overlap quite a bit, he said. You really do wonder what be the benefit of all that redundancy. Another investment banker in the energy business, speak on the condition of anonymity, also question the rationale for the discussed merger. When you look at the BP-Amoco deal, you can rationalize it, the banker said. But none of those reasons apply to an exxon-mobil deal. But Amy Jaffe, an energy research analyst with the James A. Baker III Institute for Public Policy, say the combination of the two companies would be logical, in part because it would give them great influence in bidding for projects in Middle Eastern countries. This be a deal that make sense, Ms. Jaffe said. With this combine company, there be no project that would be too big. In addition, Ms. Jaffe said, the merger would provide each company with new oil and gas assets in areas of the world where they have little influence. There be a lot of complimentary assets where they be not redundant, she said. She say that Exxon, for example, have a strong presence in Angola, while Mobil do not. And Mobil have significant assets in the caspian Sea and Nigeria, where Exxon be weak. Exxon and Mobil, the nation's two large oil companies, confirm Friday that they be discuss a possible merger, and antitrust lawyers, industry analysts and government officials predict that any deal would require the sale of important large pieces of such a new corporate behemoth. Those divestitures would far reshape an industry already undergo a broad transformation because of the low price of oil. But the mergers and other corporate combinations be also begin to create a new regulatory climate among antitrust officials, one that may prove particularly challenge to Exxon and Mobil. Although the companies only confirm that they be discuss the possibility of a merger, a person close to the discussions say the boards of both Exxon and Mobil be expect to meet Tuesday to consider an agreement. Shares of both surge on the New York Stock Exchange. Oil exploration and drilling interests would not necessarily present antitrust problems in an exxon-mobil merger because competition in those areas be brisk. But in retailing and marketing operations, an exxon-mobil combination would be like Ford merge with General Motors, Macy's with Gimbels, say Stephen Axinn, an antitrust lawyer in New York who represent Texaco in its acquisition of Getty more than a decade ago. In the United States, the deal would come under the purview of the Federal Trade Commission, which under the Clinton administration have examine large corporate mergers with a vigor not see since the 1970s. The agency have block a number of propose mergers, such as the $4 billion combination of Staples and Office Depot, the two large office supply discounters, and two deals involve the four large drug wholesalers. On the other hand it have approve other big mergers, such as Boeing's $14 billion acquisition of McDonnell Douglas. The agency's analysis of an Exxon-Mobil combination, a senior official say Friday, will turn on how it might resemble John D. Rockefeller's Standard Oil trust before it be dismantle by the Supreme Court in 1911. The big antitrust issue be whether, by a merger or alliance, they will be able to get the competition of one another off their backs, particularly against the background of BP-Amoco and Shell-Texaco, say Eleanor M. Fox, a professor at the New York University School of Law and an antitrust expert. It may be that we be look at a consolidation on the world level that look like the consolidation on the national level 100 years ago. The Federal Trade Commission recently approve a significant joint venture between Shell and Texaco after the venture agree to sell a refinery and divest some retailing operations in Hawaii and California. It be also consider the propose $54 billion merger of British Petroleum and Amoco and will now have to re-examine that combination in light of the new talks between Exxon and Mobil. In the past, when there have be two mergers involve the same industry, the government have consider them together in decide how to deal with them, say Terry Calvani, a former commissioner at the Federal Trade Commission whose clients now include Chevron. But come in the aftermath of the Shell-Texaco and BP-Amoco deals, a combination of Exxon and Mobil, which have significantly overlap retail and refinery businesses in the United States and Europe, poses questions that antitrust officials have not confront since the 1980s. It's a real test case, say Frederick Leuffer, a senior energy analyst at Bear Stearns. If the FTC let this one go through without major divesting, then everything would be fair game. Why couldn't GM merge with Ford? While the 1911 breakup of Standard Oil be view by Washington officials and industry executives as ancient history, Exxon and Mobil have become the dominant rivals in some retailing and refining markets, and in the production of lubricants and petrochemicals. Leuffer say he believe divestitures necessary in this case could be so large that they be deal-breakers. other analysts and lawyers, while disagree that the required divestitures could kill the deal, say the companies would nonetheless have to shed significant operations and that they expect challenges to be raise by a broad spectrum of constituents, include competitors, customers and state officials. These be not absolute obstacles, say John Hervey, an analyst at Donaldson Lufkin &AMP; Jenrette. In the past, when two big oil companies have merged, aggressive attorneys general from the states have almost always become involve in raise questions because of the high visibility of the local gas station. When a state attorney general drives by and sees four stations on a corner and two of them be Mobil and Exxon, they be certain to raise questions, Axinn said. Exxon and Mobil have significant concentrations of retailing and marketing concerns in the Northeast, the Southwest and the West Coast, where they also have big refining operations. Because the two companies be involve in everything from exploration and shipping to refining and retailing, the meaning of the deal for consumers will take months for the regulators to sort out. The regulators examine such a transaction would dissect each business, determine whether its market be global, national or more local, and determine whether the combined entity have too high a concentration of the business in those areas. Experts agree that the regulators be most likely to permit Exxon and Mobil to keep their exploratory and oil production businesses because those areas be already highly competitive and a merger would not result in high prices. Hervey say those markets be already so fragmented that the combined market share of major american and european oil companies be only 17 percent. They have be downsized, cut back and re-engineered. so when the 900 or so remaining blue-collar workers here at Mobil's large domestic refinery, out of about 1,500 a decade ago, hear last week that their company be discuss a possible merger with Exxon, it be like a siren warn them that an already suspect valve might be about to blow. I think it's a terrible thing, say Dick Mabry, a refinery operator, as he emerge in the plant's artificial twilight from the main gate after his 12-hour shift end at 4:30 on Sunday morning. He stop to rub eyes rim with red, but on this topic his bedtime could be delayed. It's a revival of the Standard Oil Company. It's go to put 20 or 30 thousand people out of work. I think the Justice Department should step in and stop it. Ernest Lewis, whose overalls bore a Big E patch appropriate to his scale, add his uh-huh's. The late evidence of where things be head hulk right nearby, he said, glance over at a new power plant likely to be operate by an outside company without the unions that now man the refinery's generators. But if the Mobil Corp. have to be sold, Lewis said, note the gains in his company stock holdings, a buyer as solid and large as the Exxon Corp. might be the least of all evils. If we merge with Chevron, we'd be Moron, he added. A grow american economy that can make a billionaire out of someone with an unproven idea for Internet marketing be still slough off workers in old industries, in petroleum as much as any. Those here point to the tote board by the Beaumont plant's brick headquarters, that they say shows they have already handle 171 million barrels out of 130 million plan for the full year. But the numbers that matter even more be the ones like 89.9, 88.9, even 81.9, on nearby gas stations the low prices, after inflation, since the Depression. Which be why Mobil and Exxon be consider combine into the world's large oil company. Some people close to the talks caution that no deal would be consider by their boards until at least Tuesday, maybe Wednesday. And that be why, begin last Wednesday evening, the phone at the home of Jimmy Herrington, the president of the Oil, Chemical and Atomic Workers Local 4-243 rang without stop. No, he didn't know about that merger talk on television, say Herrington, who also work full-time produce lubricants. He have ask some Mobil managers, in a meeting earlier this month, about all the rumors, but they say they have hear nothing. oil industry analysts say that the first targets of a combined company's efforts to cut billions of dollars in annual costs would be the office staff and the professionals, like geologists and engineers, in the field. One company's accountants could almost do the work for two. But the crews here fully expect that an Exxon or any other buyer would ask yet again whether the refinery could turn more crude oil into gasoline, motor oil and other products with even few people. Union leaders raise the prospect that Exxon would have to sell the refinery. Antitrust regulators, they say, be bind to notice that Exxon have refineries an hour's drive in one direction and three hours in the other, along a Gulf of Mexico crescent that form the petrochemical industry's home. The Beaumont plant, a steaming, hum chemistry set line the Neches River off the Gulf, have become the prime provider of livelihoods here since it be build almost under the spray of the nearby Spindletop gusher. With mount overtime that can stretch a shift to 16 hours or more, workers regularly make $55,000 or $65,000 a year. People go there to retire there, Herrington said, as he drive around the plant's fence periphery. Lewis, in his 17th year, be a third-generation employee. But his nephew laboring here too be the exception. The workers stream to and from the plant before dawn be mostly bald or go gray, a sign that for a full generation the refinery have be more concerned about how to get rid of workers than how to attract them. The cutbacks have, so far, come through attrition, with retirements often encourage by incentives. But the plywood sheets cover the windows of most of the fast food places and gas stations around Herrington's union hall advertise that the best times be long gone. His members chafe at the experts who come in from Wall Street to question the justification for every person's job. In tire and dangerous tasks, they question the elimination of most relief laborers in favor of cover vacations and sickness with overtime (although some like the extra pay, and they say the plant have become safer over the years). They complain about the grow numbers of outside contractors take over formerly unionized tasks. But with many workers choose to invest at least some retirement savings in Mobil stock, a 1990s ethos be gaining. Some share credit with the plant's management for the efficiency measure they agree be necessary for true job security. Some take the attitude that every company be always for sale. They will not be too concerned about what we feel about it, say Sam Salim, one of the electrical plant workers whose future be uncertain. But if they fork out $60 billion? I'd look it over. With most Mobil executives say as little as possible for now, calls on Sunday to the local plant manager and a company spokesman do not elicit a peep. Union leaders, however, be already squawking. I don't believe create new monopolies be the way to prop up the industry, say Robert Wages, a former refinery operator himself and now the union's president, by telephone Saturday. Nevertheless, with admirable foresight the union negotiate a clause in last November's three-year contract extension guarantee that any company buyer would have to keep to its terms. Many members, who typically come to work after high school, be already mold the oil companies' late exploit into case studies fit for rapacious MBA's. They're the biggest, say Bobby Whisneant, an assistant operator in the gasoline and lubrication oil units, refer to Exxon. He be coming, early on Sunday morning, through a plant gate whose white canopy seem borrow from a self-service station. So they go buy the second biggest. That's one way to get rid of the competition. I just hope it's not something like the 80s buying companies and scrap them. Or something like the Robber Baron era a century before, say Mabry, another operator. Didn't the teachers teach us all through school that the Standard Oil Company would never come back? Remember that? he said, look to his friend, Lewis, the Big E, for agreement. But I better shut up. I still work for Mobil. use to, Lewis said. Exxon Corp. and Mobil Corp. have hold discussions about combine their business operations, a person involve in the talks say Wednesday. It be unclear Wednesday whether talks be continuing. If the companies be to merge, it would create the large U.S. company in terms of revenue. A possible merger be report separately by both The Financial Times of London and Bloomberg News. The report talks between Exxon, whose annual revenue exceed that of General Electric Co., and Mobil, the no. 2 U.S. oil company, come as oil prices sink to their low in almost 12 years. A combine company would be big than Royal Dutch/Shell Group, the world's large oil company by revenue. Financial terms of the discussions could not be determine Wednesday. Neither Exxon or Mobil would comment. Any union would reunite two parts of John D. Rockefeller's Standard Oil Trust, which be break up by the Supreme Court in 1911. Exxon be then know as Standard Oil of New Jersey, and Mobil consist of two companies: Standard Oil of New York and Vacuum Oil. As oil prices have plummet to levels last see in the mid-1980s, oil companies have be under pressure to cut costs. Exxon, which have a market value of $176.7 billion, and Mobil, which have a market value of $61.1 billion, both have histories of be fiercely independent, and both have already cut back on staff and make themselves lean to survive even during a prolonged period of low oil prices. But this have be a particularly unsettling year for the oil industry, and there be little prospect that crude oil prices will recover soon. Consequently, chief executives of most oil companies have have to swallow their pride and look for suitable partners. This summer, British Petroleum announce an agreement to buy Amoco Corp. for $48.2 million, create the world's third-largest oil company and prompt analysts to predict even more widespread consolidation. It show that megamergers be doable, say Adam Sieminski, an analyst for BT Alex. Brown. He added, however, that any combination between Exxon and Mobil would not be an easy match because Mobil have be know for be a proud company that have say in the past that it would not want to merge. Exxon, he added, be a well-run company that like to grow its own businesses. He add that the heads of both companies, Lee Raymond, the chairman of Exxon, which be base in Irving, Texas, and Lucio Noto, the chairman, president and chief executive of Mobil, which be base in Fairfax, Va., be different personalities. It will not be easy, he say of combine the two far-flung companies, which have vast networks of refineries and gas stations that overlap in the United States and Europe. If you offer enough money you can make anything happen, he added. Both companies be under pressure to find new fields of oil to help them survive in the long term. Like other oil companies, they have hop to quickly tap into the vast reserves of Russia. Even though they be prepare to spend billions, they have hold back because of the political and economic crisis in Russia and great reluctance by russian officials and oil companies to give up control of vast fields. Thus they have have to fall back on exploration areas of their own such as the deep waters in the Gulf of Mexico as well as West Africa and parts of Asia. such exploration be very expensive, and even when a big field be discovered, platforms cost $1 billion or more be require to bring the it into production. oil prices have be under pressure for more than a year, fall more than 40 percent from the $20-a-barrel level because of grow inventories of petroleum and decline asian demand cause by the economic crisis there. On Wednesday, crude oil for January delivery fell 29 cents, or 2.6 percent, to $11.86 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange, close to the 12-year low of $11.42 reach on June 15. Members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries and some other oil-producing nations, notably Mexico, have try to stem the price drops with pledges to cut back on production. But those pledges have not always be honored, and rallies in the oil market this year have prove short-lived. OPEC members on Wednesday continue their discussion on extend their production cutbacks, and an agreement be expect as early as Thursday. In the spring, OPEC agree to reduce production by 2.6 million barrels a day, about 3 percent of the daily world supply of 74 million barrels. The main result of that agreement appear to have be to keep oil prices from fall below $10 a barrel. Washington regulators say Wednesday that they have not be notify about the Exxon-Mobil discussions. The Federal Trade Commission be still review british Petroleum's pending purchase of Amoco. An exxon-mobil deal would be certain to receive several months' worth of scrutiny by the commission, which would review how much of the industry the combine company would control. Analysts and investment bankers be split about the logic of a potential deal. Some point to difficulties that the companies could face if they be combined. If you ask me if Exxon need to be bigger, the answer be probably no, say Garfield Miller, president of Aegis Energy Advisors Corp., a small independent investment bank base in New York. It be hard to say that there be anything in particular to gain. In particular, Miller said, the two companies have enormous similarities in their domestic refining and marketing businesses. They really do overlap quite a bit, he said. You really do wonder what be the benefit of all that redundancy. Another investment banker in the energy business, speak on the condition of anonymity, also question the rationale for the discussed merger. When you look at the BP-Amoco deal, you can rationalize it, the banker said. But none of those reasons apply to an exxon-mobil deal. But Amy Jaffe, an energy research analyst with the James A. Baker III Institute for Public Policy, say the combination of the two companies would be logical, in part because it would give them great influence in bidding for development projects in the Middle East. This be a deal that make sense, Ms. Jaffe said. With this combine company, there be no project that would be too big. Ms. Jaffe say the propose deal would provide each company with assets in areas where it have little influence. There be a lot of complementary assets where they be not redundant, she said. She say that Exxon, for example, have a strong presence in Angola, while Mobil do not. And Mobil have significant assets in the caspian Sea and Nigeria, where Exxon be weak. Times be tough in the oil patch. Still, it boggle the mind to accept the notion that hardship be drive profitable big oil to either merge, as British Petroleum and Amoco have already agree to do, or at least to consider the prospect, as Exxon and Mobil be doing. Still, Big Oil and small oil be get squeeze by low petroleum prices and the high capital costs of exploration. Given the exotic locales of the most promising, untapped fields, it seem unlikely that exploration will get cheaper. And with West Texas crude trading at around $12 a barrel, it seem a safe bet oil that won't be sell for $100 a barrel by the turn of the century a price some analysts in the early 1980s be predict it would reach. Philip K. Verleger Jr., publisher of Petroleum Economics Monthly and a senior adviser to the Brattle Group, a Cambridge, Mass., consult firm, spend some time late last week talk about Mobil, Exxon and the change dynamics of the oil business. follow be excerpts from the conversation: Q. (italics)There be a lot of focus on the antitrust aspects of an exxon-mobil deal. Do you see any problems?(end italics) A. Let me say right off that I don't think this be a do deal. I think it be far from that. But if it be to happen, I don't see many problems. BP Amoco be the perfect end-to-end merger, one in which there be little or no overlap with the company you be merge with. Exxon-Mobil come close. The first issue be competition in local markets. The only possible problem area there be on the West Coast, but both companies be pretty small players there. If there be a reason this merger might get extra attention, it will be because Exxon and Mobil have not be terribly friendly toward either the Clinton administration's or the european Union's positions on global warming. Q. (italics)Why be you skeptical about the deal?(end italics) A. Well, Mobil have be try to get bigger. They have talks with Amoco. They want to buy Conoco. But I don't understand where Lucio Noto, Mobil's chief executive, fits into this. That could be an impediment to an agreement, because in a merger I don't think he have a place, and he have be a very strong leader. Q. (italics)Mobil be the country's second-biggest oil company, behind Exxon. Why do they need to get bigger?(end italics) a. In the first decade of the next century, the really big exploration opportunities will be very capital intensive, and only companies with the deep pockets will be able to stay in the game: Royal Dutch, Exxon and BP Amoco. Companies of Mobil's size be probably marginal players. Q. (italics)That suggest Mobil have be hard hit than Exxon by the downturn in prices.(end italics) a. From 1988 to 1996, Exxon's exploration and production expenditures rise 8 percent. Mobil's rise 14 percent. But Mobil's expenditures be much more sensitive to price elasticities of oil than Exxon's. They be push the envelope, and when prices fell they have to cut back. Exxon have try to build a very large presence systematically, without pay much attention to month-to-month or even year-to-year fluctuations in oil prices. They be brutally efficient. Q. (italics)Earlier this month the Energy Department say oil prices would stay soft for nearly a decade. Do you agree?(end italics) A. You know, every time I see forecasts that go out that far I want to go out and buy stock in oil companies. I think we be go to see low oil prices for six months to a year. It be conceivable we could go into the next century with oil at $5 a barrel, depend on what happen to the world economy. During that period, we be go to see a substantial reduction in investment in exploration and production, lead to a reduction in supply come out of non-opec countries. That will strengthen the hands of the OPEC countries. And when the asian economies start grow again that will lead to a good deal high oil prices, say $20 a barrel, in the next 18 months. Q. (italics)The number of oil companies be go to shrink in come years, regardless, isn't it?(end italics) a. We be probably head toward a world in which there be no more than five or six big oil companies, possibly eight. There be really no precedent for have as many big players as we have in the oil business in this modern society. Q. (italics)Do you think oil stocks be a good investment?(end italics) a. I think oil companies be still a worthwhile investment, but it be not a place where an investor should plan on make money over the next 9 to 12 months. And it be an area where investors need to be careful, because in that period there will be a good deal of consolidation among small companies. Times be tough in the oil patch. Still, it boggle the mind to accept the notion that hardship be drive profitable big oil to either merge, as British Petroleum and Amoco have already agree to do, or at least to consider the prospect, as Exxon and Mobil be doing.

46,"The raw passions be such that the House Democrats do not to hesitate to bellow You resign! You resign! at Speaker-elect Robert Livingston when he call from the House floor for President Clinton to quit the White House in the face of certain impeachment. Shockingly, stunningly, Livingston do just that. He quit in one breathtaking utterance, as if flick a trump card onto the heap of impeachment angst fester before his eyes in the debating chamber. In his one and only strategem in lead his fellow House Republicans, Livingston's decision strike Congress like a verbal bomb. stun Democrats saw their fury vaporize upon the instant. They have to stand, almost stagger to their feet, to join the Republicans in a prolonged, emotional ovation for Livingston and his undeniable self-sacrifice. As they stood, the Democrats sense Livingston have most suddenly close a trap on the president and his defenders. For, with the impeachment issue set to move to the Senate, Livingston, whose own marital indiscretions be now before the public to his obvious misery, choose to show how the question of a political leader's resignation be very much in play in this tumult-tossed city. I must set the example that I hope President Clinton will follow, Livingston declared, flabbergast all attend the impeachment debate and the nation watch beyond. Livingston walk off the floor like the sheriff in some bullet-pocked political High Noon, discard the leadership badge he have wrest from the early speaker-casualty, Newt Gingrich. In the corridor just beyond, a doorman shout to a police officer: Livingston just resigned! What? What? come the reply from the officer, who obviously think the momentous announcement would be about Clinton's impeachment, not Livingston's political self-immolation. Just so, the Democrats, already deep into bone-raw exhaustion after their long fight to save the president, grasp for bearings. It be a surrender to a develop sexual McCarthyism! declare Rep. Jerrold Nadler, D-N.Y., a lead presidential defender try to rally Democrats around the argument that Livingston should not resign any more than President Clinton should quit under fire. But the Republicans be surge to the fore on the strength of Livingston's announcement, fight tears as they rise to salute him as the ultimate political role model in the grueling impeachment process as it roar into the final minutes of debate. For some it be no longer good enough to make a mistake, to confirm that mistake and take the consequences of that mistake, say Tom DeLay, the Republican whip, his hands shaking, his eyes tear as he address the House and seek to drive the example of Livingston all the way down Pennsylvania Avenue. He understand what this debate be all about honor, duty, integrity and the truth, say DeLay argue that in one swift blow, Livingston have demonstrate himself to have be a far good speaker than Clinton have be a president. With something of the political elan the president show in initiate the Iraq attack as his own impeachment loomed, House Republicans, batter in public opinion polls, have find a rocket's red glare of their own. I have hurt you all deeply and beg your forgiveness, Livingston tell the House, the nation and his family as he announce retreat. only moments before, Democrats openly hiss the man as Livingston firmly read his own judgment upon the president: Sir, you have do great damage to this nation over the past year. Presidential resignation be in order, he continued, and then come the shouts of You resign! You resign! And as Livingston close the circle on his career, he stun the place into a collective breath of disbelief and somehow almost threaten to reduce the dark historic issue before the House the impeachment of the president into a matter of anticlimax. They must not succeed, David Bonior, the democratic whip say of the Republicans as he be give the task of refocus the day on the misdeeds of the president, not the departure of the speaker. We be here to debate impeachment and should not be distract from that, he declared. The only way we can stop this vicious cycle, Bonior cry out from the floor, be if we refuse to give into it, whether it be Bill Clinton or Bob Livingston. But the House be still reel through the frenzied day as the fateful vote on the presidency approach and the notion of resignation lick about the capital city like a flame in a forest. reject a last-minute democratic attempt to soften its action to censure, the House of Representatives move to impeach President William Jefferson Clinton for perjury on Saturday and to call on the Senate to try him, convict him and remove him from office. But even before the vote, Republicans press another line of attack, demand Clinton's resignation. Rep. Robert Livingston, nominate for speaker last month by his party, startle the House when he announce he would not run for speaker and would resign from the House after 21 years of service. He urge the president to heal the wounds that you have created. You, sir, may resign your post. angry Democrats boo and shouted, You resign! Livingston continued, I can only challenge you in such fashion if I be willing to heed my own words. Apologizing again for extramarital affairs reveal two days ago, he said, I believe I have it in me to do a fine job. But I cannot do that job or be the kind of leader that I would like to be under current circumstances. then he bolt from the House chamber, nearly knock reporters and members down. (the House vote 228-206 to approve the first article of impeachment, accuse Clinton of commit perjury before a federal grand jury. The vote be announce at 1:24 p.m. EST, leave the 42nd president to face trial in the Senate on whether he should be remove from office.) Clinton reject the advice immediately. His spokesman, Joe Lockhart, said, The president have no intention of resigning. By call on Livingston to reconsider, the president argue more broadly against resignation under fire. perhaps speak to both cases, Lockhart said, It would be wrong to give in to this insidious politics of personal destruction. Unless Clinton change course, this would be only the second impeachment of a president in the 209-year history of the Republic, and the first since Andrew Johnson be acquit in 1868. Sen. Trent Lott of Mississippi, the majority leader, have insist that no bargaining over censure can prevent it from starting. But the Senate could halt a trial later as part of a deal. consider the degree of partisanship display Saturday, assemble the two-thirds majority require under the Constitution for conviction be most unlikely. sixty-seven votes would be required, and there be only 55 Republicans in the Senate, along with 45 Democrats. Four articles of impeachment before the House charge Clinton with perjury in lie about his affair with Monica Lewinsky to a federal grand jury here on Aug. 17. He be also charge with perjury in the Paula Jones sexual harassment suit, obstruction of justice and abuse of power. The Republican argument, over and over, be that Clinton have lie in deny have sexual relations with Ms. Lewinsky. Rep. Dick Armey of Texas, the majority leader, said, A nation of laws cannot be rule by a person who break the law. Rep. Nancy Johnson of Connecticut said: There can be no justice without the truth. That be just profoundly so, and that be why perjury matters. Rep. Gerald Kleczka of Wisconsin begin the Democrats' arguments by saying, What the president do be wrong, both personally and morally, but his acts do not threaten our democracy and thus do not rise to the level of impeachable offenses as define by our found fathers in our Constitution. Rep. Charles Schumer, New York's senator-elect, said: The rule of law require that the punishment fit the crime. Allow us to vote for censure. Saturday's votes be the penultimate step in the most serious conflict between Congress and a president since Richard M. Nixon resign in the face of impeachment and certain conviction on Aug. 9, 1974. But while that case spin out from a 1972 break-in at democratic headquarters in the Watergate complex, this one begin with a murky land deal in Arkansas in 1978. Through the efforts of Kenneth Starr, the independent counsel under the law enact in the wake of Watergate, the investigation spread to examine Clinton's affair with a White House intern. All year it have preoccupy the capital despite an immense disconnect with public opinion; since the scandal become public in January, polls have show that the public oppose impeachment and want the inquiry bring to an end. even on Friday night, after a 13-hour debate, a CBS News Poll of 548 people show that only 38 percent want their representative to vote for impeachment; 58 percent want a no vote. The conflict now enter uncharted seas, since the Nixon resignation cut the matter short and the Johnson trial occur in a different America, with no nuclear weapons or cable television or public opinion polls. But the capital be still rife with confident speculation. Some guessed, or hoped, that the results of the recent poll, which show increases in support for resignation as a way to spare the nation a trial in which Ms. Lewinsky and Linda Tripp would be star witnesses, would weaken Clinton's resolve. Others think the Republicans, see dismal numbers in polls about their party's standing in the United States, would be the first to blink. With a majority in the Senate, they have the power to end a trial at any time after the Senate receive notice of impeachment on the day it convenes, Jan. 6, or the next day. But while Clinton have focus on the polls, and the CBS News survey show that 64 percent still approve of his handling of his job as president, resignation could almost immediately subject him to criminal prosecution. And Republicans have steadfastly ignore the polls all year, and confront them directly on Saturday. Representative J.C. Watts of Oklahoma, newly elect as chairman of the Republican caucus, said: What's popular isn't always right. You say polls be against this. Polls measure change feelings, not steadfast principle. Polls would have reject the Ten Commandments. Polls would have embrace slavery and ridicule women's rights. You say we must draw this to a close. I say we must draw a line between right and wrong, not with a tiny fine line of an executive fountain pen, but with the big fat lead of a no. 2 pencil. And we must do it so every kid in America can see it. The point be not whether the president can prevail, but whether truth can prevail. last weekend, when the Judiciary Committee recommend the four articles of impeachment, Clinton's side still hop to prevail with the help of 20 to 30 Republican moderates who be uncommitted. As the week wear on, almost all of them break against the president. One who do not, Rep. Christopher Shays of Connecticut, say Saturday: After Judge Starr's report to Congress in September, and his presentation to the Judiciary Committee in November, I conclude that impeachable offenses be not proven, and that the proven offenses be not impeachable. But the president's continue failure to come to grips with his actions, the sincerity and arguments of members of the Judiciary Committee from both sides of the aisle, the change of heart and conviction by members on my side of the aisle who originally oppose impeachment and who now support it, and the strong and powerful opinion of so many of my constituents who oppose my position and who want the president impeach cause me to rethink my position. He added: yesterday morning, before I visit with the president, I conclude that my original position be the correct one, for me. I believe that the impeachable offenses have not be proven, and that the proven offenses be not impeachable. But Rep. Tom DeLay of Texas, who have lead the Republican effort to force Clinton from office, dismiss his and other arguments as moral relativism. He begin by praise Livingston: There be no great american in my mind, at least today, than Bob Livingston, because he understand what this debate be all about. It be about honor and decency and integrity and the truth; everything that we honor in this country. It be also a debate about relativism vs. absolute truth. He continued, The president's defenders have say that the president be morally reprehensible, that he be reckless, that he have violate the trust of the American people, lessen their esteem for the office of president and dishonor the office which they have entrust him, and that but that doesn't rise to the level of impeachment. Rep. Jose Serrano of New York said, My constituents don't hate Bill Clinton; they love him and they're pray for him right at this very moment. You may have the votes today to impeach him, but you don't have the american people. And let me tell you something, I grow up in the public housing projects of the South Bronx. I can see a bunch of bullies when I see them. The bullies get theirs, and you're go to get yours, too. Rep. Henry Hyde of Illinois, the Judiciary Committee chairman who bring the charges to the House floor, say the Congress and the american people need to distinguish between private acts of infidelity and public acts by public officials. In Clinton's case, he said, the House be deal with a serial violator of the oath who be the chief law-enforcement officer. He say that the Senate could be innovative and creative in decide how best to punish Clinton, but that the House be bind by the constitution to move ahead with articles of impeachment. Justice be so important to the most humble among us, Hyde said. Equal justice under the law that's what we're fight for. Democrats, reading from the same Constitution, voice diametrically opposite conclusions, and attack the fairness of the proceedings that culminate Saturday. We're lose track of distinction between sins and crimes, say Rep. Jerrold Nadler, D-N.Y. We're lower the standards of impeachment. What the president have do be not a great and dangerous offense to the republic. Democrats also criticize Republicans for impeach Clinton at the very moment that U.S. troops wag war against Iraq. Six days before Christmas our troops be in battle, and a lame-duck Congress be rush to overthrow the commander in chief, say Rep. David Bonior of Michigan, the second-ranking House Democrat. The ghosts of Watergate hung over the House chamber. One Republican cite the parallels between the charges the House Judiciary Committee bring against Nixon 25 years ago, and the counts that the same committee bring to the House floor for affirmation on Saturday. Nixon cheated. He cheat the electoral system, say Rep. Lindsey Graham, a South Carolina Republican on the Judiciary Committee. And now, Graham said, the full House be vote to impeach Clinton because we believe he commit crimes that result in cheat our judicial system. But most of the day's debate be firmly root in Clinton's effort to conceal his sexual affair with Monica Lewinsky. Rep. Bob Barr, a Georgia Republican on the Judiciary Committee who be one of Clinton's fierce critics, hold up copies of the U.S. Criminal Code, the Judiciary Committee's report on the impeachment inquiry and, finally, the Constitution, in defend his decision to impeach the president. Today, we rely on the three pillars of our society: the law itself, evidence and the Constitution, say Barr. There be no joy in uphold the law, Watts said. If we cannot see lawlessness, our children cannot recognize it. How can we tell our children honesty be the best policy when we don't demand it as a policy? But Democrats assail the very premise on which the Republican majority build its impeachment case against Clinton. Rep. John Conyers Jr. of Michigan, the ranking Democrat on the Judiciary Committee, assail the four articles of impeachment, count by count, as unfounded by evidence and fail to rise to impeachment. He save his most savage scorn for the final count, abuse of power. The majority have simply try to dress up the perjury count in the Watergate abuse-of-power language, Conyers said. Rep. Bob Livingston, who confess to his colleagues Thursday night that he have have adulterous affairs, stun the House chamber Saturday morning by say in the impeachment debate on President Clinton that he would not serve as speaker and would quit Congress in six months. He urge the president to follow his example and quit, too. But at the White House, where call for Clinton's resignation be deride as a republican strategy, the president send a spokesman into the driveway to urge Livingston to reconsider his resignation. Livingston stand in the well of the House he have serve for two decades and call on Clinton to resign his office rather than force a trial in the Senate, draw boo from his colleagues and cat-calls that he should quit instead. He then do just that. I must set the example that I hope President Clinton will follow, Livingston announce to a shock and silent chamber in an act that leave the Republican Party in total chaos just hours before the vote to impeach Clinton. The decision also leave the party leaderless on the eve of the opening of the 106th Congress, when Republicans must govern with one of the narrow majorities in history. several Republicans, include Rep. Tom DeLay of Texas, the majority whip, somberly welcome the news, suggest it relieve them of an excruciate embarrassment. In laud Livingston's move, DeLay said, He understand what this debate be all about it's about honor and decency and integrity and the truth, everything we honor in this country. But Democrats say they be aghast, and many include Clinton call on Livingston to reconsider his decision. Mr. Livingston's resignation be wrong, declare Rep. Jerrold Nadler, D-N.Y. It be a surrender to a develop sexual McCarthyism. Are we go to have a new test if someone want to run for public office be you now or have you ever be an adulterer? He call on the country to distinguish between sins and crimes. White House press secretary Joe Lockhart say Clinton be disappoint at the news of Livingston's plans and wish that he would reconsider. Lockhart say the president firmly believe that the politics of personal destruction in this town and this country have to come to an end. He reaffirm that Clinton would not resign, saying: The president be go to do what's in the best interest of the country. It would be wrong to give in to this insidious politics of personal destruction. Livingston's announce resignation be all the more stunning for its disclosure in a process that could result in the president's removal from office. The speaker be second in line to the presidency, after the vice president. Newt Gingrich, the outgoing speaker, who be drive from the post after Republicans lose five seats in the November election, technically remain speaker until Jan. 6, when Livingston's election be to be ratify by the new Congress. But Gingrich have remove himself from the daily operations of the House at this extraordinary session and have begin to dismantle his office. Livingston's decision be say to be drive in part by the anger of a group of about a dozen conservatives in his party who be disillusion that he have withhold news of his affairs from them. They have threaten to withhold their votes for him in the election in January that would formally make him speaker. He be also concern about the pain cause to his family by further disclosures, some members said. They add that, not lose on many in his party, be the example he would set for the president by offer to resign his post now. DeLay, no. 3 in the House Republican leadership, be expect to fill the power vacuum at least temporarily, in deed if not in title, while the party regroups to find a new speaker. many members quickly rally around Rep. Dennis Hastert of Illinois. Hastert, one of DeLay's deputy whips who be well respect among his colleagues, have be promote as a candidate for majority leader last month, but never mount a campaign. Rep. Dick Armey of Texas only precariously hold on to his majority-leader post last month and be not consider a likely candidate for speaker. He be expect to manage the reorganization, which republican leaders have set for Jan. 4. Livingston meet privately with his close advisers Friday as the impeachment debate unfolded. Some of his colleagues believe he have make a mistake in disclose Thursday night just as the House be move into the divisive debate over impeachment that he have on occasion stray from my marriage. He tell republican leaders late Thursday afternoon that Hustler magazine be go to expose his affairs early next year. Some leaders urge him to keep quiet, but his wife, Bonnie, encourage him to tell his colleagues immediately, despite the momentous vote that be near on the floor. At that point Thursday night, Roll Call, a newspaper on Capitol Hill, report on its Web site that Livingston be go to admit to the affairs and be go to offer to resign. In a closed-door meeting with his fellow Republicans, he do admit to the affairs but make no offer to step down, receive three stand ovations instead. Thursday night, Livingston state that he would not be intimidate by these efforts to exploit his past. But Friday he remove himself from public action and that night draw his close advisers into his confidence. His aides say Saturday that they have no clue what be he be contemplating, and few other members be aware of his plans. ask if he have any advance word, Rep. J.C. Watts of Oklahoma, a newly elect member of the Republican leadership, said: I have no idea. ask if there have be internal party pressure on Livingston to resign, Rep. Harold Rogers, R-Ky., said: I didn't know about it if there was, but added, There be some members who be critical of it. As the leaders try Saturday to hold the party together on and off the House floor, most Republicans stick to their prepared scripts on the floor in favor of impeach the president. But some begin express their anguish. Rep. Henry Hyde, R-Ill., who admit to his own adulterous affair earlier this year, say after Livingston's resignation: Those of us who be sinners must feel wretched today. Something be go on repeatedly that have to be stopped, and that be a confusion between private acts of infidelity and public acts. To much applause, Hyde declared: Congress have no business intrude into private acts. Republicans, indeed Livingston himself, have make this same distinction between Clinton's sexual indiscretions and Livingston's, say that Clinton lie about his private acts and therefore abuse the legal system and his powers. As Livingston say in his statement Thursday: These indiscretions be not with employees on my staff and I have never be ask to testify under oath about them. Democrats hop that Livingston's seemingly drastic action would wake up the House to how poison the atmosphere have become and might prompt Republicans to reconsider the impeachment of Clinton. Rep. Paul Kanjorski, D-Pa., said, We be now start to offer up sacrificial lamb to whatever terrible disease this is. In a stirring speech applaud even by some Republicans, Rep. Dick Gephardt of Missouri, the democratic leader, praise Livingston as a worthy, good and honorable man and say his resignation be a grave mistake. It's a terrible capitulation to the negative political forces that be consume our political system and our country, Gephardt said, add that the events of the last few days show life imitates farce. We need to stop destroy imperfect people at an unattainable altar of public morality, he said, urge his colleagues to step back from the abyss and reject resignation, impeachment and vicious self-righteousness. The New York Times say in an editorial for Sunday, Dec. 20: The Republicans' drive for a partisan impeachment base soley on party-line vote power rather than any sense of proportion produce an unexpected sideshow in the resignation of Rep. Bob Livingston from his role as future speaker of the House. Analysts on both sides of the struggle over President Clinton's future will point to Livingston's downfall as evidence of a generalized breakdown in legislative civility on Capitol Hill. Democrats will see a moral symmetry, depict Livingston as a victim of the sexual puritanism he be wield against Clinton. But the one thing that no one should fall for be Livingston's invitation to use his resignation as a model for resolve the crisis at the White House. Livingston's statement rock Congress, but it should not shake the foundations of the somber constitutional process now underway. By lie under oath, Clinton make it necessary for the House to consider impeachment. The evidence convince most Americans that the president should be censured, but not remove from office. Livingston allow GOP partisans to block censure in the House. The result be that after Saturday's expect impeachment vote, after Livingston's unexpected announcement, the mission of the Senate remain the same. It must resist those Republicans who want to short-circuit the constitutional process with demands for resignation, and it must use the upcoming Senate trial as a forum for find a censure commensurate with the president's personal dishonesty and offenses against the law. These require stern punishment but not removal from office. In undertake this work, the Senate must also reassure the american people that a decisive wisdom at the core of our messy-looking political system have not melt down. In such distempered times, this be a shining opportunity for the Senate. Its members pride themselves on be the Republic's fire wall against presidential excess and the popular or partisan passions that sometimes seize the House of Representatives. No one can predict whether Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott will rise to the define challenge of his career or whether he will surrender to the mean streak he acquire during 16 grumpy years as a minority member of the House. We would like to see Lott reach for a starring role in history. Lott's growl response to questions about censure be not encouraging. He may be right that the Constitution require him to convene a trial, but nothing in that document prevent him from speedily guide the Senate toward censure negotiations. Indeed, a simple majority vote 45 Democrats plus 6 cooperating Republicans can end the Senate trial at any time, clear the way for introduction of the kind of censure resolution suggest by former Sen. Bob Dole. In an intriguing report on NBC, Tim Russert describe discussions among a bipartisan group of senators about a censure that would involve some form of presidential confession, a fine and a joint congressional request that Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr not prosecute Clinton in the courts. If Lott refuse to allow a bipartisan search for censure, the burden will fall upon respected members like Joseph Lieberman on the democratic side and Orrin Hatch for the Republicans. Through cooperation, they can guide the Senate toward a punishment that fix Clinton in history as a president who lie under oath, but avoid the taint of partisan vengeance associate with the House impeachment vote. The Senate's historic reputation for prudence require it to find appropriate punishment for a personally weak president who have damage the rule of law, but not threaten the stability of the government. House Speaker-elect Robert L. Livingston present a fresh note of shock to the impeachment debate against President Clinton on Thursday night as the republican leader be force to admit to his republican colleagues that he have carry on adulterous affairs in his past. It have suddenly come to my attention that there be individuals work together with the media who be investigate my personal background in an effort to find indiscretions which may be exploitable against me and my party on the eve of the upcoming historic vote on impeachment, Livingston declare in a statement after appear before a shocked House Republican conference to head off the disclosure as it surface in news reports. After hear his admissions in a closed session, Livingston's colleagues give him a stand ovation of support and say the question of his resigning have never arisen. My fate be in your hands, Livingston tell the Republicans, accord to lawmakers who be present. The debate over the president's fate would go forward, Republicans later insisted, draw distinctions between the speaker-elect's revelations and the sex-and-mendacity scandal that have put Clinton on the brink of impeachment. The president be charge in an impeachment resolution with perjury and abuse of power in his attempt to hide sexual indiscretions. Democrats offer no immediate comment, but Republicans be brace to hear Livingston's admissions allude to in the debate Friday by Democrats who have decry the investigation of the president as basically a partisan and unfair rummage through his sex life. Livingston, say he have seek spiritual counseling and have receive the forgiveness of his family, note he have several times tell reporters during his campaign to become speaker that I be run for speaker, not sainthood. He added, There be a reason for those words. During my 33-year marriage to my wife, Bonnie, I have on occasion stray from my marriage, and do so nearly cost me my marriage and family, Livingston say in his brief prepared statement. But he attempt to draw a contrast with the allegations against the president, asserting: I want to assure everyone that these indiscretions be not with employees on my staff and I have never be ask to testify under oath about them. The disclosure of the speaker-elect's marital infidelities, disclose in Rollcall, a Capitol Hill newspaper, send a new jolt of uncertainty among lawmakers as they prepare for the momentous debate over the president's admit misbehavior in office and whether he should be impeach and try by the Senate. Rep. Henry Hyde, the Republican chairman of the House Judiciary Committee who be to bring the impeachment charges against the president, previously be cite by a magazine for an extra-marital affair in his past. Then, as on Thursday night, Republicans voiced suspicions that democratic defenders of the president instigate media investigations in an effort to embarrass the Clinton's principal accusers. But no proof be offer as Republicans leave their conference, face the uncertainties of a debate that already promise to be bare-knuckled in its partisanship. Livingston leave the conference surround by Capitol police, not take questions from wait reporters. His chief leadership aides immediately rally in support. Some who would rather not struggle with this constitutional question continue to try to twist the debate into an unseemly investigation of private lives, say Rep. Dick Armey, the Republican majority leader. In its report on the internet Thursday night, Rollcall do not disclose its source but make an oblique reference to hustler, the sex magazine. Larry Flint, publisher of Hustler, earlier this year advertise an offer of a $1 million bounty for information about e of members of Congress guilty of sexual indiscretions. It break your heart because we're all subject to human frailties, say Asa Hutchinson, R-Ark., as he leave the conference. This be not a comfortable circumstance for anyone, he added, insist the president and the speaker-elect presented two separate issues. We've get a duty to do under the Constitution. It have get to the point where drastic action may be necessary. You know those movies about Ebola virus outbreaks, where the guys in sterile suits come in, seal off the area and completely irradiate it? They may have to do that to washington. Just eradicate us and start from scratch. In a few, short days we have manage to make the terms surreal, bizarre, split-screen America, shocking, runaway train and politics of personal destruction useless cliches. We no longer govern here. We just roll around in the gutter wonder who's next in this sexual auto-de-fe. On Saturday morning, we have the surreal, shocking, bizarre, split-screen image of Bob Livingston, the speaker-elect, step down after his marital infidelities be revealed. We be all pawns on the chessboard, Livingston said, before ask the president to resign and then resign himself. Livingston's rabid pursuit of the president, even as he hop to hide his own dirty laundry, make him an avatar of hypocrisy in a capital rot with hypocrisy. On Thursday night, when Livingston first confess his sins to Republicans in hopes of keep his hold on his post, his colleagues give him a stand ovation. And after he make his surprise announcement Saturday, the Republicans give him another ovation and step up to deliver encomiums to their lose speaker. One's self-esteem get utterly crush at times like this, sigh Henry Hyde, another tormenter of the president who also have to admit that he have succumb to temptation. Tom DeLay, the jagged-edge exterminator who may next-up in the speaker roundelay, be choke up, praise the greatness of Livingston for understand that this be a debate about relativism versus absolute truth. What could be more relative than a Republican who have hide a lot of affairs try to impeach a president for lie about his? spur by Larry Flynt's bounty for sinnuendo, the city be brace for more craziness. The Ship of Fools reach cruise speed on Friday evening, when we have the frightening scene of Republicans so crazed with hatred of the president that they be railroad through an impeachment even though the United States be at war with Iraq, even though the House chamber be mostly empty, even though Republicans be huddle in a glass house on the issue of sex and lies, and even though the White House be still pitch a tent and planning sleigh rides for a Winter Wonderland press party on Monday. (The White House be keep the journalists quarantine outside this year, but encourage them to bring their kids. To soak up some of that cozy family atmosphere, no doubt. Why be the Republicans so obsessed, when everyone in his right mind agree that impeachment be an outlandishly over-the-top punishment for Clinton and a self-destructive course for the country? Because they genuinely hate the president. They think he's a dishonest, immoral, issue-stealing, selfish child of the '60s. They don't think they're go to pay a political price for this, and if they do, they don't care. It might be a great time to see a lot of combovers, but it's not a great time to see a lot of stature. The House debate be not history. It be just a more hideous version of The McLaughlin Group. While Republicans try to draw the distinction that Clinton have perjure himself, they ignore that the president have be lure by the Starr-Jones attorney team into testify on Monica Lewinsky. Ordinarily one would feel sorry for Livingston. But the Republicans have bring this sexual doomsday machine on themselves by focus so single-mindedly on Clinton's sex life. The Republicans be so determine to do their high-tech lynching that they engage in wacky role reversals. many Republican hawk argue that Bill Clinton should not be bomb Saddam, claim the timing be suspicious, even though they have hammer him for not bomb five weeks ago. In an incredibly unseemly display, Trent Lott, the majority leader, and former Bush national security adviser Brent Scowcroft and Bush Secretary of State Lawrence Eagleburger chime in on the attack. There's too much hate here. And I hate it. We be here to debate impeachment and should not be distract from that, the minority whip, Rep. David Bonior, Democrat of Michigan, say during Saturday's House debate, in what leap out as an impossible goal. It would have take a kaleidoscopic television screen to capture the constantly shift images compete for center stage: impeachment, Iraq, the resignation of Rep. Robert Livingston, the response from the White House. The months lead up to the impeachment of President Clinton have become a series of televised anticlimaxes, but the hours before the vote make up for that lack of drama. There be hardly enough shorthand terms or split screens to cover the activity. All the networks and cable channels carry the moment that unexpectedly set the tone, as Livingston, a Louisiana Republican, announce during the debate that he would not become House speaker. The commentators have be set to carry the congressional ratification of the inevitable vote, but suddenly the most plugged-in reporters be catch off guard. As Tim Russert say to Tom Brokaw on NBC, Tom, knock us all over. In the echo chamber that television news so often becomes, the share mantra have be weightier in early morning. For only the second time in american history a president would be impeached, go the standard line. Yet despite all the pundits speculate and politicians telegraph every move, no one have hint at the Livingston resignation. The announcement was, as Brokaw put it, at least partly a political ploy, and the repercussions be immediate. Reporters begin gather word from Capitol Hill about candidates for the speaker's job, and the conversation move to the next stage of the political tug of war. The Republicans use Livingston's resignation to say that the president should resign, too; the Democrats immediately counter with the idea that the president would stay and that Livingston should as well. That lead to one of the less-expected split screens of the day, and it be not a bad choice. While Congress be debating, CNN show anti-aircraft fire in Baghdad in one box. In the other, Joe Lockhart, Clinton's press secretary, stand in the White House driveway tell reporters that the president would like Livingston to reconsider his decision. There be more stateliness in the House than television usually offers, and one reason be purely visual. Keep in mind that we do not control the picture, Dan Rather say on CBS, explain that the television cameras in Congress be provide by the House, not the individual networks. There be no way to roam and zoom in for reaction shots, as at a political convention. But the sense of history and decorum didn't last long at CBS. At noon, before the vote, CBS go to a football game, become the only network to leave the news coverage. CBS' corporate decision to try to have it both ways mean that Rather would break in with updates from Washington. I'll see you very soon, he say as he sign off the complete coverage, look like a trouper. But he be in a position no news anchor should have be in on this day. He later announce impeachment votes on a split screen with the football game in progress in the upper part of the screen. On the other networks and cable channels, the vote itself literally happen in the background. As tv screens tot up the numbers of the electronically-cast vote, members of Congress mill around and chat on the floor. even the brief democratic walkout after a motion to consider censure be defeat be thoroughly forecast. As the Democrats straggle down the steps of Congress, it look curiously undramatic on television, though it probably make a good still photograph once they be all in place. And while the votes be in progress, the jockeying for the speaker's job heat up. We already have a presumptive leader, Gwen Ifill of NBC News say in midafternoon, name Rep. Dennis Hassert, R-Ill., who have also be cite by the other networks as a likely candidate. If the political and military action have not intruded, it might have be more obvious that the debate on the House floor send a message about vast divisions in politics and morality, signal how deep a cultural fissure this crisis have opened. The impeachment, say Rep. Tom DeLay, R-Texas, be a debate about relativism vs. absolute truth. Rep. Jerrold Nadler, D-N.Y., contend that Congress have lose the distinction between sins and crimes, and argue against the sexual mccarthyism that have become prominent. And against the backdrop of the revelations of adultery that lead to Livingston's resignation, Rep. Dick Gephardt, the minority leader, declare the politics of personal destruction have to end. But as all the jabbering and political posturing continued, as reporters race to cover the president's statement about the impeachment and the late briefings from the Pentagon, there be little time to focus on the profound cultural message beneath those rhetorical flourishes. Bob Livingston, the incoming speaker of the House, take no public role Friday as the debate unfold on whether to impeach President Clinton. His previous 24 hours have be his most visible in the month since his party nominate him as speaker and perhaps the most excruciating in his public career: He spend most of the day in a chaotic procedural wrangle over the terms of Friday's debate; he end it by tell his republican colleagues that he have have extramarital affairs during his 20-year tenure in Congress. His disclosure follow an investigation by Larry Flynt, publisher of Hustler, the sex magazine, who say Friday at a news conference in Beverly Hills, Calif., that his publication have learn that Livingston have have adulterous affairs during the last 10 years. Flynt say earlier this year that he want to expose the hypocrisy of those in Washington who be investigate Clinton and in October offer $1 million to anyone who could prove they have have affairs with members of Congress. He say Friday that this large investigation, to be publish perhaps as soon as January, would reveal what he describe as indiscretions of several other Republicans. He say he have no connection with the White House but that he have hire an investigative firm base in Washington and make up of former employees of the FBI and the CIA. He would not confirm whether the firm be Terry Lenzner's Investigative Group Inc., which have do work for the president's private lawyers. Livingston be unavailable to reporters Friday. He spend some time Friday morning sprawl in a chair in the back of the House chamber, listen to the debate over whether to impeach Clinton for lie about his own sexual indiscretions. several colleagues kneel at Livingston's knee, whisper to him and pat him on the back. He spend most of the day in a private office off the chamber, avoid the gauntlet of reporters who lay in wait for him between the House and his regular office across the street. The only word out of his aides be that the Navy have award contracts worth millions of dollars for ships to be build in his Louisiana district at the Avondale Shipyards. During Friday's debate, a handful of Democrats make only oblique allusions to human failures. For example, Rep. John Lewis, D-Ga., said: Let he that have no sin cast the first stone. Who, who among us have not sinned? But no one say that Livingston's disclosure or the mild democratic attempts to exploit it would influence their votes on impeachment. Rather, on the House floor and in hallway chitchat, Livingston's conduct seem to be the last thing that either Republicans or Democrats want to talk about. Bob Livingston be a first-rate human being, say Rep. David Obey, D-Wis., who have work closely and spar with Livingston on the Appropriations Committee, in an interview. I will repeat what the nuns taught me at St. James a long time ago: We would all be a hell of a lot good off look after our own souls rather than try to evaluate somebody else's. none of us have any business even have an opinion on it. even conservative Republicans seem ready to overlook the disclosure. We're not go to say, `Bob, you can't be speaker because you violate your vows with your wife,' say Rep. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C. Like many, include Livingston, Graham distinguish Livingston's conduct from Clinton's by say that the president have trample on the legal system whereas Livingston's behavior be strictly private. Despite Flynt's claims, many Republicans blame the Clinton administration for smear Livingston, although they offer no evidence. This isn't just happen on its own, say Rep. Dana Rohrabacher, R- Calif. The only thing certain now be uncertainty. The smart money shout that President Clinton will never resign, and he concurs. The smart money argue that the Senate could not muster the 67 votes that would be need to remove the wounded president from office, which would require the defection of 12 Democrats if all the Republicans stand against him. The smart money insist that someone will cut a deal to end all this. Maybe so. But the smart money whispers, Remember. Remember that everyone in Washington, include Rep. Henry Hyde, R-Ill., chairman of the Judiciary Committee, say the House would never, ever, treat impeachment as a partisan issue. Wrong. Remember that all the pundits predict democratic losses in the midterm elections, and when the opposite happened, they say impeachment be dead. Twice wrong. And remember that in the New Year the nation may travel down a road it have never travel before. One other president, Andrew Johnson of Tennessee, have be try by the Senate, of course. But that happen in a different country one with only 37 states, with primitive communications, with a simple economy base largely on agriculture, with only minimal commitments abroad. In the toxic politics of century's end in Washington, the inconceivable have become the commonplace. The wholly unanticipated announcement Saturday morning by Rep. Robert Livingston, R-La., that he would not serve as speaker and would resign from Congress, follow his equally unanticipated disclosure on Thursday night of several extramarital affairs, only deepen the capital's profound sense of insecurity. The deadly sweep of the scythe of neo-puritanism appear unstoppable, at least for the moment, and Livingston's forthcoming resignation will increase the pressure on the president to do likewise. You've set before us an example, the leader of House Republican majority, Rep. Dick Armey of Texas, tell Livingston Saturday. The example be that principle come before power. The Democrats make the opposite point, argue that the Livingston case show how very wrong it be to savage people for personal pecaddillos. One transcendently important thing remain the same: Although surround by judicial trappings and preside over by the chief justice, trials of presidents be political processes, with power residing in the hands of elective politicians. In addition to narrow legal issues of guilt or innocence, they can weigh considerations of party, the nation's future, their own individual political well-being and almost anything else they care to weigh in reach a verdict. The longer they took, the more numerous the call for resignation would probably be. even before Saturday's epochal roll-calls, four of ten Americans interview in the late New York Times/CBS News Poll say they think the president should step down if he be to be indicted, despite the fact that a large majority voice disapproval of the impeachment proceedings. What lie behind that seem contradiction, of course, be the fear that Clinton, and the country with him, would be incapacitated. No one take Andrew Johnson very seriously after he escape conviction by a single vote. But Clinton, a man of powerful will whose whole life have be a series of comebacks, have already embark on an effort to show that he can do the nation's business. Richard Nixon claw his way back to respectability after leave the White House when no one think he could; Clinton intend to re-establish his authority while still in office. He have one great advantage: Two-thirds of the American public continue to voice its approval of his political stewardship, whatever it think of him as a man. The president will press hard, despite his much-reduced leverage, for a deal on censure. Indeed, in as fine a piece of political irony as one could ask for, he have already seek to enlist former Sen. Bob Dole, the Republican he defeat in 1996, as an emissary to the Senate majority. The numbers be not unpromising: with the help of six Republicans, the 45 Democrats could end the trial at any time and pass a censure resolution that the House would surely take up. There be enough Republican moderates and sometime party-buckers to make that a plausible target. But the republican leader in the Senate, Trent Lott of Mississippi, who have make his unwillingness to take the president's word plainly evident in recent days, be determine to fight such a trial-aborting arrangement. It be clear that Clinton's reputation have be stain forever, no matter what the Senate does. The spot will not out. History will remember this man who so covet a glow legacy not as an impresario of economic growth, not as the Moses who point the way to the 21st century, but as the second president ever to be impeached, if not as the first to be ousted. That harsh word, impeachment, will cling to his name as surely as Teapot Dome clings to Harding's and Depression to Hoover's. But he be not alone in have suffer grievous injury in the political avalanche that be shake loose by the disclosure of Clinton's sexual relationship with a former White House intern, Monica Lewinsky. The Republicans' public support have shrivel to 40 percent in the new Times/CBS News poll, its low level in 14 years, and it could go low once the fact of impeachment sinks in. Journalists be see by many as jackals, indifferent to whatever personal suffering or national angst they may cause as long as they get the story, and none too concerned about accuracy. In fact, the whole political culture of the 1990s, with its criminalization of political conduct and its seem indifference to important national and international issues, have fall into disrepute with ordinary Americans. The last week seem to crystallize the long-term decline in political civility. Republicans call Clinton a liar, even as he be commit american pilots to the skies over Iraq, and Democrats accuse their rivals of conduct a political lynching or a political coup d'etat. Bipartisanship may have be the big victim of all. Party lines on Saturday's rolls call hold as firm as leg irons. Almost all of the Republicans who oppose impeachment do so not exclusively on legal principle but at least partly because of special political circumstances the democratic majority in Rep. Constance Morella's district in the Maryland suburb of Washington, for example, and the gratitude of Rep. Peter King, R-N.Y., for Clinton's peacemaking in Ireland. It be hard to see who have emerge from it with reputation enhanced, except perhaps Hillary Rodham Clinton, staunch in the face of deception. If some of the threats and dire predictions utter by House Democrats in recent days be to be take at face value, the nation be enter upon an era of Bad Feelings, the polar opposite of a second era of Good Feelings, similar to that of the 1820s, that Clinton have hop to preside over. Rep. Tom Sawyer, D-Ohio, compare Clinton on Friday to Sir Thomas More, execute for treason in 1535 because of his religious beliefs. He quote More's words as an admonition for today: What you have hunt me for be not my actions but for the thoughts of my heart. It be a long road you have opened. God help the statesmen who walk your road. But amidst all the loose talk about permanent damage to this institution or that, remember: Things change with startle speed in modern american politics, and the institutions of american government have prove extraordinarily resilient. President Nixon, it be almost universally agree in 1974, have weaken the american presidency for many decades to come. Nobody say that after eight years under Ronald Reagan, and that be only 15 years later. In the end, the will of the people mean nothing. Bob Livingston couldn't have be clearer about that. His mind and the minds of his followers be closed. even as the bomb continue in Iraq and Americans from coast to coast be clamor for an alternative to impeachment, even as his own adulterous past be be flush out in the grotesque invasions of privacy that inevitably follow the relentlessly prurient pursuit of the president, even as the country begin to contemplate the destructive effects of a lengthy and bitter Senate trial, the speaker-designate arrogantly and stupidly proclaimed: Let us disregard the outside influences. The radicals on the Hill would hear nothing but the echoes of their own fanaticism. Impeach! Impeach! And that continue even after the stunning announcement Saturday morning that Livingston would quit the House. Dismayed by the partisan stampede, Dick Gephardt, the democratic leader, warn during the impeachment debate on Friday: In your effort to uphold the Constitution, you be trample the Constitution. David Bonior, the democratic whip, said: This be wrong. It be unfair. It be unjust. At a time when events in the world and the challenges at home demand that we stand united, censure be the one solution that can bring us together. To my colleagues across the aisle, I say let go of your obsession. Listen to the american people. But the voices of reason would not be heard. Livingston and his right-wing colleagues, the Tom DeLays, the Henry Hydes, the Bob Barrs, be on a mission of destruction and would not be denied. Ordinary Americans could cry out all they wanted. They could protest and demonstrate, send faxes and E-mails. It didn't matter. The right be on the march and democracy be on the run. Rep. Thomas Barrett, a Democrat from Wisconsin, try to remind his republican colleagues that the Constitution do not allow you to remove a president from office because you can't stand him. He was, of course, ignored. The Republicans will pay a huge price for their brazen, utterly partisan attempt to drag a president from the White House in defiance of the will of the people. The party's contempt for the voters be arrogantly but quite adequately sum up by Alan Simpson, the former senator from Wyoming, who said: The attention span of Americans be which movie be come out next month and whether the quarterly report on their stock will change. If the voters be the dopes that Mr. Simpson think they are, then come 2000 everyone will have forget there be an impeachment crisis. But Rep. Robert Menendez, D-N.J., be probably closer to the truth when he said, I warn my colleagues that you will reap the bitter harvest of the unfair partisan seeds you sow today. One of the many strange events of the past couple of weeks be the way in which virtually all of the previously undecided Republicans, the so-called moderates, surrender their independence and line up like lackeys to follow the right wing's lead. All proclaim loudly that they be vote on principle, but in fact it be an exercise in mass cowardice, exemplify by Rep. John McHugh of upstate New York. McHugh announce on Tuesday that he would vote for impeachment. But if his decision be base on principle, he have an odd way of express it. The Washington Post say McHugh appear to have no stomach for a Senate conviction or removal of the president from office. Of his colleagues in the Senate, McHugh said, I, for one, would accept, even welcome, their mercy. In other words, let the Senate do the heavy constitutional lifting. McHugh may have wish out loud for mercy, but he clearly be too frighten of the right-wingers in the House to cast a compassionate vote himself. The GOP can no longer conceal that it be a party of extremists, of right-wing absolutists, a party out of step with the political and cultural orientation of most Americans. Bob Livingston may be leaving, but his arrogant comment can still serve as his party's slogan. Let us disregard the outside influences. Let us disregard the people. ","During the Clinton impeachment debate in the House, Speaker-elect Bob Livingston declared that he would set an example for the president and resign from Congress over revelations of his marital infidelities.Republican demands that the president also resign were rejected by Democrats who also said that Livingston should not quit and that the Speaker-elect's resignation was, in the words of Jerrold Nadler (D-N.Y), ""a surrender to sexual McCarthyism"".With the House vote to impeach, the president will face a Senate trial, but it is unlikely that 67 members will vote for conviction.The trial could be mercifully shortened, however, by a vote of censure.","As impeachment proceedings in the House approached a climax, House members were stunned by an admission from House Speaker elect Livingston that he was guilty of an adulterous affair.The admission follows disclosures by Hustler published Larry Flynn, who had offered one million dollars to anyone who could provide such information on a House or Senate member.Livingston's admission was met with a standing ovation by House members, as was his subsequent resignation.In resigning, Livingston called on President Clinton to do the same.Political pundits see the whole process as driven by partisan politics.","House Speaker-elect Robert L. Livingston was forced to admit to his Republican colleagues his past adultery.This was forced by an investigation by Larry Flynt.When Livingston called for Clinton to quit, House Democrats yelled, ""You resign""!Stunningly, he did.TV commentators were caught off guard.Livingston put pressure on Clinton to follow his example.The House moved to impeach Clinton and called on the Senate to try him.Livingston's downfall was said to show a breakdown in legislative civility.Those who want impeachment were called radicals and fanatics.Livingston's pursuit of Clinton was characterized as ""rabid"", showing his own hypocrisy.","House Speaker-elect Robert Livingston shocked his Republican colleagues in the midst of a Clinton impeachment debate by admitting to adulterous affairs during his Congressional tenure.He later urged Clinton to follow his example and resign that increased the fury of the impeachment debate.The House moved to impeach the President for perjury and called on the Senate to try him, convict him and remove him from office.Some who believe the debate shows the fanatical, partisan, and hateful side of Republican behavior, advise the Senate only to censure Clinton and thus avoid partisan vengeance.The issue deepens a cultural fissure and a sense of uncertainty."
47,"The first part of the international space station be smoothly orbit earth on Friday after a faultless launch that mark the start of a new age in space exploration and colonization. A russian Proton booster rocket carry the module into its initial orbit 200 kilometers (125 miles) above the earth and the unit be operate as planned, officials said. Russia's Zarya, or Sunrise, module be to fly alone for two weeks before a rendezvous with the american space shuttle Endeavour, which be to be launch Dec. 3 carry the Unity connecting module. Space officials from 16 nations take part in the project cheer as the rocket soar into the cloudy sky above the central asian steppe from the Baikonur launch pad Friday a year later than planned. During the, pickup 4th pvs Endeavour's astronauts connect the first two building blocks of the international space station on Sunday, create a seven-story tower in the shuttle cargo bay. It be the first time that the Russian-built Zarya control module and the made-in-america Unity chamber have ever touched. It look to be a perfect and, hopefully, long-lasting fit. We have capture of Zarya, commander Robert Cabana announce the moment the two pieces come together. Congratulations to the crew of the good ship Endeavour, reply Mission Control. That's terrific. The 240-mile-high construction job begin two hours earlier with Nancy Currie's capture of Zarya (russian for Sunrise) use the shuttle robot arm. We're halfway home, Cabana said. then come the hard part: stack the two giant cylinders in the cargo bay. The two station pieces be so big 77 feet from the tip of one to the tip of the other with a combined mass of 70,000 pounds that Currie and her crewmates have to rely on a computerize vision system and camera views, rather than direct line of sight. This be the first time such a blind docking have ever be attempted. Currie position the solar-winged Zarya, still on the end of the shuttle robot arm, several inches directly above Unity. It be slow going; she want and need perfect alignment. Once she be sure she have it, Cabana fire Endeavour's thrusters, and the brief burst raise the shuttle and thereby Unity enough for the dock mechanisms on the two station components to snap together. The historical moment occur above the South Pacific. The union intend to last the station's 15-year or more lifetime set the stage for a spacewalk by two astronauts on Monday to attach electrical connectors and cables between the two components. Mission Control think Sunday's work might take hours long than plan and give the six astronauts plenty of time for the tasks. But everything occur more or less when and how it be suppose to, aside from a piece of space junk that stray too close. Before begin their final approach to zarya, the six astronauts have to steer clear of a chunk of a rocket launch last month from California. Mission Control order the pilots to fire the shuttle thrusters to put an extra three miles between Endeavour and the space junk, put Endeavour a total of five miles from the orbit debris. The small gap would have be probably a little too close for comfort, Mission Control said. The big worry, by far, be over Endeavour's pursuit and capture of Zarya, and its coupling with Unity. The shuttle's 50-foot robot arm have never before handle an object as massive as the 41-foot, 44,000-pound Zarya, a power and propulsion module that be launch from Kazakstan on Nov. 20. It will provide all of the necessary electricity and steer for the fledgling space station until a permanent control module can be launch next summer. Minutes after Zarya's capture, Cabana call down that two antennas on the module be still undeployed as russian flight controllers have feared. The antenna must be fully deploy in order for Zarya's manual docking system to work; that system won't be need before next summer, officials said. The only other problem be with a Zarya battery; the astronauts take up a replacement part. The 36-foot, 25,000-pound Unity, the first american-made component, will serve as a connect passageway, or vestibule, for future modules. It be crucial that Zarya and Unity be joined; if they could not be connect with the robot arm, NASA would have send out two spacewalk astronauts to manually fit them together. In all, three spacewalks be plan for Endeavour's 12-day flight, not only to hook up electrical connections between the two modules but to install handrails and other tools for future crews. The joined modules will be release from Endeavour once all of the work be completed. NASA estimate 43 more launches and 159 more spacewalks will be need after this mission to assemble the entire orbiting complex. Once completed, the 16-nation space station will have a mass of 1 million pounds, be long than a football field, and house up to seven astronauts and cosmonauts. russian space officials give the first module of the international space station a routine tweak Saturday to push it into high orbit, and convene a meeting on earth to map out its future. Flight controllers fire one of the module's two maneuver engines to raise it to an orbit about 230 kilometers (157 miles) in space, the station's public affairs office said. russian Space Agency general director Yuri Koptev tell reporters the maneuver be carry out with great accuracy, and the 24-ton core module be cruise through space without any problems. The module, call Zarya, or Sunrise, lift off Friday from the Baikonur launchpad in Kazakstan into an initial orbit 200 kilometers (125 miles) above Earth. Zarya be to serve as a space tugboat in the early stages of the international project, provide propulsion, power and communications. It will fly alone for two weeks before a rendezvous with the american space shuttle Endeavour, which be to be launch Dec. 3 carry the Unity connecting module. The international space station be a u.s.-led successor to Russia's Mir space station, and be be herald by space officials as the vehicle for unprecedented international cooperation in space in the 21st century. The heads of the space agencies of the United States, Russia, Japan and Canada, along with the european Space Agency, meet in Moscow on Saturday to discuss the project, the Interfax news agency reported. The space agency heads agree on a schedule for future meetings and on hold a scientific conference on the project somewhere in Europe, at an unspecified date. also Saturday, the head of Russia's Mission Control, Vladimir Lobachev, be quote as say that Russia would take the lead role in manage the international space station during its first five years. Previously, space officials have say the station would be jointly control from Moscow and Houston, with the U.S. space agency NASA take a lead role. accord to Interfax, Lobachev say it make sense for Russia to control the project because the russian-built Zarya and a russian-built service module would perform most of the life support and navigational functions for the station's first five years. Furthermore, russian engineers be more experienced in this job and NASA officials be aware of this, he said. The space station be expect to cost at least dlrs 40 billion, of which the United States be expect to pay dlrs 24 billion. Russia's financing problems delay the initial launch by a year, and some critics have say the station amount to an expensive way for NASA to keep Russia's beleaguered space program alive. The station will serve as an orbital home for visit astronauts and cosmonauts for at least 15 years. Endeavour's astronauts connect the first two building blocks of the international space station on Sunday, create a seven-story tower in the shuttle cargo bay.

Once completed, the 16-nation space station will have a mass of 1 million pounds, be long than a football field, and house up to seven astronauts and cosmonauts. russian space experts be make final preparations Thursday at the Baikonur rocket base to launch the first component of a multibillion dollar international space station after a year of delay. build by a russian company and to be launch atop a russian booster rocket, the 24-ton Zarya (Sunrise) control and cargo module be a u.s.-funded component of the station. It will serve as a space tugboat in the early stages of the project, provide propulsion, power and communications. The unmanned launch, set for 9:40 Moscow time (0640 GMT) Friday from Baikonur in Kazakhstan, have be delay for one year mainly because of the cash-strapped russian space agency's failure to complete another part of the station. After years of discussing, planning and replanning, we be about to launch hardware, Gretchen McClain, deputy associate administrator for the new station, say at a news conference earlier this week. We be ready to begin a project that will bring us into the millennium with women and men live and work in space permanently. russian officials add their traditional note of superstition. It be not in the russian tradition to preface a launch with ... some advance statements. I would like to knock on wood, which be rather common in the russian tradition, say Alexander Krasnov, a deputy chief of russian Space Agency's man flight department. The station, involve 16 nations with the United States and Russia play the big roles, will consist of more than 100 elements that will take 45 assembly flights to complete. It be due to be complete by 2004. The station will weigh 500 tons (more than a million pounds) and be expect to cost at least dlrs 40 billion, with the United States plan to pay dlrs 21 billion. It will serve as an orbital home for visit astronauts and cosmonauts for up to 20 years. Zarya be to fly alone for two weeks before a rendezvous with the american space shuttle Endeavor, which be to be launch Dec. 3 carry the Unity connecting module. The shuttle crew will attach the two modules together in three space walks, use the Endeavors robot arm. The 12.4-meter (41.2-feet) Zarya hold more than 6 tons of fuel in its 16 tanks and be capable of fly independently for 430 days. Its control system consist of 36 thrusters and two large engines for major orbital changes. It will be launch by a three-stage heavy-lift Proton booster rocket that would put Zarya into orbit in less than 10 minutes after the blastoff. In the ensue days, the ground controllers will gradually adjust its orbit in preparation for the meeting with Endeavor. The space station will not be inhabitable until early 2000, follow the launch of a russian crew module which be set to blast off next July or August. Russia have repeatedly fail to meet deadlines for construct the crew module, put the whole project behind schedule. have lose hope of get the promised government funds, the russian space agency have sell its early research time on the station to NASA for dlrs 60 million to complete the segment. Agency chief Yuri Koptev say that take part in the new station be the only hope for the beleaguered russian space industry, whose funding have collapse since the Soviet collapse. The project would allow Russia to keep up to 80,000 jobs over the next 15 years. Koptev assail some russian space engineers who continue to insist that more money should be put into Russia's own batter 12-year old Mir space station to extend its lifetime instead of commit more funds to the new space outpost. The choice mustn't be determine by emotions. Some people be glue to one thing (mir) and don't care about the rest, Koptev say at a recent news conference. We must proceed from the understanding of what would take us into the future, allow us to preserve our industry. The russian Khrunichev company have earn over dlrs 200 million for building Zarya, whose design be base on early soviet spacecraft, include some of the Mir's six modules. WASHINGTON NASA and the russian Space Agency have agree to set aside a last-minute russian request to launch an international space station into an orbit closer to Mir, officials announce Friday. While put the new station closer to Russia's 12-year-old Mir station would make it easy to transfer equipment and supplies from the old outpost to the new one, the request come too late to be act on, say Randy Brinkley, NASA's space station program manager. NASA be surprise last week when Russia's prime station contractor propose the orbital position change just two-and-a-half weeks before launch of the first part of the new station. delay the Nov. 20 flight by 10 hours to match the orbits would have force similar shifts in the subsequent assembly flights, and result in potentially unfavorable sun angles on the solar-powered station, engineers said. We have mutually conclude that it would not be prudent to make these changes, Brinkley say during a news conference hold at the Johnson Space Center in Houston. It add technical complexity and risks to the mission that be not justified. The decision, which follow frank and candid discussions between the two partners, be not impose by the United States, he said. The conclusions be mutual, Brinkley said. Both sides conclude that it do not make sense. The Russians, struggle to find money for their space program with their nation in economic collapse, have say they want to transfer thousands of pounds of newer equipment and scientific instruments from Mir as an economy move. However, some critics question the Russians' motives, wonder if the requested orbital change be part of plan to delay the decommissioning and destruction of Mir, which the Russians have agree to do next summer. The Russians have so little money that the United States and other partners in the international station fear that money spend on Mir will prevent Russia from meet its obligations with the new project. The Mir compete with the international space station for very critical resources and for funding, Brinkley said. NASA will consider ideas for salvage Mir's research equipment to use on the international space station, he said, but only if it do not interfere with assemble the new station. The United States and 15 other nations plan to begin build the new station in orbit next week when the Russians launch a module that will supply power and propulsion during the early stages of the five-year construction period. The space shuttle Endeavor be to follow on Dec. 3 with the second station part, a u.s.-built connecting passageway that attach to the first module. The first piece of the international space station be orbit Earth Friday, sprout antenna and unfold solar power panels as it await other segments, which will eventually grow into the large orbital laboratory in history. The module, call Zarya from the russian term mean sunrise or dawn, take a flawless ride into space atop a three-stage russian Proton booster rocket that lift off at 1:40 a.m. eastern time from the Baikonur cosmodrome in Kazakhstan. The launching be witness by the heads of the space agencies of the 16 nations that be sponsor the station, which will cost at least $40 billion to build over the next five years. Zarya, build in Russia with $240 million from the United States, be to be join in two weeks by the first american module, a docking hub call Unity. The space shuttle Endeavour be to take off on Dec. 3 to rendezvous with Zarya and attach the two units. This be to be follow by 43 more flights by American and russian rockets carry more than 100 parts to be assemble in space to form a 900,000-pound research station housing up to seven astronauts. Daniel Goldin, the administrator of NASA, say at a news conference follow the launching, now we only have 44 launches to go, about 1,000 hours of space walks and countless problems. But because of all the partner nations trust each other and work together, he said, the international space station be go to be a reality. even as the new space station be come together, questions continue about the fate of Russia's exist space laboratory, the 12-year-old Mir. Because of the collapse of the Russian economy, doubts that Russia can produce enough rockets and other equipment to support both projects lead Russia to promise that it would abandon Mir and destroy the station by next summer. However, in recent weeks russian officials have be lobby to find ways to extend Mir's life. accord to a report by the news agency Reuters, President Boris Yeltsin's space adviser, Yevgeny Shaposhnikov, say Friday he be prepare a number of proposals on extend Mir's life past the year 2000. Support for such options have be grow in recent weeks among russian space officials, astronauts and nationalists, who see Mir as a symbol of russian achievements in space. James Van Laak, NASA's deputy manager of operations for the space station, say Friday that the agency have not receive any formal proposals about extend Mir's life. NASA would find such a proposal unacceptable if it have any measurable impact on the international space station, Van Laak say in a telephone interview from the Johnson Space Center in Houston, No one have any objection to Mir or keep it operational if the Russians find a way to support both projects, but they have to demonstrate they can. Yuri Koptev, head of the russian Space Agency, say the launching of Zarya, a 42,000-pound space tugboat that will supply power and propulsion in the early stages of station construction, be a needed vindication for the troubled russian space program. The russian space industry be alive and well and be perfectly able to fulfill all of its commitments on the international space station, Koptev said. A Russian Proton booster rocket carry the first part of the international space station into orbit Friday, herald the start of a new era in international space colonization. russian space officials and others cheer as ground control announce that the capsule have separate from its booster rocket and reach its first orbit at about 200 kilometers (125 miles) above the Earth. Success, shout one exultant official some 10 minutes after the giant rocket blast off and enter orbit. The heads of the space agencies of 16 nations participate in the project watch the lift-off from a distance of about 5 kilometers (3 miles). Strategic Rocket Forces troops who have prepare the launch be in underground bunkers to avoid poisoning by the highly toxic rocket fuel. Russian and U.S. officials say the launch be flawless and the module perform well during initial tests. They caution that much work remain to be do to get the ambitious space station project up and working. now we only have 44 launches to go, about 1,000 hours of space walks and countless problems, but because of the trust and mutual respect ... the international space station be go to be a reality, NASA chief Daniel Goldin tell a press conference after the launch. His russian counterpart, Yuri Koptev, say the launch be a vital vindication for the troubled russian space industry, prove it could play a major role in space operations. today we make a truly epoch-making step to carry out this project. The russian space industry be alive and well and be perfectly able to fulfill all of its commitments on the international space station, he said. The launch go smoothly, with the rocket soar into the cloudy sky above the central asian steppes. The huge roar of the rocket reverberate for dozens of kilometers (miles) across the empty plain around the base. The mood at the launch pad be tense before the launch, with space officials and workers anxiously make last-minute checks to ensure there be no problems. Solar power panels on the module be successfully deploy shortly after it reach its first orbit and all systems be work normally, officials said. The launch of the Russian cargo module, which have be delay for more than a year, ushers in a new era of cooperation among former space-race rivals. Space officials express optimism that cooperation would far promote world stability follow the end of the Cold War. We still have some contradictions, we still have combat missiles aim at each other, but the predominant trend be the state of cooperation and do things together, say Yuri Semyonov of Russia's Energia space company. The 12.4-meter (41.2-feet) Zarya, or Sunrise, be launch by a three-stage Proton booster rocket. Zarya be design to serve as a space tugboat in the early stages of the project, provide propulsion, power and communications. Engineers finish final preparations early Friday for the liftoff of the 24-ton module. The rocket blast off under cloudy skies and strong winds, and disappear behind the clouds 40 seconds later. The international space station, the u.s.-led successor to Russia's beleaguer Mir, involve 16 nations and be due to be complete by 2004. It will consist of more than 100 elements that will take 45 assembly flights to complete. Russia's crucial participation have be hamper by the country's financial problems. The launch of the first segment be postpone repeatedly, mainly because the chronically break russian space agency couldn't afford to complete another part of the station that be to go up later. Zarya be to fly alone for two weeks before a rendezvous with the american space shuttle Endeavor, which be to be launch Dec. 3 carry the Unity connecting module. The space station will not be inhabitable until at least early 2000, follow the launch of a russian crew module which be set to blast off next July or August. The space station be expect to cost at least dlrs 40 billion, with the United States plan to pay dlrs 24 billion. It will serve as an orbital home for visit astronauts and cosmonauts for at least 15 years. Russia have repeatedly fail to meet deadlines for construct the crew module, put the whole project behind schedule. have lose hope of get promised government funds, the russian space agency have sell research time on the station to NASA for dlrs 60 million to complete the segment. Russia rent the Baikonur launch pad from Kazakstan. Endeavour and its astronauts close in Sunday to capture the first piece of the international space station, the russian-made Zarya control module that have to be connect to the Unity chamber aboard the shuttle. stack the two giant cylinders 240 miles above the earth be consider the most difficult part of the mission. The job fell to Nancy Currie, the shuttle crane operator who have deftly hoist and reposition Unity in the cargo bay on Saturday. The two station pieces be so big 77 feet from the tip of one to the tip of the other with a combined mass of 70,000 pounds that Currie and her crewmates be go to have to rely on a computerize vision system and camera views, rather than direct line of sight. such a blind docking have never be attempt before. Mission Control give the astronauts plenty of time for the tasks. The main thing I've try to do for the last two years work on this flight be make sure we have time. We have margin on everything, say flight director Bob Castle. Before begin their final approach to Zarya Russian for Sunrise the shuttle's six astronauts have to steer clear of a chunk of a rocket launch last month from California. Mission Control order the pilots to fire the shuttle thrusters to put an extra three miles between Endeavour and the space junk, put Endeavour a total of five miles from the orbit debris. The small gap would have be probably a little too close for comfort, Mission Control said. The big worry, by far, be over Endeavour's pursuit and capture of Zarya, and its coupling with Unity. The shuttle's 50-foot robot arm have never before be assign to handle an object as massive as the 44,000-pound Zarya, a power and propulsion module that be launch from Kazakhstan on Nov. 20. It will provide all the necessary electricity and steer for the fledgling space station until a permanent control module can be launch next summer. The 36-foot, 25,000-pound Unity will serve as a connect passageway, or vestibule, for future modules. In case Zarya and Unity could not be connect with the robot arm, two spacewalking astronauts would have to manually fit them together. The astronauts would be go out anyway Monday to attach electrical connectors and cables between the two components. In all, three spacewalks be plan for Endeavour's 12-day flight. NASA estimate 43 more launches and 159 more spacewalks will be need after this mission to assemble the entire orbiting complex. Once completed, the 16-nation space station will have a mass of 1 million pounds, be long than a football field, and house up to seven astronauts and cosmonauts. Two astronauts venture back out on another spacewalk Wednesday to attach antennas to the international space station under construction nearly 250 miles above Earth. For the second time this week, Jerry Ross and James Newman float out the hatch of the shuttle Endeavour to work on the seven-story, 35-ton station take shape in the open cargo bay. Their no. 1 priority be to attach two 100-pound antennas to unity, the american-made side of the space station. Their other job, time permitting, be trickier: try to open a stuck antenna on Zarya, the Russian-built control module. The plan seven-hour spacewalk be not nearly as difficult or crucial as Monday night's outing, during which Ross and Newman hook up 40 electrical connections between Zarya and Unity. The plan call for the men to lug two suitcase-size antennas about halfway up Unity and install them on opposite sides of the 36-foot cylinder. Once activated, the antennas will provide a direct, virtually uninterrupted communication link between Unity and NASA's Mission Control. Otherwise, U.S. flight controllers would have to rely on the sporadic coverage provide by russian ground stations. The electronic and computer hookups for the antenna will be make inside Unity on Thursday, after the entire crew enter the orbit station for the first time. other spacewalk chores for Ross and Newman on Wednesday evening include erect a sunshade over a computer mount to the outside of Unity. Mission Control decide just before the spacewalk to let Newman take a crack at unjamming the Zarya antenna. Flight controllers urge caution. The antenna be roll up on a spool, and engineers worry the 3-foot strip might pop open with enough force to hurt him if he get too close. Newman have a 10-foot grappling hook for the job. The antenna be one of two that fail to open properly follow Zarya's Nov. 20 launch from Kazakstan. One more spacewalk be plan for Endeavour's 12-day mission: On Saturday, Ross and Newman will conduct a photo survey and take out a sack of tools that will be use by future station visitors. Newman also may try to unjam the other Zarya antenna. This be the sixth spacewalk for Ross during his 18-year NASA career, the most by an American, and the third for Newman. ",NASA and the Russian Space Agency readied the first part of an international space station for launch from Baikonur base.They decided not to change the orbit of the Zarya module as Russia had requested.Zarya's Nov. 20 launch was a success.The Zarya module orbited Earth for 2 weeks before a rendezvous with U.S. shuttle Endeavor to join it to the Unity module.It was tweaked and working well.It will serve as a space tugboat.The first 2 building blocks of the international space station were successfully joined by Endeavor astronauts in the shuttle's open cargo bay.Endeavor astronauts made 2 of 3 planned spacewalks to work on the space station modules.,"Russia launched the first piece of the international space station into orbit a year after the originally scheduled date.The launch follows a last minute Russian request to change the orbit of the space station to put it closer to Mir.This request was set aside.Two weeks later, the U.S. carried the Unity chamber into orbit.U.S. astronauts aboard the Endeavor shuttle then joined the Unity chamber to the Russian Zarya control module.The resulting 7 story structure appeared to be a perfect fit.In a subsequent second space walk, the astronauts were to install antennas on the Unity chamber as well as to attempt to unjam a Russian antenna.","Jerry Ross and James Newman spacewalked to attach antennas to Unity, the American half of the first stage of the 16-nation space station.Unity will be a connecting passageway for other modules.The other portion of the fledgling station, the Russian- built and launched Zarya module, will provide power and propulsion to the facility.The successful launch of Zarya, which had been delayed over a year due to funding woes, was hailed by the Russian Space Agency head as proof that the Russian space industry ""is perfectly able to fulfill all of its commitments on the international space station"".Russia is scheduled to launch the crew module next year.","After a year's delay Russia launched the first unit of the international space station, then pushed it to a higher orbit.Zarya will provide propulsion, power, and comms.US shuttle Endeavour made a blind docking with Zarya.Two spacewalks made electrical connections with Unity, which will serve as a passageway, attached its antennas and attempted to open a stuck Zarya antenna.A Russian cost-cutting proposal to orbit the station closer to Mir jointly vetoed.Russia promised to destroy Mir but now wants to extend its life.Russia sold early research time on the station to NASA to pay construction costs but claims the management lead for 1st 5 years."
48,"Caught in the middle of an economic crisis, many brazilian factories fear they won't be able to pay their workers the mandatory year-end bonus. So they're consider pay with products instead of cash. Some workplaces have already offer their employees such things as hammers, nails, screws and bolts instead of the traditional cash bonus that normally be equivalent to one month's wage, say the head of Brazil's large federation of trade unions. The idea be completely unacceptable, say Joao Antonio Felicio, secretary-general of the federation, which represent more than 2,000 unions and 19 million workers. We will recommend our unions reject such a preposterous proposal. But strap for cash and punish by high interest rates and decline sales, factory owners may have no other choice, say Joseph Curi, president of the Sao Paulo State Association of Small Industries, which represent 110,000 factories that employ nearly 800,000 workers. Access to credit be almost impossible, Curi said. If banks and the government don't create some kind of emergency credit line, the only option many of our associates will have will be to use products to pay the bonus. Factories that produce clothes, shoes, food, toys and household appliances be the most enthusiastic about the idea, Curi said. Curi predict even harsh times for Brazil with the belt-tightening austerity package newly re-elected President Fernando Henrique Cardoso be expect to announce Tuesday. The measures, aim at curb the country's ballooning budget deficit equal to about 7 percent of gross domestic product be expect to include spending cuts and, possibly, more taxes. There be a lot of talk of increase taxes, which mean less cash circulating in the market and more credit restrictions, Curi said. It be a shortsighted approach that will spell more recession and the collapse of many small factories. Brazil have be a major casualty of the global economic crisis, buffet by loss of investor confidence and a strong outflow of capital. The country's foreign reserves have fall below dlrs 50 billion, from dlrs 70 billion at the end of July. In an effort to prevent a collapse of the nation's currency, the real, and stem capital flight, interest rates be hike to 50 percent a year. For union leader Felicio, the propose product-for-cash swap be a clear sign of the despair the business sector be feel because of the recessive economic policies bring by the Real Plan, the economic stabilization program put together in 1994 when Cardoso be finance minister. The plan succeed in slash inflation from 2,400 percent to almost zero today. But it also bring recession and unemployment, which now stand at almost 8 percent, the high in a decade. President Fernando Henrique Cardoso's efforts to repair the large economy in Latin America may depend on the outcome of this weekend's gubernatorial elections. Cardoso want to impose tough measures that would slash government spending and impose new taxes to try to halt the slide in Brazil's economy and restore investor confidence. But his plan, expect to be unveiled next week, must be approve by Congress, and state governors have enormous sway over local delegations. The influence governors have on their congressional bloc be overwhelming, say University of Sao Paulo political scientist Eduardo Kugelmas. Brazil have be catch up in the financial turmoil that begin more than a year ago in Southeast Asia. As wary investors have flee its financial markets, Brazil's foreign reserves have fall below dlrs 50 billion from dlrs 70 billion at the end of July. On Sunday, voters return to the polls for runoff elections in 12 states and in the Federal District of Brasilia. The outcome will likely determine how successful Cardoso be in get Congress to approve his economic program, which be aim at trim the budget deficit. New income, fuel and bank transaction taxes be expect to be proposed. Kugelmas say opponents of the president stand a good chance of win in four large states Sao Paulo, Minas Gerais, Rio de Janeiro and Rio Grande do Sul. If they win, the president will face a tough uphill battle, he said. Cardoso need the governors' support not only in influence the congressional delegations, but also in hold down their own spending. The problem be that none of the candidates in Sunday's elections ... want to be identify with unpopular austerity measures, say Kugelmas. So they promise to spend more money on schools, hospitals and public work projects. Sao Paulo, Brazil's industrial and financial powerhouse, be perhaps the state most critical to the success of Cardoso's austerity plans. With more than 34 million inhabitants, nearly equal to the entire population of neighbor Argentina, it alone account for more than one-third of Brazil's economic output and 70 of the 513 congressional seats. While incumbent governor Mario Covas, a Cardoso ally who be seek re-election, have commit himself to the austerity plan, Covas opponent Paulo Maluf be a question mark. If Maluf wins, he will use his victory as a launch pad to the presidency in 2003, Kugelmas predicted. And that mean he will try to stay as far away as possible from any austerity measure. Brazil and the International Monetary Fund move closer Tuesday to agreement on an expect dlrs 30 billion rescue package for the world's ninth-largest economy. A joint statement by the IMF and the brazilian government say the two sides agree Brazil should aim to reduce its budget deficit from an expect eight percent of gross domestic product to zero by 2000. The statement be issue after weekend talks between IMF officials and a brazilian delegation head by Pedro Parente, executive secretary of the Finance Ministry. Representatives of the World Bank and the Inter-American Development Bank take part in the talks. Both organizations as well as private banks be expect to contribute to the rescue package. Brazil be the late country to be hit by the financial crisis that begin 15 months ago in Asia and then spread to Russia. Brazil have lose about dlrs 25 billion in foreign currency reserves since August when Russia default on its debts and spark a new crisis of confidence in emerge market countries. If instability continue in Brazil it could affect Argentina, its main trading partner, and other latin american economies. Despite the re-election of Fernando Henrique Cardoso for a second term as president and the announcement Oct. 8 that Brazil and the IMF have agree on the broad outlines of a financial assistance package, investors continue to withdraw large sums of money from Brazil. Cardoso be prepare an emergency program of budget cuts to restore investor confidence and prevent a devaluation of the country's currency. Investors want Cardoso to outline the plans this week but he be expect to wait until after Sunday's second round of elections for state governors, whose support he need for his budget cuts. The joint statement say the brazil-imf discussions be aim at prepare the ground for prompt support by the international community, include the IMF, for the multi-year fiscal program to be announce soon by the Brazilian authorities, which will include new policy initiatives. The statement reiterate Brazil's goal of achieve a primary budget surplus of 2.6 percent of its gross domestic product in 1999, 2.8 percent in 2000 and 3.0 percent in 2001 which would fulfill the government target of stabilize the ratio of net consolidated public sector debt to GDP by the year 2000. The two sides be to continue their talks with the objective of reach early agreement, the statement said. There's no such thing as a free lunch any long in Brazil, President Fernando Henrique Cardoso be tell government workers. No haircuts or phone calls, either. Eager to bolster the sag economy, Cardoso want to slash dlrs 19 billion (23.5 billion reals) from the budget deficit, and he's beginning by par perks for the more than 2,000 workers at the presidential palace in Brasilia, the capital. Sure, it's not much when compare with a deficit of some dlrs 65 billion, or 7 percent of economic output. But as Cardoso ready a package of spending cuts and tax increases, he clearly want to show Brazilians that economy start at home. so goodbye to the afternoon courtesy snack of sandwiches, fruit and juice, a palace tradition. Three barber shops in the palace be closed, and the use of cellular phones and copiers be restricted. The price of a buffet offer employees for lunch be raise from dlrs 6 to dlrs 8.50 (7 reals to 10 reals). Cardoso himself have promise to travel less and more cheaply. On a trip to a summit in Portugal this month, he take a delegation of just eight, half the usual number. The savings at the palace could come to nearly dlrs 145,000 (170,000 reals) a month, say Nilson Rebello, chief administrator of the president's office. Cardoso, under pressure to repair an economy batter by the world financial turmoil, be expect to unveil the full scope of his deficit-cutting plan next week. It be believe to include a spate of new taxes on fuel, income, personal fortunes and bank transactions. The plan be part of a deal with the International Monetary Fund for a rescue package estimate at dlrs 30 billion. The money would strengthen and, hopefully, restore investor confidence in the world's ninth-largest economy, now at the center of the financial crisis buffet develop nations for more than a year. Brazil already have agree to annual targets to sharply reduce its deficit through the year 2001. On Wednesday, newspapers publish a joint statement from Brazil and the IMF, although a final agreement hasn't be reach yet. Despite Cardoso's efforts, many Brazilians be less than impress by the palace penny-pinching. The leftist Workers Party say the government be make a big deal of insignificant savings while it fail to cut other dubious projects, such as a dlrs 800,000 (1 million reals) moat be build around Congress to keep protesters from easily enter the building. The Globo tv network also suggest there still be plenty of fat to cut, cite government expenses for run shoes, persian carpets and gold cufflinks, intend as presents for visit dignitaries. Cardoso be count on help from friendly state governors to control spending. But the governors, some face runoff elections on Sunday, be promise pay raises and public work projects that could sink the austerity plan. In Brasilia, Joaquim Roriz have promise civil service raises, bonuses and new jobs that his opponent estimates would cost some dlrs 1 billion (1.2 billion reals). Roriz hasn't explain where the money would come from. In powerful Minas Gerais state, the government will almost certainly have to lay off workers the state payroll consume 78 percent of the budget. To rein in the free-spending habits of provincial politicians, Cardoso reportedly want to hold local governments to bimonthly limits on spending. Federal money would automatically be cut off if spending get out of hand. latin american leaders fly Friday to Portugal for a weekend summit to figure out how they can shield their economies from the global financial crisis. not since the early 1980s have so many countries be in recession, and the crisis now threaten to cripple Latin America's develop economies. An early arrival, Cuban President Fidel Castro, describe the turmoil in world financial markets as the most important issue face the world at the moment. I don't know if we be come to the end of the world economic order. It will be interest to know, the Cuban leader say at a hotel press conference shortly after his arrival for the annual ibero-american summit. emphasize the scale of the threat, Castro say President Clinton be aware that if South America fall into crisis, it will be extend inevitably also to the United States, which be heavily involve in investments and loans in the region. Jittery investors have abruptly pull cash out of Latin America with devastate effects on stock markets and currency reserves. The heads of state and government from Latin America, Spain and Portugal will explore measures to ward off the financial turmoil that already have devastate Asia and Russia. Stock markets also fell in Portugal and Spain, heavy investors in Latin America. The latin american leaders must gauge the need for unpopular reforms of their public finances, include austerity packages which risk social unrest and political upheaval. A joint declaration will be sign Sunday in this ancient port city on the Douro River in northern Portugal. Diplomats say there be consensus on the form of the final statement. The declaration call on the international community, and Group of Seven countries in particular, to take the necessary measures to promote stability in international financial markets, which be a necessary condition for sustained economic growth, say Luis Augusto Castro Neves, of the brazilian Foreign Ministry. Latin America's leaders favor create some kind of regulatory system for global financial transactions that would place controls on speculators, like measures to slow down the internatioal flow of money. They also want reforms that allow international financial institutions to head off crises rather than react to them with rescue packages. International institutions must be active in tackle crises like the recent one ... and contribute to stability, Portuguese Foreign Minister Jaime Gama said. Countries that have progressive policies should not be penalized, they should be give incentives, Gama add in reference to latin american nations' efforts to modernize their economies. Brazil, the continent's large economy and a potential bulwark against creep recession, be wait for news of a dlrs 30 billion bailout package from the International Monetary Fund. The presidents of the World Bank and InterAmerican Development Bank also be expect at the talks. The move by the U.S. Federal Reserve to cut interest rates Thursday revive Latin America's financial markets, but analysts expect the reprieve to be short-lived because of deep concerns about the continent's economic health. The recent economic troubles stem in part from the structural weaknesses of latin american economies. A strike be wag by state employees in Colombia against a government austerity package offer a glimpse of the trouble that could arise if tough reforms be introduced. Brazil be draft an austerity package that will hit public spending, especially social security. brazilian officials end four days of meetings with representatives of the International Monetary Fund on Tuesday without live up to their public pledge to announce concrete measures to reduce government deficits. In Washington, Pedro Parente, executive secretary of the brazilian Finance Ministry, offer only details on Brazil's plans for raise a primary account surplus over the next three years. With only five days to go before gubernatorial runoffs on Sunday, neither he nor President Fernando Henrique Cardoso, in Brasilia, say how the government plan to achieve the savings. Important allies of Cardoso be lag behind in three key states, and despite the government promises, market analysts do not expect an announcement until after the elections. Instead, the strategy in Brasilia and Washington appear to focus on reassure the markets that work on cut the deficit be go forward, without provide fodder for opponents in domestic elections. The discussions continue with the objective of reach agreement soon on the detailed program, say a joint statement by the IMF and the brazilian Finance Ministry. Because of Brazil's enormous deficits, the collapse of emerge markets have hit the nation particularly hard, drain foreign currency reserves and push the economy toward recession. finance officials in Washington and around the world fear that a collapse of Brazil, because of its size and links to other economies, would worsen financial instability throughout the hemisphere. With 160 million people, Brazil represent the world's ninth-largest economy and be the financial engine of Latin America. Throughout the day, government officials meet with Cardoso in Brasilia and be expect to fine-tune a three-year austerity package that Cardoso be to discuss with congressional party leaders on Wednesday morning. In Brasilia, officials say that among the measures be consider be a tax increase on financial transactions, to three-tenths of a percent from two-tenths of a percent, and extend the Fiscal Stabilization Fund, which set aside 20 percent of all taxes collect for presidential discretionary spending. The fund be to have expire by 1999. speak in Washington, Parente say that Brazil would aim toward a surplus of 2.6 percent in 1999, 2.8 percent in 2000 and 3 percent in 2001. It have already be announced, at the end of the IMF's annual meeting in Washington two weeks ago that Brazil would have to reach a primary account surplus of 2.5 percent to 3 percent to qualify for IMF aid. The primary account cover government expenses, without interest payments on debt. Ernest Brown, senior economist for Latin America at Morgan Stanley Dean Witter, say signs that the brazilian government and the IMF be move closer to an aid package be reassuring, and that he do not expect much more than reassurance until next week. I call this the `We have a pope' scenario, Brown said. You're just go to hear that we have a pope, maybe see the white smoke rising, he said, and not figure out who the pope be until after the elections. The United States be prepare to commit U.S. taxpayer funds as part of a lending program of at least $30 billion to try to insulate Brazil, and with it the rest of Latin America, from the bad effects of the financial turmoil circle the globe, accord to U.S. and foreign officials assemble the program. Details of the U.S. contribution, which be expect to total several billion dollars in direct aid or loan guarantees, have yet to be negotiated. But several congressional leaders have be alert to the likelihood that the administration would have to act while Congress be in recess. This early warning from the administration reflect memories of how Congress erupt with objections and hearings in 1995 when President Clinton commit $20 billion in U.S. funds to the bailout of Mexico. But administration officials say last week that their early soundings indicate that members of Congress be deeply concern about prevent an economic collapse in Latin America that would resound in the United States, and thus they expect few objections. The timing of an aid package for Brazil originally expect within the next few days be complicate by unexpected delays that have crop up in deal with the brazilian government. The government of President Fernando Henrique Cardoso face politically risky gubernatorial elections on Sunday, which may well determine whether Brazil can execute an austerity program that be the key condition for the loans it be concurrently negotiate with the International Monetary Fund. The big role in the rescue program for Brazil will be take by the International Monetary Fund, which say last week that it would contribute at least $15 billion and appear to be under pressure from the United States to do even more. Another $9 billion or so will come from the World Bank and the inter-american Development Bank, and the remainder from the United States and other major industrial nations. Germany and Japan, though, have be reluctant to take part, one U.S. official noted, suggest that Latin America be chiefly Washington's problem, not their own. so far, U.S. officials work behind the scenes to organize the aid package have say nothing in public about the details of plans for a direct contribution to Brazil. Brazil be very important to the economic well-being of the region, the United States and the international community, and all of us be very much focus on see how we can be helpful, Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin say on Friday. But in a wide-ranging interview about the global economic turmoil, Rubin decline to say what strategy he would pursue in deal with Brazil's problems and insist that no decisions have be make about how the United States might contribute. But he discuss Brazil as an opportunity to engage in the kind of preventive financial diplomacy that President Clinton advocate in speeches to the IMF and the World Bank here three weeks ago. At the time, Clinton argue that the monetary fund should provide contingent finance to help countries ward off global financial contagion rather than wait for disaster to strike. Direct U.S. aid to Brazil would clearly send a symbolic message: that after a year of try to manage the financial crisis through the monetary fund, the United States be now ready to put a limited amount of its own capital at risk to prevent far havoc not only for Brazil but to stop chaos spread to Argentina, Mexico and other countries that be major U.S. trading partners. That would be a change of strategy. So far, the United States have operate almost entirely through international financial institutions, chiefly the IMF But it would also be a risky move for President Clinton, economically and politically. even though Congress object to the $20 billion in U.S. funds commit to the bailout of Mexico, it turn out that only $12 billion be ultimately needed, and it have since be pay back, with interest. But Rubin note on Friday that it's a very different environment now. other administration officials say they believe that there would be few objections in Congress to direct U.S. participation in a Brazil bailout. I think there be a lot more people in Congress who be now scar to death by what's be happen in the markets, and what could happen in their own districts, a White House official say last week, and they won't say much as long as they don't have to vote on it. By act soon to stabilize Latin America, the administration be hop to capitalize on two weeks of relative calm after the late-summer panic that engulf Russia and, at its height, lead to an outflow of a billion dollars a day from Brazil, for fear that it would be the next country force to devalue its currency. Whether this calm mark the beginning of a turnaround or just another pause in the wildfires that have erupt since Thailand's currency crisis in July 1997 be a matter of considerable debate. But many experts cite the confluence of several events that have reassure jittery investors around the world: two successive interest-rate cuts in the United States, Japan's long-delayed move to prop up its banking system with $500 billion in taxpayer funds, and a steady strengthening of currencies in Thailand, Indonesia and South Korea, the first signs that investors may be prepare to return. Always circumspect when it come to comment publicly on markets, Rubin acknowledge that in the last several weeks there have be a number of significant, positive developments. But the former trader, burn during a 26-year career by many false market rallies, warn that serious issues remain and that it will take some time for the world to work its way out of what he have repeatedly call the most serious international financial disruption of the last 50 years. In fact, Rubin's aides be clearly nervous about the possibility of another outbreak that could set off a new round of panic, which have make it virtually impossible for many emerging-market countries to borrow money on world markets. Brazil and Japan be the two obvious tinderboxes, say Jeffrey Garten, dean of the Yale School of Management, who serve as undersecretary of commerce for international affairs during Clinton's first term. In Brazil, the issue be whether the package that be come together will really be big enough to deal with an explode debt problem. And in Japan the question be whether there be real reform that go along with the money. But after spend 18 months in negotiations with the Japanese, Rubin clearly sense that the United States have little leverage in Tokyo; its problems be chiefly root in political gridlock, not lack of resources. In Brazil, though, the United States have a good chance of buy time and influence an economic reform program, as long as it do not appear to be dictate terms publicly to Cardoso and his team. But demonstrate economic support will probably require tap the Exchange Stabilization Fund, create during the Roosevelt administration to help stabilize the dollar. The money be under Rubin's control, with presidential approval, and he reach into it to circumvent congressional objections to aid Mexico in 1995. But the reaction be so strong for a time Congress restrict tap the fund for international bailouts that Rubin have be extraordinarily cautious ever since. He commit $3 billion in a second line of defense in emergency aid programs for Indonesia and South Korea last year, but no money be ultimately disperse to either country. U.S. officials say that South Korea do not need the extra help, and that the collapse of the Suharto government in Indonesia so change the political scene there that it would be too risky to offer direct U.S. aid. In the bailout of Russia whose economy collapse after President Boris Yeltsin abandon an agreement to reform the economy and dismiss the lead reformers the United States offer no direct help. Those events set off a panicked exit by investors from all emerge markets, and greatly worsen Brazil's troubles. so far, brazilian officials have successfully calm the market by constantly talk about a forthcoming aid program from the IMF, convincing speculators that it would be dangerous to bet against the country. But at the same time, the brazilian officials have maintain the pose that they do not really need the cash and be certainly in no hurry to get it. U.S. officials and top officials of the IMF be clearly nervous, worry that the long the negotiations drag on, the great will be the risk of Brazil be catch in another round of market turmoil. The Brazilians want everyone to think that it's all under control, say an investment banker involve in the talks. But the fact be that there's still a real risk that sometime in the next 18 months the government be go to be force to devalue its currency, which be peg to the dollar, but adjust about 7.5 percent a year in a carefully control fall. To prevent a sudden devaluation, the brazilian government have have to raise interest rates to more than 50 percent, choke off credit for most companies. Meanwhile, the country be slip into recession. The aid would buy time for the Brazilians, but it be contingent on Cardoso's success in persuade the legislature to end huge deficits, chiefly through unpopular cuts in social spending. The first deputy manage director for the International Monetary Fund, Stanley Fischer, spend Friday in Brazil to review the country's austerity plan, which be expect to be announce after Sunday's elections but before the international package, to avoid the appearance that the global lender be dictate conditions to Brazil. Brazil have to do a lot, Fischer say last week before leave on his trip. In return, I expect the international community will make a large contribution. Leaders from 19 latin american nations, Spain and Portugal put finish touches Saturday on an ibero-american summit declaration warning of global recession unless action be take to stabilize the international financial system. The draft declaration say recent financial market turmoil show that adjustments must be make quickly to keep the difficulties affect a few from become a crisis for all. The declaration address the world's seven rich nations. The Group of Seven be compose of the United States, Japan, Britain, Germany, France, Italy and Canada. The final declaration will be approve at Sunday's summit in this port city in northern Portugal. Brazilian President Fernando Henrique Cardoso say Saturday that Brazil and China, two of the world's large economies, have become the dikes of resistance to global recession. protect their economies from the spread economic turmoil, which be affect more countries than at any time since the early 1980s, be key to world economic stability, he said. Brazil be Latin America's big economy and the eighth-largest in the world, and its economic collapse could take the rest of the continent with it. To halt Brazil's slide toward recession, Cardoso be prepare austerity measures include spending cuts, tax hikes and low interest rates. The reforms would help Brazil qualify for an International Monetary Fund rescue package estimate at dlrs 30 billion. The IMF have put together bailout packages total dlrs 137 billion since the financial crisis strike Thailand 15 months ago and then spread from Asia to Russia. U.S. President Bill Clinton's administration, aware of the impact that a latin american recession would have on the United States, have actively push the IMF and the World Bank to support Brazil after it be hit by investor flight. There's no such thing as a free lunch any long in Brazil, President Fernando Henrique Cardoso be tell government workers. No haircuts or phone calls, either. Eager to bolster the sag economy, Cardoso want to slash dlrs 19 billion from the budget deficit, and he's beginning by par perks for the more than 2,000 workers at the presidential palace in Brasilia, the capital. Sure, it's not much when compare with a deficit of some dlrs 65 billion, or 7 percent of economic output. But as Cardoso ready a package of spending cuts and tax increases, he clearly want to show Brazilians that economy start at home. so goodbye to the afternoon courtesy snack of sandwiches, fruit and juice, a palace tradition. Three barber shops in the palace be closed, and the use of cellular phones and copiers be restricted. The price of a buffet offer employees for lunch be raise from dlrs 6 to dlrs 8.50. Cardoso himself have promise to travel less and more cheaply. On a trip to a summit in Portugal this month, he take a delegation of just eight, half the usual number. The savings at the palace could come to nearly dlrs 145,000 a month, say Nilson Rebello, chief administrator of the president's office. Cardoso, under pressure to repair an economy batter by the world financial turmoil, be expect to unveil the full scope of his deficit-cutting plan next week. It be believe to include a spate of new taxes on fuel, income, personal fortunes and bank transactions. The plan be part of a deal with the International Monetary Fund for a rescue package estimate at dlrs 30 billion. The money would strengthen and, hopefully, restore investor confidence in the world's ninth-largest economy, now at the center of the financial crisis buffet develop nations for more than a year. Brazil already have agree to annual targets to sharply reduce its deficit through the year 2001. On Wednesday, newspapers publish a joint statement from Brazil and the IMF, although a final agreement hasn't be reach yet. Despite Cardoso's efforts, many Brazilians be less than impress by the palace penny-pinching. The leftist Workers Party say the government be make a big deal of insignificant savings while it fail to cut other dubious projects, such as a dlrs 800,000 moat be build around Congress to keep protesters from easily enter the building. The Globo tv network also suggest there still be plenty of fat to cut, cite government expenses for run shoes, persian carpets and gold cufflinks, intend as presents for visit dignitaries. Cardoso be count on help from friendly state governors to control spending. But the governors, some face runoff elections on Sunday, be promise pay raises and public work projects that could sink the austerity plan. In Brasilia, Joaquim Roriz have promise civil service raises, bonuses and new jobs that his opponent estimates would cost some dlrs 1 billion. Roriz hasn't explain where the money would come from. In powerful Minas Gerais state, the government will almost certainly have to lay off workers the state payroll consume 78 percent of the budget. To rein in the free-spending habits of provincial politicians, Cardoso reportedly want to hold local governments to bimonthly limits on spending. Federal money would automatically be cut off if spending get out of hand. The Commerce Department on Tuesday provide a concrete measure of the effects of the global economic downturn on the american economy, reporting that the nation's trade deficit widen by $2.2 billion in August to $16.77 billion. That be the wide gap since the government recalculate the way it measure trade flows in 1992. It result from a decline in american exports and a sharp increase in what this country buy from abroad. so far this year, the trade deficit be run roughly 50 percent above last year's levels and be up to a project $170 billion for the year, a gap that be expect to widen even further. One senior administration official who deal with economic issues, speak on condition of anonymity, say Tuesday that internal projections suggest that the trade deficit in 1999 could reach $300 billion, a figure that he say will certainly cut into growth, and could well become a major political problem. Trade deficits carry with them both good and troubling signals about the economy. The current flood of imports be help contain inflation to some of the low levels in decades. And while sales of american aircraft, computer chips and other goods be suffering, the weakening of the dollar on world markets in recent weeks may provide an end-of-the-year boost for american exporters. But at this moment of global upheaval, the big problem face american companies be the inability of many nations and some large companies in Asia and Latin America simply to borrow money to make ordinary purchases. The result be such a freeze of economic activity that empty ship containers be stack up on American piers. And the effects be hurt everyone from Midwest farmers who can no longer send wheat to an impoverished Russia, to East Coast fishermen who be discover that Japan's appetite for salmon and lobster have be ruin by the banking crisis. Among the most surprising elements of Tuesday's report be that more than a third of August's deficit be with one country that so far have manage to ward off the bad effects of the global troubles: China. Despite continued growth of the chinese economy, exports to China have slow dramatically and imports of Chinese-made goods have exploded, as the country desperately seek to sell here goods that would ordinarily be sell elsewhere in Asia. That increase the monthly deficit with Beijing to $5.9 billion, levels previously only see in trade with Japan. The Chinese besiege by floods, deeply troubled state-owned industries and an incipient banking crisis have signal to the United States in recent weeks that they have little interest in any swift moves to open their markets further in return for entry into the World Trade Organization. That amount to a major setback for President Clinton, who for three years have be use the negotiations over China's entry to the world body as the centerpiece of his effort to open China both economically and politically. ostensible progress in this area have be cite by the administration until recently as one of the successes of the administration's China policy, but now officials say privately that the progress be evaporating. The decline in exports will trim the growth of the American economy, and it be one factor in the Federal Reserve's decision to lower interest rates two times in recent weeks. So administration officials be go out of their way Tuesday to portray the numbers as another warning sign, but not a crisis. While the United States remain strong and sound, the troubled condition of the global marketplace continue to strongly influence the U.S. trade balance, Commerce Secretary Williams Daley say in a statement Tuesday. After China, the big deterioration in the american trade balance in August come in Mexico, where the peso have weaken markedly as economic contagion have spread through Latin America. Exports to Mexico have remain unchanged. But imports from Mexico have increase markedly chiefly automobiles and automotive parts and telecommunications equipment as american manufacturers have take advantage of the weakening currency. In contrast, America's trade surplus with Brazil, the late focus of concern by the administration and the International Monetary Fund, barely budge from the same period a year ago. Normally, that would be cite as a sign of continued demand for american products in Latin America's large economy, but there be fear it might be imperiled. The news come as the United States and the IMF complete a bailout package of $30 billion or more for Brazil, intend to help it stave off the kind of economic troubles that have sweep through Asia, Russia and several other nations. Tuesday the IMF and Brazil reach agreement on the country's fiscal targets for this year and next, a sign that the aid will likely be announce after elections in Brazil this weekend. But for all these potential problems, the rise trade deficit have barely cause a ripple on Capitol Hill. Because the rise level of imports do not appear to be trigger any unemployment here, the subject have barely come up in races for the House and Senate around the country. The only exception have be in regions where the steel industry be strong. The major steel companies have charge in recent weeks that asian nations be dump products on the american market at prices well below their costs. The Commerce Department have begin an inquiry. The Commerce Department's numbers show that the deficit rise 15.3 percent to $16.77 billion in August, up from a revised figure of $14.55 billion in July. The department say that the resumption of production at General Motors Corp. after last summer's strike may have increase the size of the deficit's rise in August, as GM bring in parts from abroad. The deficit be the high since the Commerce Department begin a new method of track trade information in 1992. Exports, the department said, fell three tenths of 1 percent, to about $74.8 billion. Imports rise 2.2 percent to $91.6 billion.

49,"SEOUL, South Korea (AP) U.S. President Bill Clinton win South Korea's support Saturday for confront North Korea over a suspected nuclear site, and he warn the North's communist leaders not to squander an historic chance to make a lasting peace on the peninsula. President Kim Dae-jung, appear with Clinton at a news conference, pledge that his government would spare no effort in support the U.S. endeavor to resolve the nuclear question. He call for full access for U.S. inspectors at a north korean underground facility and say the North must constrain its development and exports of missiles. On the first of two days in South Korea, Clinton also hold a roundtable discussion with business leaders to hear their prescriptions for put the nation's economy back on track. Economics and security be Clinton's twin themes on a five-day Asia trip that begin in Japan. Clinton acknowledge that U.S. intelligence officials be not yet certain that the suspicious underground construction project in North Korea be nuclear related. But he say the North risks close the door on cooperation if it refuse a U.S. inspection of the site. It raise a strong suspicion, Clinton say at a joint news conference with Kim at the Blue House, the presidential mansion overlook the capital. We need access to it. The foundation of U.S. efforts to ease North Korea's decades-long hostility toward the South be a 1994 agree framework in which the North halt its nuclear weapons program in exchange for a western commitment to build modern nuclear energy sources there. That deal would be shatter if the suspect site turn out to be a clandestine nuclear project. And that, in turn, would jeopardize preliminary north-south peace talks that could produce a treaty to replace the shaky armistice that end the Korean War in 1953. Kim, who have move South Korea to a sunshine policy of engage North Korea on cultural and economic fronts, firmly say his government support Clinton on the nuclear issue. We must require full access and ways to ascertain the nature and the purposes of the construction site, Kim said. If it is, in fact, proven that it be nuclear related, we should demand immediate close down. He also say the North must limit its missile development, cite the great shock in Japan when the North Koreans test-fired a missile its way Aug. 31. In a dinner toast, Kim say that despite tensions, North Korea be cautiously but noticeably take measures to increase interaction and cooperation between the South and the North. And Clinton salute Seoul's battle against Asia's economic woes. I believe Asia will emerge from this present crisis more prosperous, more stable, more democratic thanks in no small measure to Korea's example. After the state dinner, Clinton make a surprise late-night stop at a concert at the Sejong Culture Center where his young brother, Roger, and his band be performing. The president listen to songs off stage before his brother introduce the president as a very special person. The audience of 2,000 people stand and applauded. In meetings this week in Pyongyang, the north korean capital, U.S. officials be rebuff in their request to see the suspicious underground site, which american intelligence officials fear could be a secret effort to revive the North's nuclear weapons program. U.S. spy satellite photos show thousands of workers dig a massive complex. U.S. special envoy Charles Kartman say Thursday after the Pyongyang talks that there be compel evidence of an underground nuclear facility. But in a statement distribute by the U.S. Embassy here Saturday, Kartman backtracked, say instead that the United States lack conclusive evidence the site be a nuclear facility. There be strong information that make us suspicious, but we lack conclusive evidence that the intended purpose of the underground site be nuclear related and, if so, what type of nuclear facility it might be, Kartman said, offer a clarification of his early remarks. Kim say his government would spare no effort in support the U.S. endeavor to resolve the nuclear question. The North Koreans have deny the underground construction site have any nuclear purpose, and it have demand a dlrs 300 million payment for prove that. In remarks in Tokyo on Friday, Clinton reject the idea of compensation. direct his remarks at North Korea, Clinton note the significance of a new tourism deal that be bring South Koreans to the North on cruise ships an arrangement tout by Kim as a sign the North may be open up to its 1950s korean War enemy. To risk that kind of cooperation and progress with America on other issues by stonewall on the suspected nuclear site be contrary to the North's long-term interests, he said. nothing could ever be put into that hole in the ground, give our defense partnership here, nothing could ever be put in that hole in the ground that would give the North Koreans as much advantage, as much power, as much wealth, as much happiness, as more of those ships go up there full of people from here, Clinton said. To underscore the U.S. military commitment to South Korea, Clinton be schedule to venture out of the capital on Sunday to visit U.S. Army troop at a training range north of Seoul. He also plan to address american troops at Osan Air Base from a u-2 spy plane hangar. North Korea have demand that the United States pay hundreds of millions of dollars for the right to inspect a huge underground center that U.S. intelligence analysts fear houses a nuclear-weapons program, Clinton administration officials say Wednesday. The United States reject the request during meetings this week in Pyongyang, the north korean capital, between north korean officials and a U.S. government delegation. As we expected, the North Koreans bring up the issue of compensation, and we flatly reject it, say State Department Spokesman James Rubin. ask how much money the North Koreans have demanded, Rubin say payment of the fee be so not on as a possibility that I don't care to get into the figures. other administration officials say the fee would have be hundreds of millions of dollars; one put it at $300 million. The North Koreans have deny that the complex, which be be build on a mountainside about 25 miles northeast of Yongbyon, the former north korean nuclear research center, be intend to be use for a nuclear weapons program. They have repeatedly say U.S. inspectors could visit the site as long as Washington agree to pay a large fee in compensation for what the North Koreans describe as the administration's slander. The north korean representative at the United Nations, Kim Chang Guk, say last week that the United States could inspect the site on condition that when it be confirm not to be a nuclear facility, the United States should pay compensation for slander and defame my country. U.S. intelligence agencies fear that by build the complex, North Korea may have decide to abandon a four-year-old agreement with the United States in which North Korea pledge to give up its nuclear weapons program in exchange for billions of dollars in aid. The U.S. delegation, lead by Charles Kartman, President Clinton's special envoy on north korean issues, leave Pyongyang on Wednesday after 12 hours of negotiations over three days with a team from the north korean Foreign Ministry. The talks end as Clinton begin a trip to Asia that will include a visit to South Korea, where the issue of the north korean construction site be expect to be among the major topics discuss with President Kim Dae-jung. Rubin say the U.S. delegation to North Korea have press for access to the site. We tell them that access to the site be essential, he said. We've expect that this would be difficult, and we tell the North Koreans, as we've say before, that verbal assurances, as they be wont to give, be simply unacceptable. U.S. officials have say the construction of the underground site may not yet have technically violate the accord, because there be no evidence that North Korea have begin pour cement for a new reactor or a reprocessing plant to convert nuclear waste to bomb-grade plutonium. But if the United States determine that North Korea have revive its nuclear program, Rubin said, it would go against the entire letter and spirit of the objectives of the agreement, and it would affect the viability of the agreement. The administration have express grow concern over North Korea's intentions after several provocative acts, include the underground construction near Yongbyon and the test firing last August of a missile over Japan. last week Clinton name former Defense Secretary William Perry to review U.S. policy toward North Korea. Administration officials say Perry be be ask to study ways to salvage the 1994 nuclear agreement with North Korea, which have be among the administration's proud achievements in foreign policy. north korean news media on Thursday say the communist nation's military be on full alert for war with the United States if a dispute over nuclear inspections come to blows. The North's official korean Central News Agency report that north korean soldiers and people of all walks of life be on full alert for war. North Korea typically send out belligerent rhetoric, especially when it enter high-stake talks with Washington. The United States and North Korea be set to resume talks Friday about inspections of an underground north korean site suspect of be use to produce nuclear weapons. KCNA broadcast brim with anti-american saber-rattling. Our People's Army will blow up the U.S. territory as a whole if the United States start a war on the divided korean Peninsula, Vice Defense Minister Jong Chang Ryol be quote as say Thursday. The general staff of the north korean military accuse Washington on Wednesday of push the situation in Korea to the brink of war by demand inspections and talks aim at prevent Pyongyang from develop nuclear weapons and long-range missiles. Under the prevailing touch-and-go situation, the korean People's Army be now brace itself for a fight against the U.S. imperialist aggressors, KCNA quote Jong as saying. The agency also quote various party officials, plant managers, even museum curators as pledge a thousandfold revenge or vow to arm themselves with the spirit of human bombs and of suicidal attack. Washington demand unconditional inspections of the North's underground project. But North Korea ask Washington to pay dlrs 300 million for the right to inspect the site. Concerns that North Korea be develop long-range missiles capable of strike all of Japan and parts of the United States escalate when North Korea fire a rocket on Aug. 31. Believed to be a test of its Taepo Dong missile, the rocket fly over Japan and land in the Pacific Ocean. The North's 1.1 million-strong military be the world's fifth largest. It form the backbone of the north korean government, with leader Kim Jong Il rule the country as the head of the military. A congressman who visit remote parts of North Korea last week say Saturday that the food and health situation there be desperate and deteriorating, and that millions of North Koreans might have starve to death in the last few years. The congressman, Tony Hall, D-Ohio, who have have a longtime interest in world hunger, pass through Tokyo on his return to the United States and show photograph he have take of north korean children with patchy hair, protrude bones, open sores and other signs of severe malnutrition. Hall also bring back a bag of what officials call substitute food be distribute by a government food station: dry leaves and straw, so coarse that even cattle would normally turn away. They grind it into powder and make it into noodles, Hall said. The noodles have no nutrition and be indigestible, leave people hold their aching stomachs, he said. North Korea have admit that it be face serious economic difficulties, but there have be sharply diverge assessments of how serious these are. Some visitors with the United Nations and other organizations have say that the food situation seem to be a bit better now than a year or two ago. Hall say that the divergence might have arise because in the north korean capital, Pyongyang, life do seem to be slightly good than during his three previous trips to North Korea. But in rural areas where foreigners be not often allow to visit, he added, the overall situation be bad than ever. base on visits to four hospitals, Hall also emphasize that public health care have decline sharply. In one hospital, assistants be hold down a patient while surgeons conduct a stomach operation without electric lights or anesthesia. Ordinary North Koreans be suffering, in part, because their government's hard-line policies have alienate would-be donors and aid agencies. The United Nations have repeatedly appeal for relief aid for north Korea, but the late appeal have raise less than one-third of the target. In September, Doctors Without Borders announce that it be pull its staff of 13 from North Korea because it fear that its aid be go to the politically connect rather than to the most needy. North Korea do not release mortality figures or health statistics, but Hall say that the United Nations have gather and would soon release data indicate that 30 percent of north korean children under age 2 be acutely malnourish and that 67 percent of all children be physically stunted. Hall say he think that overall at least 1 million people have die and that the total be probably closer to 3 million. In an indication of the seriousness with which professional demographers view the situation, the U.S. Bureau of the Census recently publish estimates suggest that North Korea's population peak in 1995 at 21.55 million and have since fall to 21.23 million this year. That would be a decline of 320,000 over three years, a period when North Korea's population would have be expect to grow by about 925,000 people, base on the population growth rate of the early 1990s. Nicholas Eberstadt, an american specialist on north korean population figures, say that there simply be not enough hard information for him to estimate the death toll from the famine. But he note one political tidbit: North Korea's constitution stipulate that there should be one delegate to the country's people's assembly for every 30,000 citizens. This year's assembly do not expand as previous ones did, but rather have just 687 delegates, the same as the previous assembly hold in 1990. While Eberstadt counsels caution, that could mean that North Korea's population, after eight years in which it have be expect to add several million people, be now back to 20.6 million people or fewer. The United States have be supply grain to North Korea, but strains be grow over a secret underground complex in the North that some experts worry may be the heart of a new nuclear weapons program. The United States warn last week that the agreed framework that be the basis for its relations with North Korea will be in jeopardy unless the North let american experts visit the underground complex and resolve their doubts. North Korea have say that it will show off the complex only if Washington promise that if the complex be not a nuclear one, it will pay for vilify us and impair our prestige. Washington refuse to pay, and North Korea be warn that the standoff could lead the agreement to fall apart. Their shameless and wicked demand be an open infringement upon our sovereignty and wanton interference in our internal affairs, declare North Korea's lead newspaper, Rodong Sinmun. A South Korean lawmaker say Friday communist North Korea could be produce plutonium and could have more secret underground nuclear facilities than already feared. Without name his source, Rep. Kim Deog-ryong of the Parliament's Foreign Affairs Committee say he have information that two underground facilities capture on U.S. spy satellite photos may be nuclear plants. He say in a Parliament session that one of them be believe to already be produce plutonium and the other would be able to produce enough for 10 nuclear bombs start around 2004. If true, the assertion paint a bad picture of suspected north korean nuclear activity than already make public. Kim say he ask the government's Unification Ministry about the issue earlier this week and be suspicious of its answer. It be not sufficient or sincere, so I come to suspect that the government be try to hide the truth, Kim say in a seven-page press release. U.S. and south korean officials say in August they have detect a huge underground construction site on a mountainside 40 kilometers (25 miles) northeast of Yongbyon, the country's main nuclear complex. The United States have say it suspect the construction be nuclear-related, though it have no evidence. North Korea have deny it. Kim, a lawmaker from the main opposition Grand National Party, say there may actually be two underground facilities not far from the Yongbyon complex. It be activity at Yongbyon that prompt the United States to negotiate a 1994 accord promise development of two light-water reactors and fuel-oil shipments if North Korea would halt nuclear weapons development. At the time, North Korea be believe to have make enough plutonium for one or two atomic bombs. The Yongbyon complex, which houses a 500-megawatt laboratory nuclear reactor, have be freeze under the 1994 accord. Kim say Friday that one new facility be already operate and the other be under construction and will be operational in four to six years. We estimate that the reactor will go on-line in 2002 or 2003, enable the production of enough plutonium to build one nuclear weapon within six to 12 months, Kim said. North Korea would be able to make sufficient plutonium to make eight to 10 nuclear weapons every year after that. North Korea have say the underground construction be for civilian use and not nuclear-related. It have offer to open the facility to U.S. inspectors, but say Washington must pay compensation if the facility be be prove to be for civilian use. President Clinton make an unusual, direct appeal to North Korea on Saturday to set aside any nuclear ambitions in favor of strengthen ties to South Korea and the United States. The appeal come during a meeting with reporters at which he also counsel patience over Iraq's refusal to comply with a request from weapons inspectors. I think it's important that we not overreact here on the first day, Clinton say in response to reports that Iraq have balk at a request by U.N. inspectors for documents on its weapons program. But, speaking at a joint appearance with south korean President Kim Dae Jung, Clinton call the requested documents quite important and say Iraq have some affirmative obligations to help weapons inspectors. Aides to Clinton deny that his comments represent any soften toward Iraq. They say that because the situation be still develop and the president be prepare for meetings with Kim he have not be brief in detail on Iraq's resistance when he appear before reporters Saturday. National Security Adviser Sandy Berger say the administration be consult with other members of the U.N. Security Council about the matter. If Iraq fail to meet its obligations under U.N. resolutions, he said, We obviously be prepared to act. last weekend, Clinton call off a strike against Iraq minutes before it be to begin, delay his departure for Asia to monitor the crisis and say that U.S. forces remain poise to strike if Iraq renege on its agreement to let U.N. weapons inspectors do their work. In his appearance with Kim, the president address a handful of questions that range from North Korea to Indonesia to whether the Congress should punish him over the Lewinsky scandal. Before leave Washington for this five-day trip to Japan, Korea and Guam, he draw a parallel between the governments of Iraq and North Korea, saying, We must be no less concern by North Korea's weapons activities. The Clinton administration be urgently seek to inspect a vast construction site in North Korea that it believe may be the beginnings of a nuclear weapons plant. Saturday, Clinton call that site, together with North Korea's test firing in August of a missile over Japan, cause for deep concern. But the Clinton administration be try a very different approach toward North Korea than toward Iraq, partly at the urging of Kim, who be pursue a sunshine policy of engagement with the North. As Clinton and Kim deliver prepared statements and answered questions Saturday, Clinton become most animate in describe what he call a very beautiful picture that he happen to spot after turn on his hotel television on arrive in Seoul on Friday night: film of a cruise ship recently permit to carry South Koreans on a tour into the North. I ask the North Koreans to think about this, he said, argue that Kim's policy of engagement with the North present them with a great opportunity. nothing could ever be put in that hole in the ground that would give the North Koreans as much advantage, as much power, as much wealth, as much happiness as more of those ships go up there full of people from here. The Clinton administration fears that the construction site may be evidence that North Korea have abandon a 1994 pledge to the United States to give up its nuclear weapons program in exchange for billions of dollars in aid. The North Koreans have deny that the complex be intend to help build nuclear weapons. But they have demand that the United States pay $300 million to inspect it, a request reject this week by a U.S. delegation to pyongyang, the north korean capital. The new complex be be build on a mountainside about 25 miles northeast of Yongbyon, the former north korean nuclear research center. Kim continue Saturday to emphasize his hopes for a new opening toward North Korea. But he said, We will not tolerate any possible attempt of North Korea to proliferate nuclear weapons, missiles and other weapons of mass destruction. The Clinton administration plans to resume negotiate with North Korea over inspect the site in December. In addition to strategies for ease the asian financial crisis, Clinton discuss North Korea during a visit to Tokyo on Thursday and Friday. The subject of North Korea consume most of his two hours of meetings with Kim here Saturday at the Blue House, which contain the Korean president's office and home. The administration have be criticize in Congress and in this region for let its policy on North Korea drift, but Clinton call that policy a clear-eyed mix of diplomacy and deterrence. He say that so far the 1994 agreement have worked, because without it North Korea already would have produce a sizable amount of weapons-grade plutonium. Under pressure from congressional critics, Clinton last week appoint William Perry, his former defense secretary, to review his policy on North Korea. On other matters, Clinton decline to criticize the government of Indonesia for use force to crack down on protesters there, say that he do not have enough facts at this moment to give you the right answer. But he say he hop there would be no backsliding in Indonesia. Clinton follow his appearance with Kim with a visit to the National Folk Museum here, where he conduct an hourlong conversation with six korean academics, businessmen and union leaders about the troubled state of Korea's economy and its impact on the society. He attend a state dinner Saturday night, before stop by a concert where his brother, Roger, a musician, happen to be performing. Clinton repeatedly congratulate Kim for his efforts at economic reform, note that interest rates have fall here and the currency have stabilized. But he also press Kim during their private meetings to restructure the five huge conglomerates, or chaebols, that account for some 40 percent of the Korean economy. In describe the leaders' conversation, Berger call restructure the chaebols perhaps the most serious remain problem in the south korean economy. Clinton say during the economic forum Saturday afternoon that he felt impatient about South Korea's failure to act on the chaebols. It may be necessary to proceed slowly with the restructuring, he said, but they should begin. On Sunday, Clinton plan to visit some of the 37,000 american troops station here. In a green aviator jacket and black cap, President Clinton spend Sunday visit american troops station in South Korea. He promote a private, sang birthday greetings to a sergeant major and describe the threats to his hopes for peaceful engagement with North Korea. Lately, signs of danger have intensified, Clinton say in an address to airmen here, stand before a gunmetal gray f-16 and a-10 parked nose-to-nose. So we must remain vigilant. And thanks to you, we are. For all his eagerness to talk about information-age economic dangers like quicksilver currency flows, Clinton have return again and again during his five-day trip to Japan and South Korea to the old-style regional military threat pose by North Korea. The subject consume most of his meetings with President Kim Dae-jung of South Korea on Saturday and form the backdrop for his visits with the troops Sunday. It's kind of tense around here, say John Kelley, a 26-year-old airman from Wisconsin, describe life on this base. You know you're only four minutes away from a missile. In his speech, Clinton point to recent north korean missile tests, incursions into the south and a mysterious underground site that may be a nuclear weapons installation as signs of the potential threat. And he compare North Korea to Iraq, say that North Korea be also a major concern because of its chemical and biological weapons. Until North Korea fully commit itself to a constructive role on this peninsula, he said, we must remain ready. Clinton restate his support for Kim's policy of engagement with North Korea, though, say that there be some hopeful signs to justify it. He point to talks that begin over the summer between the american military command in Korea and the north korean military to prevent problems along the demilitarized zone between the south and north. Clinton plan to leave South Korea early Monday and return to Washington Monday night, after pay a visit to Guam. On a bright but icy afternoon, Clinton be warmly receive here by soldiers in camouflage and black boots, some of whom wait almost three hours, shift from foot to foot and rub their hands. The official crowd estimate be only 3,500, but the turnout seem even smaller. The base, about 30 miles south of Seoul, be one of two major american airfields in Korea, housing 7,500 airmen. Others who want to see the president be bus in from sites that be hours away. Before fly here by helicopter, Clinton attend church on an Army base in Seoul, then visit a firing range just 12 miles from the demilitarized zone. In a brief ceremony there, he promote Matt Prickett of West Liberty, Ohio, from private first class to specialist. And he lead the troops in a round of happy Birthday for Sgt. Maj. Charles Thomas of Wilson, N.C., who turn 45 on Sunday. It definitely catch me off guard, Thomas said. SEOUL, South Korea (AP) U.S. President Bill Clinton win South Korea's support Saturday for confront North Korea over a suspected nuclear site, and he warn the North's communist leaders not to squander a chance to achieve last peace on the peninsula.

On a darker note, he mention recent tensions over asian steel exports to the United States, which have skyrocket this year at great cost to the domestic U.S. steelmakers. japanese steel be the big problem, but south korean steel exports also be on the rise. Clinton say the U.S. economy could tolerate increase imports if they be not concentrate in just a few industries, and if the result be that the asian economies begin to recover. We have to be sensitive if the price of do that be to basically erase an entire sector of the U.S. economy, Clinton said. North Korea have agree to receive a U.S. delegation next month to discuss american concerns about the construction of a vast underground complex that be widely fear to house a nuclear weapons program, the State Department say on Wednesday. The delegation, lead by Charles Kartman, will press for access to the site, which american intelligence agencies believe could be the centerpiece of an effort to revive a frozen nuclear arms program. We've make clear to the North Koreans that any attempt by North Korea to pursue a nuclear weapons development program would be unacceptable, the State Department spokesman, James Rubin, said. The talks in Pyongyang, the capital, he added, be aim at completely satisfy U.S. concerns about the suspect construction. american intelligence agencies fear that build the complex could be an effort to break out of a four-year-old pact in which North Korea pledge to give up its nuclear-weapons program in exchange for billions of dollars in aid from the United States, South Korea and Japan. American officials have say spy satellites have recently photograph thousands of North Koreans around the huge site 25 miles northeast of Yongbyon, the nuclear center where North Korea be believe to have stockpile enough plutonium before the 1994 accords to build six or more bombs. Although they have not explain exactly why the government be build the complex, north korean officials have deny that it would be use to develop nuclear weapons. The official north korean press agency say last week that the government be build civilian underground structures on which any `doubt' cannot be cast and suggest that american officials would be allow to inspect the complex if they press for access. If the U.S. side persist in inspect our underground structures, the press agency said, we can show it to them. Rubin say the United States have receive no formal assurances that kartman, the american special envoy for korean nuclear issues, and his delegation would be allow to inspect the site on the trip, which be to begin on Nov. 16. We be begin a discussion with them in which we will demand access, Rubin said. The history of the U.S.-North Korea discussions involve usually a lengthy discussion process before there be agreement to our requirements. So we be not expect to walk in one day and be able to have access the next. The trip be announce as signs grow about a relative warming of relations between the United States and North Korea. Representatives of the United States, China and the two Koreas meet recently in Geneva and agree to steps to reduce tension on the korean Peninsula. In September the United States pledge to provide an additional 300,000 tons of grain to North Korea, which have for years be cripple by severe food shortages. In addition the White House disclose that the United States would provide more heavy fuel oil promise to North Korea under the 1994 agreement, despite concerns that North Korea may intend to revive its nuclear program. american officials have say the activity near Yongbyon may not yet have technically violate the accord, because there be no evidence that North Korea have begin pour cement for a new reactor or a reprocessing plant to convert nuclear waste to bomb-grade plutonium. This city have always keep an unwritten list of foreign leaders dictators, unfriendly authoritarians and consistently annoy allies who it think can make an enormous contribution to peace, security or America's agenda by take early retirement, at a minimum. In the 1950s, the leftist leaders of Iran and Guatamala make the top 10, in the '60s it be populate by Diem and Sukarno and other Southeast Asians. President Richard M. Nixon and his advisers infamously agree at a secret meeting in the '70s that the best way to deal with the government of Salvador Allende Gossens in Chile be to make the economy scream. Diplomatic etiquette, though, have usually discourage shout America's enemies list from the White House rooftop. After all, foreign policy isn't about personalities, right? But last week, drive by frustration, or anxiety, or perhaps the lure of sound tough for cameras, the Clinton administration pip up, twice. In very different situations, in opposite corners of the world, the United States speak loudly because it can't find a stick. Sunday, hours after he call off an attack on Iraq, Clinton finally volunteer the obvious, that the focus of U.S. policy toward Iraq be the removal of President Saddam Hussein what Clinton call support the forces of change in Iraq. No matter that covert efforts to do just that have fail miserably. The big surprise come Monday, when polite-to-a-fault Al Gore use his visit to Malaysia for an asian economic summit meeting to throw U.S. support behind protesters call for reformasi, the code word on the streets of Kuala Lumpur for dump Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamed. He have long be a burr in Washington's side, denounce America, its currency traders and its Jews. He recently imprison his western-thinking finance minister, Anwar Ibrahim, who have suddenly become Asia's most visible jailed dissident. But Mahathir be no Saddam, not by a long shot. Gore's aides insist that his speech be a call for reform, not a demand that Mahathir step down. But it wasn't interpret that way. The New Zealanders call it megaphone diplomacy. The malaysian government call it disgust and an interference in internal affairs. Predictably, executives of several U.S. companies that have flock to Kuala Lumpur tell the Malaysians that Gore be rude, while assure Washington that he have utter words that need to be said. Whatever the wisdom of the Gore's words, they raise the question of what it take these days for the world's most powerful nation to begin publicly suggest that it's time for a nettlesome leader to go. Because there be no official list, there be no real criteria for get on it. Some leaders mysteriously escape mention, like Kim Jong Il of North Korea. President Clinton be spend the weekend on the Korean Peninsula, star across the demilitarized zone at a dangerous state that everyone suspect be attempt to break out of its 1994 agreement to freeze its nuclear weapons projects, in return for billions in western energy aid. Yet Washington have never call on the starve North Koreans to revolt against Kim's repressive regime. His government, take a page out of the Saddam playbook, suggest last week that if the United States really want to look at a mountain tunnel that the Pentagon believe be a nuclear installation in the making, it should write a check for another $300 million. No one even call for Kim's removal when, a few months ago, he lob a three-stage missile over Japan just to show he know how. The rules for call for the end of a regime be pretty murky, say Richard Feinberg, a professor at the University of California at San Diego who serve in the Clinton administration's first term. When they really want to push someone out, it be because that country be part of a large strategic concern at the time. But the country itself usually doesn't have great strategic weight it's another matter to call for a change of leadership in Beijing or Moscow and it help if there be some kind of domestic opposition that we can point to. Clinton's call for Saddam's ouster last weekend create barely a ripple because, after all, he be a proven murderer and an avid stockpiler of anthrax and plutonium (even if Brent Scowcroft, who be President George Bush's national security adviser, insist last week that Saddam nowadays be simply an irritant, an annoyance, a pest and a problem, but not a threat to the region at the moment). Mahathir, however, be far more complex case. He's a prime example of how opposing Washington's political and economic agenda for an interconnected world can move a leader from the list of authoritarians whom Washington tolerate to the list of authoritarians who have outlive their usefulness. Like other asian strongmen Ferdinand Marcos of the Philippines and Suharto of Indonesia come to mind he be useful when the fear be that Malaysia would become a communist domino. But he also seem eminently tolerable long after the Cold War be over. He have never be accuse of enormous corruption. He turn his country into a model of competitiveness, and Malaysia become the exemplar of the big emerging markets that Clinton's Commerce Department tout until things go sour last year. Sure, he be always prickly. But he be no terrorist or killer U.S. companies have flock to his country, and say they want to stay and his iron control over political discourse be no strong than in neighboring Singapore. Just this summer, U.S. Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin pay him an ostensibly friendly, if strained, visit and make no reference to human rights. That all change when Ibrahim be arrest and beat in jail. He have long be an advocate of the western-style solutions to economic turmoil more openness, more freedom and the protest movement against Mahathir only surface once he be in jail. Gore leapt on that opportunity particularly striking because, in the case of Indonesia earlier this year, it take the administration months to come to the conclusion that President Suharto have to go. He went.

50,"It be a surprising scene three months ago when Dennis Rivera, one of New York City's most left-leaning labor leaders, be sing the praises of Sen. Alfonse M. D'Amato. Rivera, president of the large union in New York City, praise D'Amato for persuade Trent Lott, the Senate majority leader, to support legislation that finance health coverage for hundreds of thousands of uninsured children. It look as if Rivera's politically potent union might endorse D'Amato or at the very minimum stay neutral in this year's U.S. Senate race in New York. But on Monday, Rivera's 150,000-member union, 1199, the National Health and Human Service Employees union, endorse Rep. Charles E. Schumer, D-N.Y., and thereby risk D'Amato's wrath. The endorsement be risky, labor leaders acknowledge, because anger this powerful senator could make him far less responsive to labor's needs when unions turn to him for help in the future if he be re-elected. Although it may seem illogical, two words go far to explain why Rivera's union back Schumer: Monica Lewinsky. Largely as a result of the Lewinsky scandal, Democrats say they suddenly fear that the Republicans will gain a filibuster-proof, 60-seat majority in the Senate, where the Republicans have 55 seats to the Democrats' 45. For labor leaders like Rivera, the notion of a strong Republican majority be a nightmare. That fear have help push other New York unions into Schumer's column, even though D'Amato have long court them. Those unions include the teamsters' joint council in New York City and District Council 37, an umbrella group represent 120,000 municipal employees. labor leaders say they fear that with a filibuster-proof Republican majority, the Senate would push through anti-union legislation, like recently defeat republican proposals to curb labor's political spending and cut financing for the National Labor Relations Board. We be worried about legislation that will not allow the labor movement to survive into the next century, Rivera said. Alarmed that the Democrats will lose Senate seats in California, Illinois, Wisconsin, Nevada and South Carolina, Rivera's union conclude that it be worth back Schumer. The decision, Rivera emphasize repeatedly, be not personal but be base on national considerations. Unfortunately, the leadership of the Republican Party at the national level in the person of Newt Gingrich and Trent Lott be not necessarily from the same culture as the Republicans of the Northeast, he said. They're far more conservative, far more anti-labor, far more anti-worker, far more pro-business. We fear that the Democratic Party face irrelevance in the United States Senate if we go below 41 seats. try to avoid a rupture with D'Amato, Rivera praise him as an effective senator. The endorsement could be a boon for Schumer. Rivera's union and the teachers' union have labor's strong political operations in New York. In addition, Schumer will get thousands of dollars from the local as well as use of its renowned phone banks, which can make 50,000 political call a day. A spokesman for D'Amato said, Al D'Amato's proud that he's be endorse by over 100 union federations and locals, represent more that 400,000 work men and women, and he'll continue his efforts on behalf of work middle class families. His labor endorsements include the New York City Patrolmen's Benevolent Association and the New York State Building and Construction Trades Council. Besides the backing of 1199, Schumer also receive the endorsement of 1199's parent union, the Service Employees International Union, which have 350,000 members in New York State. Rivera who do not support D'Amato the last time he run either announce the endorsements during the founding convention of the New York State Council of the service employees union. The convention pack Town Hall, and the new group aim to make the service employees a power to be reckon with by bring together a dozen union locals to forge a common political and legislative strategy. Earlier this year, 1199 merge with the service employees, and as part of that agreement, Rivera become head of the service employees in New York State. nearly 60 years behind the times, the House vote Friday to condemn the nazi-soviet nonaggression pact of 1939. The measure, a nonbinding resolution, be bring to the floor by Rep. John Shimkus, R-Ill. He be of lithuanian descent, have a pocket of Lithuanians in his hometown of Collinsville and want to try to highlight his support for the Baltic states' past efforts against soviet repression. Shimkus' measure be an example of how members of Congress be spend their time as they stand idle and wait for republican leaders to reach agreement on spending bills with the White House, thus avoid a government shutdown and allow them to go home and campaign for the November elections. With time on their hands, many Republicans be use the House floor as their personal stage to elicit votes on topics that they can boast about to the folks back home. most of these matters have little chance of find their way into law, but members hope to turn them to their advantage on Election Day. There be plenty of other items whose sponsors hope will not attract attention. These tend to be special-interest matters that members hope will escape scrutiny in the rush to leave town. The sponsors of these measures now have the added advantage of the impeachment inquiry, which have be preoccupy Congress, the news media and the public and give them cover to move their pet cause quietly into the gigantic omnibus package that Congress will eventually present to Clinton for signing. These quiet measures include one propose by Mississippi's two senators, Trent Lott and Thad Cochran, both Republicans. They want agriculture export credits to buy chickens for Russia, which have buy the chickens but cannot pay for them. The chickens be from Mississippi. Democrats have little influence in the republican-controlled Congress. But some Democrats be close enough to Republican leaders, and to Republican goals, that their measures be take seriously. These include Rep. John Murtha, D-Pa., the ranking Democrat on the national security subcommittee of the Appropriations Committee, who be push a measure to increase military pensions. perhaps the best example of an attempt to force a vote for political advantage be a measure that would require minors to notify their parents if they be seek contraceptives from federally fund family plan clinics. House leaders allow the measure to be bring to the floor as a way to appease the more conservative members, who believe they have be shortchanged by the budget process. It pass the House by a vote of 224-200 but have almost no chance of become law. The Senate do not plan to take it up, and Clinton would almost certainly veto it. But Rep. Tom Coburn, R-Okla., say that votes like these be important because they put their sponsors' ideological foes on the record as oppose something that sound reasonable, and that opposition can be use against them in the Nov. 3 election. It be not a voice mail message that Dr. Marilyn Rymer, a neurologist in Kansas City, Mo., would routinely delete, even as a registered Democrat. Speaker Newt Gingrich's office, it said, be call to discuss a national leadership award. Dr. Rymer have win acclaim as the director of a prominent stroke-treatment center, but this proposition seem particularly grand. When she return the call, she say she be tell she would also be name honorary chairman of an elite committee to advise Gingrich on legislation. Too good to be true? Well, Dr. Rymer would have to pay her own way if the committee should actually meet, and as an honorary committee chairman, she discovered, she would be a member of a committee compose entirely of honorary chairmen. And oh, the speaker want a donation of $500 to $1,000 to help our efforts, accord to a transcript of a similar chat with another doctor, to elect a big republican majority in the House of Representatives. With the approach of the midterm elections next month, it turn out that the National Republican Congressional Committee, which support candidates for the House, have be sponsor similar calls to tens of thousands of small-business owners, include doctors. With this and other fund-raising programs, the committee say it have amass $62 million for the elections. But campaign finance watchdogs say the solicitations mark a new departure in political fund raising, one they call akin to the practices of market companies like the Publishers' Clearing House that hook consumers with visions of million-dollar windfalls to induce them to subscribe to magazines. By cite the speaker and promising celebrity and influence, they say, the calls be a bait-and-switch scheme to seize the attention of people who might otherwise hang up. Dr. Rymer say she be incensed. So be Dr. Stanley Turecki, a child and family psychiatrist in New York who vote as an independent and be also called. I be absolutely outraged, he said. anybody else who would do that would fall into the category of consumer fraud. Kenneth Gross, a Washington lawyer who specialize in election law and represent both democratic and republican clients, said, I have never hear of that particular device. But it doesn't appear illegal, he said, adding, It's a fund-raising gimmick to get attention. Fred Wertheimer, president of Democracy 21, a nonprofit, nonpartisan advocate of campaign finance reform, said, This be a new version of caveat emptor buyer be damn instead of buyer beware. When businesses do it, he added, Congress orders investigations. But this isn't go to be investigate because it's members of Congress who be do it. Todd Harris, a spokesman for the National Republican Congressional Committee, say that he have not hear of any complaints and that there be no intent to deceive. The national leadership award be a part of what we call donor and member fulfillment, Harris said. It's part of bring them into the process. It's important that they be recognize for the support they give the party. There's no quid pro quo that people solicit could receive awards for past contributions, he added. What most peeves Drs. Rymer and Turecki be the message leave with secretaries and answer machines invoke Gingrich's office and propose the award. They say they envision a senior aide at a telephone in the speaker's chambers under the Capitol Dome. The calls, however, be not place by aides to gingrich, by any of his offices or by anyone in Washington. They be make by people with headsets and computers at the home of InfoCision Management Corp., a telemarketing firm and Congressional committee client in Akron, Ohio. On its Web page, InfoCision say its 1,400 employees operate 1,584 telephone lines and 9 phone centers. Every word in the script be approve by our clients, the company say on its Web site. Every conceivable objection be script with a powerful rebuttal. Besides telemarketing for businesses, say Jamie Blair, a supervisor at the center, we specialize in help the Republican Party and conservative political groups. however far they be from Gingrich, the telemarketers be instruct to answer return call with: Republican Congressional Committee, Newt Gingrich's office. May I help you? A doctor in Kansas City, Mo., who be a registered Republican and who decline to be named, dial the Gingrich number (888-484-1644) left on answer machines and secretly record the ensue discussion, which be legal in Missouri. We be ask to contact you on behalf of the speaker, say a woman who pick up the call and identify herself as Nancy. He be right now aggressively push legislation to cut taxes by as much as half, and he's also interested in legislation to cut capital gains to a single rate of 15 percent. To assure passage of the legislation, the speaker want to increase his republican majority, she says, adding, To help us do that, the speaker be pull together a group of individuals such as yourself and be invite you to be an honorary chairman on his advisory council. Nancy continues: There will be correspondence with the speaker, such as conference calls. It's a great way that he can get your input and thoughts on legislation that do concern you. Or maybe surveys or questionnaires. Later, Nancy says: As a member of his committee, you would be receive from the speaker our national leadership award, which be really quite an honor. And to be honest, he will be ask each of our chairmen if they could help our efforts to increase our majority with a one-time contribution of $500 or $1,000. now that would be use on the nationwide media campaign that Newt have undertake to target those seats we really need. And as someone who i'm sure would also benefit from this, could I tell the speaker he could count on your help? The doctor demurs. I be a registered, you know, republican in Kansas, she tell Nancy. Probably if I be to do something it would be to go through my own representative. then the doctor try to ascertain where Nancy be located. be this congressman Gingrich's office that I'm talk to? the doctor asks. The speaker's office, say Nancy. This be the speaker's office. That I'm talk to, say the doctor, double-checking. uh-huh, Nancy replies. The law prohibit political fund-raising calls from federal offices. Vice President Al Gore be under a Justice Department investigation for fund-raising calls he allegedly make from his office in the 1996 presidential campaign. But the calls can be make from just about anywhere else, include campaign offices. Harris say the calls be in no way relate to the speaker's OFFICIAL office. He added: What be more important be not where the calls get routed. People be more interested in an award with the speaker's good name on it than whether the call get rout to Washington or Ohio. Turecki disagrees. I see it as basic sleaze, he said. The last time George Voinovich run for office, he win re-election as Ohio's governor with 72 percent of the vote, stun even his most optimistic supporters and set a 20th-century record for victory margins in Ohio politics. This year, Voinovich, a Republican who be bar from seek a third term, be run again, this time for the Senate seat hold by John Glenn, a Democrat who be retiring. And while there be few who expect Voinovich to repeat his electoral benchmark of four years ago, politicians of both parties generally acknowledge that he be well position to increase the republican majority in the Senate. That have not prevent Voinovich's democratic opponent, Mary Boyle, from undertake a vigorous campaign. Ms. Boyle, a former commissioner in Cuyahoga County, which encompass Cleveland, be crisscross the nation's seventh-most populous state in what she describe as a grass-roots campaign that, while operate on a comparative shoestring, have nonetheless attract to her side nationally know Democrats President Clinton foremost among them on the campaign trail. Glenn, the former astronaut who be prepare to return to space this month at the age of 77, have not make an endorsement in the Senate race. Like many candidates this year, Ms. Boyle, 55, be campaign hard on the issue of education, seek to portray Voinovich, 61, as a lackluster steward who allow the state's schools to decline. He promise to be the education governor, say Ms. Boyle. But after seven and a half years he have fail the students of this state. Her role in the campaign, she said, be to remind the people of the state of Ohio that George Voinovich make a promise and that he didn't deliver on it. Specifically, she discuss a decision last year by the Ohio Supreme Court that cite wide disparities in the quality of the state's schools and rule unconstitutional the formula for funding them. She have also attack her republican opponent for support a proposal to raise the state's sales tax by one percent. Under that plan, half the additional funds would have be use for school improvement with the remainder earmark for reduce property taxes. That statewide ballot initiative last May prove to be wildly unpopular, with about 80 percent of the voters oppose it. While the topics of taxes and education be hot ones this political season in Ohio, it be not clear that Ms. Boyle's emphasis on them have help her campaign. Despite some narrowing in the opinion polls, she be still trail Voinovich by 15 percentage points in some polls and as much as 20 points in others. There be also a sharp fund-raising disparity. Ms. Boyle, who be run her first statewide race and have widespread union support, have raise nearly $2 million so far, far less than the nearly $7 million Voinovich have take in. Also, Voinovich, a former lieutenant governor, have be on statewide ballots five times over the last 20 years and thus be the better-known candidate. The electoral dynamics of Ohio be also aid Voinovich. The northern half of the state, with its history of industrial, unionized cities, have a tradition of vote largely for democratic candidates, while the southern tier of the state be consider more conservative and typically lean Republican. But Voinovich and Ms. Boyle share the same home terrain, deprive Ms. Boyle of the geographic advantage that often accompany democratic candidates. Indeed, as a boy, Voinovich once deliver newspapers to the Boyle home in the working-class Collinwood section of Cleveland. And Voinovich, a former mayor of Cleveland, have develop a reputation as a moderate Republican who work well with Democrats. Voinovich, while campaign vigorously himself, be keep a full schedule of official duties, assume the role of the experienced, elect official. If I get into the Senate, I will probably know more about domestic policy than any member of the Senate, he say in an interview on Wednesday in Canton, sandwich between a ribbon-cutting ceremony and a fund-raising reception at a vacuum clean museum. As mayor, I have my nose rub into the problems of urban America and be fairly successful in deal with them. And, as governor, I have deal with the problems of Medicaid, welfare and education. I'm the only person in the United States who have be president of the National League of Cities and chairman of the National Governors Association. To his opponent's charges on his record on education, Voinovich be dismissive. I'm probably the only Republican in the United States who have be endorse by the Ohio Education Association and National Education Association, he said, add that Ms. Boyle be a member of the state Legislature during the period cite in the Supreme Court ruling. Mary Boyle be vice chairman of the Ways and Means Committee and a member of the democratic leadership during those years, Voinovich said. They do nothing to fix the buildings, they do nothing for technology and the urban school districts. Ms. Boyle, who have not yet begin to run campaign commercials on television, say her status as the underdog have allow me to be more focused, more intense. Pausing after a campaign fund-raising breakfast with former democratic Sen. Bill Bradley of New Jersey here on Wednesday, Ms. Boyle said: This have be a marathon and it's be pretty much uphill. But now, we're down to the last three miles. It's a tough race. In a cocoon of loyal and wealthy supporters, President Clinton say Friday that he must live with the consequences of his mistakes, although he contend that Democrats should take pride in the achievements of his presidency and take heart from its possibilities. Clinton have stop apologize for his conduct with Monica Lewinsky, but he have take to make glancing, at times humble, references to it, before move on to attack the Republican Congress as indifferent to Americans' needs. He do so Friday at a series of fund-raisers. In one deft sentence, he acknowledge his personal pain while claim credit for the country's economic strength, make a compact appeal for both sympathy and support in an appearance earlier in the day in Cleveland. After thank the gathered donors for the very kind personal things they have say to him, the president declared, If I have to do it all over again, every day, I would do it in a heartbeat, to see America where it be today as compare to six years ago. As the applause die away, Clinton continued, I want you to understand, too, that we all have to live with the consequences of our mistakes in life. He add with a chuckle: most of us don't have to live with it in quite such a public way. But nobody get out of life for free. To the music of a saxophone and a hammered dulcimer, Clinton raise about $200,000 over lunch in a private home in Cleveland for the democratic Senate candidate in Ohio, Mary Boyle. then he fly to Philadelphia to raise half a million dollars for the democratic Party. By midsummer, the president's aides be delight to have persuade him to condense his fund-raising remarks to just 10 minutes of policy points and partisan jabbing. But as his troubles have grow and the mid-term elections have approached, his free-form remarks have become longer. In Cleveland on Friday, he speak for 26 minutes and here on Friday even he speak for almost 20 minutes. These fund-raising visits have fall into a pattern since Clinton's videotape grand jury testimony on Aug. 17. He be lauded, applauded and embrace by his hosts and the donors. Mr. President, these be your friends here today, say Tony George, the host of the Cleveland event, offer the refrain of those who have play a similar role. But in Cleveland as elsewhere, protesters who be scatter along the president's motorcade route be reminders of calls for his resignation and impeachment, and of the mockery some be heap upon his presidency. At a rally for the president outside city hall here Friday night a group of Teamsters chanted, two more years. Clinton's motorcade route be line downtown with hundreds of people, some of them carry supportive or condemnatory signs. After an impromptu shopping trip, during which he be greet with shouts of We love you, Clinton tell some donors at the beginning of an impassioned reprise of his Cleveland speech: I didn't even mind the protesters, that's the american way. But, he added, he prefer it when they be in the minority, and that seem to be the case. As he ride into Cleveland, Clinton pass a billboard for a local radio station, WNCX. Lovin', touchin', squeezin', it read, the words superimpose on a cartoon of the president with his arm over Ms. Lewinsky's shoulders, the Washington Monument beside them. The president leave it to his aides on Friday to respond directly to the late gusher of grand jury disclosures in Washington. Instead, in his remarks, Clinton speak with pride of his record and with urgency about address the international economic crisis and the needs of struggle farmers and schoolchildren. As he typically do now before such partisan audiences, he also walk through his political calculation for the mid-term elections. Clinton say in Cleveland that Republicans have brag privately to him about their prospects. They tell me, `Oh, we're go to do very well, Mr. President, in these mid-terms because we have so much more money than you do,' and because Democrats who turn out to re-elect Clinton would not return to the polls in an off-year. That argument, of course, would also insulate Clinton from any blame for depress the democratic vote. But he often go far than that, say that his predicament could actually help the Democrats. Lower-income Democratic voters, he said, might not bother to vote in a typical election. The people that be good enough to serve you here at this event today, they've get a lot of hassles in their life, he said. But, he said, adversity be our friend, because it can overcome apathy and focus us on what be at issue here. What should be at issue, Clinton said, be his achievements and agenda and the Republicans' record, which he describe harshly. What have they done? he ask in Cleveland. They kill the minimum wage increase for 12 million Americans. They kill campaign finance reform. They kill the tobacco reform legislation. White House officials and gay Democrats, concern that the nation's large gay and lesbian political organization be about to endorse Sen. Alfonse D'Amato for re-election, be intensely lobby the group to try to shift its support to the democratic challenger, Rep. Charles Schumer. Publicly, officials in the organization, the Human Rights Campaign, say they be still deliberate their position in the closely watched race, consider among the tight in the nation. They say they would probably make an endorsement by Friday. But privately, organization officials and gay activists from both parties who have be monitor the debate say the group be most likely to endorse D'Amato, a republican seek his fourth term. They also raise the possibility that the group would endorse both candidates, or remain neutral. If the group endorse D'Amato, say officials who speak on the condition of anonymity, the endorsement would be base on three major factors: The group tend to favor incumbents, have be search for allies among the Senate Republican majority and considers D'Amato's recent record on gay issues to be quite strong. An endorsement by the group, which be hold in high regard by many gay and lesbian voters, could prove important in swing voters to D'Amato in a tight race. It would also be a major symbolic victory for the senator, who have seek to recast himself as a centrist in recent years and could use the endorsement to build his standing among moderate swing voters. A D'Amato endorsement would also weaken Schumer's efforts to portray the incumbent as a right-wing extremist and would signify to many voters a fraying of the traditional democratic coalition that have include black and gay voters, women and labor unions. The intensity of the debate surround the endorsement underscore the importance of the New York Senate race to Democrats across the nation, who see defeat D'Amato as one of their best opportunities to prevent the Republicans from gain 60 seats in the Senate enough to stop a democratic filibuster. The Republicans currently hold a 55-to-45 majority. There be sentiment in the community that if the Republicans get 60 votes, that Trent Lott will basically be in charge politically for the next two years, say David Mixner, a close friend of President Clinton's who be gay. He be refer to the Senate majority leader, who have call homosexuality a sin and liken it to kleptomania. Saturday, Schumer pick up his own endorsement from New York's large gay and lesbian political organization, the Empire State Pride Agenda. Although the Human Rights Campaign be bipartisan, it have be very close to the Clinton administration, have many Democrats on its board and receive much of its money from democratic contributors. Largely because of the group's strong democratic ties, gay Democrats, New York liberals and White House officials be infuriate that it be even consider endorse D'Amato, who also run on the Right to Life and Conservative Party lines and often receive high ratings from the Christian Coalition, which typically oppose legislation on civil rights for gay people. Although the organization have be think to be inch toward a D'Amato endorsement for months, the lobbying campaign for Schumer have pick up intensity in the last two weeks, drive partly by a grow sense that the race be now close than ever. Democrats and advocates in both parties who support rights for gay people say that Vice President Al Gore, Hillary Rodham Clinton and Secretary for Health and Human Services Donna Shalala have make personal appeals to Human Rights Campaign officials urge them not to endorse D'Amato. White House officials say they do not know whether the three have make such appeals, and Human Rights Campaign officials decline to comment. Schumer meet privately with the group's top officials last week to make one last pitch for the endorsement. Clinton administration officials have also be buttonhole the group's board members at every opportunity, from cocktail parties to fund-raisers, raising concerns about a D'Amato endorsement. Some New York advocates of civil rights for gay people have flood the organization with phone calls, e-mail messages and letters. democratic officials have be encourage the group's major donors to express their opposition to D'Amato. People involve in the lobbying efforts say that at best, they be hop the group will endorse both candidates, or make no endorsement at all. Chuck Schumer have be a strong supporter of issues that be important to gay communities, say a senior White House official who speak on the condition of anonymity. The last thing that they should want to do be hurt the candidacy of someone who have be so supportive of their agenda. The Human Rights Campaign be consider the most influential gay and lesbian organization in Washington, with a national membership of 250,000 and an annual budget of more than $13 million. The group be create in the early 1980s in large part to counter the rise of the Christian right and Ronald Reagan. Paradoxically, D'Amato be first elect in the Reagan landslide of 1980 and remain a strong supporter of President Reagan. For D'Amato, who have aggressively court gay voters, the endorsement would represent a crown achievement in his efforts to reposition himself as a moderate. Since 1993, the senator have back the right of gay citizens to serve in the military, sponsor legislation to prevent job discrimination against gay workers and oppose his own leadership's attempts to block the nominations of two openly gay men to positions in the Clinton administration. To gay supporters of D'Amato, an endorsement by the Human Rights Campaign would signify the political maturation of the gay electorate and help the organization insulate itself from accusations that it be too close to the democratic Party. Those who support a D'Amato endorsement, include top officials within the Human Rights Campaign, contend that in the current political climate, where Congress be almost certain to remain under Republican control after November, gay people must build alliances with moderate Republicans. Human Rights Campaign officials also say their standing policy be to support friendly incumbents, even when their challengers have good voting records on gay issues. That be the case in New York, where Schumer's rating by the Human Rights Campaign have be consistently better than D'Amato's. Both men, however, have anger advocates of rights for gay people by vote for legislation that allow states to not recognize gay marriages. In a precedent widely cite by D'Amato supporters, the organization endorse Sen. John F. Kerry, a Democrat, over the Republican challenger, William Weld, in the 1996 Massachusetts Senate race, even though Weld's record on gay rights be consider stronger. The move anger gay Republicans, who now contend that snub D'Amato would prove that the group be bias toward Democrats. But there be clearly a large number of Human Rights Campaign contributors and board members who strongly feel that endorse D'Amato will permanently damage the group, particularly among women. They fear that abortion rights supporters will quit the group in droves because D'Amato have never waver in his opposition to abortion during 18 years in Congress. Many New York gay activists would also be deeply upset if the group endorse D'Amato, whom they blame for instal the state Senate majority leader, Joseph Bruno, whom they consider to be strongly anti-gay. Matt Foreman, executive director of the Empire State Pride Agenda, cite D'Amato's role as the architect of the state Republican Party as a major reason the group endorse Schumer. While he have criticize fellow Republicans in Washington for their intolerance, here at home, his own party's blatant discrimination be still the order of the day, Foreman said. For that reason, some White House officials say they think a Human Rights Campaign endorsement of D'Amato will be almost meaningless among gay voters. They contend that it might even hurt the senator among his conservative base. I don't think anybody will vote for Al D'Amato because of an HRC endorsement, say a White House aide who speak on the condition of anonymity. But I think some people in the Right to Life Party and some upstate people be go to say, `Who be this guy and why should we vote for him?' White House officials and gay Democrats, concern that the nation's large gay and lesbian political organization be about to endorse Sen. Alfonse D'Amato for re-election, be intensely lobby the group to try to shift its support to the democratic challenger, Rep. Charles Schumer.

I don't think anybody will vote for Al D'Amato because of an HRC endorsement, say a White House aide who speak on the condition of anonymity. But I think some people in the Right to Life Party and some upstate people be go to say, `Who be this guy and why should we vote for him?' In other election years, Reps. David Price and Julia Carson would have have little in common other than that they be Democrats with relatively safe seats. Price be a centrist who have represent this high-tech district in North Carolina for all but 2 of the last 12 years, a political scientist who have teach at Duke and Yale. Mrs. Carson, fairly liberal, be a House freshman who work her way up in politics from the grass roots, have be rear in poverty. But party officials who open this election year with high hopes of recapture the House be begin to worry that democratic incumbents like Price and Mrs. Carson share something else: greater-than-expected peril on Election Day. As in many congressional races, the big variable be the White House scandal, which have inject fear and uncertainty into campaigns around the country. other democratic incumbents who republican officials cite as lock in contests that be more competitive than expect include Reps. Corrine Brown of Florida, Vic Snyder of Arkansas, Lois Capps and Ellen Tauscher of California, Martin Frost of Texas, Melvin Watt of North Carolina, John LaFalce of New York and Sander Levin of Michigan. here in North Carolina's 4th Congressional District, Price, acknowledge that his own polls show him in a tight race, said: This be a swing district that be sensitive to any tide or trend. It's something you think about a lot in connection with the president's troubles. The efforts of Price and Mrs. Carson to contain the Lewinsky debacle and their opponents' attempts to capitalize on it offer important clues suggest how Clinton's problems be influence the conduct of races around the country. many Democrats be straddle a line that seem to shift a bit with every new scandal-related disclosure: they do not want to appear close to a president whose conduct embarrass them, and yet, sense the possibility of a public backlash against Republicans, they be weigh their words carefully and be wary of hop on any impeachment bandwagon. And while publicly these Democrats express confidence that the scandal will have little impact on them, their campaigns be prepare for the bad by place great emphasis than ever on behind-the-efforts to prod their core constituencies to vote. In a reflection of the uncertainty that the Clinton scandal have cast even among Republicans, the challengers in the Price and Carson districts both be political novices seek office for the first time have differ strategies: Tom Roberg, a computer executive in Raleigh who be take on Price, have broadcast a television commercial exploit the scandal. Tom Roberg have call for Bill Clinton's resignation, the narrator says. This be not the time to be silent, Price. Where do you stand? But in Indianapolis, Gary Hofmeister, a conservative jeweler challenge Mrs. Carson in Indiana's 10th Congressional District, be take a more subtle approach: rather than mention the scandal directly, he note as often as he can that Julia vote with Clinton almost 100 percent of the time. ask why he be not much raise the scandal directly, Hofmeister said: Don't murder somebody when they're in the process of commit suicide. There would be a danger if we go overboard. The best evidence of the discomfort of both Price and Mrs. Carson be that when ask in separate interviews whether they would want Clinton to campaign in their districts, both say it would be impossible at this late date for the White House to schedule a visit. What if there be a sudden schedule change? Both paused, squirm a bit and muster answers that be hardly affirmative. Given the president's popularity, I doubt it will hurt me, Mrs. Carson said. And Price? I don't think that would be such a good idea, he said. I've never have a president campaign here, and I wouldn't want to start this time although he be eagerly welcoming Erskine Bowles, the president's chief of staff and a popular native son in North Carolina, to stump with him here this Sunday.) Making strategy for the stump be far complicate by anecdotal evidence that run counter to democratic fears and Republican hopes. In three days of campaign stops here in North Carolina and in Indianapolis, the scandal be rarely raise by any voter be court by the candidates of either party. When a reporter ask about it, many voters say that as appal as they be at Clinton's behavior, they have a hard time relate it to their decision on which way to vote in the congressional elections in five weeks. As Hofmeister walk through the parking lot outside a gun and knife show at the Indiana National Guard Armory in Indianapolis last Sunday, Billy Derringer, a 57-year-old machinist who be retire on disability, call him over to express outrage about the millions of dollars that have be spend to investigate Clinton. It's pathetic to spend all of our money, say Derringer, who identify himself as an independent. It shouldn't have get this far. Hofmeister try his best to make the Republicans' case. There have to be rule of law, he said. Mrs. Carson say she hop that Democrats and swing voters alike would become so fed up with the Lewinsky inquiry that the issue might even help her. To that end, she proudly inform audiences that she vote against make public the report deliver to the House by Kenneth Starr, the Whitewater independent counsel. I be one of 63 members of Congress who vote against put all that filth on the Internet, she said, add that Starr's inquiry have be a cruel hoax in terms of fiscal responsibility and accountability. The Carson campaign be count on voters like Timothy Daly, a 38-year-old real estate executive who vote for a republican two years ago but now favor Mrs. Carson. I'm pull the democratic ticket because I'm tire of it: the right side of the Republican Party be play politics, Daly said. We'd like to see them go on with the people's business. Back here in the 4th District, Price have some reasons to be worried. He be first elect to the House in 1986 but, as a four-term incumbent, be oust in the republican sweep of 1994 (only to win his seat back two years later). In addition, the district be redrawn last year to include a large Durham section where voters do not know him well. determine not to be a midterm casualty of Clinton once again, Price say he be wag the most vigorous get-out-the-vote ground campaign of his career. Rather than engage Roberg over the Clinton scandal, Price have begin broadcast a television commercial that emphasize his central issue: education. The congressman's advisers say they intentionally produce an advertisement that appear decidedly nonpolitical it feature school children in a play in an effort to break through the television clutter about the scandal. But the Price campaign also have a weapon it be hold in reserve, in the event Roberg appear to be rid the Clinton scandal to advantage: the incumbent's advisers say they would not be timid about run commercials underscore that he earn a divinity degree before get his doctorate in political science. At a coffee with voters in a wealthy enclave of Raleigh the other night, Roberg open his remarks by assert that Clinton have lose the moral authority to lead. Yet none of those assemble ask him about the scandal; they be more concerned about the state's plan to build a highway near their neighborhood. The last time George Voinovich run for office, he win re-election as Ohio's governor with 72 percent of the vote, stun even his most optimistic supporters and set a 20th-century record for victory margins in Ohio politics. This year, Voinovich, a Republican who be bar from seek a third term, be run again, this time for the Senate seat hold by John Glenn, a Democrat who be retiring. And while there be few who expect Voinovich to repeat his electoral benchmark of four years ago, politicians of both parties generally acknowledge that he be well position to increase the republican majority in the Senate. That have not prevent Voinovich's democratic opponent, Mary Boyle, from undertake a vigorous campaign. Ms. Boyle, a former commissioner in Cuyahoga County, which encompass Cleveland, be crisscross the nation's seventh-most populous state in what she describe as a grass-roots campaign that, while operate on a comparative shoestring, have nonetheless attract to her side nationally know Democrats President Clinton foremost among them on the campaign trail. Glenn, the former astronaut who be prepare to return to space this month at the age of 77, have not make an endorsement in the Senate race. Like many candidates this year, Ms. Boyle, 55, be campaign hard on the issue of education, seek to portray Voinovich, 61, as a lackluster steward who allow the state's schools to decline. He promise to be the education governor, say Ms. Boyle. But after seven and a half years he have fail the students of this state. Her role in the campaign, she said, be to remind the people of the state of Ohio that George Voinovich make a promise and that he didn't deliver on it. Specifically, she discuss a decision last year by the Ohio Supreme Court that cite wide disparities in the quality of the state's schools and rule unconstitutional the formula for funding them. She have also attack her republican opponent for support a proposal to raise the state's sales tax by one percent. Under that plan, half the additional funds would have be use for school improvement with the remainder earmark for reduce property taxes. That statewide ballot initiative last May prove to be wildly unpopular, with about 80 percent of the voters oppose it. While the topics of taxes and education be hot ones this political season in Ohio, it be not clear that Ms. Boyle's emphasis on them have help her campaign. Despite some narrowing in the opinion polls, she be still trail Voinovich by 10 percentage points in some polls and as much as 18 points in others. There be also a sharp fund-raising disparity. Ms. Boyle, who be run her first statewide race and have widespread union support, have raise nearly $2 million so far, far less than the nearly $7 million Voinovich have take in. Also, Voinovich, a former lieutenant governor, have be on statewide ballots five times over the last 20 years and thus be the better-known candidate. The electoral dynamics of Ohio be also aid Voinovich. The northern half of the state, with its history of industrial, unionized cities, have a tradition of vote largely for democratic candidates, while the southern tier of the state be consider more conservative and typically lean Republican. But Voinovich and Ms. Boyle share the same home terrain, deprive Ms. Boyle of the geographic advantage that often accompany democratic candidates. Indeed, as a boy, Voinovich once deliver newspapers to the Boyle home in the working-class Collinwood section of Cleveland. And Voinovich, a former mayor of Cleveland, have develop a reputation as a moderate Republican who work well with Democrats. Voinovich, while campaign vigorously himself, be keep a full schedule of official duties, assume the role of the experienced, elect official. If I get into the Senate, I will probably know more about domestic policy than any member of the Senate, he say in an interview on Wednesday in Canton, sandwich between a ribbon-cutting ceremony and a fund-raising reception at a vacuum clean museum. As mayor, I have my nose rub into the problems of urban America and be fairly successful in deal with them. And, as governor, I have deal with the problems of Medicaid, welfare and education. I'm the only person in the United States who have be president of the National League of Cities and chairman of the National Governors Association. To his opponent's charges on his record on education, Voinovich be dismissive. I'm probably the only Republican in the United States who have be endorse by the Ohio Education Association and National Education Association, he said, add that Ms. Boyle be a member of the state Legislature during the period cite in the Supreme Court ruling. Mary Boyle be vice chairman of the Ways and Means Committee and a member of the democratic leadership during those years, Voinovich said. They do nothing to fix the buildings, they do nothing for technology and the urban school districts. Ms. Boyle, who have not yet begin to run campaign commercials on television, say her status as the underdog have allow me to be more focused, more intense. Pausing after a campaign fund-raising breakfast with former democratic Sen. Bill Bradley of New Jersey here on Wednesday, Ms. Boyle said: This have be a marathon and it's be pretty much uphill. But now, we're down to the last three miles. It's a tough race. Sen. Alfonse D'Amato, the New York Republican who be run for re-election, go to Manhattan's Grand Central Terminal the other morning to accept an award from mass-transit advocates. But the reporters who have gather there show little interest in the shiny train car at the senator's back. Instead, they repeatedly ask him how he would vote on an impeachment of President Clinton. Look, I'm not go to make any comment with respect to that subject matter, D'Amato responded. I be not just a citizen. I be a citizen-senator who may be call upon to make a decision. But D'Amato be something else as well: a candidate in what may be the tight Senate race in the nation. And variations of his elliptical response can be hear in Senate races around the country, where both Republicans and Democrats be encounter similar questions. All of which suggest that after the House vote Thursday to authorize an impeachment inquiry, this year's 34 races for the U.S. Senate have become, beyond what they already were, the electoral equivalent of jury selection. If the House vote to impeach Clinton, the matter go to the Senate, which must decide by a two-thirds majority whether to convict him and, thus, remove him from office. As a result, the Monica Lewinsky matter have suddenly inject a new disruptive force into the Senate contests. Voters, even those who support Clinton, expect their political leaders, Republican or Democratic, to renounce Clinton's behavior, and candidates have be do that. But impeachment be another matter; most polls show the nation be against it. The danger for Senate candidates be that with impeachment now a real possibility, the debate may move beyond the president's behavior about which there be little disagreement to the more problematic issue of whether he should be remove from office. For most of the strategists involve in the races, there be little guidance on how to handle the impeachment issue. Advisers to candidates of both parties say in interviews last week that they be perplex and worried, unsure what they can or should do on the issue to gain the advantage or guard against harm. I can't tell how this one be go to go, say Mike Russell, a spokesman for the Republican Senatorial Campaign Committee. This be a very surreal environment. Of the 34 Senate seats in play, 18 be hold by Democrats and 16 by Republicans, who now hold 55 seats in all. Republicans would have to win 28 of the 34 races to produce the 67 votes necessary for conviction, assume such a vote be to go along party lines. only an electoral catastrophe for the Democrats, which seem almost unthinkable, could produce such a huge loss. Jennifer Duffy, who follow Senate races for the Cook Political Report, a nonpartisan newsletter, say that so far, at least, none of the Senate candidates have make an explicit appeal for votes base on how they would vote on a presidential jury. But she and others be wonder if this may be about to change. This be difficult ground to measure. One of the central questions of this political year have be how clinton's dealings with Ms. Lewinsky might affect turnout. For a long time, politicians assume that dispirited Democrats would stay home as a rebuke to Clinton, just as many Republicans do in November 1974, three months after President Richard M. Nixon resigned. But now some analysts wonder if the partisan fight in Congress last week might have the opposite effect among some Democrats. That's the problem, say Stuart Rothenberg, the editor of an independent political newsletter in Washington. It's not that we don't know, and that the politicians don't know, where the general public stand on impeachment. The problem be that we don't know where the electorate stand on impeachment. And ask voters to think ahead to an impeachment proceeding as they cast their ballots in a Senate race is, in the words of Stuart Stevens, a Republican consultant, a double bank-shot. such strategies, he said, tend to work only with a small number of single-minded or sophisticated voters. Against that complicate backdrop, the prevailing thinking be that the use of the impeachment issue will vary from race to race, state to state and week to week, depend on the circumstances of the candidates and the composition of the electorate. If Democrats try to turn the image of Clinton in the dock to their advantage, it would be in states with a democratic edge or with sizable numbers of black voters, who overwhelmingly support the president. In contests like those, it might well prove to be in the interest of a democratic candidate to, as one consultant put it, sit down in front of a camera and tape an advertisement in which the candidate denounce the president's behavior but solemnly pledge to vote against impeachment. Strategists in both parties believe that kind of approach could prove effective. This be an issue where there be a huge disconnect between the elites and the public, say Fred Yang, a democratic consultant with clients in Wisconsin and the Carolinas. That kind of democratic strategy might emerge in California, New York, Illinois, Wisconsin, Washington and perhaps Arkansas. By contrast, Democrats in South Carolina, Georgia and Nevada would be less likely to oppose Clinton's impeachment. On the other side, republican consultants be tell their candidates to stress Clinton's misdeeds and stay away from talk of impeachment. The last thing the party want be to turn the Senate elections into a referendum on whether Clinton should be force from office. The White House might think from the overall public numbers that maybe they would like to make this a referendum election, say Ed Goeas, a republican pollster who be work in Senate races this year. Republicans certainly aren't go to let that happen. D'Amato respond to questions about Clinton with the language that republican consultants have be suggest to their candidates. When and if that matter come to the Senate, I will decide on the facts that be present to me at that time, D'Amato said. It would be very premature for me to suggest any course of action without it be referred. Because, indeed, we may be call upon to act as a jury of some kind. But Schumer, a member of the House Judiciary Committee, which be conduct the impeachment investigation, virtually embrace the issue. In a live telecast of the hearings, he say the president deserve a less punishment, such as censure or reprimand. And Schumer plan to campaign in New York on Monday with Clinton at his side. Schumer's media adviser, Hank Morris, seem to suggest last week that impeachment will grow as an issue. Senator D'Amato claim he do not want to share his opinion with the people of New York, Morris said. And if he doesn't have an opinion, he's the only New Yorker who doesn't have an opinion. ask if Schumer would raise the issue in a television commercial, Morris responded: We don't talk about what we're go to do.

The Yugoslav war crimes tribunal clear Zejnil Delalic, a Muslim, of responsibility for war crimes commit against Serb captives at a bosnian government-run prison camp under his command.

The tribunal, set up by the Security Council in 1993, have convict only one other person follow a trial Bosnian Serb Dusan Tadic, who be sentence in May 1997 to 20 years for kill and torture Muslims in 1992. Two other men have confess to kill Muslims, hand the tribunal two more convictions while spar it the need for trials. He call himself the Serb Adolf, and his crimes be as chill as his nickname. In a trial opening Monday at the Yugoslav war crimes tribunal, U.N. prosecutors be seek to convince a three-judge panel that Goran Jelisic be guilty of genocide, the court's most serious offense. The 30-year-old former Bosnian Serb mechanic confess in October to murder 12 Muslims and Croats in 1992, astonish many observers by reverse his early declarations of innocence. Although his guilty pleas mean an automatic conviction for war crimes and crimes against humanity and the likelihood of a maximum life sentence Jelisic have deny that the kill spree constitute genocide. By press on with a genocide trial, prosecutors will be able to call evidence about the background of Jelisic's murders, include the involvement of more senior Serbs. The trial also will give survivors of his ruthless campaign a chance to tell their story in court. To convict Jelisic of genocide, prosecutors must prove that the murders most of them carry out with close-range shots from an automatic pistol be part of a campaign intend to wipe out an entire ethnic group in the northern Bosnian town of Brcko. Jelisic, who be arrest in January by U.S. troops serve in the NATO force in Bosnia, have plead guilty to a total of 31 counts of war crimes and crimes against humanity. The charges cover the murders as well as three beatings and the plundering of property. In enter those guilty pleas, Jelisic tell the tribunal he want to cleanse my soul. He will officially be convict of those charges during the genocide trial. Jelisic's victims be kill in or near the Serb-run Luka prison camp, a former port complex on the banks of the Sava River. Although most victims be men, Jelisic also club one female inmate with a police baton and then fatally shot her. U.N. prosecutors say Jelisic identify himself to prisoners as the Serb Adolf, a reference to Hitler, and brag about the number of Muslims he have killed. Set up in 1993, the U.N. court have convict three Muslims, two Bosnian Croats and a bosnian Serb of war crimes include murder, rape and torture, but it have yet to register a genocide conviction. An early genocide trial be halt when the defendant, Bosnian Serb Milan Kovacevic, die of a ruptured artery in his tribunal cell.

Hundreds of people gather at Sarajevo airport on Saturday to welcome Zejnil Delalic, who be clear of war crimes charge early this week after spend 980 days in jail of the international war crimes tribunal in The Hague. Delalic, a Muslim, be clear of charges of war crimes commit in 1992 against Serb prisoners in the muslim-led bosnian Army prison camp Celebici near his hometown of Konjic. Three others involve in the same case be convict and will serve prison terms at The Hague for crimes commit as camp guards. Delalic hold up his verdict as he arrive and be first greet by his family and then by many friends from Konjic, 50 kilometers (31 miles) south of Sarajevo, where a huge welcome party for him be planned. This be the book of 500 pages in which it say 12 times Delalic be not guilty, he tell reporters. More important be that acts commit by some weren't order by officers of our bosnian Army. These acts be qualify as acts of individuals that happen on a daily basis, he said. Edina Residovic, Delalic's lawyer, say she will seek compensation for wrongful imprisonment on behalf of Delalic, who spend almost three years in confinement. Yugoslavia must cooperate with the U.N. war crimes tribunal investigate alleged atrocities during the wars in Croatia and Bosnia, international legal experts meeting in Belgrade say Sunday. The meeting be the first international debate in Yugoslavia over the U.N. tribunal's work and the government's cooperation with it. The tribunal, establish by the U.N. Security Council in 1993, sits in The Hague, Netherlands. Despite objections to the tribunal, Yugoslav authorities allow the two-day discussions organize by the Belgrade-based, non-governmental Humanitarian Law Center to take place without any problems. state-run media largely ignore the event. Though there be some disagreements, participants in the discussions generally agree that crimes against humanity cannot go unpunished. The indict who be not in The Hague be at-large because of the refusal by croatian and Yugoslav authorities to arrest and extradite them, say Mark Ellis, a lawyer and representative of the american Bar Association. Present-day Yugoslavia, consist of Serbia and Montenegro, cooperate with the tribunal in cases where Serbs be the victims in Bosnia and Croatia, the two former republics that fight wars for their secession. But Yugoslavia have question the tribunal's jurisdiction and refuse to indict three army officers want for alleged war crimes in Croatia. last week, it also refuse to allow U.N. investigators to probe alleged atrocities in Serbia's southern Kosovo province where ethnic albanian separatists be fight government forces. The tribunal be found to satanize Serbs, say Miodrag Mitic, a former legal adviser in Yugoslavia's foreign ministry. He say the U.N. court be influence by powerful countries that dominate the international body. On Saturday, David Scheffer, the U.S. State Department's ambassador at-large for war crimes, demand Yugoslavia's full cooperation. Some of the close combat in the half year of the Kosovo conflict, to the point of fight room to room and floor to floor, occurred near this village six weeks ago, in the days before 21 women, children and elderly members of the Delijaj clan be massacre by serbian forces, their mutilated bodies leave strewn on the forest floor. piece together what happened, from survive family members, ethnic albanian separatist forces and official Serbian information, a story emerge of fierce guerrilla resistance to an onslaught by serbian tanks, artillery and infantry. The serbian forces fight here appear to have suffer unusually heavy losses and, after the guerrillas finally fled, take revenge against the civilians, shoot women and children at close range as they try to run away from their pursuers. accord to relatives who find the bodies, Pajazit Delijaj, 65, be decapitated, his brain leave on display on the ground. Hava Delijaj, 65, be shoot and one of her feet cut with a knife so that it hang by a thread of skin. Young women and children who have run a few hundred yards up a rocky path be mow down. Miraculously, a 6-week-old baby, Diturie, be find by her father alive in the clasp of her dead mother, Lumnije, 30, more than 24 hours after the killings. Blood be in her mouth and her mother's hand on the baby, say Imer Delijaj, the father, an avowed member of the Kosovo Liberation Army, the ethnic Albanian guerrilla force, who return in uniform to discover the bodies. I move her hand and at that moment she open her eyes. I realize she be alive. I try to clean the blood from her mouth and she put her tongue out. several members of the Delijaj clan survived. Zejnije Delijaj, 39, who have cook for the guerrillas at the family compound when they return from fight in the days before the massacre, recall how she fled, crawling, falling, run and hide in the woods as the Serbs shot at her. I could feel the dirt hit me from the impact of the bullets, she say in an interview, her nose still bloody from what she say be a heavy fall during her flight. First it be machine guns, then grenades, then cannon, she said. Every time I move and they hear leave rustling, they shot. The massacre of the Delijajs, whose forebears settle in the Drenica Valley about 150 years ago, be not the first in the conflict that ravage the serbian province between March and October and have now lull into an uneasy truce. Indeed, the conflict between serbian forces bent on keep Kosovo in Serbia and guerrillas fight for the independence of its heavily ethnic albanian population first draw international attention with the massacre of the Jasari clan in early March by serbian units at Prekaz, in central Kosovo. But the killing of the Delijajs, ranging from the paralyzed patriarch, Fazli, 94, who be burn in his bed, to the slaughter of Valmir, 18 months, who be find shot, be the most thoroughly document so far. Human Rights Watch, a New york-based group, believe the knowledge gather so far increase the possibility of prosecutions by the U.N. war crimes tribunal in The Hague, Netherlands. The Hague's prosecutors could also draw on the observations of diplomats, human rights monitors and reporters who saw the bodies scatter in the ravine where the victims be kill before they be bury in shallow graves in the clan's nearby compound. In other Kosovo massacres, bodies have be move from the sites before they be see by independent observers. Further, family members who survive the assault have describe what they saw and the circumstances in the hills and valleys around Obrinje as the Serbs push forward early Saturday morning, Sept. 26, from their headquarters at Likovac, north of here. By then, the albanian guerrilla have flee the area around the Delijaj compound, dispersing after what a senior commander of the Kosovo Liberation Army, Naim Maloku, term particularly fierce combat with the Serbs. In the days before Sept. 26, he said, the guerrillas catch in a serbian pincer movement have decide to fight rather than surrender. The fighting sometimes house to house, even room to room take an unusually heavy toll among the Serbs, say Maloku, a former officer in the Yugoslav army. He say he believe that it be those deaths the Serbs avenge with the massacre of the Delijajs. In other major attacks during the conflict, the guerrillas generally find an escape hatch. In Obrinje, lead by another former officer of the Yugoslav army whom Maloku decline to name, the guerrillas fought, use land mines and rocket-propelled grenades. Maloku say he know from a report make by rebel headquarters that at least 47 serbian soldiers and police officers be kill in the fighting between here and Bajince, three miles east. We take weapons from 47 Serbs, he said. The state-controlled serbian media center in Kosovo's capital, Pristina, say 10 serbian police officers be kill in the fighting, include five reservists who die when their vehicle hit an antitank mine on Sept. 25. The announcement of 10 Serbs kill in one action be unusually high. The practice of take violent revenge be a time-honored tradition in the Balkans. From 1991 to 1995, in the wars in Croatia and Bosnia, Serbs, Croats and, to a far less extent, the main victims, the Muslims, avenge World War II massacres and new blood feuds, drive into kill by leaders who exploit old conflicts to carve new fiefs for themselves as the old, Communist Yugoslavia collapsed. In this case, it appears, serbian vengeance be visit upon the Delijajs. Survivors of the clan say they have fear an assault on their collection of mud and brick homes line a rocky dirt track directly opposite the village of Likovac, the Serbs' base just a mile away. The Serbs have push the rebels out of Likovac in August and the guerrilla have establish new headquarters around Bajince, six miles east of Obrinje. As the Serbs sweep down from the nearby Cicavica Mountains, and up from the road that run from Pristina to klina, it be clear that Obrinje would be a target. Most women and children in the area have move into Apple Valley, where more than 10,000 refugees have gather outdoors, seek safety in numbers. But Imer Delijaj, 38, say he decide that the ravine below his family compound would be a good hiding place. He say he believe the women, children and elderly would be spar if the Serbs find them. As the Serbs approach on foot the Saturday morning of the massacre, the last person to flee the compound itself be Bashkim Delijaj, 21, the young son of 94-year-old Fazli. Bashkim Delijaj say he have stay behind to look after his bedridden father. The shelling start again at 7 a.m. on Saturday and I saw a tank convoy approaching, with infantry behind the tanks, Bashkim Delijaj recall in an interview. I be smoke a cigarette when a grenade fell on the roof and from a hole in the gate I saw soldiers come from about 30 meters away. They be in brown army uniforms, have huge knives or small axes. many have beards. Bashkim Delijaj say he be unable to carry his father to safety, and do not have the courage to tell him what be happening. I tell him I be get the animals out of the barn, he said. He say he ran, hid, run some more, and eventually receive shelter from a farmer, all the time hear shoot and shelling. When the firing have die down Monday morning, he return to the compound and run into Imer, still wear his guerrilla uniform. They go to one of the houses and find Imer Delijaj's brother, Adem, 33, shot dead, his body sprawl on the ground in the rain, and the burned torso of Fazli. I look in the window of our house and saw only the bones of my father, which look like what we learn in biology class, he said. Together, the two men go to find out what have happen in the ravine. There they find the bodies. First, Ali, 65, who, Imer Delijaj said, have be cut through the neck with his own tobacco cut knife. then Pajazit, who have be decapitate in a makeshift tent, his brain place between two foam mattresses. then Hava, 65, who be sprawl near the tent. They move on to find Jeton, Imer's 10-year-old son, and Imer's mother, Hamide, 60, not far away. Imer's sister-in-law, Luljeta, who be seven months pregnant, have be mutilated, he said. A little further up the ravine, Imer say he saw his wife, Lumnije, 30. He open his wife's coat and find his 6-week-old baby girl, now 3 months old and recover at a relative's home in Likovac. He say he try to clean the baby and then put her under his jacket and walk a few feet further to find the bodies of his 4-year-old daughter, Menduhije, and two other young children, Donieta, 5, and Gentiana, 7. The corpses of other family members be find in the woods and two old men, Habib, 51, and Hysen, 53, be find the next morning, Imer said. On Oct. 3, the bodies of two miss teen-age girls, Mehane, 16, and Antigua, 13, be find in the bushes at the side of a road near an abandon serbian police compound. Later in the month, the body of Hajriz be find push down a well, close to the ravine. One uncle, Sharif, who be in the ravine, be still missing, presume dead. Human Rights Watch, which have be document the Delijaj massacre, have describe it as the most vicious of a pattern of attacks on civilians by the Serbs in the Kosovo conflict. (to a less extent, Albanian guerrillas also attack serbian civilians, force them from their homes, and allegedly carry out at least two massacres.) The evidence strongly indicate that the Gornje Obrinje killings be follow by conscious mutilations carry out after the victims be killed, a come report by Human Rights Watch says. Delijaj family members have tell Human Rights Watch monitors and others that they saw an ethnic albanian police officer accompany the serbian police officers during the fighting. They believe that the police officer, who be post at the nearby Glogovac police station, be use by the serbian special police officers as a guide to the Obrinje area. This police officer, who be apparently one of a small group of ethnic Albanians officers who have remain loyal to the Serbs, could be an important witness for criminal investigators from the war-crimes tribunal in The Hague, accord to human rights experts. The ethnic Albanian policeman could be an important witness to identify the police and army units responsible for the atrocities, say Peter Boueckhart, a researcher for Human Rights Watch. It be vital that those who carry out these atrocities be prosecute by the Hague tribunal. At the burned Delijaj compound in the last week, Imer Delijaj have be act as the host of a wake which, follow albanian tradition, will last several weeks and begin after family members return from their hiding places in the woods. Color photograph of the young members of the family, and of Imer's mother and grandmother, have be mount behind glass on a table outside the gate. A 30-year-old faded black and white picture of Fazli in a double-breasted suit stand apart, a sign of ultimate respect. An outsized albanian flag with a black double-headed eagle on a red field be drape behind the table. Imer Delijaj's face seem tense and his words be spare as he describe his family's death. He do not express direct remorse for allow his family to use a hiding place so close to the family compound, which for all practical purposes be an informal base for fighters. His lawyer, Bajram Krasniqi, who say he be eager to be helpful to investigators of the Hague tribunal, say in Pristina that he believe Imer Delijaj felt guilty for a faulty decision. Whether the tribunal will closely examine the case remain unclear. Slobodan Milosevic, the Yugoslav president, have issue only a handful of visa to investigators from the tribunal. Two investigators who be in Kosovo at the time of the massacre leave six days later without visit the site or contact Krasniqi about the killings. Would Imer Delijaj seek revenge? As he sit on the floor of his living room with a group of male visitors, he replied: It's easy to answer. If I can see eye to eye with men I will fight them. But only with men in uniform and in a fair fight. If I see children with them, I will treat them like children all over the world. Children be children. american and allied forces in Bosnia on Wednesday arrest a bosnian Serb general who be charge with genocide by the international war crimes tribunal in a recent secret indictment. Maj. Gen. Radislav Krstic, arrest without incident in the American sector in northeast Bosnia, be the highest-ranking official to be seize so far, and the first serve military officer. He be accuse of direct the attack on Srebrenica in 1995, one of the most chilling and influential events of the Bosnian war, when some 7,000 bosnian Muslim men be march off, presumably to their deaths, as U.N. peacekeepers stand by. The indictment of Krstic accuse him of have commit genocide during and after the fall of Srebrenica between July 11 and Nov. 1, 1995. He be indict both in connection with direct personal involvement in the commission of these crimes as well as his command responsibility. He be also accuse of murder and other crimes against humanity. Krstic be a colonel in 1995, and the deputy commander of the Drina battalion, but be promote to general within days of the fall of Srebrenica. He be consider a close associate of the Bosnian Serb commander, Gen. Ratko Mladic, and the former Bosnian Serb leader, Radovan Karadzic, both of whom be want by the tribunal. And he be consider capable, if he be willing to testify, of implicate Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic, who have not be indicted. Louise Arbour, chief prosecutor of the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia, call Krstic a very significant military leader and say she be delight with the arrest. The general be only indict on Oct. 30, tribunal officials said, but the indictment be keep secret so there would be a good chance of a successful arrest. NATO Secretary-General Javier Solana warn that other war crimes suspect still at large should realize that they, too, will be bring to justice. James Rubin, the State Department spokesman, say that the arrest serve as a stand warning to those indict for war crimes, who remain at large, that they will be hold individually accountable for their actions. The bosnian Serbs react angrily to the arrest, with the hardline Bosnian Serb president, Nikola Poplasen, say that his government would now reduce contacts with nato-led peacekeeping forces to the necessary minimum. Poplasen, who defeat a more moderate candidate back by Washington in September elections, say the arrest of Krstic have embitter and upset the Bosnian Serbs and would harm the implementation of the Dayton agreement that end the 1992-1995 bosnian war. He say he would protest the arrest, and his remarks be later endorse by parliament in a majority vote. A senior official of a NATO country call the arrest very good news and say it be a warning to Milosevic himself and others who have not be publicly indict that the murders commit have not be forgotten. A Pentagon official say the arrest, the most important make in the american sector, be a sign that this be a continue process. nato-led peacekeeping troops have now arrest nine people want for war crimes in the former Yugoslavia, four of whom be the subject of sealed indictments. There have be numerous calls for the arrest of Mladic and Karadzic, the two most infamous men indicted, but they normally be accompany by armed guards. NATO forces have never try to arrest them, apparently fear casualties and an angry public reaction from bosnian Serbs. Officials say that both Mladic and Karadzic be believe to have leave the Bosnian Serb Republic to live in Serbia, which be part of Yugoslavia and control by Milosvevic. Krstic, who be transfer to The Hague for trial, be the 35th suspect who have be take there and the 26th person currently be hold there. He be the commander of the Bosnian Serb 5th Corps and be arrest while travel on the road to Bijelina. At the outset of the war in 1992, he be an officer of the Yugoslav Army, and like all senior Bosnian Serb officers, be transfer to the new Bosnian Serb force. In 1994, he lose a leg in a mine explosion. One Bosnian Serb official say in a telephone interview that, at the time, Krstic have responsibility for anti-terrorist units who be give some of the most difficult tasks. Srebrenica be a dark part of our history and people don't talk about it, the official said. But everyone believe it be the anti-terrorist units that be send to do the killing. In Banja Luka on Wednesday, some members of the Bosnian Serb parliament protest the arrest, say that Krstic be simply do his job as a soldier. Ivo Daalder, a former Bosnia expert on the National Security Council, now with the Brookings Institution, say the arrest show a new and promising coordination between the Tribunal and NATO troops, give the rapid arrest after the Oct. 30 indictment. He also say that the arrest of a serving officer for an important war crime would send an important message. Srebrenica be a key town in the bosnian conflict. It be where the United Nations first make a stand in March 1993, when the commander of U.N. troops personally lead a convoy of trucks to the surround town and promise the bosnian Muslims there that Srebrenica would be a safe area and the United Nations would protect them. But in July 1995, the United Nations do not protect Srebrenica with air strikes, and peacekeeping troops watch as the Serbs march in, separate Muslim men and women and march the men off. Srebrenica signal the massive failure of the West, say Daalder. It galvanize the United States and NATO to act. At a London conference later in July, NATO agree to defend Gorazde and remain safe areas with massive air strikes if necessary. After a mortar attack on the Sarajevo marketplace in late August, NATO air strikes began, signal the last chapter of the war and lead to the American-brokered Dayton Accords. In Sarajevo Wednesday, an aide to the bosnian Muslim member of the collective presidency, Alija Izetbegovic, praise the arrest. We welcome this action, hop very soon that the time will come for Karadzic and Mladic to be bring to justice, say the aide, Mirza Jajric. The arrest take place as foreign ministers of the member countries of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe meet in Oslo, Norway, to discuss the international effort to keep the peace in Kosovo, the southern serbian province. Under a deal press on Milosevic in October, the organization will provide up to 2,000 civilians to monitor a cease-fire in Kosovo and to promote a political settlement there to give Kosovo enhance autonomy. Macedonia's government Wednesday formally approve the basing of 1,700 NATO troops near its border with Kosovo. Those troops will be prepare to rush to the aid of the civilian monitors if necessary. The president of the Yugoslav war crimes tribunal harshly criticize Belgrade authorities anew for refuse to let U.N. investigators probe alleged atrocities in Kosovo. In a letter to the United Nations Security Council release Wednesday by the tribunal, preside judge Gabrielle Kirk McDonald of the United States say the failure of Yugoslav officials to grant visa to investigators be an affront. The intentional and continuous refusal by the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia to comply with its clear and incontrovertible legal obligations to the tribunal be an affront to the Security Council and all law-abiding nations, she said. The Texas judge fire off the letter last Friday follow the refusal of Belgrade authorities to allow tribunal Chief Prosecutor Louise Arbour of Canada and a team of investigators to visit Kosovo. McDonald ask the Security Council to impose measures which be sufficiently compel to bring the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia into the fold of law-abiding nations. Hundreds of people, mostly ethnic Albanians, have be killed, and as many as 300,000 driven from their homes since February, when Serb forces begin a crackdown on ethnic albanian separatists in Kosovo. The tribunal want to look into allegations of war crimes on both sides of the conflict. In its first case to deal with atrocities against Serbs during Bosnia's civil war, a U.N. war crimes tribunal on Monday convict three prison officials and guards, but acquit a top military commander who oversee the facility. The Yugoslav war crimes tribunal clear Cmndr. Zejnil Delalic, of the Bosnian Muslim Army, of responsibility for war crimes commit at a government-run prison camp under his overall command. Prosecutor Grant Niemann of Australia say he would appeal Delalic's acquittal. Judges free Delalic pending the outcome of the appeal. let me thank you for a just and fair judgment, Delalic tell the court. The judgment have even increase my trust in this institution. The tribunal convict camp warden Zdravko Mucic, a Croat, of 11 war crimes and grave breaches of the Geneva Conventions because he oversee guards who murder nine Serbs and torture six. Mucic, wear dark sunglasses and a cross, smile as he hear his sentence of seven years in prison. Tribunal Deputy Prosecutor Graham Blewitt of Australia say he be consider appeal Mucic's inadequate sentence. Mucic's conviction be the first by an international court on the basis of command responsibility since post-world War II tribunals convict Nazi and japanese superiors for the crimes of their subordinates. Mr. Mucic be clearly derelict in his duty and allow those under his authority to commit the most heinous of offenses, without take any disciplinary action, say preside Judge Adolphus Karibi-Whyte of Nigeria. Monday's verdicts end a marathon 20-month trial that focus on the brutal mistreatment of the bosnian Serbs, themselves blame for the vast majority of war crimes commit during the 3 1/2-year bosnian conflict. During the trial the tribunal's long to date involve 122 witnesses survivors describe the campaign of terror unleash against Serbs in the area. inmates at the Celebici prison camp be beat to death by guards wield baseball bats, wooden planks and rifle butts, accord to testimony. Others be set on fire, rap and force to commit sexual acts with members of their own family. The 49-page indictment detail atrocities at Celebici assert that at least 14 prisoners be kill in 1992. One prisoner be beat to death and have a Muslim party badge nail to his head, a witness claimed. Yet a few witnesses also praise Delalic and Mucic, for humanitarian gestures, such as get food and clothing to some prisoners and release others. Hazim Delic, a Muslim who serve as deputy warden of the camp, be find guilty of two murders and of rap two women as well as torture other inmates. He be sentence to 20 years by Karibi-Whyte, who denounce rape as a despicable act which strike at the very core of human dignity and physical integrity. Delic's defense attorney say he would likely appeal. Esad Landzo, a Muslim guard, be convict of kill three prisoners and torture at least three others and be sentence to 15 years. His attorneys also be likely to appeal the conviction. All four defendants have face up to life imprisonment, the maximum punishment at the tribunal, which have no death penalty. A charge against Delic and Mucic of plunder property be dismiss by the three-judge panel. Mucic also be clear of responsibility for four murders and three cases of mistreatment or torture of prisoners. Delic be clear of two murders, and of command responsibility for other killings at Celebici. He be also acquit of three cases of torture. Landzo be clear of one murder charge and one torture count. The tribunal, set up by the Security Council in 1993, have convict only one other person follow a trial Bosnian Serb Dusan Tadic, who be sentence in May 1997 to 20 years for kill and torture Muslims in 1992. Two other men have confess to kill Muslims, hand the tribunal two more convictions without conduction trials. To his Muslim targets, Bosnian Serb Goran Jelisic be the face of genocide who once brag that he have to kill 20 or 30 Muslims before his morning coffee. open a genocide trial Monday at the Yugoslav war crimes tribunal, U.N. prosecutor Terree Bowers say the 30-year-old mechanic use the nickname Adolf with a perverse pride in the genocidal symbolism it represented. Jelisic plead guilty in October to murder 12 Muslims and Croats in and around the Serb-run Luka camp set up in Brcko, northern Bosnia, in May 1992. By try him for genocide, prosecutors will be able to call evidence about the background of Jelisic's murders, include the involvement of more senior Serbs. The trial also will give survivors of his kill spree chance to tell their story in court. Bowers tell a three-judge tribunal panel that Jelisic admit in interviews with investigators to far more killings than the dozen to which he have plead guilty. Jelisic will be convict of those murders and sentence at the end of his trial, which be expect to last well into 1999. He face a maximum sentence of life imprisonment. We will never be able to fix the exact number of victims, Bowers said. But if we be to believe even a small percentage of the totals which Goran Jelisic claimed, then his victims certainly number well over 100. As the trial began, judges be read excerpts of a psychological report which state that Jelisic be mentally fit to stand trial but suffer a borderline personality disorder. wear a striped sweater and black jeans, Jelisic bring a laptop computer into court and take notes. When he wasn't writing, Jelisic sit slightly slump in his chair, his head still, look impassively around the courtroom. Jelisic's campaign of murder stand out even at a tribunal set up to deal exclusively with atrocities for its cold-bloodedness. Once Goran Jelisic even decline assistance from a guard, note that he be still in `good form' even though he have kill over 60 people, Bowers tell judges, cite statements make by witnesses due to testify later in the trial. To victims in Brcko, the face of genocide be the face of Goran Jelisic, he said. Bowers tell the judges that Jelisic, who hold no official rank, be release by bosnian Serb authorities from jail, where he be serve three years for fraud, and send to Brcko to murder Muslims. He tell investigators that on his arrival in the town, which be of strategic importance to Bosnian Serbs, he be give a list of Muslim targets and order to kill as many as possible. Jelisic, Bowers said, seem to relish the task. Witness testimony will also establish that Goran Jelisic be not a reluctant tool of the genocide who be be compel by Serb authorities to act against his will, the U.S. prosecutor said. Quite to the contrary, the testimony will firmly establish that Goran Jelisic be an efficient and enthusiastic participant in the genocide. Set up in 1993, the U.N. court have convict two Muslims, two Bosnian Croats and a bosnian Serb of war crimes include murder, rape and torture, but it have yet to register a genocide conviction. An early genocide trial be halt when the defendant, Bosnian Serb Milan Kovacevic, die of a ruptured artery in his tribunal cell.

53,"The radical Islamic group Hamas on Monday denounce U.S. President Bill Clinton's upcoming visit to the Gaza Strip but carefully avoid make any threats against him. Hamas is, 2nd graf pvs On a street newly litter with the debris of battle stones, spend tear gas canisters, char remnants of half-burned tires a sodden palestinian flag flaps in a fitful rain-laden wind outside a house in mourning. Inside, to the tinny record wail of Koranic verses, neighbors and relatives of the dead man a 21-year-old university student fell on the roof of his own home by an israeli soldier's rubber-coated bullet sip tiny cups of coffee leave unsweetened to symbolize the bitter occasion. Some smoked, a few spoke quietly among themselves, but most simply sat in reflective silence. Among those in attendance on this day, the first of the traditional three days of family mourning, be Saeb Erekat, the chief peace negotiator for Yasser Arafat's Palestinian Authority. The dead youth, Nasr Erekat, be a cousin of his. Erekat stay for a time, sit amid clan elders in Arab headdresses and teen-age nephews in American-style athletic shoes, then slip away for a meeting in connection with President Clinton's visit begin this weekend. It's be very difficult, he say later, ask about carry on his negotiating duties at such a time. I have a great sense of sorrow and sadness, a feeling of such loss. I hope God will enable me to use my grief to strengthen my determination for peace. The scene at the Erekat home, in the arab village of Abu Dis on Jerusalem's eastern outskirts, drive home a central truth about the israeli-palestinian conflict: on both sides of the divide, the political be also deeply personal. And that inescapability go to the heart of the quarrel's intractability. In the glare of world attention, it be easy to forget that there be few people live in Israel and the palestinian lands combine than there be in New York City. In the small and jostling confines of what few here choose to call the Holy Land, the conflict touches all. Everyone have a stake in it. Israelis fret daily over soldier sons on dangerous patrol in the West Bank and Gaza Strip, or shudder when they pass a sidewalk cafe once rip by an Islamic militant's suicide bomb. palestinian families struggle to keep alive the memories of fathers and brothers languish in Israeli prisons, and chafe under the checkpoints and gunsights of Israeli troops. On both sides, the young soak up fear and anger along with their ABCs. And elders' memories of half a century past still rise to trouble the collective sleep: the shadow of the Holocaust for Israelis, the trauma of exile and dispossession for the Palestinians. Against this backdrop, amid a landscape little change since biblical times, terrible Old Testament theme lamentation and retribution, the smiting of enemies and the sharpening of swords spring to life once again in any day's headlines. now come Clinton, this most american of presidents, one who have make Middle East peacemaking a kind of personal crusade, in hopes of halt what have become one of the century's most protracted blood feuds. Clinton be no stranger to these particular hatreds. Three years ago, in another winter season, he come here to bury Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin, gun down by a nationalist Jew who could not abide the terms of a Mideast agreement that call just as this late accord do for Israel to cede West Bank land in exchange for peace with the Palestinians. On the occasion of this visit first intend to celebrate the Wye River accords sign seven weeks ago in Washington, now mean to salvage them all three of the principals be embattled. Clinton be under an impeachment cloud; Arafat be buffet by furious palestinian street protests and his own failing health, and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's coalition government be hang by a thread. The days lead up to Clinton's visit have be divisive ones, contrive somehow to simultaneously tap into both sides' great fears. In the West Bank's bad spasm of violence in months, Israelis watch windows of israeli-plated cars shatter from stones throw by angry youths, saw TV footage of a cringe Israeli soldier now face court martial be beat bloody by a palestinian mob, heard Palestinian officials' exhortations for a new intefadeh, or uprising. Palestinians, for their part, listen in anger as Netanyahu announce the suspension of an upcoming israeli troop pullback in the West Bank and try vainly to halt Israeli bulldozers expand jewish settlements on land they claim as their own. Both sides to Palestinians' satisfaction, and Israel's dismay come to see the visit as an implicit acknowledgement of palestinian statehood aspirations, despite increasingly desperate american efforts to avoid cast it in that light. Clinton's foray to the Gaza Strip, which be already under palestinian rule, will be the first by a sitting american president. Palestinians intend to play on that symbolism for all it be worth, greet him with the strains of their once-banned national anthem. In the mourning house in Abu Dis, though, the friends and relatives of Nasr Erekat have little to say about politics and statehood. They talk about Nasr instead. Amr Erekat, 27, recall his disbelief as he cradle his die cousin in his arms. His 14-year-old brother Taher speak haltingly of the big brother he have look up to. His childhood friend, Samir Abdel Salam, remember wish he have stick to his studies as diligently as Nasr had. Saeb Erekat, the peace negotiator, could find neither lesson nor logic to his young cousin's death. It's senseless, this rhythm of bloodshed, he said. At these difficult times, you pray for one thing, for both sides: no more of it. Armored personnel carriers be deploy Tuesday around the convention center where U.S. President Bill Clinton will address 1,500 palestinian delegates next week. U.S. Secret Service agents have already arrive in Gaza to work with their palestinian counterparts on how to protect Clinton during his first visit to palestinian areas. There be cooperation with the american security people. We have our own plan. The Americans have their own procedures as well, say the palestinian police chief, Ghazi Jabali. The Islamic militant group Hamas, which hop to scuttle the accord, have be careful not to openly threaten Clinton. However, Hamas have carry out more than a dozen suicide bombings in Israel in an attempt to bring peace talks with Israel to a halt. On Monday, Clinton and palestinian leader Yasser Arafat be to address members of the Palestine National Council and delegates from other groups, at the Shawa Cultural Center in Gaza City. Traffic near the Shawa Center still flow normally Tuesday, but plainclothes security as well as uniformed officers with M-17 and AK-47 assault rifles begin patrol in the vicinity. Streets around the center be to be close days before the Clinton visit. Four armored personnel be park at the corners of the convention center, with members of Arafat's elite bodyguard unit, know as Force 17, sit on the vehicles. APCs be also deploy outside Arafat's guest house and near the palestinian legislative council. Jabali say the APCs be part of a palestinian security plan that have be present to the Americans. U.S. security agents, in turn, have give their palestinian counterparts sophisticate explosives detection equipment. The palestinian police be ready to protect President Clinton here in Gaza or in Bethlehem, Jabali said, refer to Clinton's expect visit next Tuesday to the Church of the Nativity in the biblical West Bank town of Bethlehem In Jerusalem, Clinton's entourage of 1,200 people will take over the Jerusalem Hilton, at a cost of half a million dollars. The hotel boast stun views of Jerusalem's wall Old City and the slopes of the Judean Desert. Israel affirm Friday that it will not withdraw troops in the West Bank unless the top palestinian decision-making body hold a vote to annul clauses of the PLO charter call for Israel's destruction. Just a day before U.S. President Bill Clinton's arrival, Israel also reject a U.S. compromise on the release of Palestinian prisoners, an issue that have spark riots in the West Bank. The Palestinians have say they would revoke the clauses only by acclamation, not by a vote, when the Palestine National Council meet on Monday in Clinton's presence. With its demand, Israel may be set itself up for a showdown with Clinton whose visit to Israel and the Palestinian be usher in the next stage of the Wye River land-for-security agreement he help negotiate. Under the accord, the annulment of the offend provisions by the PNC be to clear the way for an israeli troop pullback. Clinton be unlikely to declare the PNC have not complete its task because that would mean his high-profile visit have be a failure. However, Israeli officials say they would not drop their demand for a vote. They have to vote in the PNC, say israeli government spokesman Moshe Fogel. Otherwise, he said, Israel will not turn over additional West Bank territory to the Palestinians because transfer of territory be irreversible. In Washington, deputy U.S. State Department spokesman James Foley be evasive on whether the United States expect a vote from the PNC. The procedures need to be clear enough that nullification have take place, he said. A senior Palestinian official, speak on condition of anonymity, say the United States have not ask palestinian leader Yasser Arafat to consider hold a vote. On Thursday, the Palestinians take an interim step when a small leadership body, the 124-member palestinian Central Council, declare the charter clauses revoked. The 95 members present be ask whether they approve a letter in which Arafat inform Clinton that the charter clauses call for Israel's destruction be null and void. In all, 81 vote in favor, seven against and seven abstained. ask about the decision, Arafat would only say that it be a very important and constructive meeting. The palestinian leader also say he hop Clinton would exert pressure on Israel to keep its obligations under the Wye agreement. The Palestine Liberation Organization charter be draw up three decades ago, long before Israel and the Palestinians start their peace process in 1993. The Palestinians say they take all the required steps to revoke the pertinent clauses at a PNC session in Gaza in 1996. However, Netanyahu have say the PNC never complete the job. During the Wye River talks, the Palestinians agree in a compromise to invite PNC members and delegates from other groups to Gaza to hear Clinton and Arafat speak. The Wye accord say delegates should reaffirm the Arafat letter to Clinton, but do not specifically refer to a vote. Former Israeli Prime Minister Shimon Peres side with the Palestinians on Friday. They do it once, they do it twice, they don't have to do it again, say Peres, who be prime minister during the PNC vote in 1996. Israel and the Palestinians have also accuse each other of violate other elements of the Wye agreement. A key point of contention have be Israel's pledge to release 750 palestinian prisoners in three stages by the end of January. The Palestinians have say Israel break a promise to release prisoners hold for anti-israeli activities. Israel say it never make such a pledge, and accuse the palestinian Authority of incitement over the prisoner issue. palestinian negotiator Saeb Erekat say the United States offer a compromise, a trilateral committee to go over the list of prisoners one by one and determine who will be released. But israeli Cabinet Secretary Danny Naveh say Friday such a proposal be unacceptable. Israel have not be offer such a compromise and there will not be such a compromise, Naveh said. On Friday, about 2,000 supporters of the Islamic militant Hamas movement march through the West Bank town of Nablus to press for the release or prisoners. We want prisoners, not Clinton, the crowd chanted. At Jerusalem's Al Aqsa Mosque, Islam's third holy site, the prayer leader, Yousef Abu Sneineh, speak out sharply against the u.s.-brokered peace agreement. America support a peace agreement that further reinforces the Israeli occupation of the palestinian lands, he said. less than a week before U.S. President Bill Clinton be to arrive for a visit meant to bolster a new israeli-palestinian peace accord, the two sides exchange angry accusations Sunday over jewish settlements and street clashes. Ahmed Qureia, speaker of the Palestinian parliament, warn of possible violence if Israel continue to expand settlements in the West Bank and Gaza Strip, where the Palestinians hope to establish a state. If settlement activity continues, then all means of resistance be open, Qureia, who be also know as Abu Ala, tell reporters in the West Bank town of Ramallah. Since the signing of a land-for-security accord, jewish settlers have accelerate the establishment of makeshift communities on West Bank hilltops, in an explicit bid to keep the land from be turn over to the Palestinians. Meanwhile, at a meeting of the Israeli Cabinet, ministers express dismay over an outbreak of street clashes between palestinian demonstrators and Israeli troops in the West Bank. The Palestinians have be ask to immediately stop the violence and incitement to violence, the Cabinet say in a statement. At least two Palestinians be injure Sunday in a confrontation outside the jewish settlement of Ariel in the northern West Bank. Demonstrators throw stones at Israeli troops, who respond with rubber bullets and tear gas. A day earlier, 27 Palestinians and three israeli soldiers be injure in similar clashes throughout the West Bank. And three days before that, Israelis be horrify by television footage of an Israeli soldier be drag from a car and beaten with chunks of concrete by a palestinian mob. Israel say Yasser Arafat's Palestinian Authority be orchestrate the street fighting. The Palestinians deny that. The past week's protests grow out of an increasingly bitter dispute over palestinian prisoners hold by Israel. Israel last month free 250 of 750 prisoners it be to release under the Wye accords, but most be criminals. The Palestinians be demand that so-called security prisoners those be hold for anti-israel activity be release instead. also Sunday, another quarrel be brew over the scheduled meeting of the palestinian National Council, the palestinian parliament-in-exile, in the Gaza Strip during Clinton's visit. At the gathering, the PNC and other Palestinians in attendance be to reaffirm the nullification of clauses in their national charter that call for Israel's destruction. Israel have demand that the Palestinians hold an actual vote at the meeting rather than simply proclaim the charter changed, but the Palestinians on Sunday repeat their objections to that. They haven't the right to give us instructions, Arafat say Sunday as he return to Gaza follow a trip to Europe. Clinton's visit to Israel and the Palestinian lands, which be to begin Saturday, be mean to provide impetus to the u.s.-brokered peace accords and encourage both sides to stick to a timetable for compliance. But some commentators suggest the visit be prove a polarize force instead. He be come to promote the peace process... but his visit's only actual result be a sharpening of the differences, Yosef Lapid write in Sunday's editions of the Maariv newspaper. In Israel, increase concern be be voice over Clinton's plan visit to gaza, the first ever by a sit U.S. president. At Sunday's Israeli Cabinet meeting, a shout match break out over the issue, accord to Israel radio. Who invite President Clinton to the Gaza Strip? Silvan Shalom, the science minister, reportedly yell at Netanyahu. Netanyahu say it have be Clinton's idea, not his. The United States have repeatedly say the visit be not intend as an endorsement of palestinian statehood, but the Palestinians see it as a powerful boost to their sovereignty hopes. Arafat adviser Ahmed Tibi say on Israeli television that the invitation for a Clinton visit come from Israel and be warmly welcome by the Palestinians. Benjamin Netanyahu's refusal to move the peace process forward, which have frustrate President Bill Clinton and anger the Palestinians, may not be enough to save his government from collapse next week. Netanyahu on Wednesday brief his cabinet on Clinton's three-day visit and affirm what he tell the president a day earlier that he would not withdraw troops in the West Bank on Friday, as stipulate by the Wye River peace accord. Clinton have hoped, 3rd graf pvs President Clinton will travel to Gaza next month to address palestinian leaders, the White House say Friday. He be to speak at what the Palestinians be describe as a historic meeting to formally revoke anti-israel clauses in the 1964 palestinian charter. Israel demand revocation of the clauses at U.S.-brokered negotiations last month that lead to the late land-for-peace deal between Israel and the Palestinians. As part of that settlement, reach at Wye, Md., Clinton agree to travel to territory control by the palestinian Authority to speak at the meeting of the palestinian National Council, the de facto parliament. accord to a schedule release Friday by the White House, Clinton will visit Gaza, the West Bank and Israel during a four-day trip that will begin on Dec. 12. He be to meet with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel and Yasser Arafat, the Palestinian leader, before return to Washington on Dec. 15. Clinton administration officials say the White House have not yet decide whether Clinton would fly to the newly open Gaza International Airport aboard Air Force One, give the symbolism of the president's jet land on palestinian soil with the trappings of a state visit. Officials say the White House be fearful of upset israeli leaders who be worried that the president's plan visit to Gaza appear to be a step toward american recognition of a palestinian state. The White House say the president would speak to the Israeli and palestinian people about the importance of the Wye agreement and the need to continue to support the Middle East peace process. The meeting in Gaza on Dec. 14 be bind to be contentious, give that many prominent Palestinians have charge that the Wye agreement allow the israeli government to backtrack on promises make to the Palestinians in their 1994 peace settlement. The Palestinians have insist that they have already revoke clauses in the 1964 charter that call for Israel's destruction. In January, Arafat write to the White House, list the anti-israel provisions that he say have be annulled. But the letter do not satisfy the Israelis. And during the talks in Maryland last month, Arafat agree to call a meeting of the national council to reaffirm the decision to revoke the clauses. In order to guarantee passage of a motion to annul the provisions, Arafat be be allow under an agreement with the Israelis and the United States to pack the council meeting in Gaza with his loyalists, and to conduct the vote by a show of hands instead of a ballot. During a recent interview with Israeli television, Clinton brush aside concerns that his visit to gaza might be see as a step toward U.S. recognition of a palestinian state. That be not what I'm do in go there, he said. I have try strictly to adhere to the position of the United States that we would not take a position on any final status issue. He say he be travel to Gaza at the recommendation of, among others, Netanyahu. The prime minister want me to go there and want us all to make this pitch, he said, add that he would ask the palestinian National Council to support the peace and to renounce the idea of animosity toward and opposition to the existence of the state of Israel, and instead embrace the path not only of peace but of cooperation. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Sunday accuse Yasser Arafat of make a farce of the Wye River accords and say he would not agree to further troop withdrawals until a halt to anti-israel violence. Netanyahu, in an interview with The Associated Press, say the Palestinians be embolden to foment street riots and threaten to declare statehood because they believe they have the Clinton administration in their back pocket. The Palestinians be make a farce out of the Wye River accord. They think they have the United States in their back pocket, say the Israeli leader. as long as that be the case, they will not change their behavior. Netanyahu say he do not believe the United States be side with the Palestinians, but his sharply word remarks send a strong signal that he would like President Bill Clinton to intervene and low palestinian expectations prior to his Dec. 12-15 trip. Palestinians claim it be Israel that have violate the summit agreement reach in October by not free jail political activists, by confiscate West Bank land for roads and allow jewish settlers to seize hilltops for expansion. Ahmed Qureia, speaker of the palestinian Legislative Council and the head of the peace team that negotiate the Oslo accords, tell reporters Sunday all means of resistance be justify in oppose settler activity. Netanyahu, who reject claims of settlement expansion as bunk, be interview in the Cabinet room after a meeting of his unruly coalition government, which rally behind Netanyahu on his tough stance. But officials say Science Minister Silvan Shalom attack him for be too generous to the Palestinians by agree to the Clinton visit next week to Gaza and the West Bank. We be not go to give up territory when there be violations of the agreement and attempts to get things that weren't achieve at Wye use violence, Netanyahu said. Israel have threaten to scrap the next Israeli troop pullback, which be schedule for Dec. 18, three days after Clinton's departure. The United States have say it should go ahead as scheduled. Palestinians see the Clinton trip as implicit recognition of their struggle for statehood, even though Clinton have specifically say in an interview air on Israel's Channel 2 television that it should not be read that way. Netanyahu make clear that he would be annoy if Air Force One land at the newly open palestinian airport in Gaza, which aides say would be view as a strong symbol of support for palestinian demands for sovereignty. We will be very disappointed if that be the case. We've say to the United States that we don't think that be necessary, Netanyahu say of reports that Clinton's plane would land in Gaza. He say travel by motorcade would be quick and more politically considerate. Unless somebody want to put a thumb in our eye, I think there be good ways to travel, Netanyahu said. In the interview, Netanyahu stress that he oppose palestinian statehood and demand that Arafat stop threaten to declare independence on May 4, 1999, when the Palestinians maintain the Oslo accords expire. What must be be that Yasser Arafat retract this open and incipient violation of the Oslo and Wye River accords and recommit himself to negotiate until we get white smoke, until we get a solution. That's the only way we'll get a real peace between Israel and the Palestinians, Netanyahu said. In a conciliatory speech in Sweden over the weekend, Arafat stress that he seek a negotiated settlement and do not mention May 4 as a deadline. He also say any palestinian state would not make alliances with states hostile to Israel one of Netanyahu's key concerns. The israeli leader be also demand that Arafat drop claims that Netanyahu promise at Wye to release 750 Palestinians jail for anti-israel attacks that result in bloodshed, rather than free car thieves and petty criminals. Each side have a different interpretation of the understanding regard the prisoners. Netanyahu maintain he never agree to free those with blood on their hands. It's high time that Yasser Arafat admit this be agree upon and that he's not go to make demands on Israel, include the incitement of violence,...on a trumped-up charge, he said. Israel never promise to release murders at Wye, and it won't release them. The issue have be the focal point for a new wave of violent protests and demonstrations in the West Bank and a hunger strike that begin Saturday by the 1,700 palestinian inmates. Israel be also upset by statements that the nearly 600-member palestinian National Council will not reaffirm in a vote that anti-israel clauses in the palestinian charter have be deleted. Netanyahu maintain that only 25 members out of hundreds who live abroad have be invite so far. Netanyahu quote Clinton as tell him that the purpose of his visit be to personally make sure that they actually rescind this charter that call for Israel's destruction. keep a promise to Israel and the United States, palestinian leader Yasser Arafat on Thursday convene senior officials and legislators to revoke clauses of the PLO founding charter call for Israel's destruction. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, meanwhile, say he have order the Israeli army to deal with palestinian riots with a firm hand. He add that he would not go ahead with a West Bank troop pullback, as promise under the Wye River peace agreement, unless Arafat meet a list of demands. The West Bank have be sweep by stone-throwing protests in recent days, and thousands of Palestinians march Thursday in the funeral procession of a 17-year-old stone mason, Jihad Iyad, who be kill by Israeli army gunfire a day earlier. The violence raise concern that U.S. President Bill Clinton's visit to the region, which be to start late Saturday, be foment more unrest rather than calm the already tense situation. Israeli hard-liners, include Cabinet ministers, have say Clinton's visit be confer statehood status on the palestinian areas. On Thursday, signs read Clinton go home be string along the Tel Aviv-Jerusalem highway and on walls in Jerusalem. The most problematic moment of the Clinton visit will be his address Monday to the Palestine National Council, the Palestinians' parliament-in-exile, and other palestinian groups, in Gaza City. Under the Wye agreement, the PNC be to reaffirm during this session an Arafat letter to Clinton which declare clauses of the PLO founding charter call for Israel's destruction revoked. Israel insist a vote be take by a show of hands, while the Palestinians say only approval by acclamation be required. Netanyahu say Thursday he will not settle for anything less than a vote, even if Clinton declare the PNC session a success without it. It be Israel which determine issues connect with its future, Netanyahu say when ask by Israel radio whether he would be ready to enter a showdown with Clinton over the issue. It be unlikely the U.S. president would side with Israel in such a dispute because it would mean that the main purpose of his visit, to usher in the next stage of the Wye agreement, have failed. immediately after the PNC session, Israel be to transfer five percent of the West Bank from its sole control to joint jurisdiction. Netanyahu say last week he be freeze the pullback over what he claim be systematic palestinian violations of the peace accord. He reiterate Thursday that he would not change his decision unless Arafat publicly drop plans to unilaterally declare a palestinian state in May. The prime minister's critics have say he be seize excuse after excuse to walk away from the agreement because he face a very real threat from hard-liners in his coalition to bring down the government in the event of another troop withdrawal. The Palestinians, meanwhile, press ahead with implement the accord. On Thursday, 98 members of the 124-member palestinian Central Council meet at Arafat's seaside headquarters to hold a vote on whether to approve the Arafat letter concern the PLO charter. The meeting be an interim step, ahead of Monday's PNC session, and be stipulate by the Wye agreement. A simple majority of 63 members be required, and a vote be expect by Thursday evening. The council have not meet for years and be revive specifically for Thursday's vote. It consist of PNC delegates, members of the palestinian legislative council and the PLO Executive Committee, among others. In an atmosphere of political tension, U.S. President Clinton meet Sunday with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in a bid to put the troubled Wye River peace accord back on track. After get together for breakfast in Clinton's hotel suite, the two leaders meet at Netanyahu's office and plan to talk to reporters later. The president be sure to be ask about the impeachment drama unfolding in Washington. At a late-night arrival ceremony for Clinton Saturday, Netanyahu say he hop the president's visit would contribute to true peace. Again, the Israeli leader accuse the Palestinians of ignore commitments in peace accords. Clinton be to meet with palestinian leader Yasser Arafat on Monday in the Gaza Strip. Thousands of police be deploy throughout Israel during the Clinton visit. At the hotel where Clinton be staying, 500 policemen be post to guard the president and his 600-member delegation. Clinton's wife, Hillary, and their daughter, Chelsea, set out on their own schedule. Mrs. Clinton tour a school in a cooperative village of Jews and Palestinians, while Chelsea visit Jerusalem's Western Wall, Judaism's holy site. Israeli Foreign Minister Ariel Sharon tell reporters during a picture-taking session with Secretary of State Madeleine Albright that Israel have not leave the Wye River agreement. We will not give up on the land-for-security accord, Sharon said. But, he added, it should be base on mutual reciprocity. About two hours before Air Force One land Saturday night, the House Judiciary Committee approve a fourth article of impeachment against Clinton. The full House will vote on the impeachment article next week. israeli government spokesman Moshe Fogel be ask Sunday if the success of Clinton's visit would turn on the question of revoke the palestinian Liberation Organization's found charter. President Clinton play a very important role in the Wye Memorandum and its success, and I think that it's go to be very, very important that this visit show us at least a readiness on the part of the palestinian Authority to move forward in peace, Fogel said. There be no letup in violence Sunday. Palestinian stone throwers clash with Israeli troops and an israeli high school student be stab and wound by a palestinian teen-ager. In his remarks at Clinton's airport arrival Saturday night, Netanyahu say the peace process be in danger. Mr. President, Netanyahu said, speak in Hebrew, The truth have to be told. In recent weeks the Palestinians again constantly, systematically and intentionally violate all their commitments. We be not entitled, not able and not prepared to forgo fulfillment of those commitments. Netanyahu, who be face political turmoil in his hard-line coalition government, say he could not accept a phony peace on paper which be not honor in practice. Since Clinton preside over its signing in Washington in October, the land-for-security agreement have hit one snag after another. Israel froze implementation of the accord altogether, accuse Arafat of violate the deal and incite violent street protests. Clinton say the United States shares Israel's concerns about security. Peace be not simply an option among many but the only choice that can avert still more years of bloodshed, apprehension and sorrow, he said. That be why I'm here. He say both sides now must face the challenge of implement Wye. Both Clinton and Netanyahu have a shaky political future. The israeli leader be fight for his political survival as parliament prepares for a no-confidence vote within two weeks. His coalition begin to weaken after he and Arafat sign the Wye River Memorandum Oct. 23 agree to turn over 13 percent of West Bank territory to be meet by palestinian security measures. Netanyahu have say there would be no further troop withdrawals until West Bank rioting and violence ends. Israel and the Palestinians be also in bitter disagreement over procedures for revoke passages in the palestinian charter call for Israel's destruction and the release of palestinian prisoners hold in Israeli jails for militant or political acts against the jewish state. On Monday, the president be to fly to the Palestinian-run Gaza Strip to be welcome by Arafat with the trappings of a state visit. Clinton's visit to Gaza and his address to the palestinian National Council be see by some as a boost for dreams of palestinian statehood. It imply de facto recognition of a palestinian state, Ziyad Abu Ziyad, a member of the palestinian legislative council, say in an interview sunday. ","Security high for Clinton's visit to Gaza, part of the Wye Accord, as Palestinian leaders revoke a 1964 Israeli destruction clause.Israel claims Air Force One landing in Palestinian is sovereign recognition.It won't withdraw West Bank troops unless Palestinians formally vote to revoke the clause and violence stops.Palestine says Israel violated the Accord by improper prisoner releases, roadbuilding and settlement expansion.It warns of violence and there have been stone-throwing protests.Radical Islam group Hamas denounces the visit and the Accord.Clinton has made ending the long feud a crusade.Both Clinton and Netanyahu's leadership threatened.","Clinton traveled to the mid-East in December in an effort to energize the Wye agreement signed by Israel and Palestine.Problems immediately faced this accord, intended to trade Israeli territory for security.Questions remained on which prisoners should be released and what constituted a vote to revoke a 1964 call to destroy Israel.Jewish settlers continued to take more lands.Violence and demonstrations went on.The Israeli far right was angry.Clinton was facing impeachment hearings.History and hatred were too strong for him to succeed.Netanyahu finally refused to move the peace process forward, but probably still will be voted out of office.","Clinton will visit Israel, Gaza and the West bank Dec. 12-15 as agreed in the Wye River accord.The days preceding his trip are filled with violence, unrest and divisiveness.Hamas denounces Clinton's trip, but makes no threats against him.Netanyahu says Arafat is ""making a farce"" of the Wye accord.The two sides disagree over its terms.The Israelis and Palestinians are troubled by violence, fear and loss.Clinton has impeachment troubles.Extra security is in place wherever Clinton will go.He hopes to salvage the Wye accord.However, Netanyahu continues to withdraw troops from the West Bank as stipulated in the agreement.","Despite concerns it might cause more unrest, President Clinton met in Israel separately with Prime Minister Netanyahu and Yasser Arafat to negotiate Wye Accord agreement terms.Israel is demanding revocation of anti-Israeli clauses in the 1964 Palestinian charter.Palestine is demanding Israel's release of Palestinian prisoners.Both sides are exchanging accusations over Israeli West Bank settlements and anti-Israeli violence.Hamas denounced Clinton's visit but avoided threats.US and Palestinian agents kept the Gaza area secure.In the end, Netanyahu, facing political turmoil, told President Clinton he would not remove his troops from the West Bank."
55,"Premier Romano Prodi battle Tuesday for any votes free up from a split in a far-left party, but say he will resign if he lose a confidence vote expect later this week. We must respect the will of the voters. If we win the confidence vote, we will go ahead, otherwise we will pass the baton, Prodi tell a news conference close a two-day french-italian summit in Florence. Prodi's center-left government, Italy's second-longest since World War II, be threaten with collapse by the defection of its Communist ally. The premier will address Parliament Wednesday, follow perhaps by Friday by the vote of confidence that will determine whether the 2 1/2-year-old, center-left alliance stands or falls. The Communist Refoundation Party provoke the crisis by withdraw its support over the weekend and say it would not vote for his deficit-cutting 1999 budget. But the break with Prodi's government divide Refoundation. Armando Cossutta, leader of the moderate wing, resign as party president Monday, say the party's hardline stance be wrong and dangerous. Prodi be hop to profit from the break. Politicians have say Prodi be now four votes short of the 316 votes need for a majority in the Chamber of Deputies, the low house. The government have a majority in the Senate even without Refoundation's support. After his meetings with french leaders, Prodi warn that the political difficulties threaten the progress the country be make in clean up its public finances. Prodi's government have hold together this long in large part because of the widely share desire to see Italy qualify for the 1999 debut of Europe's common currency, the euro. It qualify earlier this year leave the disparate allies without so clear a reason to stay together. As it is, Prodi have outlast all but Bettino Craxi, who serve 3{ years in two back-to-back stints from 1983 to 1987. Prodi's be Italy's 55th government since World War II. Three days after the collapse of Premier Romano Prodi's center-left government, Italy's president begin call in political leaders Monday to try to reach a consensus on a new government. follow the talks, which be expect to last several days, President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro could ask Prodi to try again with a new majority. He could also name a new premier, or appoint a government of technocrats. If Scalfaro feel no candidate be capable of muster a majority, he could call early elections. Because the president cannot dissolve Parliament during the last six weeks of his term, elections would have to be schedule by December. Scalfaro have name Prodi as caretaker premier for the interim. Prodi's far-left ally, Communist Refoundation, provoke the crisis when it withdraw support for the government over the 1999 deficit-cutting budget, which it say do not do enough to stimulate job creation. Despite help from a breakaway faction of the Communists, who on Sunday form a new party, Prodi lose Friday's vote of confidence by a single vote. Prodi have say he won't take the job back unless his new government could stick to the policies of its old one, an unlikely scenario give the divide Parliament. An alternative to Prodi could be Massimo D'Alema, leader of the Democrats of the Left, the large party in Prodi's coalition. In the case of a so-called technical government, the names of Treasury Minister Carlo Azeglio Ciampi and Foreign Minister Lamberto Dini have be circulated. A government of technicians would get Italy through the volatile period of approve the 1999 budget and the launch of the common european currency, the euro, in January 1999. Prodi preside over cost cuts that get Italy into the debut of the European Monetary Union, outlast all but one other post-world War II italian government in the process. By one vote, Premier Romano Prodi's center-left coalition lose a confidence vote in the Chamber of Deputies Friday, and he go to the presidential palace to resign. President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro must now decide whether to call early elections or to ask Prodi or someone else to try to forge a new majority. The vote in the low chamber of Parliament 313 against the confidence motion bring by the government to 312 in favor. I'm not bitter, Prodi say immediately after his government go down. The swing vote come from Prodi's own coalition, a defect deputy from Foreign Minister Lamberto Dini's tiny italian Renewal party. The Communist, 6th graf prv By one vote, a defector from its own ranks, Premier Romano Prodi's center-left coalition, Italy's second-longest serve government since World War II, lose a confidence vote Friday in the Chamber of Deputies. Prodi immediately offer his resignation to President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro, who ask him to stay on as caretaker premier while the head of state decides whether to call early elections or ask someone else to be premier. The vote, 3rd graf prv Italy's Communists on Sunday vote to withdraw support for Premier Romano Prodi's 2 1-2-year-old coalition, a move expect to trigger the collapse of one of the country's longest-lived postwar governments. Prodi have say he would call a confidence vote if the Communists yank support. The coalition have a majority without the Communists in the Senate, but have depend on them for passage of key legislation in the Chamber. MORE italian politics have long be enliven by baroque feuds and shift alliances. And that time-honored tradition may have win the embattled government of Prime Minister Romano Prodi a momentary reprieve. A leader of Italy's hard-line Marxist faction, know as the Communist Refounding Party, resign Monday in protest over his party's decision to reject the government's 1999 budget and imperil Prodi's slender majority in Parliament. Prodi must realize that his majority no longer exists, say Armando Cossuta, chairman of the Communist Refounding Party, a fringe group that break with mainstream Communists after they overhaul the party follow the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991. Nevertheless we should do everything possible, until the last minute, to save this government and avoid this crisis. Cossuta be clearly unwilling to join the most hard-line wing of his party in withdraw support from Prodi and risk be brand as have torpedoed the first leftist italian government in 50 years. But the leader of the Communist Refounding Party in Parliament, Fausto Bertinotti, seem to have no such compunctions. On Friday, he tell journalists that he be not worry about force new elections that could return the right to power. sometimes you have to take one step back in order to take two steps forward, he say with a shrug. Until now, however, the communist rank and file have disagree with that view. When Bertinotti force Prodi to offer his resignation last year over proposed budget cuts, the rank and file protested, and he be force to backpedal. Prodi meet Monday with President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro and coalition leaders to devise a strategy. He be expect to go to Parliament on Wednesday to open debate on the crisis and seek enough votes for the budget. Without it, the italian central bank be unlikely to cut its key lending rates, something Italy must do to get in line with Germany and other big european neighbors before the introduction Jan. 1 of the single european currency, the euro. But even if he gather enough votes to pass the budget, Prodi could still be leave without a majority. After two and a half years in office, his government be the second-longest in the postwar era. But the fragile center-left coalition have hold together mostly because Italians be unite for the last two years in an effort to reduce spending, inflation and government borrow to meet the requirements for membership in the euro plan. Once that goal be achieve last spring, dissension quickly revived. Prodi's backers be hop that enough members of the Communist Refounding Party will break ranks and follow Cossutta to save the coalition. If not, Prodi be face with two unappetizing choices. He can resign and seek new elections, which carry the risk of bring the opposition to power. Or he could seek to form a new majority without the Communists by seek an alliance with the small center-right party of Francesco Cossiga. Cossiga's party come to Prodi's rescue in June, when the hard-line leftists refuse to back Prodi on NATO expansion. But Prodi have repeatedly say he will govern only with the center-left majority that elect him in 1996. Cossiga also suggest to reporters Monday that he would not welcome any invitations to join a coalition lead by Prodi. We wouldn't want this majority to get stain like Monica Lewinsky's dress, he said. By only one vote, the center-left prime minister of Italy, Romano Prodi, lose a confidence vote in Parliament Friday and be topple from power. The collapse of his government after two and a half years, the second-longest tenure since World War II, suggest that the chronic political instability that mark Italy for decades have spring back to life. Though oblige to tender his resignation, Prodi will remain in charge as a caretaker prime minister until a new government be formed. He may get a second chance to form a new majority, but even if he does, negotiations to that end could take days and even weeks, cloud decisions on such urgent issues as the crisis in Kosovo. NATO military planners prepare for possible air strikes against Yugoslavia have expect to use key air bases in Italy. In his weakened position, Prodi will have difficulty persuade Parliament to approve NATO strikes. He will have similar problems pass the 1999 budget, which be necessary before Italy can cut its lending rates, a requirement for join the single european monetary unit, the euro, on Jan. 1. immediately after Friday's vote of 313-312, in a tense and at times raucous session, Prodi meet with President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro to submit his resignation and discuss his options. In the coming days Scalfaro will consult with dozens of other leaders to ascertain whether Prodi have enough linger support to try to form a new government. If not, the president be expect to turn to another political leader. If no compromise be found, Italy could be plunge into early elections. But parties of all political stripes may be reluctant to push things that far, for opinion polls suggest that voters be no more enamored of the center-right opposition parties than they be of the govern majority. Prodi, an economist, be admire by his western allies as a down-to-earth leader who vow to tame Italy's bloated economy and reckless government borrowing and actually live up to his pledge. By raise taxes, lowering interest rates and reduce the deficit, Italy meet the requirements for membership in the euro last spring, a feat that only a year before be consider impossible by german and french economists. Prodi be help by a healthy global economy and a rare consensus among industrialists, labor unions and taxpayers, who fear that exclusion from the euro would condemn Italy to Third World status. But his fiscal discipline be not follow by reform of a political system that be inherently fragile. There be more than 40 parties in Italy, and the government's efforts to amend the constitution to introduce a two-party system failed. Unless the italian political system changes, Italy be condemn to political instability, say Sergio Romano, a former diplomat and political science professor. The country need stability and credibility, and that will never happen as long as the government be hang from a thread. In 1996 Prodi win with a patchwork quilt of center-left factions mostly make up of Catholic moderates and leftists. He rely on a fringe Marxist group, the Communist Refounding Party, for a majority in the low house. And that alliance, fragile from the beginning, finally fray to the breaking point this week. The hard-line leader of Communist Refounding, Fausto Bertinotti, say his party would vote against the 1999 budget and would also end its 28-month-old pact with the center-left coalition. That position drive the moderate wing of Communist Refounding, worry that a vote against Prodi would open the doors to a center-right government, to split away. But the 20-odd deputies who defy Bertinotti be not enough to squeeze Prodi through. I be not bitter, Prodi say moments after his defeat. even today I receive a lot of support. In the end the coup de grace be deliver by one of his own, a member of the coalition. They have win by the treachery of one single person, Sergio Mattarella, a deputy in Prodi's coalition, angrily tell reporters, refer to Silvio Liotta, a member of the italian Renewal Party. Foreign Minister Lamberto Dini, who head that party, say Liotta would be expelled. Prodi have often say he would not govern with any other majority than the center-left one that elect him in 1996. But throughout his tenure, he be force to seek temporary alliances to push through major policy decisions. He struggle to the last to try to keep his original majority intact. On Thursday, in an effort to woo more moderate Communists to his side, the prime minister, a staunch ally of the United States, warn that he would oppose a NATO strike aim at stop serbian violence in Kosovo unless the U.N. Security Council approve the attack. Washington maintain that NATO do not need a new U.N. resolution to order a strike. Premier Romano Prodi say Monday he would appeal directly to Parliament to save Italy's second-longest government since World War II, threaten with collapse by the defection of its Communist ally. The address to Parliament be expect Wednesday, follow perhaps by Friday by the vote of confidence that will determine whether Prodi's 2 1/2-year-old, center-left alliance stands or falls. Prodi's far-left ally, the Communist Refoundation Party, provoke the crisis by withdraw its support over the weekend and say it would not vote for his deficit-cutting 1999 budget, which be key to Italy's participation in the european common currency. Prodi have say he would call a confidence vote if he lose the Communists' support. I've always act with coherence, Prodi say before a morning meeting with President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro on the crisis. I've never change strategy and I don't want to do political gymnastics. The break with Prodi's government divide Refoundation. Armando Cossutta, leader of the moderate wing, resign as party president Monday. He say the party's desertion of Prodi be wrong and dangerous, but at the same time promise to follow the party line. We be in a very complicated political crisis which could lead to early elections, Cossutta tell reporters Monday. And with the divisions in the left, this would mean a victory for the right. If the crisis come to a confidence vote and Prodi loses, he would offer his resignation. once he do that, it be up to Scalfaro to decide what to do. He could ask Prodi or someone else to form a new government or he could call elections 2 1/2 years early, something most analysts think unlikely. Working in Prodi's favor be the fact that few parties think they would stand to gain by early elections, include the Communist Refoundation. There be speculation Prodi would reopen negotiations that would win back the communists' grudge support, as he have manage to do in the past. Prodi's government have hold together this long in large part because of the widely share desire to see Italy qualify for participation in the 1999 debut of Europe's common currency, the euro. That happen earlier this year leave the disparate allies without so clear a reason to stay together. Prodi lead Italy's 55th government since World War II. He have outlast all but Bettino Craxi, who serve 3{ years in two back-to-back stints from 1983 to 1987. Refoundation be not part of Prodi's center-left coalition, but the government need its 34 votes to muster a majority in the low house. It have be a difficult ally from the outset. It break with Prodi over NATO expansion earlier this year and on send troops into Albania last year. Prodi be even force to resign a year ago after a bitter battle over spending cuts link to the euro. The crisis be resolved, and Prodi return to work, after he make steep concessions and promise a 35-hour work week. By one vote, Premier Romano Prodi's center-left coalition lose a confidence vote in the Chamber of Deputies Friday, and he go to the presidential palace to resign. President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro must now decide whether to call early elections or to ask Prodi or someone else to try to forge a new majority. The vote in the low chamber of Parliament 313 against the confidence motion bring by the government to 312 in favor. I'm not bitter, Prodi say immediately after his government go down. The swing vote come from Prodi's own coalition, a defect deputy from Foreign Minister Lamberto Dini's tiny italian Renewal party. The Communist, 6th graf prv It be autumn in Italy, the birds be go south, and so it seem could the italian government, as the bonds of compromise and political opportunism that bind a small leftist party to the government come undone Sunday. The late threat to the government of Prime Minister Romano Prodi come after delegates to a two-day conference of the Communist Refounding Party vote to reject the government's propose 1999 budget, imperil the future of the center-left coalition. Officials in the prime minister's office say Sunday night that Prodi would meet on Monday with President Oskar Luigi Scalfaro to discuss the political turbulence, though not to offer his resignation. If the Communist Refounding's parliamentary deputies abide by the resolution, which pass by a vote of 188-112, it will destabilize italy's government at a time when the outcome of the recent election in Germany have already inject a note of uncertainty into the future of european economic and fiscal policy. Mauro Zani, a spokesman for the Democratic Party of the Left, the main party in Prodi's coalition, call the decision by Communist refounding a misfortune for the entire country. passage of the budget, he said, be essential to avoid disaster. Prodi's coalition be a loose alliance of the former Communists, know as the Democratic Party of the Left, and Prodi's moderate Catholic-oriented followers. It be support by Communist Refounding, a fringe group of hard-line leftists who break with the mainstream Communists after they overhaul the party follow the collapse of Communism in Eastern Europe. Despite frequent shocks, the alliance have hold since 1996, glue together mainly by the desire to meet the fiscal requirements to allow Italy to adopt the single european currency. As the Jan. 1 date approaches for the introduction of the new money, the euro, Italy must cut its key lending rates to bring them in line with those of big european neighbors, like Germany. A rate cut by the italian central bank be generally think to hinge on passage of the budget bill. If the bill be not passed, negative signals would be send to global financial markets that be already upset because of the financial crises in Asia, Russia and Latin America. On Sunday, Prodi's backers be still hop that a sufficient number of communist Refounding deputies would break ranks and back the budget when it come up for a vote in Parliament later this week. If that fails, a centrist group that rescue Prodi in June under similar circumstances and that be lead by former President Francesco Cossiga announce it would support the budget, thus at least assure parliamentary passage. communist Refounding and its mercurial leader, Fausto Bertinotti, have push Prodi to the brink twice before. The party force him to offer his resignation last year over proposed budget cuts, but then backpeddled after the party's rank and file protested. In June, the hard-line leftists again refuse to follow the prime minister, that time in a Parliament vote for NATO expansion, but the government muddle through with the help of Cossiga's party. But one of the leaders of that centrist group, Clemente Mastella, say Sunday that it would not support the government generally, leave the future of Prodi's coalition highly uncertain.

There be certain methods that might force a person to confess to any crime, Atgeriyev said. The videotape, show Thursday by Chechnya's vice president, show hostage Peter Kennedy claim that the four men have be send to Chechnya to listen in on phone conversations in the breakaway republic. Chechen officials refuse to answer any questions about the tape, include where or when it be film and how the government get it. It be not know if Kennedy speak under duress. Britain's Embassy in Moscow be try to obtain the tape, spokesman Michael Haddock say Friday. Chechen President Aslan Maskhadov will allow british government agents to come to Chechnya to investigate the killing, Atgeriyev said, accord to the Interfax news agency.

Over the weekend, Interior Minister Sergei Stepashin even have to call a news conference to say there be no evidence that the Communist speaker of the Duma, Gennady Seleznyov, be involve in the killing. Seleznyov respond in kind on Monday, suggest that the extremists from democratic organizations might have stag the murder in order to win local elections set for Dec. 6, the Interfax news agency reported. The speaker also threaten to file a libel suit against a St. Petersburg newspaper, which Starovoitova edited. The newspaper recently accuse Seleznyov of set up an illegal fund to finance a presidential bid and other shady activities. Seleznyov, who have say he might run for president in 2000, deny the newspaper's allegations on Friday, call them an outright slander. Starovoitova's murder have all the traits of a contract murder, an increasingly common crime in Russia. Communist leader Gennady Zyuganov on Monday use Starovoitova's kill as an occasion to lambast the government for its inability to contain soar crime.

There have be several attacks on prominent figures in St. Petersburg recently. A finance official be attack earlier this week, a top banker be kill last week, and an aide to Russia's parliament speaker be shoot in the head last month. In modern Russia, the crime be so common as to be mundane. Two thugs, arm with machine pistols and silencers, stalk and kill a powerful figure, then slip away into the night. Police vow to catch them and politicians express outrage. Usually, that would be the end of the story. This time, though, the figure shot be one of the most prominent and popular women in russian politics, a prospective presidential candidate with friends in the high reaches of the Kremlin. As outrage mount Sunday, it seem clear that the killing of Galina Starovoitova be not go to be treat as a routine crime, and some say it might turn out to be a watershed event in russian politics. This be impossible to tolerate any longer, say Grigory Yavlinsky, the leader of Yabloko, another reform-oriented party. We must stop feeling powerless before the increasingly cheeky scum. We cannot go on living as though everything be run as usual. Starovoitova, a member of parliament and a leader of the liberal Russia's Democratic Choice party, be walk up the stair of her apartment building in St. Petersburg with a young aide Friday evening. A team of assailants police believe it be a man and a woman appear behind them and open fire. Starovoitova, shoot three times in the head, collapse and die instantly, authorities said.

Although it be still not clear who kill Starovoitova or why, the killing have all the earmarkings of a contract hit a remarkably common crime in post-soviet Russia. Most of the killings involve business deals and the corruption that have swamp the government and the economy. Until now, the most notorious of the killings be that of popular television host Vladislav Litsyev, who be shoot outside his Moscow home in 1995. But there have be hundreds of others. St. Petersburg have be especially plagued. last year, the city's deputy governor be gun down on a central St. Petersburg street. In the past two months alone, hitmen have claim the lives of a legislative aide, a high-ranking city official and a prominent banker. So deeply have the toxin infect russian society that President Boris Yeltsin order an investigation last week into reports that his Federal Security Service the domestic successor to the KGB have order the death of Boris Berezovsky, the nation's most prominent businessman and the head of the Commonwealth of Independent States. There be no indication that anyone attempt to carry out an assassination of Berezovsky. But Yeltsin's order be the equivalent of U.S. President Bill Clinton order an investigation into whether the FBI be plot to kill Microsoft chairman Bill Gates. Yet, as remarkable as that news was, it have be vastly overshadow by the death of Starovoitova. Television news since her death have carry reports of little else. Reaction have pour in from virtually every important figure in the country, and from surround nations. Yeltsin, call her my comrade, declare that he would personally oversee the investigation into her death. There was, in much of the reaction to Starovoitova's death, the sense that a line have be crossed. perhaps it be because she be a woman, perhaps because she elicit impassioned support, or perhaps because people be simply fed up. But, in more characteristic fashion, her death also lead to a round of political finger-pointing. Colleagues of Starovoitova declare without any apparent evidence that her Communist foes in the Duma, the low house of parliament, be the most likely culprits in her death. historian Dmitry Likachyov, one of the nation's most revered and trust figures, say her killing seem to signal the outburst of a new Red Terror. By late Saturday, the name-calling have go so far that Interior Minister Sergei Stepashin call a news conference to say there be no evidence that the Communist speaker of the Duma, Gennady Seleznyov, be involve in the killing. Seleznyov go on television to say he be sadden by her death. But, he added, I would not like the deputies who sit on the same bench with Galina Starovoitova in the State Duma ... to turn this into a political show. It be too early to know where the recriminations and political maneuvering will lead. For now, the only thing certain be the Starovoitova have become the late in a long line of Russian martyrs. A liberal lawmaker who plan to run for president in Russia's next elections be kill Friday in St. Petersburg, a news report said. Galina Starovoitova, a member of the low house of Russia's parliament from the reformist party democratic Russia, be attack in an apartment building along with her aide, the Interfax news agency reported.

There have be several attacks on prominent figures in St. Petersburg in recent months. Mourners bear flowers and candles gather Sunday outside the house on Griboyedova Canal where a russian legislator, Galina Staravoitova, be shoot to death on Friday night. A key witness, Ruslan Linkov, 27, Mrs. Staravoitova's press aide, be report to be regain consciousness in a heavily guard hospital ward where he be take with gunshot wounds to the head and neck. The police say the two be attack in the stairwell of Mrs. Staravoitova's building by two assailants, one of them a young woman. The attackers reportedly flee through a back entrance to a wait car. Two guns be find at the scene. Friends and relatives say Mrs. Staravoitova, a founder of Russia's democratic movement, have receive death threats, but the motive for the killing remain unclear. The choice of the target suggest a well-thought out plan, say Sergei Kozyrev, vice president of the Russian Association of Scientific Societies and a Staravoitova supporter. To kill a woman a woman in politics that have not happen in Russia since Stalin's time. Setting aside past feuds, local democratic groups say Sunday that they would unite in coming elections to the St. Petersburg city council, combine their forces against what they say be criminals who have invade local politics. At a gathering Sunday night in Moscow, Yegor Gaidar, a former Russian prime minister and a close ally of Mrs. Staravoitova, bitterly reject suggestions that Russia should adopt extraordinary security measures to stem the rise in political crime. The New York Times say in an editorial on Monday, Nov. 23: The russian reform movement have produce few leaders with an uncompromising dedication to democracy. Galina Starovoitova be one, and her murder in St. Petersburg on Friday be a terrible loss for Russia. In a bleak season of economic collapse and political timidity, the killing can only heighten fears that Russia be slip into an ugly era of intolerance and political violence. Initial evidence suggest that the killing be a political assassination. Ms. Starovoitova be gun down in the lobby of her apartment building, shoot three times in the head, typical of russian contract killings. She be a member of the Russian parliament and a recently declare candidate for governor of the region around St. Petersburg. In recent weeks she have speak out forcefully against political extremism, denounce the anti-semitic statements of a Communist parliamentarian and be campaign aggressively against financial corruption in the St. Petersburg municipal government. Ms. Starovoitova's activities be fully in character with a career build around principles of liberty, tolerance and the rule of law. She champion democracy and human rights long before they become politically acceptable in Moscow, and courageously stand by Boris Yeltsin and other reformers as Russia struggle to find a new political course when the Soviet Union disintegrated. An ethnographer by training, Ms. Starovoitova prove to be a skillful and effective politician. She first gain national attention a decade ago when she set aside her academic work about the ethnic history of Leningrad and run successfully for a seat in the soviet parliament from Armenia, a startling victory for a Russian. She later represent St. Petersburg in the russian legislature. Ms. Starovoitova be a woman of irrepressible energy and infectious enthusiasm. But her good humor and quick smile belie a steely commitment to combat the corruption and ethnic divisions that she correctly consider to be the enemies of russian democracy. The least yeltsin can do be to hunt down her killers and bring them to trial. That would be the exception in a nation where political violence be rarely prosecuted. Her countrymen can honor her memory by follow her example. A liberal lawmaker who plan to run for president in Russia's next elections be kill Friday in St. Petersburg, a news report said.

Starovoitova, 52, try to run for president in the 1996 elections but her registration be turn down for technical reasons. She have say she would run again in 2000. She serve as President Boris Yeltsin's aide on ethnic issues and be on the human rights committee of the USSR's Supreme Soviet. Born in the ural Mountains city of Chelyabinsk, Starovoitova be train as a psychologist and later receive a doctorate in history. She be divorce and have one son, accord to Who's Who in Russia. There have be several attacks on prominent figures in St. Petersburg recently. A finance official be attack earlier this week, a top banker be kill last week, and an aide to Russia's parliament speaker be shoot in the head last month. Hundreds of people gather Saturday to mourn the shoot death of one of Russia's most prominent women, a potential presidential candidate whose killing be widely consider to be politically motivated. President Boris Yeltsin say he would personally assume control over the investigation into the killing of Galina Starovoitova, who be gun down Friday night as she climb the stair to her apartment. An aide be also shot and critically wounded. The shooting occur in a building along St. Petersburg's atmospheric Griboedova Canal, site of another notorious russian crime the murder that be the central event in Fyodor Dostoevsky's 19th century masterpiece, Crime and Punishment. Like that fictional crime, which shine a light on social ferment in the St. Petersburg of its day, the death of Starovoitova be immediately seize upon as a seminal event in the Russia of the late 1990s. It be one of the black pages in our modern history, Vladimir Putin, director of the Federal Security Service (FSB) tell the Interfax news agency. It doesn't do much to improve our reputation, the reputation of the country as a whole. Starovoitova, 52, be an outspoken deputy in the low house of parliament who inspire strong feelings from both her friends and enemies. A leader of the liberal Russia's Democratic Choice party, she be plan to run for president in 2000. Those close to her speculate about who might have want her dead, with some name various prominent politicians as potential culprits. Whose path do she cross? The answer be simple: communists and gangsters, say former Deputy Prime Minister Anatoly Chubais. These be the two kinds of people in whose way she be standing. Putin, whose agency be in charge of the investigation, caution that there be still no evidence that her death be a political assassination. Interior Minister Sergei Stepashin do not speculate about the motive for the crime, but tell reporters that it be be investigate under a criminal code section that cover terrorism. Arriving at the St. Petersburg airport from Moscow, he said: I bring with me a team of experienced investigators. I think we will clear it up soon. Yeltsin send a telegram to Gennady Seleznyov, chairman of parliament's lower house, the State Duma, promising that the contractors and executors of the murder will be find and severely punished, The president also send a telegram to Starovoitova's family, in which he call her one of the most vivid figures in russian politics, who consistently uphold the lofty ideals of freedom and democracy. more than 200 people gather in St. Petersburg's Palace Square to remember Starovoitova. People hug quietly as they listen to speeches by her fellow politicians and friends. The small stage be adorn with red roses, yellow carnations and photograph of the deputy with various people, include the late russian physicist and dissident, Andrei Sakharov. We be unite today by pain, which be big than politics, say Viktor Krivulin, a poet and candidate for the regional legislature. Politics, as I felt during the past night, have become the art of spit on the soul. Others at the gathering say they be sure that Starovoitova be kill by those who dislike her outspoken views. She have too many enemies, say Galina Markelova, an aide to the lawmaker. She say Starovoitova have receive many threats in the past. It be doubtless a political murder, add Vitaly Milonov, the chairman of the Young Christian Democrats. Police say two men follow Starovoitova and her aide, Ruslan Linkov, 27, and shoot them on the stair of her building Friday evening. Linkov be shot twice. He regain consciousness after a five-hour operation at the Military Medical Academy, but remain in critical condition in intensive care.

A slain russian lawmaker be honor Tuesday as a martyr to democratic ideals in a stately funeral service in which anger mingle freely with tears. Afterward, Galina Starovoitova be to be bury alongside some of Russia's great national heroes. The stir tribute to starovoitova, a feisty liberal whose kill remain a mystery, be indicative of the depth of national feeling over her death. To stop us, they want to scare us. They will never succeed, former Deputy Prime Minister Anatoly Chubais say at the funeral for Starovoitova. We will fulfill the goals she sacrifice her life for. Hundreds of people, include many of the country's most prominent political figures, pack the grand Marble Hall of St. Petersburg's Ethnography Museum for the funeral. An open casket, cloak with black ribbons and flank by a military honor guard, stand at the head of the hall. At the end of the service, mourners pass grimly past it as classical music played. Outside, several thousand more mourners stand in the cold, wait for the service to end so they could file in and pay their respects. ordinary people should honor her memory, and make sure this never happen again, say one man, Vadim Olshevsky, the manager of a construction company. But, he add bitterly, There's little hope of that in our country. Among speakers at the service be former Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin and Yuri Yarov, President Boris Yeltsin's first deputy chief of staff, who represent the president at the service.

Yeltsin, who have say he will personally oversee the investigation into Starovoitova's killing, be in a Moscow hospital, recover from pneumonia. The shooting in St. Petersburg be a grim lesson for the whole of Russia, Yarov said. Irrespective of real motives for that murder, a crime of this magnitude be a political act, and society should know all the truth about it. One national television channel turn over its daylong programming to funeral coverage and a memorial tribute. Newspapers carry page after page of coverage of her death. Her political party, Russia's Democratic Choice, call on all Russians to turn out their lights in her memory for three minutes at 8 p.m. Tuesday.

But as outrage mount over her killing, the government announce that she would be inter in the Alexander Nevsky Monastery in the city's center follow the funeral at the Ethnography Museum. Among those bury at the Alexander Nevsky Monastery be the composers Peter Tchaikovsky and Modest Mussorgsky and the author Fyodor Dostoevsky. Starovoitova be shoot to death Friday evening as she and an aide scale the stair to her apartment in St. Petersburg. The aide, 27-year-old Ruslan Linkov, be seriously wounded, but have be able to provide some description of the shooting to police. act on his information, investigators round up several suspects, officials say Monday. But a detective later say that investigators have learn nothing serious from Linkov, accord to the Interfax news agency, and there be no further details about whether the suspects be still in custody. Igor Kozhevnikov, head of investigations for the Interior Ministry, tell Interfax on Tuesday that he be confident the case would be solved. It will take time, he said, but add that investigators have tips, they have something to work on. Authorities be act on the assumption that Starovoitova's death be a contract hit, a common event in post-soviet Russia. Russian politicians and newspapers have speculate wildly about political motives for the killing, but police have say they have no idea why someone would have want her dead. Police say someone fire shots at the apartment of a member of the St. Petersburg legislature Monday night, Interfax said. No one be hurt. It be not clear whether the shooting be relate to Starovoitova's death.

1001,"The institution explore apartheid's horrors will issue a report that find the African National Congress shares blame for human rights violations as it struggle to overcome white rule. The 3,500-page report by the Truth and Reconciliation Commission culminate more than two years of nationwide hearings. South african media release preliminary findings on Monday, three days before its official release on Thursday in Pretoria, the capital. The release of the document be a milestone in South Africa's transformation from white minority rule to democracy. The commission, which have the power to grant amnesty, be task with promote reconciliation by lay bare the what and why of apartheid-era atrocities. With the ANC now in power and face an election in mid-1999, a condemnation by the commission could prove damage both to its electoral chances and moral standing. There have be no doubt that the report's overwhelming blame would be lay on white governments and their security forces during the years under scrutiny, 1960-1994. Indeed, news reports Monday say the Truth Commission would declare apartheid a crime against humanity and acknowledge that the ANC and the more radical Pan Africanist Congress be conduct a legitimate struggle against the former apartheid state. But in preliminary findings send to the parties last month, the commission also say the two movements be morally and politically accountable for gross rights violations, South African Press Association and South African Broadcasting Corp. said. The preliminary finding say that despite ANC policy against kill civilians, the line between military and civilian targets have be blurred, SAPA said. It condemn the planting of landmines in rural areas, the execution of enemy agents, torture and mistreatment of ANC members in its exile camps and for kill political opponents. It say the party must accept responsibility for the activities of ANC Women's League president Winnie Madikizela-Mandela, Nelson Mandela's former wife, and her Mandela United Football Club, accuse of killings, torture and kidnappings. The commission also say the PAC be guilty of the deaths of civilians in its strategy in 1993 to drive white farmers off their land so it could be reclaim by blacks. Justice Minister Dullah Omar, meeting journalists in Pretoria, would not comment on the news reports about condemnation of the ANC. I do expect various responses (to the report). I do not expect everyone to agree. It will lead to healthy debate, he said. He say that if the commissioners recommend prosecutions against anyone for abuses, it will be up to the national director of prosecutions to decide whether to proceed. The director be appoint by the government. The commission's work be design to help us establish the rule of law in South Africa, and to establish the principle of accountability, Omar said. The ANC already have prepare the ground for a negative finding, say weeks ago that the commission have warn that harsh judgments be in the offing. The ANC be nervous enough about the report to request a meeting with commissioners earlier this month. The panel refused, to avoid appear biased. On Monday, it reject with contempt suggestions ANC officials themselves have leak the findings. Constand Viljoen, leader of the tiny right-wing Freedom Front, say the ANC have do so to give the commission credibility by make it more even-handed. Publicly, the party have long defend its actions as those commit during a just war. F.W. de Klerk, the last apartheid-era president, meanwhile, plan to ask a court to prevent the Truth Commission report from implicate him in cover up state-sponsored terror. Obviously we will comply with the ruling of a court, Omar said, but add he would regret any court-ordered delay. face a court challenge, the Truth and Reconciliation Commission say Wednesday that it would withhold, at least temporarily, the parts of its final report that implicate South Africa's last apartheid-era president, F.W. de Klerk, in illegal acts. De Klerk, 62, who help negotiate the end of South Africa's white supremacist government and share the 1993 Nobel Peace Prize with President Nelson Mandela for that work, have object to a finding by the commission that he be an accessory after the fact in the bombings of the headquarters of a church group and of a labor federation in the 1980s. The chairman of the 17-member panel, Archbishop Desmond Tutu, say that although he take such action with great reluctance, the commission need time to prepare to fight the legal challenge. He say it would take de Klerk's name out of 3,500-page report to avoid delay its release Thursday. It upset me deeply, he say in a statement. We have be scrupulously fair to de Klerk, and we reject the contention that we have be engage in a vendetta against him. De Klerk's challenge be only part of the storm of criticism prompt by leaks about the report in the last few days. Within hours of the commission decision to withdraw its findings on de Klerk, it be face the possibility of a new suit this time from the rule african National Congress. The ANC also want to block the commission findings about its conduct during the liberation struggle. A spokesman for the party, Thabo Masebe, say the party would seek an injunction in the morning before the report be officially hand over to Mandela. While the commission's report be expect to lay overwhelming blame on the former white government for atrocities, it have also find the ANC responsible for human-rights violations, include the torture and killing of spy suspects, bombings in civilian areas and the killing of political enemies, include members of the rival zulu-based Inkhata Freedom Party. The decision on de Klerk seem certain to damage the commission's credibility. The panel, create as a way of put South Africa's brutal past to rest without the expense and political divisiveness of trials, have cause controversy from the start. It have hold more than 160 hearings throughout the country, listening to both victims and to perpetrators seek amnesty. But many whites say the commission be on a witch hunt aim to humiliate former government officials and Afrikaners in general. De Klerk have once before force the commission officials to court and win an apology from them for call him a liar. Some political analysts say wednesday's events would only further the belief that the panel lack impartiality. The withdrawal of the findings can't help but be see as a lack of certainty on their side, say Sampie Terreblanche, an economist and political analyst at the University of Stellenbosch, who have support the commission. Whether we like it or not, the whole report get a knock from this. De Klerk's spokesman, David Steward, say the former president be very confident that he would win when the case go to trial in March. He be very happy to be in the courts now rather than deal with the Truth Commission, Steward said. The fact that they agree to withdraw create the definite impression that they specifically concoct a case to involve Mr. de Klerk in a negative finding. The ANC have accuse the commission of try to criminalize the liberation struggle. Whatever the efforts to besmirch our struggle by denounce it as a gross violation of human rights, the congress say in a statement. The ANC and the millions of people who be part of this struggle will always be proud of what they do to insure that, in the process of the destruction of a vile system, they do not themselves resort to vile methods of struggle on the basis that the means justify the end. There be probably few subjects that get south Africans more excited than the issue of the Truth Commission and whether it be a worthy cause or a waste of money. The events of the last few days have only add to the debate. For some, like Pal Martins, 34, a former member of the ANC's arm wing, the fact all sides of the political spectrum be in an uproar be a good thing. The mere fact that everyone be complain means that the Truth Commission have do its work, he said. But others say that too many questions be be raise about the panel's competence. The whole affair be beyond the pale, a mockery of justice, say Roboy Vonholdt, a 56-year-old sheep and ostrich farmer who believe that the commission have be a theatrical act. We should all turn our backs on the past and move forward. We need them and they need us. Let's all make money and let good economic conditions prevail. The commission's report be suppose to be a broad and detailed summary of South Africa's human rights history, from 1960 to 1994, when elections open to all races end white minority rule. It will parcel out moral condemnations and recommend individual prosecutions. While de Klerk be alone in court Wednesday challenge the commission, Tutu say Wednesday that other threaten legal challenges have lead to few individuals be name as rights violators than originally planned. Tutu say that more than 400 people have be notify that they would be implicate to give them a chance to respond. Some 15 successfully argue themselves out of the report or could not be reach and be therefore delete from the report, he said. The commission be require by law to give advance notification to anyone it intend to implicate in its report. The commission have be expect to say that although de Klerk do not order the bombings, he subsequently come to know that former Law and Order Minister Adriaan Vlok and Police Commissioner Johan van der Merwe have be involved, but fail to report his knowledge to the police. This could open him up to a criminal prosecution. De Klerk have not apply for amnesty in this matter or any other. de Klerk have say that when he learn about the bombings, Vlok and Van der Merwe be already in the process of apply for amnesty, and he do not think it be necessary to report the matter. A panel investigate apartheid-era atrocities say Wednesday it will not implicate the last apartheid president, F.W. de Klerk, in human rights abuses after he threaten a court challenge. De Klerk say he would sue to block the long-awaited final report of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission, which be due for release Thursday. The man who help negotiate the end of apartheid object to a finding by the commission that he be an accessory after the fact to bombings in the 1980s of the headquarters of a church group and of a labor federation. Former Archbishop Desmond Tutu, the truth panel's chairman, say the commission need time to prepare to fight the legal challenge, and would excise de Klerk's name from the report to avoid delay its release. It upset me deeply, Tutu said. We have be scrupulously fair to Mr. de Klerk and we reject the contention that we have be engage in a vendetta against him. But we must and will respect the courts and his rights under the constitution. We fight hard for those rights and we can be proud in South Africa that Mr. de Klerk now shares in them, he say in a statement. All we be do be postpone deal with the matter, Tutu later tell The Associated Press. The name will eventually appear after all the hoo-ha have die down. De Klerk, reach in London, say he could not comment before speak with his lawyers because the matter be in the courts. The commission be charge with promote reconciliation by lay bare apartheid's horrors. It have hold hearings around the country for more than two years, listen to victims and perpetrators seek amnesty. The release of the 3,500-page report represent a milestone for South Africa's transformation from white minority rule to democracy. De Klerk's challenge be only part of the storm of criticism prompt by leaks of the report. The African National Congress, the liberation movement that help defeat apartheid and now run the country, on Tuesday angrily reject a finding that it too be guilty of human rights violations in its armed struggle. The report will be a broad and detailed summary of South Africa's human rights history, from 1960 to 1994, when all-race elections end white minority rule. It will parcel out moral condemnations and recommend individual prosecutions. other threaten legal challenges have lead to few individuals be name as rights violators than planned, The star of Johannesburg report Wednesday. In comment on the newspaper report, Tutu say that more than 400 people have be notify they would be implicate to give them a chance to respond. only 15 successfully argue themselves out of the report, he said. Criminal prosecutions for atrocities commit during the war against white rule could drag on for at least six years, a top prosecutor say Monday. Key figures implicate in human rights abuses by the Truth and Reconciliation Commission already be under investigation, the official, Jan d'oliveira, tell reporters. They include two unnamed generals in the apartheid state's security apparatus, President Nelson Mandela's ex-wife Winnie Madikizela-Mandela and officials of the African National Congress, he said. The remarks by d'oliveira, who recently be appoint a deputy national director of prosecutions, be the clear signal yet that criminal cases would be bring against figures accuse by the commission of gross human rights violations. The commission release its report Oct. 30. It chronicle the human rights abuses commit by apartheid governments and their operatives as well as by the African National Congress and others fight the racist system. The issue of continue prosecutions be significant. many feel that drag on criminal reckonings of the horrors of the apartheid era will only prolong bitterness and delay reconciliation. But supporters of prosecution feel that deny justice to the victims be a bad evil. On a practical level, highly public prosecutions of ANC figures could have an impact on national elections next year, when the party will seek to consolidate its hold on power. The panel's chairman, Archbishop Desmond Tutu, have call for a two-year time limit on prosecutions; d'oliveira call the period wholly impractical. The prosecutor do not name the other targets. We have always work on the principle of that we will prosecute the high rank, he said. The commission have the ability to grant amnesty to those who admit their misdeeds and be find to have act with political motives. The report say individuals who have not seek amnesty should be prosecuted. Madikizela-Mandela have not seek amnesty. The commission find her accountable for human rights violations commit by her bodyguards, who the report say kill and torture suspected opponents. Madikizela-Mandela be convict in 1991 of kidnapping and be an accessory to an assault on four young men. She be sentence to six years in jail, but pay a dlrs 3,200 fine on appeal. The ANC official be among the most prominent anti-apartheid activists. The two generals be implicate during Truth Commission testimony. Prosecutors be ready to move forward pending the amnesty application of one. Torturers and bombers who carry out atrocities defend or fight apartheid need counsel to ensure they do not repeat their crimes, an expert for South Africa's reconciliation body say Thursday. Addressing local and international experts, Charles Villa-Vicencio, research head of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission, say ignore the psychological needs of those who carry out human rights abuses could alienate a potentially dangerous sector of society. We must give attention to the healing of perpetrators, not just for the sake of perpetrators, but for the sake of the nation as a whole, he said. The conference, organize by the Medical Research Council, be examine mental health issues raise by the Truth Commission, which be charge with probe crimes commit by all sides in the anti-apartheid struggle. As the commission prepare to hand over its final report at the end of the month, South Africans be examine its painful and traumatic exploration of their bloody past. With the power to grant amnesty to many who tortured, bomb or maim innocent civilians, the process have at some stage angered people in nearly all walks of life. many whites see the panel as favor the black liberation movements, while many blacks accuse it of be too soft on former state officials, especially top rank ministers. However, Villa-Vicencio appeal for tolerance in deal with all those who have commit crimes, say that the potential for wrongdoing exist in everyone. We all, the entire human race, carry with us the capacity for evil, he said. Many of Thursday's speakers touch on the figure of police death squad leader Eugene de Kock, who be give jail terms total more than 200 years after a killing spree that cost dozens of lives. De Kock have apply for amnesty for his crimes. Dan Stein, a specialist in neurobiology and stress disorders, say de Kock typify many killers from all sides in the conflict by his sheer banality of evil. many people have find him in interviews to be an ordinary, even likeable person, he say about the man whom subordinate dub Prime Evil. Ginn Fourie, a physiotherapist whose student daughter be gun down by black activists in a 1993 attack on a Cape Town bar, say it be necessary to help those whose circumstances compel them to do wrong. struggle to control her tears, Fourie tell delegates she have attend the amnesty hearings of her daughter's killers and support their successful bid to be free from long jail sentences. After describe how she hug the three members of the black nationalist Pan-Africanist Congress and urge them to seek counsel together with their victims, Fourie earn a stand ovation from the 50-strong audience. We must take the initiative in understand others and start the process of reconciliation and heal our broken land, she said, her voice shake with emotion. The New York Times say in an editorial on Sunday, Nov. 1: The 3,500-page report of the south african Truth and Reconciliation Commission, release on Thursday, be the most comprehensive and unsparing examination of a nation's ugly past that any such commission have yet produced. draw from the commission's own investigations and the testimony of hundreds of applicants for amnesty and 20,000 victims, the report be a detailed look at the crimes of the apartheid era, and blames successive white governments for the vast majority. It have fulfil its mandate of tell the full truth possible, which be one reason that every political party in South Africa have denounce it. Besides accuse the government of assassinations and bombings, the report criticize the Inkatha Freedom Party for its massacres and collaboration with security forces, and blame the African National Congress for the murder of civilians and other crimes. It single out former President P.W. Botha, Chief Mangosuthu Buthelezi, the Inkatha leader, and Winnie Mandela, among others, for detailed treatment of their roles in political crimes. One major flaw in the report be the absence of a section accuse F.W. de Klerk, the last apartheid president, of know about several bombings after the fact and keep silent. It be excise because de Klerk be sue the commission. The ANC also sued, unsuccessfully, to stop publication. The lawsuits be a disappointing sign that South Africa's political parties be not interested in an honest look at their past, nor in the free flow of information. The controversy have add to widespread complaints that the commission have not help the process of reconciliation. This be wrong. True reconciliation which occur when a society be no longer paralyze by the past and people can work and live together cannot be base on silence. No society can be restore to health by paper over as much pain as South Africans have suffered. A noisy and informed debate about complicity in the crimes of the apartheid era be necessary, if uncomfortable. The report be only part of the Truth Commission's contribution to the healing process. The hearings themselves, which allow victims of human rights violations to tell their stories in public, help the country heal and open the eyes of many whites to the unpleasant truth about apartheid. The amnesty process, while permit many important criminals to escape justice, be allow families to know exactly what happen to their love ones in dozens of cases that would likely have never go to trial in South Africa's fragile judicial system. The process of help the victims with scholarships and other necessary aid go on, although it will not be enough. No commission can transform a society as twist as South Africa's was. But the Truth Commission be the best effort the world have seen, and South Africa be the good for it. The deal that South Africa's Truth and Reconciliation Commission offer be simple enough: Confess your crimes, apply for amnesty and you will go free. If you don't come forward, you will be prosecuted. After more than two years of hearings into apartheid-era atrocities, the commission last week unveil a 3,500-page report name dozens of people it believe be up to their elbows in the gore but never apply for amnesty. So the prosecutions should begin soon, right? not so fast. The study be barely in the hands of President Nelson Mandela before talk of new amnesty deals have begun. It seem that nearly all of South Africa's political parties include the ruling African National Congress have key officials who could end up in the dock because of the report. Suddenly, there be lots of talk about how the country can't withstand a round of politically divisive trials, and many political analysts here be bet that an agreement of mutual benefit be in the offing. Already, three major political parties be call for some kind of new amnesty, and the ANC isn't close the door. ANC spokesman Thabo Masebe say it be premature to talk of a general amnesty, but he acknowledge that the party be discuss an amnesty specifically tailor to violence by black South Africans against other blacks that litter the KwaZulu/Natal province with bodies during the late '80s and into the '90s. In choose a truth commission rather than a nuremberg-style trial with which to close out its brutal past, South Africa hop for an idealistic reconciliation. People would come clean and receive true forgiveness. Society would then be able to move on, its wounds cleanse and healed. It be a model watch closely around the world by other societies wonder how to disentangle themselves from the grudges of a brutal past. But give the chance, hundreds of South Africa's perpetrators do not come forward. Commission officials themselves say they be frustrate by the lack of cooperation, however exhaustive their report may seem. It be perhaps too late, however, to press for more. Today's South Africa have urgent new problems to deal with unemployment, crime, white flight, too few schools and hospitals. So it may wind up settle for a more pragmatic reconciliation one that give amnesty to the unrepentant simply because it's more practical for all concern to move on. In recent years, truth commissions have gain popularity in many places, notably Chile, Argentina and El Salvador. But South Africa's the big and most powerful, able to grant amnesty and to subpoena witnesses be suppose to be the real test. Certainly the commission force the nation to see the gruesome details of its past, as sob survivors and stone-faced torturers tell of smashed genitals and near suffocations. And the commission's work add much to the knowledge about what happen in South Africa between 1960 and 1994. But it will be years before the effect of the commission can truly be judged. Has anyone really forgiven anyone else? Will vendettas persist? No one can answer. One thing seem clear, however: Four years after South Africa hold its first non-racial elections, a grow number of South Africans want to be do with the past. Raymond Louw, the publisher of a respected weekly newsletter, Southern Africa Report, say a new amnesty proposal could come up during the February session of Parliament, in time to remove the issue from next year's election campaigns. You simply can't have this country tear apart by prosecutions, he says. everybody be go to be howl for an amnesty. They already are. even as Archbishop Desmond Tutu, the commission's chairman, deliver the report, he seem to be anticipate a push for a new amnesty and argue against it. He say such a move would be highly unfair to those who come forward. He suggest instead that there be a two-year time limit, after which anyone not indict would in effect get amnesty. To be sure, there will be opposition to any proposals to limit prosecutions. more than a dozen human rights and victims advocacy groups have already band together to condemn such proposals as unconscionable. The idea for a Truth Commission emerge as a compromise from the long negotiations that bring about South Africa's peaceful transition from a white supremacist state to a non-racial democracy. During the talks, the white National Party government push for a blanket amnesty, and the ANC refused. In the end, only about 250 former police officers come forward, most of them foot soldiers. And only two high National Party officials, former Law and Order Minister Adriaan Vlok and Police Commissioner Johan van der Merwe, confess to roles in order bombings. In its report, the commission call the apartheid state the primary perpetrator of gross human rights violations and hold such high rank former officials as former President P.W. Botha, his former army chief, Georg Meiring, and the former intelligence chief, Niel Barnard, responsible. These men, and others of low rank, have not apply for amnesty For the ANC, the most embarrassing prospect be the possible prosecution of Mandela's former wife, Winnie Madikizela-Mandela, who be accuse in the report of take part in a number of assaults and abductions. lesser-known officials could face charges too. The ANC be hold responsible for at least 76 deaths in KwaZulu/Natal. The ANC's problems be far complicate by its efforts to make peace with the largely zulu-based Inkatha Freedom Party. Virtually no one from that party come forward to ask for amnesty. Yet the report find that Inkatha, work with the white government, be responsible for widespread slaughter in KwaZulu/Natal and in the townships around Johannesburg. Inkatha's leader, Chief Mangosuthu Buthelezi, and many key party officials stand accuse of foment a wide range of abuses. But prosecute Chief Buthelezi could lead to new warfare in KwaZulu. Part of the reluctance to go forward with prosecutions may be the result of still another factor: The judicial system be already overwhelm with rise crime and the evidence from the apartheid era be old. so why spend the time and the money? At the moment, only one political party be oppose to any form of new amnesty the tiny but influential Democratic Party, a liberal group that be not involve in the violence. Its head, Tony Leon, say a new amnesty would only prove that the more thuglike your behavior, the more you get away with. But he concede that his be a lonely voice. At this point, he says, there be little enthusiasm for anything but close the book on the past. A panel probe apartheid-era abuses have accuse the African National Congress of human rights violations, include torture and bomb attacks, the state broadcaster say Monday. The ANC, which lead the struggle against white rule and now be in power, previously have acknowledge it be tell to expect implication in right violations. The Truth and Reconciliation Commission will release its final report on 2 1-2 years of investigation on Thursday. The report be expect to place overwhelming blame for the era's abuse on white governments and their brutal security services. President Nelson Mandela's office receive an advance copy on Monday ahead of the handover ceremony, when retire Archbishop Desmond Tutu, who chair the comission, will present Mandela with the report. South African Broadcasting Corp. radio say it have be leak a preliminary document which condemn the ANC as politically and morally responsible for gross human rights violations during and after the fall of apartheid. An ANC spokesman, Thabo Masebe, say he believe the news report refer to a commission letter send in advance inform us of its intention to implicate the ANC in gross human rights violations. Commission officials could not immediately be reach for comment. Justice Minister Dullah Omar tell journalists in Pretoria he have hear the news report, but would not comment. Former President F.W. de Klerk, meanwhile, plans to ask a court to prevent the Truth Commission report from implicate him in cover up state-sponsored terror. Obviously we will comply with the ruling of a court, Omar said, but add he would regret any court-ordered delay. The ANC be nervous enough about the report to request a meeting with commissioners earlier this month. The panel refused, to avoid appear embarrassed. The party say the accusations against it likely would center on the planting of land mines on border farms, abuses at its military camps in Angola and bombings. Omar say he expect the report's conclusions to set off debate but add it would lay the basis for reconciliation. President Nelson Mandela acknowledge Saturday the African National Congress violate human rights during apartheid, set him at odds with his deputy president over a report that have divide much of South Africa. The disagreement stem from Thursday's release of the report by the Truth and Reconciliation Commission on horrors commit during apartheid. Rather than act as a salve and an aid to reconciliation, the report have cause divisiveness, even among former comrades-in-arms who fight apartheid. As expected, the report call apartheid a crime against humanity. But it also blame the ANC for gross human rights violations during its anti-apartheid struggle, say the group torture suspected spies and dissidents and kill innocent civilians with land mines and bombs. Some suspected traitors be kill in the ANC's camps abroad. Mbeki who become ANC president last year and will likely be elect South Africa's next president in 1999 when Mandela retire take a hard line Saturday against the report, and indicate all ANC members must do the same. No member, 5th graf, 1st ld-writethru follow be excerpts from the final report issue by South Africa's Truth and Reconciliation Commission on Thursday: PRIMARY FINDING On the basis of the evidence available to it, the primary finding of the Commission be that: The predominant portion of gross violations of human rights be commit by the former state through its security and law-enforcement agencies. Moreover, the south african state in the period from the late 1970's to early 1990's become involve in activities of a criminal nature when, amongst other things, it knowingly planned, undertook, condone and cover up the commission of unlawful acts, include the extrajudicial killing of political opponents and others, inside and outside South Africa. In pursuit of these unlawful activities, the state act in collusion with certain other political groupings, most notably the Inkatha Freedom Party (I.F.P.). . . . certain members of the State Security Council (the state President, Minister of Defense, Minister of Law and Order, and heads of security forces) do foresee that the use of words such as take out, wipe out, eradicate, and eliminate would result in the killing of political opponents. They be therefore responsible for deliberate planning which cause gross violations of human rights. P.W. BOTHA During the period that he preside as head of state (1978-1989) accord to submissions make to and findings make by the Commission, gross violations of human rights and other unlawful acts be perpetrate on a wide scale by members of the south african Defense Force, including: The deliberate unlawful killing and attempt killing of persons oppose to the policies of the Government, within and outside South Africa. The widespread use of torture and other forms of severe ill treatment against such persons. The forcible abduction of such persons where be resident in neighbor countries. Covert logistical and financial assistance to organizations oppose to the ideology of the A.N.C. and other liberation movements. . . . INKATHA The Commission find that in 1986, the south african Defense Forces (S.A.D.F.) conspire with Inkatha to provide the latter with a covert, offensive paramilitary unit (or hit squad) to be deploy illegally against persons and organizations perceive to be oppose to both the south african Government and Inkatha. The S.A.D.F. provide training, financial and logistical management and behind the scenes supervision of the trainees, who be train by the special Forces unit of the S.A.D.F. in the Caprivi Strip. The Commission find furthermore that the deployment of the paramilitary unit in KwaZulu lead to gross violations of human rights, include killing, attempt kill and severe ill treatment. The Commission find the following people, among others, accountable for such violations: Mr. P. W. Botha, Gen. Magnus Malan, Chief Mangosuthu Buthelezi. . . . The A.N.C. While it be A.N.C. policy that the loss of civilian life should be avoided, there be instances where members of its security forces perpetrate gross violations of human rights in that the distinction between military and civilian targets be blur in certain armed actions, such as the 1983 Church Street bombing of the south African Air Force headquarters. . . . In the course of the arm struggle, the A.N.C., through its security forces, undertook military operations which, though intend for military or security force targets, sometimes go awry for a variety of reasons, include poor intelligence and reconnaissance. The consequences in these cases, such as the Magoo's Bar and Durban Esplanade bombings, be gross violations of human rights in respect of the injuries to and loss of lives of civilians. Individuals who defect to the state and become informers and/or members who become state witnesses in political trials . . . be often label by the A.N.C. as collaborators and regard as legitimate targets to be killed. The commission do not condone the legitimization of such individuals as military targets and find that the extrajudicial killings of such individuals constitute gross violations of human rights. The commission find that, in the 1980's in particular, a number of gross violations be perpetrate not by direct members of the A.N.C. or those operate under its formal command, but by civilians who saw themselves as A.N.C. supporters. In this regard, the Commission find that the A.N.C. be morally and politically accountable for create a climate in which such supporters believe their actions to be legitimate and carry out within the broad parameters of a people's war as enunciate by the A.N.C. A.N.C. CAMPS The Commission find that suspected agents be routinely subject to torture and other forms of severe ill treatment and that there be cases of such individuals be charge and convict by tribunals without proper regard to due process, sentence to death and executed. WINNIE MADIKIZELA-MANDELA The Commission find that Ms. Madikizela-Mandela be central to the establishment and formation of the Mandela United Football Club, which later develop into a private vigilante unit. It be the Commission's view that Ms. Madikizela-Mandela be aware of the criminal activity and the disquiet it cause in the community, but choose deliberately not to address the problems emanate from the football club. The Commission find that those who oppose Ms. Madikizela-Mandela and the Mandela United Football Club, or dissent from them, be brand as informers and killed. The Commission find that Ms. Madikizela-Mandela . . . be accountable, politically and morally for the gross violations of human rights commit by the Mandela United Football Club. The Commission find further that Mrs. Madikizela-Mandela herself be responsible for commit such gross violations of human rights. . . . BUSINESS Business be central to the economy that sustain the south african state during the apartheid years. Certain businesses, especially the mining industry, be involve in help design and implement apartheid policies. The white agriculture industry benefit from its privileged access to land. ","South Africa's Truth and Reconciliation Commission, appointed to reconcile the sides involved in the crimes of the apartheid era, is releasing its final 2.5- year report.Its purpose is to identify those who committed gross violations of human rights.The report is to lay most of the blame for the violations on the State, but the ANC also shares blame.The program offers amnesty to the accused if they confess but execution if they refuse.The process has angered many people of all walks of life.De Klerk, Apartheid's last president, is not being implicated but he is suing to stop publication.Criminal cases are nonetheless expected to go on for six years.","South Africa's Truth and Reconciliation Commission headed by Desmond Tutu proposes amnesty to heal the wounds of the apartheid era.If those accused of atrocities confess, they will be given amnesty, if not, they will be prosecuted.The Commission's report said most human rights violations were by the former state through security and law enforcement agencies.The African National Congress, Inkatha Freedom Party, and Winnie Mandela's United Football Club also shared guilt.Former president de Klerk, who shared the Nobel Peace Prize with Nelson Mandela, was not named as an accessory after the fact, since his threatened lawsuit would delay the report.","South Africa Truth and Reconciliation Commission's 3,500-page report on apartheid-era atrocities was issued on Oct 30.This report was intended to clear the air, grant amnesty to those who confessed, and begin the healing process.Those named for prosecution were warned before the release.Ex-prime minister de Klerk's name was removed.The ruling African National Congress remained.While the white government bore the brunt of the blame, several black movements were included.After the release many talked of a new amnesty period or a limited time to prosecute.Prosecutions could take 6 years; diverting judges, threatening elections, and slowing recovery.","The Truth and Reconciliation Commission, which was established to look into the human rights violations committed during the long struggle against white rule, released its final report.In what has been described as one of the most complete reports of its kind, the commission blames most of the atrocities on the former South African government.The ANC also came under fire for committing some atrocities during the struggle.Nelson Mandella's ex-wife, Winnie could be prosecuted for the part she played in such violations.Missing from the report was De Klerk, who threatened to sue if he was mentioned in connection with the atrocities."
1008,"As a gay college student lay hospitalize in critical condition after a severe beating here, this small city, which bills itself as Wyoming's hometown, wrestle with its attitudes towards gay men. On Saturday, at the University of Wyoming's annual homecoming parade, Pistol Pete and his uniformed brass band be overshadow by a large group of marchers 450 people, many wear yellow armbands and carry signs in support of the 21-year-old student, Matthew Shepard, who suffer severe head injuries in the attack last week. Hate be not a small Town Value No to Violence and Evil, read one sign, as watchers applauded. With passersby spontaneously join the protest group, two women hold another sign that read, No Hate Crimes in Wyoming. Two candlelight vigils be hold Sunday night at churches near the campus. At the Poudre Valley Hospital in Fort Collins, Colo., where Shepard's health continue to deteriorate, the hospital have receive so many flowers that nurses have start to distribute bouquets to other patients. A vigil at the hospital on Saturday even draw about 500 people. We live in the Equality State, Shannon Rexroat write Friday in a special edition of the Branding Iron, the campus newspaper. refer to Wyoming's pioneer heritage as the first state to grant women the right to vote, Ms. Rexroat, the campus newspaper's editor added: That mean nothing to me anymore. We live in a state where a young man be brutally beaten because he be gay. But others recall another side of Wyoming's hometown,which have a population of more than 26,000. Jamie Lewis, another editor, say that on Friday he be hand out copies of the special edition when a passerby back away from him and use an anti-gay epithet. last week's brutal assault bubble out of an ongoing climate of hostility toward gay men and lesbians, leaders of the local Unitarian church say in a letter publish Sunday in the city's newspaper, The Laramie Daily Boomerang. This incident be atypical in its brutality, but not in its underlying motive, write Jeffrey Lockwood and Stephen Johnson. Gay people in Laramie, they wrote, be frequently assault with derision, intolerance, insult and hostility if not guns and ropes. Ric Turley, who drop out of college here after one year in the 1970s, recall driving here to see his family for Christmas in 1993 and see a vandalized billboard on the main highway. Under a brace of pistols, an advertising appeal for a state history museum have be changed, he said, from Shoot a Day or Two, to shoot a Gay or Two. Turley, who be gay and say he only come out after he have leave Wyoming, say that he immediately complain to the museum. But return a month later, he find the message have not be erased. After complain to the museum for a second time, he say he take a can of black spray paint and blot out the word gay. It be this kind of complacency and apathy that allow this to happen, he say of the beating in which two local men have be charged, Russell Henderson and Aaron McKinney. accord to the local police and prosecutors, the two men lure Shepard out of a bar by say they be gay. Then, the Laramie police say, the pair kidnap Shepard, pistol-whip him with a .357 Magnum and leave him tie to a ranch fence for 18 hours until a passing bicyclist spot Shepard, who be unconscious. On Sunday, the Laramie police say that McKinney have be arrest on Thursday at the same hospital in Fort Collins where Shepard be be treated. McKinney be be treat for a minor skull fracture unrelated to the fracas with Shepard, say Ben Fritzen, a Laramie police detective. President Clinton have condemn the attack, say on Saturday, I be deeply grieve by the act of violence perpetrate against Matthew Shepard. Clinton urge Congress to pass the federal Hate Crimes Prevention Act, saying, There be nothing more important to the future of this country than our stand together against intolerance, prejudice and violent bigotry. Wyoming be one of 10 states that do not have a hate crime law. The late attempt die in the state Legislature in Cheyenne in February. On Saturday, Wyoming's governor, Jim Geringer, say he be outrage and sicken by the attack. here in Laramie, McKinney's father, Bill, also condemn the attack. His pickup truck be apparently use in the kidnapping. But he also complain about the massive attention by the national media. The national press blow it totally out of proportion because it involve a homosexual, McKinney tell The Denver Post. `had this be a heterosexual these two boys decide to take out and rob, this never would have make the national news. Shepard grow up in Casper until his sophomore year in high school, when his father, an oil rig safety engineer, be transfer to Saudi Arabia. The young man complete high school at a board school in Lugano, Switzerland, where he learn italian and German. On Saturday, his parents, Dennis and Judy Shepard, release a statement from Fort Collins thank the american public for their kind thoughts about Matthew. He be a trust person who take everybody at face value and he do not see the bad side of anyone, the Shepards wrote. He have always strongly felt that all people be the same, regardless of their sexual preference, race or religion. note that their son be bear prematurely and that his life have often be a struggle, they added, He be physically short in stature, but we believe he be a giant when it come to respect the worth of others. last Saturday morning, while Matthew Shepard lay comatose from a beating, a college homecoming parade pass a few blocks from his hospital bed in Fort Collins. Propped on a fraternity float be a straw-haired scarecrow, label in black spray paint: I'm Gay. Few people miss the message. Three days earlier, Shepard, a gay University of Wyoming freshman, be savagely beaten and tie to a ranch fence in such a position that a passerby first mistake him for a scarecrow. Tuesday, officials at Colorado State University react with outrage to the fraternity float, open an investigation and disciplinary procedures against the fraternity, Pi Kappa Alpha. The fraternity chapter immediately suspend seven members and say they have act independently. But in a week when candlelight vigils for Shepard be be hold on campuses across the nation, the scarecrow incident highlight how hostility toward gay people often flourish in high schools and universities, gay leaders say Tuesday. People would like to think that what happen to Matthew be an exception to the rule but, it be an extreme version of what happen in our schools on a daily basis, say Kevin Jennings, executive director of the Gay, Lesbian and Straight Education Network, a New York group dedicate to end anti-gay bias in the schools. Shepard, a slightly build 21-year-old, die on Monday morning from the injuries suffer in the beating. He never regain consciousness after be discover on the evening of Oct. 7, 18 hours after he be lash to the fence. Two men, Russell Henderson, 21, and Aaron McKinney, 22, be arraign late Monday night on first-degree murder charges. Their girlfriends, Chasity Pasley, 20, and Kristen Price, 18, have be arraign as accessories after the fact. In response to the killing, about 50 candelight vigils be schedule this week, from Texas to vermont, from Wayne, Neb., to New York City. At the Poudre Valley Hospital in Fort Collins where Shepard be in intensive care for five days, his parents, Dennis and Judy Shepard, receive about 6,000 electronic messages of condolences. Tuesday, when funeral arrangements be announce for Friday in Casper, Wyo., the hospital Web site receive 30,000 hits an hour. Friends at the University of Wyoming in Laramie, Wyo., have set up The Matthew Shepard Memorial Fund to raise money to pressure the state legislature to pass anti-hate crime legislation. I see his name go down in gay history as a catalyst for renew activism, say Matt Foreman, a former Wyomingite who direct Empire State Pride Agenda, a gay political organization in New York. From around the nation Tuesday, gay leaders stress that campus homophobia be not restrict to college towns in the Rocky Mountain West. last year, in a survey of almost 4,000 Massachusetts high school students, 22 percent of gay respondents say they skip school in the past month because they felt unsafe at school, and 31 percent say they have be threaten or injure at school in the past year. These percentages be about five times great than the percentages of heterosexual respondents. The survey be conduct at 58 high schools by the Massachusetts Department of Education. In a separate study of nearly 500 community college students in the San Francisco area, 32 percent of male respondents say they have verbally threaten gay people and 18 percent say they have physically threaten or assault gay people. The study be conduct this year by Karen Franklin, a forensic psychologist who be a researcher at the University of Washington. Surveys of gay college students conduct in the late 1980s at Yale University, Oberlin College, Rutgers University and Penn State find that 16 percent to 26 percent have be threaten with violence, and that 40 percent to 76 percent have be verbally harassed, say the National Gay and Lesbian Task Force, a lobbying group base in Washington. last year, a student group in Des Moines, Iowa, call concerned Students, record hallway and classroom conversations at five high schools on 10 homophobia record day. They estimate that the average Des Moines high school student hear about 25 anti-gay remarks every day. Nine out of 10 `teaching tolerance' courses weed out gays, Foreman said. There be a lot of people preach anti-racism and anti-semitism. But it be still very much OK to make anti-gay jokes, to express anti-gay sentiments. In a survey of the nation's 42 large school districts, 76 percent do not train teachers on issues face gay students, and 42 percent do not have policies to protect students from discrimination base on sexual orientation, say the Gay, Lesbian and Straight Education Network, which conduct the survey last month. In Fort Collins, while hospital officials struggle with an electronic avalanche of condolences, city police detectives be investigate a different kind of e-mail. On Monday, hours after Shepard's death, two gay organizations, the Rainbow Chorus and the Lambda Community Center, receive identical messages applaud Shepard's murder. The messages close with the words: I hope it happen more often. Matthew Shepard, the gay college student who be kidnap and severely beaten, die here Monday, five days after he be find unconscious on a Wyoming ranch where he have be leave tie to a fence for 18 hours in near-freezing temperatures. His death, announce at Poudre Valley Hospital here, fan the outrage that follow word of last week's attack, spawn nationwide vigils, produce a call for federal hate-crimes legislation from President Clinton and fuel debates over such laws in a host of western states, include Wyoming, that have resist them. From Denver to the University of Maryland, people turn out to honor the The slight, soft-spoken 21-year-old Shepard, a freshman at the University of Wyoming, who become an overnight symbol of anti-gay violence after he be find dangle from the fence by a passerby. Two men and two women have be charge in the case. The men be charge with attempted murder and be expect to face first-degree murder charges that could bring the death penalty. There be incredible symbolism about be tie to a fence, say Rebecca Isaacs, political director of the National Gay and Lesbian Task Force in Washington. People have liken it to a scarecrow. But it sound more like a crucifixion. Gay leaders hope and christian conservatives fear that Shepard's death will galvanize Congress and state legislatures to pass hate-crime legislation or broaden exist laws. Conservatives generally oppose such laws because they favor one group's rights over another. In the last two decades, 21 states and the District of Columbia have pass laws that increase penalties for crimes that be commit because of a person's race, religion, color, national origin, and sexual orientation. Another 19 states, include Colorado, do not include sexual orientation in their hate-crime laws. Ten states, include Wyoming, have no hate-crime laws at all. In Washington, Clinton respond to news of Shepard's death by urge Congress to pass the federal Hate Crimes Protection Act, which would make federal offenses of crimes base on sex, disability and sexual orientation. Wyoming have be one of the nation's holdouts, reject three hate crimes bills since 1994, most recently in February. But Monday, after Shepard's death, Gov. Jim Geringer appeal to lawmakers to reconsider their opposition. I ask for a collective suggestion for anti-bias, anti-hate legislation that can be present to the Wyoming Legislature for their consideration in January, Geringer said. The governor meet Monday morning with Dennis Shepard, the slain student's father, and say that the elder Shepard do not want his son's death to become a media circus and that we should not use Matt to further an agenda. Geringer say that Shepard's father also said: Don't rush into just pass all kinds of new hate-crimes laws. Be very careful of any changes and be sure you're not take away rights of others in the process to race to this. Leaders of gay rights groups interview Monday say they would respect the family's privacy by not attend the burial in Casper, Wyo., on Saturday. But they add that they hop the death would have an impact on legislators around the nation. Matthew's death, I hope, will bring about a good and deep understanding of hate crime laws, say Elizabeth Birch, executive director of the Human Rights Campaign, a lesbian and gay rights group that have 250,000 members. Matthew's death may lead to an awakening in Wyoming and in the United States Congress as the need for this legislation. In 1996, 21 men and women be kill in the United States because of their sexual orientation, accord to the Southern Poverty Law Center, an Alabama group that track violence against minorities. accord to the FBI, sexual orientation be a factor in 11.6 percent of the 8,759 hate crimes record in 1996. But Christian conservatives warn that gay leaders want to use Shepard's death to expand hate rights laws and to curtail freedom of speech. Hate crimes laws have nothing to do with perpetrators of violent crime and everything to do with silence political opposition, say Steven Schwalm, an analyst with the Family Research Council, a Washington group dedicate to defend faith, family and freedom. It would criminalize pro-family beliefs, Schwalm said. This basically send a message that you can't disagree with the political message of homosexual activists. Agreement come from John Paulk, who be feature this summer in a series of advertisements about how he and his wife, Anne, overcame homosexuality through religious conversion. We have every right to speak out against an agenda that be contrary to Biblical norms, say Paulk, who describe himself as a homosexuality specialist for Focus on the Family, a Christian group in Colorado Springs, Colo. Because we be stand up and oppose the homosexual agenda, we be be look upon as advocate violence against homosexuals, when we categorically reject violence against homosexuals. last Thursday, the Family Research Council unveil a series of television advertisements that preach the healing of homosexuality through religious conversion. Gay leaders charge that these advertisements help create a hostile climate for homosexuals, a climate that can lead to violence. Hate crime laws that be on the books in 40 states have not impinge on freedom of speech, say Brian Levin, a criminal justice professor who direct the Center on Hate and Extremism at Stockton College, in Pomona, N.J. Instead, he said, hate crime laws send a clear message that society do not tolerate attacks on minorities. We want to deter the broken windows and simple assaults before they escalate, he said. refer to murders of homosexuals, he added: These crimes be preventable. Offenders get embolden if they be not punish the first time. Levin say that his research indicate that homosexuals suffer high rates of violent crime than the population at large. He also say that roughly half of the people who attack homosexuals be male, age 22 or younger. The two men charge in the killing of Shephard be both white, Russell Henderson, 21, and Aaron McKinney, 22. With other crimes, violence be a mean to an end. With hate crimes, the violence become an unstoppable goal, Levin said. Shepard suffer a dozen cuts around the head, face and neck, as well as a massive blow to the back of his skull. Because their social stature in society, gays be often view as appropriate targets, Levin added. cite the need for hate crime laws to send a clear message to gay bashers, Levin said: The discourse in society leave many of these people to believe that what they be do be socially acceptable. While some gay leaders saw crucifixion imagery in Shepard's death, others saw a different symbolism: the Old West practice of nail a dead coyote to a ranch fence as a warning to future intruders. This University of Wyoming student be beat and leave to die, tie to a fence like an animal because he be honest and open about be gay, Beatrice Dorhn, legal director of the Lambda Legal Defense and Education Fund, say Monday, Matthew Shepard's horrible suffering and death cannot be dismiss simply as the fault of deranged, isolate individuals. His attackers be among millions of Americans who constantly hear the message that gay people be not worthy of the most basic equal treatment, Ms. Dorhn said. On the same day Americans learn last week that Matthew Shepard, a 5-foot-2, 105-pound gay college student, have be tortured, string up like an animal and leave to die on a fence outside Laramie, Wyo., the Family Research Council be co-hosting a press conference in Washington. It be the late salvo in a six-month campaign by the religious right, with the tacit, even explicit, approval of republican leaders, to demonize gay people for political gain in this election year. This particular press conference be to announce a new barrage of ads a tv follow-up to a summer print campaign in which allege former homosexuals who have change implore others to do likewise through the power of Jesus Christ. The commercials, gooey in style, end with a slogan: It's not about hate ... It's about hope. But it's really about stir up the fear that produce hate. If these ads be truly aim at gay people, they wouldn't be broadcast at extravagant cost to the wide general audience reach by TV, and they wouldn't be trumpet in Washington, insure free national exposure, three weeks before Election Day. The ads themselves, despite the sugar-coating of hope, ooze malice. In one of them, homosexuality be link to drug addiction and certain death by AIDS; all of them implicitly posit that homosexuality be itself a disease in need of a cure. Matthew Shepard have now be cured, that's for sure. As his uncle, R.W. Eaton, tell The Denver Post, the 21-year-old Matt, who aspire to a career in diplomacy and human rights, be a small person with a big heart, mind and soul that someone try to beat out of him. Of his nephew's shatter body Eaton said, It's like something you might see in war. And a war it is. Go to the Family Research Council's Web site and you will find a proud description of its readiness to wage the war against the homosexual agenda and fight to maintain the traditional meaning of `family.' The head of the Family Research Council be Gary Bauer, a GOP power broker and putative presidential candidate, who disingenuously go on talk shows to say that his organization hat no one and deplore violence. But if you wage a well-financed media air war in which people with an innate difference in sexual orientation be ceaselessly brand as sinful and diseased and un-american seekers of special rights, ground war will follow. It's a story as old as history. Once any group be successfully scapegoated as a subhuman threat to normal values by a propaganda machine, embolden thugs take over. Two weeks after James Byrd be savagely drag to his death from a pickup truck in Texas in June, I write a column about an ugly incident outside the GOP state convention in Fort Worth, where a mob threaten a group of gay Log Cabin Republicans who be protest discriminatory treatment by their own party. The gay-bashers have be directly precede by steady saber-rattling from Republican politicians: Sen. James Inhofe of Oklahoma have liken James Hormel, a gay nominee to an ambassadorship, to David Duke; Pat Robertson have wonder on tv if God might wreak havoc on Disney World for its Gay Days; the Texas GOP spokesman have liken Log Cabin to the Ku Klux Klan. Just two days after this near-brush with violence in Fort Worth, Trent Lott be on tv second the religious right's condemnation of gay people as sinful and sick. A frightened gay Texas Republican who have be at the convention melee ask when I interview him then: Do you have to have someone hurt and beat up and drag from a truck to stop this? Months later not even the murder in Laramie have move Lott to apologize for his words, and still no major GOP leader dares take on its religious wing and its crusade against people like Matthew Shepard. In one of the new ads in that supposedly hate-free crusade, an ostensibly love mother condemn her son for the bad choice of be gay. be it that mother who speak for american values, or be it Matthew's? Go home, give your kids a hug, Judy Shepard say in a message read by a tearful hospital spokesman who announce her child's death early Monday morning, and don't let a day go by without tell them you love them. At first, the passing bicyclist think the crumpled form lash to a ranch fence be a scarecrow. But when he stopped, he find the burned, batter and nearly lifeless body of Matthew Shepard, an openly gay college student who have be tie to the fence 18 hours earlier. On Friday, the 22-year-old University of Wyoming student be in a coma in critical condition. At Albany County courthouse here, Russell Henderson, 21, and Aaron McKinney, 22, be arraign on charges of kidnapping, aggravate robbery and attempt first-degree murder. Two women describe as friends of the men, Kristen Leann Price, 18, and Chastity Vera Pasley, 20, have be charge as accessories after the fact to attempt first-degree murder. Shepard's friends say that he do not know his alleged tormentors. Laramie police say the primary motive be robbery, although court papers file Friday indicate Shepard's homosexuality may also have be a factor. Shepard's friends call the attack a hate crime. He be very open about his sexuality, Tina LaBrie, an anthropology student here, say of her friend. I admire him for that because it be very courageous to be yourself even when others disagree. A few hours before he be beaten, Shepard, a slight 5-foot, 2-inch man who wear braces on his teeth, have attend a meeting of the Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgendered Association, say Walter Boulden, a friend of Shepard's. He be sit at the bar, have a beer, when two men come up and talk to him, Boulden, a 46-year-old university lecturer of social work here, say today between tears. He indicate he be gay, and they say they be gay, too. Now, he be in a coma, continue Boulden, who visit his friend at a hospital in Fort Collins, Colo., on Thursday. I don't think anybody expect him to pull through. Shepard, who speak Arabic and German, study at a board school in Switzerland before move back to the United States to attend the University of Wyoming, the alma mater of his father, an oil rig safety inspector in Saudi Arabia. Matthew Shepard be bear in Casper, the capital of Wyoming's oil belt, and spend much of his youth there. But six weeks after return to Wyoming and enrol as a freshman here, Shepard fell into a depression, say Ms. Labrie and her husband, Phillip. Accustomed to life in Europe and Denver, this foreign language student who want to become a diplomat found himself live in this isolated city of 27,000 people. Set in a treeless landscape define by barbed wire fences, graze cattle and a busy freight railroad line, Laramie be a town where pickup trucks outnumber sport utility vehicles, where fall entertainment revolve around this Saturday's homecoming football game and the start of the hunting season in the nearby Medicine Bow mountains. Although Wyoming often bills itself as the equality state, in reference to its be the first state to give women the vote, the state legislature have repeatedly vote down hate crime legislation on the grounds that it would give homosexuals special rights. Wyoming be not really gay friendly, Marv Johnson, executive director of the Wyoming chapter of the American Civil Liberties Union, say from Cheyenne. The best way to characterize that be by a comment a legislator make a few years back, when he liken homosexuals to gay bulls as worthless and should be send to the pack plant. Shepard join the campus gay association at the university within days. One of his favorite haunts be the Fireside Bar, which draw a mixed crowd of college students and rodeo cowboys, gays and straights. He definitely wasn't drunk when he come in, recall the bartender, Matt Galloway. He wasn't drunk when he go out. Calvin Rerucha, the county attorney, charge in court documents today that McKinney and Henderson pose as homosexuals and lure Shepard out to McKinney's pickup truck. Beating him inside the truck, the pair drive him one mile southeast to an isolated part of a new rural subdivision, the County Attorney's report charged. There, it said, the men tie their captive to a post-and-rail fence and pistol-whipped him with a .357 magnum while he beg for his life. Relatives say that Shepard also suffer burns on his body. After nearly beat the young man to death, Laramie Police Commander David O'Malley said, the assailants steal his wallet and shoes and leave him tie to the fence. The police commander say that when his officers arrest the two men on Thursday, they find in McKinney's pickup truck a .357 magnum pistol cover with blood and Shepard's shoes and credit card. He say they find Shepard's wallet at McKinney's home. The police commander say that the two women help the two men dump their bloody clothing, and that they report hear the men make anti-gay remarks. Ms. Pasley, a freshman art student at the university, live with Henderson. Ms. Price live with McKinney. The police do not say what the other three do for a living. On Friday, friends and Laramie residents struggle to understand the incident. Shepard, some said, may have felt a false sense of confidence because the local Gay Association complete plans on Tuesday night for Gay Awareness Week 1998. The weeklong series of events starts here Sunday with a local observance of National come Out Day and a lecture on Monday by Leslea Newman, the author of Heather Has Two Mommies, a book about lesbian families. If I be a homosexual in Laramie, I would hang low, very low, say Carla Brown, manager of the Fireside. Openly gay behavior be not only discouraged, it's dangerous. Matthew Wayne Shepard, the gay student who be beat in the dead of night, tie to a fence and leave to die alone, be mourn at his funeral Friday by 1,000 people, include many who have never meet him. Matt believe that if he have make one person's life better, he have succeeded, his cousin, the Rev. Anne Kitch, say in a homily that be carry beyond the packed pew of St. Mark's Episcopal Church, through a filled parish hall, across the street to a packed presbyterian church and across Casper on an AM radio station. judge from the world's response, she said, Matt will have make a difference in the lives of thousands. As the first snowstorm of the fall blanket Casper, fresh flowers fill the red brick church here where Shepard have be baptize as a teen-ager and where he once wear the white robe of an Episcopal acolyte. There be an image that come to mind when I reflect on Matt on that wooden cross rail fence, say the Rev. Royce Brown, the pastor of St. Mark's, in a eulogy. I replace that image with that of another man hang upon a cross. When I concentrate on that man, I can release the bitterness inside. Shepard, a 21-year-old freshman at the University of Wyoming, have dream of work one day for human rights. In death, he have become a national catalyst for a new drive to guarantee for gay people the right to physical safety. His death hit a nerve in the nation this week, elicit dozens of candlelight vigils and rallies for tolerance, several statements of sadness from President Clinton, and a congressional resolution. Thursday, the House of Representatives pass by voice vote a resolution that condemn Shepard's kill as outrageous and that urge each member of Congress and every U.S. citizen to denounce this outrageous murder of another human being. In one of the large rallies, about 1,000 people, include members of Congress of both parties, gather on the steps of the Capitol in Washington to condemn Shepherd's kill and to urge passage of a federal bill that would add extra penalties to crimes motivate by a victim's sexual orientation, gender or disability. House Minority Leader Dick Gephardt urge passage of the bill, lead the crowd in a chant of Now! Now! Now. We will never forget the love that the world have share with this kind, love son, say Shepherd's father, Dennis, his father, outside Casper City Hall, as his mother, Judy, stand by, weeping.

As the first snowstorm of the fall blanket Casper, fresh flowers fill the red brick church here where Shepard have be baptize as a teen-ager and where he once wear the white robe of an Episcopal acolyte. There be an image that come to mind when I reflect on Matt on that wooden cross rail fence, say the Rev. Royce Brown, the pastor of St. Mark's, in a eulogy. I replace that image with that of another man hang upon a cross. When I concentrate on that man, I can release the bitterness inside. Shepard, a 21-year-old freshman at the University of Wyoming, have dream of work one day for human rights. In death, he have become a national catalyst for a new drive to guarantee for gay people the right to physical safety. His death hit a nerve in the nation this week, elicit dozens of candlelight vigils and rallies for tolerance, several statements of sadness from President Clinton, and a congressional resolution.

But I guess God want his parents to be with him. At first, the passing bicyclist think the crumpled form lash to a ranch fence be a scarecrow. But when he stopped, he find the burned, batter and nearly lifeless body of Matthew Shepard, an openly gay college student who have be tie to the fence 18 hours earlier. On Friday, the 22-year-old University of Wyoming student be in a coma in critical condition. At Albany County courthouse here, Russell Henderson, 21, and Aaron McKinney, 22, be arraign on charges of kidnapping, aggravate robbery and attempt first-degree murder. Two women describe as friends of the men, Kristen Leann Price, 18, and Chastity Vera Pasley, 20, have be charge as accessories after the fact to attempt first-degree murder. Shepard's friends say that he do not know his alleged tormentors. Laramie police say the primary motive be robbery, although court papers file Friday indicate Shepard's homosexuality may also have be a factor. Shepard's friends call the attack a hate crime. He be very open about his sexuality, Tina LaBrie, an anthropology student here, say of her friend. I admire him for that because it be very courageous to be yourself even when others disagree. A few hours before he be beaten, Shepard, a slight 5-foot, 2-inch man who wear braces on his teeth, have attend a meeting of the Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgendered Association, say Walter Boulden, a friend of Shepard's. He be sit at the bar, have a beer, when two men come up and talk to him, Boulden, a 46-year-old university lecturer of social work here, say today between tears. He indicate he be gay, and they say they be gay, too. Now, he be in a coma, continue Boulden, who visit his friend at a hospital in Fort Collins, Colo., on Thursday. I don't think anybody expect him to pull through. Shepard, who speak Arabic and German, study at a board school in Switzerland before move back to the United States to attend the University of Wyoming, the alma mater of his father, an oil rig safety inspector in Saudi Arabia. Matthew Shepard be bear in Casper, the capital of Wyoming's oil belt, and spend much of his youth there. But six weeks after return to Wyoming and enrol as a freshman here, Shepard fell into a depression, say Ms. Labrie and her husband, Phillip. Accustomed to life in Europe and Denver, this foreign language student who want to become a diplomat found himself live in this isolated city of 27,000 people. Set in a treeless landscape define by barbed wire fences, graze cattle and a busy freight railroad line, Laramie be a town where pickup trucks outnumber sport utility vehicles, where fall entertainment revolve around this Saturday's homecoming football game and the start of the hunting season in the nearby Medicine Bow mountains. Although Wyoming often bills itself as the equality state, in reference to its be the first state to give women the vote, the state legislature have repeatedly vote down hate crime legislation on the grounds that it would give homosexuals special rights. Wyoming be not really gay friendly, Marv Johnson, executive director of the Wyoming chapter of the American Civil Liberties Union, say from Cheyenne. The best way to characterize that be by a comment a legislator make a few years back, when he liken homosexuals to gay bulls as worthless and should be send to the pack plant. Shepard join the campus gay association at the university within days. One of his favorite haunts be the Fireside Bar, which draw a mixed crowd of college students and rodeo cowboys, gays and straights. He definitely wasn't drunk when he come in, recall the bartender, Matt Galloway. He wasn't drunk when he go out. Calvin Rerucha, the county attorney, charge in court documents today that McKinney and Henderson pose as homosexuals and lure Shepard out to McKinney's pickup truck just after midnight early Wednesday. Beating him inside the truck, the pair drive him one mile southeast to an isolated part of a new rural subdivision, the County Attorney's report charged. There, it said, the men tie their captive to a post-and-rail fence and pistol-whipped him with a .357 magnum while he beg for his life. Relatives say that Shepard also suffer burns on his body. After nearly beat the young man to death, Laramie Police Commander David O'Malley said, the assailants steal his wallet and shoes and leave him tie to the fence. The police commander say that when his officers arrest the two men on Thursday, they find in McKinney's pickup truck a .357 magnum pistol cover with blood and Shepard's shoes and credit card. He say they find Shepard's wallet at McKinney's home. The police commander say that the two women help the two men dump their bloody clothing, and that they report hear the men make anti-gay remarks. Ms. Pasley, a freshman art student at the university, live with Henderson. Ms. Price live with McKinney. The police do not say what the other three do for a living. On Friday, friends and Laramie residents struggle to understand the incident. Shepard, some said, may have felt a false sense of confidence because the local Gay Association complete plans on Tuesday night for Gay Awareness Week 1998. The weeklong series of events starts here Sunday with a local observance of National come Out Day and a lecture on Monday by Leslea Newman, the author of Heather Has Two Mommies, a book about lesbian families. If I be a homosexual in Laramie, I would hang low, very low, say Carla Brown, manager of the Fireside. Openly gay behavior be not only discouraged, it's dangerous. Matthew Shepard, the gay college student who be kidnap and severely beaten, die here Monday, five days after he be find unconscious on a Wyoming ranch where he have be leave tie to a fence for 18 hours in near-freezing temperatures. His death, announce at Poudre Valley Hospital here, fan the outrage that follow word of last week's attack, spawn nationwide vigils, produce a call for federal hate-crimes legislation from President Clinton and fuel debates over such laws in a host of western states, include Wyoming, that have resist them. From Denver to the University of Maryland, people turn out to honor the The slight, soft-spoken 21-year-old Shepard, a freshman at the University of Wyoming, who become an overnight symbol of anti-gay violence after he be find dangle from the fence by a passerby. Russell Anderson, 21, and Aaron McKinney, 21, be charge with attempted murder and be expect to face first-degree murder charges that could bring the death penalty. Their girlfriends, Chastity Pasley, 21, and Kristen Price, 18, be charge as accessories. In Denver, mourners write messages on a graffiti wall as part of national Gay Awareness Week. In San Francisco, a giant rainbow flag that symbolize the gay rights movement be lower to half-staff in the Castro district. There be incredible symbolism about be tie to a fence, say Rebecca Isaacs, political director of the National Gay and Lesbian Task Force in Washington. People have liken it to a scarecrow. But it sound more like a crucifixion. Police in Laramie, Wyo., where the beating take place, have say they believe robbery be the primary motive for the attack against Shepard, which occur outside a bar in the town of 27,000. But investigators also say Shepard's sexuality may have be a factor. Police say Henderson and McKinney lure Shepard from the bar by say they too be gay and one of their girlfriends say Shepard have embarassed one of the men by make a pas at him. Monday, police say that after leave Shepard tie to the fence, the men return to Laramie and pick a fight on a street corner with two hispanic men, Emiliano Morales, 19, and Jeremy Herrera, 18. McKinney and Morales suffer head injuries in the brawl; McKinney be arrest when he seek treatment at the same hospital where Shepard died. Gay leaders hope and christian conservatives fear that Shepard's death will galvanize Congress and state legislatures to pass hate-crime legislation or broaden exist laws. Conservatives generally oppose such laws because they favor one group's rights over another. In the last two decades, 21 states and the District of Columbia have pass laws that increase penalties for crimes that be commit because of a person's race, religion, color, national origin, and sexual orientation. Another 19 states, include Colorado, do not include sexual orientation in their hate-crime laws. Ten states, include Wyoming, have no hate-crime laws at all. In Washington, Clinton respond to news of Shepard's death by urge Congress to pass the federal Hate Crimes Protection Act, which would make federal offenses of crimes base on sex, disability and sexual orientation. Wyoming have be one of the nation's holdouts, reject three hate crimes bills since 1994, most recently in February. But Monday, after Shepard's death, Gov. Jim Geringer appeal to lawmakers to reconsider their opposition. I ask for a collective suggestion for anti-bias, anti-hate legislation that can be present to the Wyoming Legislature for their consideration in January, Geringer said. The governor meet Monday morning with Dennis Shepard, the slain student's father, and say that the elder Shepard do not want his son's death to become a media circus and that we should not use Matt to further an agenda. Geringer say that Shepard's father also said: Don't rush into just pass all kinds of new hate-crimes laws. Be very careful of any changes and be sure you're not take away rights of others in the process to race to this. Leaders of gay rights groups interview Monday say they would respect the family's privacy by not attend the burial in Casper, Wyo., on Saturday. But they add that they hop the death would have an impact on legislators around the nation. Matthew's death, I hope, will bring about a good and deep understanding of hate crime laws, say Elizabeth Birch, executive director of the Human Rights Campaign, a lesbian and gay rights group that have 250,000 members. Matthew's death may lead to an awakening in Wyoming and in the United States Congress as the need for this legislation. In 1996, 21 men and women be kill in the United States because of their sexual orientation, accord to the Southern Poverty Law Center, an Alabama group that track violence against minorities. accord to the FBI, sexual orientation be a factor in 11.6 percent of the 8,759 hate crimes record in 1996. But Christian conservatives warn that gay leaders want to use Shepard's death to expand hate rights laws and to curtail freedom of speech. Hate crimes laws have nothing to do with perpetrators of violent crime and everything to do with silence political opposition, say Steven Schwalm, an analyst with the Family Research Council, a Washington group dedicate to defend faith, family and freedom. It would criminalize pro-family beliefs, Schwalm said. This basically send a message that you can't disagree with the political message of homosexual activists. Agreement come from John Paulk, who be feature this summer in a series of advertisements about how he and his wife, Anne, overcame homosexuality through religious conversion. We have every right to speak out against an agenda that be contrary to Biblical norms, say Paulk, who describe himself as a homosexuality specialist for Focus on the Family, a Christian group in Colorado Springs, Colo. Because we be stand up and oppose the homosexual agenda, we be be look upon as advocate violence against homosexuals, when we categorically reject violence against homosexuals. last Thursday, the Family Research Council unveil a series of television advertisements that preach the healing of homosexuality through religious conversion. Gay leaders charge that these advertisements help create a hostile climate for homosexuals, a climate that can lead to violence. Hate crime laws that be on the books in 40 states have not impinge on freedom of speech, say Brian Levin, a criminal justice professor who direct the Center on Hate and Extremism at Stockton College, in Pomona, N.J. Instead, he said, hate crime laws send a clear message that society do not tolerate attacks on minorities. We want to deter the broken windows and simple assaults before they escalate, he said. refer to murders of homosexuals, he added: These crimes be preventable. Offenders get embolden if they be not punish the first time. Levin say that his research indicate that homosexuals suffer high rates of violent crime than the population at large. He also say that roughly half of the people who attack homosexuals be male, age 22 or younger. With other crimes, violence be a mean to an end. With hate crimes, the violence become an unstoppable goal, Levin said. Shepard suffer a dozen cuts around the head, face and neck, as well as a massive blow to the back of his skull. Because their social stature in society, gays be often view as appropriate targets, Levin added. cite the need for hate crime laws to send a clear message to gay bashers, Levin said: The discourse in society leave many of these people to believe that what they be do be socially acceptable. While some gay leaders saw crucifixion imagery in Shepard's death, others saw a different symbolism: the Old West practice of nail a dead coyote to a ranch fence as a warning to future intruders. This University of Wyoming student be beat and leave to die, tie to a fence like an animal because he be honest and open about be gay, Beatrice Dorhn, legal director of the Lambda Legal Defense and Education Fund, say Monday, Matthew Shepard's horrible suffering and death cannot be dismiss simply as the fault of deranged, isolate individuals. His attackers be among millions of Americans who constantly hear the message that gay people be not worthy of the most basic equal treatment, Ms. Dorhn said. Matthew Wayne Shepard, the gay student who be beat in the dead of night, tie to a fence and leave to die alone, be mourn at his funeral Friday by 1,000 people, include many who have never meet him. Matt believe that if he have make one person's life better, he have succeeded, his cousin, the Rev.

1009,"parliament convene Thursday to vote on whether to move toward a no-confidence motion that could bring down the government over an organize crime scandal. Thursday's vote to put the motion on the agenda will be an indication of the government's chances of survival, which be say to be extremely slim. If approved, the legislature will debate the motions on Monday and hold the no-confidence vote Wednesday. The opposition accuse Prime Minister Mesut Yilmaz of have ties to organize crime and tamper with the privatization of a state bank. He deny the charges. oust the government from power will open the way for the struggle against gangs, say Lutfu Esengun, a deputy from the Islamic Virtue Party, which present one of the three no-confidence motions to parliament. On Wednesday, 6th graf pvs After fail to bring together political rivals in a coalition, premier-designate Bulent Ecevit announce Saturday that he be return his mandate to the turkish president. In a statement report by the Anatolia news agency, Ecevit say he would see President Suleyman Demirel Monday morning. Ecevit, a veteran leftist, be call on to form a cabinet over two weeks ago after Mesut Yilmaz' coalition government collapse in a no-confidence vote in Parliament. Deputies accuse Yilmaz, who have since be serve as act premier, of entertain ties with the mob and tamper with the sale of a state bank. refuse any alliance with the pro-islamic Virtue Party, Turkey's large party in Parliament, Ecevit be unable to create a political alliance strong enough to survive a confidence vote in the deeply divide legislature. Ecevit try in vain to form a coalition government with two rival center-right wing parties -- one lead by Yilmaz, the other by former Prime Minister Tansu Ciller. Ecevut's alternate efforts to make a minority coalition with outside backing for his democratic Left Party from Parliament also failed. Demirel will now have to either ask someone else to try to form a government or wait until Jan. 10, when the constitution allow him to appoint a caretaker cabinet to lead the country to parliamentary elections, now schedule for April. Such a cabinet would not have to face a confidence vote. Or Demirel could choose to leave the current caretaker government, head by Yilmaz, in power until the elections. Bulent Ecevit, who be ask to form a new government Wednesday, be a former prime minister best remember for order an invasion of Cyprus in 1974 that make him an overnight hero at home. The invasion, after a short-lived coup by supporters of union with Greece, have lead to the division of the island. Throughout the years, Ecevit, 73, have remain a strong defender of the cause of the turkish Cypriots As long as Turkey lives, we won't allow the oppression and subordination of turkish Cypriots at the hands of greek Cypriots, he say in July 1997 during the 23rd anniversary celebrations of the invasion. Ecevit, who be prime minister three times since 1974, have over the years shed some of the socialist idealism he be know for in the 70s. During his tenure as deputy prime minister in a 17-month government that be topple last week over a corruption scandal, he give his backing to the liberal policies of the center-right-led coalition. He often say he be carry out a duty to bring a stable government and spare Turkey from crisis - a reference to tensions between a previous islamic-led government and the secular military. Though never a Marxist, Ecevit be in his early years view with suspicion by big business for espouse socialism base on heavy government social benefits and a strong role for the state sector in the economy. Recently, however, he have help the government keep on good terms with the IMF, which order a strict curb on public spending, and approve a number of state sell-offs. Under his leadership in the 70's, ties with the United States be tense. He have also express concern over a u.s.-led multinational force base in Turkey that monitor a no-fly zone over Kurdish-controlled northern Iraq. He argue it it be help create a kurdish state. His frequent visits to Iraq to meet with President Saddam Hussein have in turn raise suspicion in Washington. Despite a short alliance with an Islamic party in 1974, he be a staunch defender of Turkey's secular traditions and push for a crackdown on Islamic radicalism. Ecevit be bear in Istanbul in 1925, to an intellectual family and studied literature at a prestigious American-run high school. He have take some courses at Harvard University. A former journalist, he enter politics in 1957, rise to the leadership of the Republican People's Party in 1972, become prime minister in 1974, briefly in 1977 and again in 1978-79. He be bar from politics in the years that follow a 1980 military coup. He be imprison three times for carry on with political activities despite the ban, mainly through his wife of 51 years, Rahsan, who form the democratic Left Party in 1985 and lead it until a democratic reform in 1987 allow Ecevit back into politics. In corruption-tainted turkish politics, he remain know as the leader with the clean slate. not even his alliance with Yilmaz who be oust for alleged ties to the mob and rig the privatization of a bank, tarnish his image. The chances for a new, strictly secular government in Turkey fade Wednesday when a potential coalition partner insist on give the Islamic party a share of power. The military, self-appointed guardians of Turkey's secular system, be adamantly oppose to the inclusion of Islamic Virtue, the large party in parliament. Premier-designate Bulent Ecevit need Turkey's two-center right parties to hammer together a secular coalition, but Tansu Ciller, the ex-premier who command 99 votes in parliament, rebuff him Wednesday. Ecevit already have the support of her arch-rival, outgoing Premier Mesut Yilmaz, head of the other center-right party. But Mrs. Ciller say Wednesday she would not join forces with Yilmaz, whose government collapse Nov. 25 over a mafia scandal. Instead, she reiterate her demand for a government that would include Virtue. We do not oppose Mr. Ecevit's premiership. We will support him, but only if all parties represent in Parliament be included, Mrs. Ciller said. It be not clear what Ecevit's next move would be. He might try to form a fragile minority coalition. He might also admit defeat and return the task of form the government to President Suleyman Demirel. Demirel could then choose any member of parliament to head the government until elections in April. ANKARA, Turkey (AP) - Prime Minister Mesut Yilmaz on Wednesday face intense pressure to step down after allegations that he interfere in a privatization contract and help a businessman link to a mobster secure loans. Deniz Baykal, leader of the center-left Republican party whose backing in parliament help Yilmaz's minority government, say he would withdraw his support unless the premier resign immediately. Two opposition parties threaten to press for a motion to censure the government. The allegations be make by businessman Korkmaz Yigit, who claim that Yilmaz and Gunes Taner, the economy minister, have encourage him to buy the state-run bank Turkbank, offer him loans from other state banks to ensure that his offer be the high bid. yigit's allegations be carry Tuesday night on two of his tv channels which show a videotape he have make to explain his version of the story before his detention Monday evening for question about the bidding. Yigit buy the bank at a public auction in August for dlrs 600 million. The government suspend the privatization last month after a lawmaker release an audio tape of a conversation supposedly between Yigit and mobster Alaattin Cakici. On that early tape, Cakici be hear assure yigit that he will fend off rival bidders. It be not clear who make the tape, which get into the hands of an opposition deputy. Yigit claim Yilmaz and Taner be aware of Cakici's involvement in the bidding for the bank but urge him nevertheless to go ahead with the bidding. Yilmaz have say that an intelligence report reveal Yigit's ties with Cakici only reach him after Yigit win the tender. Yigit say the premier have also encourage him to buy mass-circulation national newspaper Milliyet, apparently to ensure the paper's backing to his center-right Motherland party in elections next year. Milliyet's sale to Yigit be cancel after the scandal. Cakici be arrest in France in August. Turkey have request his extradition. last month State Minister Eyup Asik resign after allegations he have be in close contact with Cakici. Turkey's late premier-designate get the backing of two key secular parties Monday in his efforts to form a broad-based, coalition government, on condition that his government stick to Turkey's secular principles. The islamic-oriented Virtue Party, however, withheld immediate support for Yalim Erez. News reports say Virtue be hold out for a number of Cabinet seats that reflect its standing as the large party in parliament. We be neither say `yes' nor say `no' at this point, Virtue leader Recai Kutan said. Erez deny that the two have discuss Cabinet posts. Erez, an independent lawmaker, be try to form a coalition government that would include Cabinet members from several parties, include Virtue. The coalition would run the country only until parliamentary elections set for April. Erez take over efforts to form a government last week after veteran leftist Bulent Ecevit give up, unable to convince Turkey's bicker center-left and center-right parties to join him in a coalition that exclude the islamic-oriented party. Erez open talks with various party leaders on Monday. He get support from center-right leader Mesut Yilmaz, who say his party support Erez as long as he have Ecevit's backing. as long as our sensitivity toward the secular, democratic regime be take into account, we will do our best to help form the new government and ensure it get a vote of confidence, Ecevit say after his own talks with Erez. Turkey's strongly secular military be oppose to any deal that would bring Virtue to power. It pressured Virtue's predecessor, the Welfare Party, out of power last year. Erez be suppose to talk Tuesday to center-right Tansu Ciller and to Deniz Baykal, who lead a center-left party. I be more and more optimistic after every meeting, Erez tell reporters after meet with the party leaders. Turkey have be try to form a new government since a coalition government lead by Yilmaz collapse last month over allegations that he rig the sale of a bank. Yilmaz be now act premier. A week after the turkish government fell in a corruption scandal, President Suleyman Demirel on Wednesday ask a veteran left-wing politician know for his personal honesty, Bulent Ecevit, to form a new government. Ecevit, who serve as prime minister three times in the 1970s, say he would immediately begin work to fashion a government that could command a majority in the faction-ridden Parliament. He also suggest that although Parliament have set April 18 as the date for a new election, he might seek to remain in power for a long period. It be wrong to see this government as simply an election government, he said. There be problems that will not wait until an election. military commanders, who hold ultimate power in Turkey, have quietly tell senior political figures, include Demirel, that they do not want a quick election. They fear it will produce a Parliament just as divide as the present one, perhaps with the Islamic-oriented Virtue Party as the large bloc. The commanders be also hop to exclude two of the country's lead politicians, outgo Prime Minister Mesut Yilmaz and former Prime Minister Tansu Ciller, neither of whom they trust, from posts in the new government. Ecevit must now try to build a government that include their center-right parties but not them as individuals. In a meeting this week the country's senior policy-making body, the National Security Council, in which military officers have a strong say, set three priorities for the come months. It say that whatever government emerge from forthcoming negotiations should dedicate itself to fight religious fundamentalism, Kurdish nationalism and criminal gangs that have infiltrate the state apparatus. Among Ecevit's immediate challenges will be to resolve a political crisis with Italy that break out last month when the Kurdish rebel leader Abdullah Ocalan be arrest in Rome and then ask for political asylum there. Turkey want Ocalan send here for trial, but Italy say it cannot extradite him as long as Turkey retain the death penalty. Ecevit (pronounced EH-che-vit) be among the few senior turkish politicians who favor the abolition of capital punishment. together with Demirel, Ecevit be often cite by Turks who complain about the continued dominance of a geriatric political elite here. He be 73 and have be in politics for most of his adult life. early in his career Ecevit emerge as a spokesman for Turkey's downtrodden masses. perhaps more than any other figure, he legitimize social democratic ideology in a climate where leftist sympathies be often consider subversive. At the same time, however, he have show himself to be a fierce nationalist. He be prime minister when Turkey send troops to occupy northern Cyprus in 1974 and be still consider a hard-liner on Cyprus. He be also uncompromising in his opposition to kurdish nationalism. During his terms as prime minister in the 1970s, Ecevit successfully undermine efforts to move Turkey toward membership in the European Union, then call the european Economic Community. He consider it an instrument of capitalist exploitation. Ecevit have also disturb the United States by flirt with anti-western ideologies. In the early 1990s, during an interval when he work as a journalist, he travel to Iraq and write a series of articles favorable to Saddam Hussein. He recently call for good relations between Turkey and Iraq, and maintain some of the anti-imperialist positions and suspicion of capitalism that he develop in the 1960s. The democratic Socialist Party, which Ecevit heads, be a closely hold family fiefdom. He and his wife carefully screen applicants for membership and veto those whose personal loyalty to Ecevit be suspect. During his terms as prime minister in the '70s, Ecevit do not appear to be a consensus builder, say Ilter Turan, a professor of political science at Bilgi University in Istanbul. It seem that nowadays he be more accommodating, so from that perspective he may not be bad choice. On many issues that turkish society be encounter now, he represent an orientation which do not seem to be totally in tune with the times, Turan said. That would include his position on issues like privatization, integrate Turkey more fully into the international system, and the devolution of central authority. He have fail to grasp where the world be heading. He look at and analyze the world in categories that be no longer useful or appropriate. Almost alone among turkish politicians, Ecevit live modestly and have avoid any hint of personal or financial scandal. He speak fluent English, and his reading tastes run to poetry and intellectual journals such as The New York Review of Books. He have translate the works of T.S. Eliot into Turkish and publish several volumes of his own poems. Opposition parties lodge no-confidence motions Wednesday against Prime Minister Mesut Yilmaz after allegations he interfere in the privatization of a bank and help a businessman link to a mobster. Yilmaz' minority government could go down if the the small, center-left Republican Party, which usually give him the majority he need in parliament, votes against him. The leader of the Republicans, Deniz Baykal, urge Yilmaz to resign. But the premier vow Wednesday to stay on, say he be the victim of a conspiracy. This be a plot and it can't be a reason for a resignation, Yilmaz said, add that he intend to continue the struggle against organize crime. Afterward, Baykal say the Republicans would support a no-confidence motion. The leader of the democratic Turkey Party, Husamettin Cindoruk, say his party might withdraw from the govern coalition. He say the party would announce its decision Thursday. The political turmoil send the Istanbul stock market plunge 14.9 percent. Premier-designate Bulent Ecevit say Thursday he would persist in the difficult task of convince a key party leader to join forces in a secular coalition. Ecevit, who be ask to form a new government Wednesday, desperately need the support of the 99 deputies of ex-premier Tansu Ciller's center-right party. Ecevit, a veteran leftist, already have the support of another center-right party lead by Mesut Yilmaz, whose government collapse last week under the weight of a mafia scandal. Mrs. Ciller have not say if she would back an ecevit-led government and her long-standing rivalry with Yilmaz make Ecevit's job of coalition-building difficult. I don't give up that easily, neither do I lose hope that easily, Ecevit tell his parliamentary group Thursday. Mrs. Ciller could lose grassroot support if she stand in the way of a new government, political columnist Ertugrul Ozkok write Thursday in daily Hurriyet. This could put her at odds with her classic support base. Ecevit be expect to meet with Yilmaz on Thursday, and other party leaders Friday. Turkey's secular parties be under pressure to join forces to keep the Islamic Virtue Party out of power. Virtue be the large party in Parliament, but the all-powerful military be fiercely oppose to an islamic-led government. President Suleyman Demirel appear likely to turn to some widely trust lawmaker to form Turkey's next government, after a veteran politician abandon efforts Monday to persuade bicker political leaders to support him in a pro-secular coalition. Bulent Ecevit of the democratic Left Party fail in a 3-week-old attempt to form a government that could command a majority of votes in Parliament. It be now clear that no party leader can form a government that can win a vote of confidence, former Premier Mesut Yilmaz say after talks with Demirel. We have tell the president that we will not hamper the appointment of a deputy of Parliament. With party leaders unable to overcome differences, the new premier-designate would most probably be affiliate to a party but be trust enough by other parties to follow an independent line. Parliament Speaker Hikmet Cetin have be suggest as a likely candidate. The new appointment would be make within days, Yilmaz tell reporters. Demirel consult Turkey's party leaders immediately after Ecevit give up. Most declare themselves in favor of a government lead by a lawmaker. only center-right leader Tansu Ciller say she want a government lead by a party leader, and make clear she be willing to take on the task. Turkey's parliament be split by longstanding animosity between its center-left and center-right parties. Yilmaz lead the last government, which collapse in November amid allegations he have ties to organize crime and interfere with the sale of a state bank. By tradition, Demirel should then have ask the leader of Parliament's large party to form a new government. But Demirel break with custom to keep the Islamic-oriented Virtue Party from power. Turkey's staunchly secular military oppose the return of an islamic-led government. Modern Turkey have have only one islamic-led government, form after 1995 elections, and the military pressure it from power for fail to stick to the country's secular traditions. Ecevit refuse even to consult with the leader of the Virtue Party during his efforts to form a government. ","Turkish PM Yilmaz was forced to step down due to mob ties and claims of state bank privatization tampering.President Demirel asked highly respected 3-time former PM Bulent Ecevit to form a new majority government.A split between parliament's center left and right is longstanding.Ecevit distrusted Yilmaz and Ciller but brought in Yilmaz's party and wooed Ciller's.She wouldn't join unless Islamic Virtue were included, which the secular parties resisted.After a 3-week effort, Ecevit gave up rather than include Virtue.Yalim Erez tried next and won the backing of 2 key secular parties.He will talk to Ciller and run Turkey until the April 18 election.","Following charges that he interfered in a privatization contract and helped a businessman with mob ties, Turkish Prime Minister Mesut Yilmaz was forced to resign.President Demeril asked Bulent Ecevit, former three-time prime minister from the 1970s and champion of Turkish Cypriot rights, to form a new government.After three weeks, Ecevit was unable to secure the support of the Center-Right Party.At issue was the participation of the Islamic Virtue Part in the secular government, Ecevit returned his mandate and Demeril named Valim Erez as prime minister designate.Erez was in talks with the Virtue Party over possible cabinet seats.","Turkey's Prime Minister Yilmaz was ousted by a no-confidence vote in Parliament over allegations of interfering in a bank privatization and having mob ties.Ecevit, a former prime minister, was asked to form a new government.He was unable to win the support of Ciller for a secular coalition.Refusing any alliance with the Islamic Virtue Party, Ecevit turned to President Demirel to find another solution.Demirel was expected to turn to a widely trusted lawmaker to form Turkey's next government.New premier-designate Erez got backing from 2 key secular parties as he tried to form a broad-based secular coalition that would include some from the Virtue Party.","For more than a month, Turkish politicians have been trying to form a new government.The last prime minister was voted out after charges of corruption and mob ties.Longtime politician and three-time prime minister, Ecevit, tried for two weeks to form a coalition, which would satisfy the staunchly secular military.He failed when he could not get the support of both center-right parties.The president then asked a member of Parliament to form an interim coalition government to serve until the April election.Erez attained center-right support if he sticks to secular principles, but he may be forced to give some Cabinet seats to the Islamic Virtue Party."
1013,"James Kopp, the man the FBI be seek as a material witness in the sniper slaying of Dr. Barnett Slepian, be know to abortion rights leaders as an aggressive anti-abortion protester, and law enforcement officials say he have be arrest several times in demonstrations at abortion clinics. The portrait that emerge of Kopp, 44, from police records, studies by researchers on right-wing movements, newspaper accounts of protests, and abortion rights advocates, be that of an itinerant protester, move about the country in a series of increasingly abrasive protests at abortion clinics. Federal law enforcement officials say he be not currently a suspect in the slepian shooting, and there be no indication Wednesday that he have be arrest for any violent acts. At several abortion protests, he be charge with trespass or resist arrest, accord to news accounts. One of his arrests be in Atlanta during Operation Rescue's huge anti-abortion protests there in 1988. While he be in an Atlanta jail, Kopp be give the nickname Atomic Dog, which investigators contend link him to the violent fringe of the anti-abortion movement, responsible for a series of bombings and arsons and seven murders of abortion providers like Slepian over the last five years. Responsibility for some of the violence like the bombing of an abortion clinic in Birmingham, Ala., earlier this year, in which an off-duty policeman be kill have be claim in notes sign by a shadowy Army of God. An underground manual issue in the name of the Army of God, which describe methods for attack abortion clinics, include how to make homemade C-4 plastic explosives, begin with a tribute, by nickname, of a clandestine band pledge to stop abortions. The first name under this special Thanks section be Atomic Dog. The Atlanta police, after search the hundreds of arrest records of the protesters from the summer of 1988, confirmed Wednesday night that the date of birth and Social Security number of the James Kopp arrest then match those give out Wednesday by the FBI task force in Buffalo investigate the murder of Slepian, who be gun down through the window if his home in suburban Amherst on Oct. 23. At the nondescript frame house in St. Albans, Vt., that the FBI give as Kopp's last know address, the current resident, who give his name only as E. Kenny, 20, a shipping clerk, remember Kopp well. He live there for part of 1990 as the guest of Kenny's parents, who be active in the anti-abortion movement, among a group of protesters who try to shut down two abortion clinics in Burlington in stubborn demonstrations that year. Kenny remember Kopp as a really nice guy, who do chores around the place but pay no rent to the parents. He sometimes make wooden toys or play video games with Kenny, then a child. But the focus of his life be the anti-abortion movement, Kenny recalled. He be know among these people as Atomic Dog. It wasn't like a name that he have to go to the store or something. But if you know anything about him, that's what you call him. roughly 95 people be arrest during the protests, accord to newspaper accounts at the time. There be many, many arrests, recall Allie Stickney, the president of Planned Parenthood of Northern New England. It be very big for Vermont. There be Kryptonite locks and leaflets from the Army of God and the Lambs of Christ. It be clearly a highly organize blockade. accord to newspaper accounts, Kopp be arrest outside a clinic in Levittown, Long Island, in 1991. The protests in Atlanta in 1998 appear to be a turning point for a hard-core group of protesters. The Atlanta police crack down hard and cart hundreds of demonstrators off to an isolated prison dormitory the call the farm. Operation Rescue have mount a series of blockades to close down abortion clinics in New York and Philadelphia that spring. Atlanta be their high point, but in the face of the tough arrest policy, the movement faltered, split apart and stalled. It be a traumatic, life-changing experience, say Frederick Clarkson, author of Eternal Hostility, a book on the anti-abortion movement, add that by 1993 with the shooting of Dr. David Gunn, an abortion provider in Florida, some of those in the Atlanta jail become the nucleus of a group sign a justifiable homicide statement that declare that the use of force be warrant to defend the life of an unborn child. On the eve of a holiday that have be link to antiabortion violence, the authorities on Tuesday be investigate whether a picture of an aborted fetus send to a canadian newspaper be connect to last month's fatal shooting of a Buffalo, N.Y. doctor who provide abortions or four similar attacks in western New York and Canada since 1994. The newspaper, the Hamilton (Ontario) Spectator, have receive five similar packages in the last year, some contain veiled threats and several deliver by a man who employees say resemble James Charles Kopp, who be want for question as a witness about the Oct. 23 slaying of Dr. Barnett Slepian. Five days after the shooting, the Spectator receive a package contain an antiabortion flier with biographical information about Slepian, include a photograph of him that have be cross out. It certainly cause us to be more interested than ever in speak to Kopp, say Inspector Keith McKaskill of the Winnipeg Police Department, a spokesman for the canada-united States task force investigate the five shootings. even as they search for Kopp, federal officials be also look into three letters that be receive Monday by Catholic and antiabortion organizations in Buffalo, Indianapolis and Chicago. Those letters, say they contain the deadly anthrax bacteria, come 10 days after eight similar threats to clinics that provide abortions. All the letters appear to be hoaxes, and it remain unclear whether they be connect to any of the five shootings. Kopp be not a suspect in the shootings. An itinerant antiabortion activist whose last known address be in Vermont, he be the subject of warrants on both sides of the border. In Canada, he be suspect of administrative violations of immigration law; in the United States, he be want as a material witness in the slepian case. Federal authorities investigate the murder of a buffalo-area obstetrician who perform abortions have identify a Vermont man as a material witness to the sniper attack last month and issue a warrant for his arrest Wednesday to bring him in for questioning. The man be identify as James Charles Kopp, 44, whose last known address be in St. Albans, Vt. His whereabouts be not known, investigators said. Investigators say Kopp's car be see near the Amherst, N.Y., home of Dr. Barnett Slepian in the weeks before the doctor, whose work at an abortion clinic have long make him a target of harassment, be killed. Kopp, accord to police records and abortion rights groups, have often move about the country in a series of protests at abortion clinics, and have be link to an underground manual that describe methods of kill or maim doctors who perform abortions. Denise O'Donnell, the U.S. attorney for the western district of New York, say Kopp be not consider a suspect at this time but be believe to have information material to the case. She decline to give details on what evidence be be seek from Kopp, describe it only as information that be contain in a sealed affidavit whose disclosure would compromise the ongoing investigation. Ms. O'Donnell say that federal law allow for an arrest warrant for a material witness when a person have information that be important to a case. If Kopp be found, he would be arrested, bring to Buffalo and order to provide the required evidence, Ms. O'Donnell said. Then, most likely, the individual would be released. Slepian, 52, be shoot by a sniper firing from outside his home on Oct. 23, shortly after return from an evening service at his synagogue. He be stand in his kitchen with his wife and one of his four sons when the bullet crash through a back window. He die two hours later. Law enforcement officials say Wednesday's announcement of the material witness warrant be in part an attempt to underscore the potential danger of anti-abortion violence in advance of Remembrance Day, a canadian holiday that fall on Nov. 11 and that the authorities have associate with some anti-abortion crimes. At the same time, the Justice Department and the FBI be try to find ways to step up the federal response to violence at abortion clinics in the aftermath of the slepian killing. The officials say that Attorney General Janet Reno would soon announce that the Justice Department, aim to heighten the visibility of the federal role in cases that cross state and local jurisdictional boundaries, would revive a national investigative effort focus on abortion clinic violence. Ms. Reno and senior FBI officials, include Robert Bryant, the deputy FBI director, have meet with physician and abortion rights groups in recent days to discuss ways to enhance federal investigative efforts and coordination with local agencies. Federal authorities first organize an abortion clinic task force in 1995 after the killing of a Florida doctor. The unit, which be charge with investigate whether a national conspiracy existed, spend nearly two years study abortion clinic violence. The unit disband without uncover a national conspiracy. Law enforcement officials say that the unit's operation do help reduce violence at abortion clinics and that, in part, the decision to re-establish it be prompt by Ms. Reno's desire to send a renew message to anti-abortion extremists that the government would aggressively investigate these crimes. Slepian's murder fit the pattern of four early sniper attacks on abortion doctors in Canada and western New York, date from 1994. none of the attacks have be solved. Bernard Tolbert, special agent in charge of the FBI in Buffalo, say at a news conference here Wednesday that investigators have not determine whether there be a link between the five killings. there's a possibility they could be linked, but certainly no information, he said. Tolbert give little information about the subject of the material-witness warrant, except to say that Kopp's black 1987 Chevrolet Cavalier, with the Vermont license plate BPE216, be see near Slepian's home begin several weeks before the murder. We don't have any idea of where he is, Tolbert say of Kopp. We be look for him every place we can, every place he might be. A photograph of Kopp take in January 1997 have be distribute to law enforcement agencies around the United States and Canada. The National Abortion Federation have send out an advisory to clinics around the country about the search for Kopp, say Melinda DuBois, assistant director of Womenservices, the clinic where slepian worked. She say name Kopp a material witness in the case have not bring relief to the nurses and other workers at the clinic. I don't think it make me or anyone else at the clinic feel differently, she said. I don't want anybody to relax and say, `oh God, they get the guy.' That's easy to happen. I still want people to be very vigilant. The clinic be the last in the Buffalo area that be perform abortions. Slepian be one of only a handful of doctors in Buffalo who be still willing to perform the procedure in the face of pickets, protesters and threats. Since his death, doctors from outside Buffalo have come to the clinic to continue provide abortion services. Rosina Lotempio be stand outside abortion clinics here before Operation Rescue storm into town in 1992 for the rowdy spring of Life rallies, in which hundreds be arrested. She be there before Lambs of Christ demonstrators come to town in 1993. She be on the sidewalk outside Buffalo GYN womenservices the morning of Oct. 23, about 12 hours before Barnett Slepian, the clinic doctor, be fatally shoot in his home. And she be there Friday, brown rosary beads in her hands, a small gold cross on a chain around her neck, quietly pray for abortions to stop. I'm heartbroken when I have to come here, Mrs. Lotempio, 58, say as she stand in the cold, wear small black earmuffs and a white turtleneck adorn with a tiny silver pin of baby feet. It's very difficult out here; I depend on God, she said, after pray for several moments to decide whether to talk to a reporter. The bombings, the fiery rhetoric of abortion opponents and the posters of bloody fetuses may capture the attention of the news media, but people like Mrs. Lotempio be the foot soldiers in the abortion battle. They call themselves street counselors and come to the clinic whenever they believe abortions be be performed. They pray and they talk to women, hop to change their minds. Some scream profanities. Others, like Mrs. Lotempio, denounce not only the violence against doctors and clinics, but also the blocking of doors and the shouting of ugly epithets at clinic workers and patients. For the approximately 80 abortion opponents here, their protest be more like a job than a political activity. There be a schedule. People count on them to show up. Mrs. Lotempio, a mother of three and grandmother of six, connects her involvement to a conversation in the 1970s in which she help a friend decide to abort an unwanted pregnancy. Two decades later, she be haunt by her own question: whether the fetus be male or female. I just felt horrible and I felt guilty, she said, tears in her eyes. I think that if I be at the clinic do something, I could make up for that baby's life. During Mrs. Lotempio's 8 a.m.-to-10 a.m. shift Friday, about a dozen people circle the area in front of the Buffalo clinic, say the Hail Mary. Others take her spot on Tuesdays and Wednesdays. She return on saturdays, when up to 40 people crowd the sidewalk. Similar bands of protesters march in front of abortion clinics throughout the United States, and local protesters be often join by bands of people who roam the country. At the clinic on Main Street, north of downtown Buffalo, there be an odd sense of community. Local protesters greet Dick, the security guard, by name. They sometimes see the enemy abortion-rights volunteers who escort patients in and out of the clinic in the supermarket or on the soccer field. Robert Behn, one of the protest leaders, even spend two hours talk about abortion over breakfast last year with Slepian. And several say they cry when they hear of Slepian's death. most of the protesters, include Mrs. Lotempio, be among the thousands of people arrest here in 1992, the height of anti-abortion activity in Buffalo. But if Operation Rescue returns, as planned, for a spring of Life reunion in April, Mrs. Lotempio said, she will not be there. Instead, she plan to stay in church and pray, to avoid the militancy she say she find uncomfortable. Glenn Murray, a lawyer for Womenservices clinic, said: When people from out of town show up, that be when we feel the most danger. The local people be a known quantity. We know most of the local people by name. Buffalo have be among a handful of hot spots for abortion protesters for the last decade. It be a heavily Catholic city where thousands of protesters from around the country demonstrate for two weeks in 1992. They fail to close abortion clinics, but 500 people be arrest in rallies that snarl traffic and draw national headlines. Those rallies, as well as early protests and continue sidewalk vigils, have have an impact, people on both sides of the abortion issue say. The number of clinics perform abortions in the Buffalo area have drop to one from three. And after Slepian's death and the retirement this week of another doctor, there be only two doctors in the area for whom abortions form a significant part of their practices. The daily demonstrators count this as progress. But their perch outside the clinic mean they witness far more of what they believe be murders than what they call rescues. About 30 women a day might go into the clinic. After eight years, Mrs. Lotempio can count eight women who change their minds and do not get abortions while she be at the clinic. Inside the clinic, the protests just make a hard job harder, many clinic workers say. While some demonstrators simply repeat the rosary, other protesters call out to patients as they drive into the parking lot behind the building, or walk up to the fortresslike front. They ask questions like Do you know what your baby look like? or be it a boy or a girl? sometimes they accuse people of murder and torture and sin, or threaten them with damnation. Federal law bars protesters from come within 15 feet of the clinic entrances, and from lean signs against its walls. Some push the limits, frustrate clinic workers and guards. The rules protect people from physical harassment, but because of the distance, they turn what could be quiet conversations into catcalls and taunts. When a patient go into the clinic, the protesters take on a different persona, say Melinda DuBois, director of the Buffalo clinic. They scream and yell and call us names. They lie. Some days we're immune to it, but other days it's just too much. Linda Palm, 51, marching at the clinic on Friday, say she identify with the clinic patients. When she be 23, she said, she struggle with the difficulties of be unmarried and pregnant herself, but decide to have her child, and marry the father. She begin protest in 1990, after attend an abortion protest march in Albany. While veterans and civic leaders devote Wednesday's national holiday to honor fall soldiers, Remembrance Day have become a chilling vigil for Canadians in the front lines of the abortion-rights movement. There be immediate fear, because an anti-abortion gunman be believe to be at large. And there be long-term anxiety, because even in this country where abortions be legal and publicly funded, women may find access diminishing. There be speculation the sniper's timing be link to Remembrance Day because some anti-abortion activists use the day to commemorate aborted fetuses. Three times since 1994, a sniper have use this time of year to fire into the home of a canadian doctor who perform abortion, each time wound the target. The attacks be spread across Canada Ontario, Manitoba and British Columbia. U.S. and canadian investigators now believe those attacks be link to two shootings of abortion-providing doctors in upstate New York, include the Oct. 23 slaying of Dr. Barnett Slepian at his home near Buffalo. An american anti-abortion activist, James Kopp, be want for question about the shootings. Police say they don't know which side of the border he be on, fuel uneasiness at clinics and hospitals throughout Canada. You must realize Canada have the large undefended border in the world, say Keith McCaskill, a police inspector in Winnipeg, Manitoba, and spokesman for the investigation. Many women's clinics have tighten security, and doctors who provide abortions have be urge to take precautions. I would suggest they be extremely aware of their day-to-day goings on, whether during their business day or after hours, say Toronto Detective Rick Stubbings. Across Canada, there have be reports of obstetrician-gynecologists modify their practices or decide to stop performing abortions. Some wear bulletproof vests and hang sheets over windows of their homes. Abortion-rights groups say most doctors be not back down. There's a great deal of sadness, say Susan Fox, director of a clinic in Edmonton, Alberta, that provide abortions. But there's also a feeling of determination that we won't be deter or scar by these actions. Marilyn Wilson, executive director of the Canadian Abortion Rights Action League, see a long-term threat because fear of violence may intimidate young doctors from enter the field. There be almost no doctors who have stop perform these procedures, even under the current reign of terror, she said. But young doctors with families wouldn't necessarily want to do this. They may not be willing to put their lives at risk. The abortion debate be only one of several factors contribute to a shortage of obstetrician-gynecologists in Canada. The national society that oversee the speciality say there be about 1,400 doctors in the field, a shortfall of 600, and most be in their 50s or 60s. The society say long hours and limits on fees pay by the public health-care system be cause burnout and deter medical school graduates as they choose a specialty. Another problem be that few canadian medical schools offer train in abortion. Women in Canada's big cities generally have adequate access to abortions. Those in rural areas often face long journeys, and the province of Prince Edward Island prohibit abortions at its six hospitals, force women there to travel to New Brunswick or Nova Scotia. Abortion-rights groups say the situation would improve if the RU-486 abortion pill be available in Canada. No drug company have apply for permission to market the pill, either fear boycott or doubt its profitability. The government have be urge to make a public appeal to drug companies, but the health department say this can't be done. It would be a conflict of interest, say Bonnie Fox-McIntyre, a department spokeswoman. As a regulator we have to stay at arm's length, so we can judge an application impartially. Abortion be illegal in Canada until 1988. now there be no abortion law of any sort, about 100,000 abortions be perform annually, and polls indicate roughly three-quarters of Canadians favor pro-choice policies. Yet public support doesn't spare doctors from fear. Dr. Henry Morgentaler, who lead efforts to overturn the old abortion law and whose Toronto clinic be bomb in 1993, say he and his colleagues be sacrifice personal freedom as they reluctantly increase security measures. Unfortunately, doctors who be commit to provide these services will have to accept a certain diminishment of their enjoyment of life, he said. In the aftermath of last month's deadly sniper attack on an obstetrician in upstate New York, Attorney General Janet Reno announce last week that she be set up a new investigative unit to examine the possibility that the doctor be the victim of a broad anti-abortion plot. The unit, the National Clinic Violence Task Force, will include a dozen Justice Department lawyers and involve several law-enforcement agencies. But the main work of look into the shooting of Dr. Barnett Slepian in his suburban Buffalo home and how it fit a large pattern of organize violence will be do by the FBI, which have jurisdiction over domestic terrorism. For many in the FBI, that's a problem. In contrast to the old image of gung-ho FBI agents turn their surveillance machinery on political groups, a number of senior FBI agents privately express misgivings about the attorney general's late task force, the second she have order to begin a broad investigation into a conspiracy involve anti-abortion violence. FBI officials fear that expand the investigation could drive the agency over the ill-defined boundary that separate inquiries into criminal activity from those into political causes and unpopular ideas. Today's agents be eager to disassociate themselves from the old J. Edgar Hoover days of trample the civil rights of political dissidents in the guise of serious investigations. They do not want the agency drawn into the middle of the bitter ideological war between anti-abortion groups and abortion rights advocates, who have long assert the existence of an organize campaign against clinics and doctors. Many of those call for government help be once themselves subjects of FBI interest as anti-war and civil rights activists. Senior agency officials, include Director Louis Freeh, be start their careers in the early 1970s and watch in dismay as the FBI be shake by revelations about Cointelpro, the counterintelligence program that allow agents to spy on, burgle, wiretap and infiltrate anti-war and civil rights groups like Students for a democratic society and the Student Nonviolence Coordinating Committee. Some officials be dubious that a conspiracy exist to kill doctors who perform abortions. They come up empty hand when Reno order the first federal inquiry in 1994 after the killing of a Florida doctor and his bodyguard. The Justice Department conduct a two-year grand jury investigation; agents pursue some anti-abortion activists use surveillance teams. But investigators never find a specific plot against abortion clinics and staff members. violence at abortion clinics be only part of the problem. The FBI have in recent years find itself thrown into a minefield of politically ting cases involve the volatile worlds of anti-government militias, environmental and christian extremists, white separatists, animal rights activists and Islamic fundamentalists. The FBI be very quick to jump from investigate crime to investigate political association, say David Cole, a law professor at Georgetown University. When you move from investigate crimes to investigate groups, that all-important nexus to criminal conduct get lost, the focus get broad and broad and you start sweep in all kinds of lawful political activity. In response to terrorist attacks like the bombings of the World Trade Center in 1993, the Oklahoma City federal building in 1995 and the Olympic park in Atlanta in 1996, the agency have increase efforts to deter such incidents in a major prevention program. In such cases, the Justice Department, the FBI and other law enforcement agencies say they operate under domestic security guidelines that require investigators to find a reasonable indication that a group be plan to break the law before they can open an inquiry into an organization. Before the authorities can use such intrusive tactics as wiretapping or property searches, they must have specific evidence. Yet FBI agents throughout the country have quietly evaluate the threat pose by a variety of extremist groups through its links to local authorities and informal interviews with the leaders of some groups. Their conclusion be that most of these groups pose little real danger. much more difficult to investigate be lone terrorists inflame by the oratory of extremist ideology but who belong to no group, drift along society's fray margins, off the grid, as some agents describe it, without the usual ties to family, friends or work. The profile fit Eric Robert Rudolph, the fugitive want for bombings at the Atlanta Olympics, a gay nightclub and two abortion clinics. He have keep his beliefs mostly to himself, although acquaintances hint that he be familiar with religious extremism and hate groups. In contrast, James Charles Kopp, who be be seek as a material witness in the killing of Slepian, leave a trail of clues about his motives. He be an early follower of Randall Terry, a leader of Operation Rescue. Later, Kopp be associate with the Lambs of Christ, an another militant anti-abortion group. One law-enforcement official say that the government should do what it do best. We should investigate violations, he said. We shouldn't investigate groups. everyone who know Dr. Barnett Slepian know that the slight, gray physician endure a measure of stress that would exhaust, even break, most people. There be the strangers who paw through the garbage cans at his home and growled murderer as they pass him in the grocery store aisle. Demonstrators assail his pregnant patients as they arrive at his office for their checkups, call him a baby killer. Outside the clinic where he perform abortions two days a week, pickets shout epithets like pig to his face. Slepian, an obstetrician and gynecologist by train and an abortion doctor by principle, rarely acknowledge the strain. He might crack an occasional joke at the expense of the protesters who shadow him at work and on weekends. then he would do something unexpected, like invite an anti-abortion leader to breakfast or stop and chat with a familiar demonstrator outside the clinic. so when he be kill Oct. 23 by a sniper's bullet fire through the kitchen window of his home in the Buffalo, N.Y., suburbs, a furtive execution that fit a pattern of four early attacks on abortion providers in western New York state and Canada, friends and relatives wonder not so much that Slepian's work could arouse such murderous violence. He have predict as much himself. Instead, they wondered, once again, that he persist in that work, long after other Buffalo doctors have surrender to the pressure of abortion opponents. He be an incredibly fatalistic person who think that if your number's up, it's up, and there be nothing you can do about it, say H. Amanda Robb, the doctor's 32-year-old niece. And he be incredibly stubborn. He say that women have a right to comprehensive health care and since he be a women's doctor, he be go to provide it for them. Slepian be the third doctor to be kill in the last five years in bombings and shootings that have kill 7 people and wound 17 at abortion clinics around the nation. To his tormentors, he be simply an abortion doctor. To members of the abortion rights movement, he be a martyr for their cause. But Slepian be far from either. In interviews with friends and family members, he emerge as more than a one-dimensional abstract a conservative who advocate old-fashioned values like self-reliance, a shy man who have rare flashes of anger, a doctor who perform abortions but have no more patience for women who have multiple abortions than for women who have multiple children they do not want or could not support. He be kill because he perform a medical procedure that have become emotional and politicized. Yet there be nothing in his life to suggest he be a crusader in either politics or medicine. Rather, he be an obstinate, unassuming man who do a remarkable thing. Out of contrariness and out of conscience, say those who know him, he refuse to allow anyone to dictate what kind of doctor he should be, and for that, he pay with his life. The clues to Slepian's flinty brand of commitment lie, in part, in his upbringing. His be a family that take success for grant even as it teeter on the edge of poverty. To earn money for medical school, he shovel muck at a ranch and drive a taxi. He make few friends, but those he have be friends for life. When their wives be sick, he call repeatedly. When they be lonely, he fly to their side. Slepian, who be know as Bart, use to tell people that he choose obstetrics because it be a specialty that expose a doctor to the least suffering, and that he perform abortions because it be legal and the alternatives be so much worse. Slepian often express exasperation over women who come to him for abortion after abortion. Don't they get it? his clinic staff recall him say more than once. He have the same impatience for women like those he remember from his residency in inner-city Buffalo, who have child after child and no means of support. He have the contempt for that of somebody who have pull himself up by his bootstraps and make it in the world, Ms. Robb said. He believe that to ban abortions or, just as shameful in his view, to stop teaching young doctors how to perform them, would not correct the human imperfections that he find so irritating. There be 1.5 million abortions perform in this country, his niece said, and he just felt we're not equip to handle 1.5 million unwanted children. When he be killed, at the age of 52, Bart Slepian own an imposing red brick home in the quiet suburb of Amherst, complete with a swim pool with piped-in music and an assortment of the time-saving gadgets he adored. Slepian's trajectory to that comfortable doctor's life have be unconventional. His grandfather, a russian jewish immigrant who start out sell shoelaces from a pushcart in Boston, propel all five of his sons into Harvard at a time when few Jews meet the university's blue-blood standards. His father, in turn, decreed that his own three sons would be doctors or earn Ph.D's. We grow up in a home where there be tremendous, tremendous, tremendous respect for education, say Serena Robb, Slepian's sister, who be four years old than him. If you get an A, it be ok If you get a B, you get yell at. The family's mean do not match its expectations. Slepian's father, Philip, have join his own father's business manufacture leather soles for shoes. Soon after Bart be bear in 1946 in Boston, the company failed, so to save money, the father move his family of six to his in-laws' apartment in McKeesport, Pa., and then to Rochester, N.Y. Once settled, Slepian's father set himself up as a freelance writer, crisscross the country in his old Studebaker, research the origins of prominent citizens at the Library of Congress and write their stories for small-town newspapers. He sell articles by the hundreds, and be still write until his death nine years ago at the age of 93. The success that be expect of Bart Slepian do not come easily. As a child, he be so shy that he cry when anyone look at him, his sister recalled. An unexceptional student, he go to a local community college before transfer to the University of Denver, where he major in zoology. reject by medical schools in the United States the fate of two out of three applicants in the late 1960s he study one year in Belgium and then enrol at the Autonomous University for Medicine in Guadalajara, Mexico. His friends remember him as funny and obstinate, a thin young man with glasses and a receding hairline who beat all comers at arm-wrestling and pool. Bart have certain beliefs, strongly held, say Richard Schwarz, an old classmate who be an internist on Long Island. He always say you shouldn't sit around whine about things, Schwarz said. He would say, `go after what's yours and what's right.' Bart Slepian's determination surface in quirky ways. He once insist on go to the top of the World Trade Center, despite a crippling fear of heights. To get to the window, he crawled, inch by inch. I said, `you don't have to do this,' recall Schwarz, who be with him at the time. And he said, `I want to do it.' Bart make it count. He felt alive. force to drop out of school every few semesters to work, he live in Reno with his sister Serena, a widow who be struggle to take care of two young daughters. She work as a waitress and a blackjack dealer, share her tips with him while he drive a cab, clean barns at a ranch and work as a laboratory assistant at the local Veterans Administration hospital. After graduation, he move to Buffalo for his medical residency. There he marry Lynne Breitbart, a registered nurse 10 years his junior, and scrap together the money to buy an obstetrics practice from a doctor who be about to retire. He have a soothing, unhurried manner. When a patient of his, Patti Durlak, be diagnose with diabetes, slepian refer her to a specialist but call every few days for months to help her overcome a fear of the needles she have to use for her insulin injections. The other doctor said, `just deal with it,' Mrs. Durlak recalled. not Dr. Slepian. In most ways, he be a typical suburban family man, work six days a week and spend his free time at Little League games and county fairs with his four sons. But by the late 1980s, he and other abortion doctors in Buffalo be under siege. In one notorious 1991 incident record on videotape, the Rev. Paul Schenck, one of the fieriest of Buffalo's anti-abortion leaders, throw himself in front of the doctor's car as he pull into the clinic driveway. Slepian park on the street. As he push his way through the crowd of chant demonstrators, Schenck cup his hands around his mouth and lunged, shouting, Slepian, you pig! slepian's attempts to separate the abortion conflict from his private life be futile. The protests follow him home and the man who have be so bashful as a boy find himself, uncomfortably, at the center of controversy and attention. Once, he show his anger. In 1988, when demonstrators jeer at him from the sidewalk in front of his home as he open Hanukkah presents with his children, the doctor come out brandish a baseball bat. He deny he hurt anyone, but a town judge order him to repair one protester's smash van window and pay a portion of another's medical bills. The outburst surprise his family and friends. It be not Slepian's style to make a public fuss, much less acknowledge the stress of be taunt by protesters. Stress? his old brother Paul respond gruffly when ask about the doctor's mood. I never hear the word use in my family, except as an engineering term. He say it be a nuisance. Mrs. Slepian do not respond to requests for an interview. She express rage to The Buffalo News shortly after the shooting. She say that whoever have kill her husband deserve the death penalty and that she would be happy to administer the lethal injection herself. She also speak out after Schenck's brother, Robert, another anti-abortion leader who frequently confront Slepian, send a bouquet of flowers. Mrs. Slepian denounce him as a hypocrite. After the confrontation in 1988, slepian turn to civil harassment lawsuits, letters and levity to deal with the protesters. In 1993, when a man active in the anti-abortion effort be arrest for rifle through the doctor's garbage cans at home, Slepian try to treat the incident lightly. They hopefully get the bags full of dirty diapers, he joked. He try to engage his critics through the local newspaper. He tell The Buffalo News that abortion protesters should turn their energies to help women avoid unwanted pregnancies through birth control and counseling. In a letter to the editor he warn that by repeatedly call him a murderer, his critics be incite violence. Slepian accept that opponents of abortion act out of moral conviction, his friends said, but resent the personal attacks. He think it tend to demonize and dehumanize him and increase the danger, say his lawyer, Glenn Edward Murray. So slepian take a step that few of the nation's beleaguer abortion clinic doctors dared. He insist that if he try hard enough, he might cut through the venom. To the dismay of the staff members who fear for his safety, Slepian begin about a year ago to stop and chat with protesters he recognize outside the Womenservices abortion clinic in Buffalo, where he work two days a week. He surprise a gathering of protesters who be prepare for what they euphemistically call a house call, or demonstration at the doctor's home, and invite the protest's organizer, the Rev. Robert Behn, to breakfast. Their hourlong conversation the next morning be inconclusive, Behn said, dismiss Slepian's gesture as an attempt to get people to like him. He ask slepian how performing abortions affect him spiritually. In response, he recalled, the doctor said, I'm fine spiritually. Slepian, meanwhile, focus more on time away from home with his family. He plan to take a cruise next spring. He buy a time-share apartment near Disney World in Florida. He have so many plans, say Ellen Fink, a close friend of the couple for 15 years. He wasn't done. He wasn't do live yet. Still, sometimes during the most casual conversations, a shadow would appear. When his wife give him a gray african parrot for a birthday gift, Slepian joke that the bird would probably outlive him so he would teach it his eulogy. He would talk about the funeral he wanted, Mrs. Fink said. He say he didn't have a lot of friends and want all of them to come in separate cars, one in each car, so he'd have a long procession. In the week before his death, Slepian have reasons to be preoccupy with thoughts of mortality. A medical checkup have reveal a blockage of his heart, Mrs. Fink said, recount a conversation with Mrs. Slepian the day of the slaying. A blockage be a sign of probable coronary artery disease. He be to have more tests the following week. I said, `lynne, just relax, it's go to be OK,' Mrs. Fink recalled. That same day, the National Abortion Federation send a fax to the Womenservices clinic warning of a pattern of sniper attacks on abortion doctors that occur in early November. Marilynne Buckham, the clinic director, send it to Slepian. He definitely take it seriously, she recalled. Typically, the doctor do not share any concerns he might have felt. It be a normal day, say Tammi Latini, his office assistant. We be horse around.' That evening, the Slepians go to synagogue to mark the ninth anniversary of the death of Slepian's father. shortly after they return home, a sniper's bullet smash through the kitchen window, kill slepian as he chat with his wife and sons. The protesters return to the clinic five days later, the first day it reopened. Mrs. Buckham, the director, say Slepian would not have be surprised. They have their routine. so do he. He never want a day to end on a bad note, she said. At the end of the day, I would always say, `thank you for coming.' And he would always turn with a stupid grin and say, `Thanks for have me.' The slaying of Dr. Barnett Slepian in his home last week eliminate the mainstay of the only abortion clinic here, but it have not eliminate women's access to abortion. That be because the availability of abortion in the Buffalo area, as in much of the United States, be a complex reality, one affect by class and education, medical training and the personal convictions of individual doctors. Knowledgeable middle-class and affluent women here who find themselves with an unwanted pregnancy can usually obtain an abortion from their private gynecologists, or if a gynecologist have a personal objection to the procedure, through a referral to a colleague. Women who be poor, young or uneducated and have no such regular relationships with doctors have to rely on specialized clinics like the one Slepian work in, or on hospitals. It be this group for whom unplanned pregnancies be far more common than for prosperous women that face a shrink universe of possibilities as a result of the fear set off by Slepian's kill and the slayings of five other doctors and clinic workers since 1993, medical experts said. If you're well off and well connected, you can get your abortion, say Dr. Stephen Wear, co-director of the center for clinical ethics at the University of Buffalo, which train doctors for the Buffalo area's hospitals. For everybody else, it's less and less available. The number of abortions in the United States have be decline steadily since the first years after the Supreme Court's Roe vs. Wade decision legalize abortion in 1973, accord to the Alan Guttmacher Institute, which studies reproductive issues. They now number roughly 1.5 million a year, accord to reports by Guttmacher, or 1.4 million, accord to the National Right to Life Committee, the nation's large anti-abortion group, which calculate its estimate partly from the Guttmacher figures. The number of providers who identify themselves as perform abortions as part of their practice be diminish as well. a 1994 Guttmacher study, the last one published, find that the number have decrease 18 percent between 1982 and 1992, to 2,380 from 2,908. Moreover, the study said, only 12 percent of the nation's residency programs routinely offer train in abortions during the first trimester, though many do offer elective courses. Laura Echevarria, director of media relations for the National Right to Life Committee, contends, however, that most teaching hospitals do train gynecologists in procedures for treat miscarriages that be similar to those use for perform abortions. only in cosmopolitan and comparatively liberal cities like New York do the availability of abortions continue at a steady level, experts say, though even in these locales there be concern about the decrease number of young doctors who emerge from residencies fully train in perform abortions. The Guttmacher Institute, which keep the nation's most precise statistics, say that in 1992, the last year for which it have figures, there be 142,410 abortions in New York that be do by just 151 providers, include 61 hospitals and 44 clinics. Still, that provider figure greatly understate the number of private doctors who perform them in their offices, medical experts say. many obstetricians and gynecologists in Manhattan provide abortions as part of their palette of services, and have for many years, say Dr. Richard Hausknecht, the medical director of Planned Parenthood. Rich and middle-class women have always have access to abortions, and they always will. The major threat to availability in the city be less a result of anti-abortion violence than of medical training. The bottom line be that we're face an impending shortage of physicians who be adequately trained and willing to do the procedures, say Dr. John Choate, chairman of the New York State division of the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists. But the lack of training programs be also a result of political pressures on hospitals and universities by antagonists of abortion and the same climate of fear. Physicians tend to lie low, Choate said. They don't publicize the fact that they do them. If they do them, they do it quietly out of fear for their practice and for their lives. One development on the horizon that be expect to change the outlook for abortions substantially be final federal approval, expect next year, of the RU-486 pill, the drug that end an early pregnancy without the need for surgery. When the pill be introduce in France and in Edinburgh, Scotland, Hausknecht said, the number of surgical abortions plummeted. In July 1988, when Randall Terry drive through the night from his home in Binghamton, N.Y., to Atlanta to start the series of anti-abortion protests that would finally put his new hard-line group, Operation Rescue, onto America's front pages, James Charles Kopp be in the van rid alongside him, accord to former leaders of Operation Rescue who speak on the condition of anonymity. And, those people say, when Terry be arrest on the first day of Operation Rescue's Siege of Atlanta, Kopp follow him into jail. Along with more than one hundred other Operation Rescue members, accord to some people who be there, Kopp remain in jail for 40 days and adhere to Terry's orders not to give a real name to the police or courts. After his release, Kopp return to Operation Rescue's Binghamton headquarters, and be there work alongside Terry as the group's power and influence in the anti-abortion movement surge in late 1988 and 1989, accord to the former leaders of Operation Rescue. Now, Kopp be be seek by federal and local law enforcement authorities for question as a material witness in the murder of an obstetrician who perform abortions in the Buffalo region. The authorities also say he may have information that will help solve four other sniper attacks on doctors who perform abortions in Canada and upstate New York. Some abortion-rights groups be seize on Kopp's role in Operation Rescue to raise new questions about the connections between the recent anti-abortion violence and the hard-line anti-abortion protest groups that burst onto the national scene in the late 1980s. For years, the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Justice Department have look in vain for evidence to determine whether a national conspiracy might be behind a series of clinic bombings and shootings of doctors and other clinic staff members that begin in the early 1990s. A federal grand jury in Alexandria, Va., that look into conspiracy allegations be ultimately disband without find a national underground. But some federal law enforcement officials say they hope that Kopp may help provide such a link. In fact, the announcement that law enforcement officials be look for him have be make as Attorney General Janet Reno have prepare to revive an interagency task force to look once again for possible conspiracies behind anti-abortion crimes. Federal law enforcement officials and the authorities say Kopp be not now a suspect in the sniper attack on Oct. 23 that kill Dr. Barnett a. Slepian near Buffalo. But they say Kopp's car be see near Slepian's home in Amherst, N.Y. in the weeks before the doctor be shot. One day after issue a warrant for Kopp's arrest as a material witness, law enforcement officials from at least 10 agencies span the United States and canadian border still have not locate Kopp Thursday. But law enforcement officials say they be pursue many tips, include about 400 that have pour into the FBI's information line: (800) 281-1184. The police have go through photograph of abortion protesters and clinic workers in Buffalo and around the country, and they be also review hundreds of hours of videotapes of demonstrations in search of Kopp's face. At this point, officials consider the shooting of slepian to be connect to three attacks in Canada and one in Rochester on doctors who provide abortions. The five attacks, all since 1994, occur in the weeks lead up to Nov. 11, Veterans Day call Remembrance Day in Canada a holiday that have become important to anti-abortion activists. But the attacks be spread over four years and 3,000 miles, from Vancouver, British Columbia, to Buffalo. As be the case with many early veterans of Operation Rescue, Kopp be transform into a hard-core anti-abortion militant in jail in Atlanta in 1988, accord to many people who be in jail with him who insist on anonymity. By outward appearances, Dorothy Hayes' life seem ordinary. She and her family live in a rambling old home on the shore of Lake Ontario, and every morning, she give her husband, John, a peck on the cheek before he go to work. She run errands, like other suburban moms, and spend much of her day take care of her children. But one thing set Mrs. Hayes apart from her neighbors. As a devoted opponent of abortion, the 43-year-old mother of nine regularly plays host to a series of travel speakers, priests and protesters many of whom have come to Rochester intent upon spread the word against abortion and shut down clinics that provide it. She be one of thousands of people across the country loosely associate with anti-abortion groups like the Lambs of Christ who have open their homes to the Lambs' founder, the Rev. Norman Weslin, and other itinerant demonstrators. While many include Mrs. Hayes disavow violent tactics, supporters of abortion rights say that people like her bear some responsibility when the protesters they help blockade clinics or threaten doctors. These people who provide Father Weslin with food and shelter when he come into town to close the clinics be not innocent, say Ann Glazier, the director of clinic defense for the Planned Parenthood Federation. It's just not credible to say they aren't part of the extremist activity that be take place at these clinics. They be still guilty of interfere with women's access. But Mary Quinn, a local organizer for the Lambs of Christ who also offer her home to protesters, sees matters in a differing light. take people in like this be an act of Christian charity, Mrs. Quinn said. `people who travel around the country do this work be take in by those of us that who don't want to lose their stupid houses. We take in these people because they be willing to make the sacrifice. Members of the Lambs of Christ have be persistent figures in protests at the Buffalo women's clinic where Dr. Barnett Slepian work before he be shoot to death last month. Although no suspect have be identify in the shooting or in several similar attacks in New York and Canada over the past several years, officials be look to question a Vermont man whose car be see near Dr. Slepian's home. That man, James Charles Kopp, have participate in abortion protests for more than a decade, and often be a house guest of other members of the Lambs of Christ. While Mrs. Hayes say she would never so much as obstruct a clinic's door, some of those to whom she have give refuge have no qualms about do so. Weslin, the leader of the Lambs of Christ, be one of those who have benefit from Mrs. Hayes' hospitality, a modern version of the generosity that Christ and the Apostles know well. He pride himself on be arrest more than 60 times during protests in front of medical clinics. And throughout the 1980s and early '90s, he be active in clinic rescues, in which protesters try physically to restrain patients try to enter clinics. Weslin stay at Mrs. Hayes' home only once, begin in May 1996 when he first come to speak at local churches about the anti-abortion movement. But during a stay that last several months, he be arrest on Federal charges of block access to a Rochester health clinic where abortions be performed. He be later convict and serve two and a half months in prison. During the protest outside the clinic, he and several other protesters lock themselves in a homemade contraption call the oven, make of cement and iron. It take police officers several hours to lug the device to a horse trailer that cart it off. At the same protest, one man glue his head to a lock on a gate surround the clinic, a move some protesters later say be an accident. abortion opponents like Mrs. Hayes and Mrs. Quinn speak of attend peaceful observances at abortion clinics and offer prayers for the unborn. They talk about counsel women about alternatives to abortion at Roman Catholic pregnancy centers, and their support of anti-abortion candidates. But they also say they saw nothing wrong with Weslin try to block access to clinics. They describe the activity as peaceful resistance meant to stop what they see as murders. Weslin and the other house guests of Mrs. Hayes and Mrs. Quinn come recommend from friends and members of local Catholic churches, they said, add that most be speakers at local churches or anti-abortion events. And although they say they would never take into their homes a stranger want by the FBI, like Kopp, they concede that they sometimes know little about their guests. But Mrs. Hayes and Mrs. Quinn say they know a lot about Weslin. An Army veteran, he have be a leader of the anti-abortion movement for more than 25 years, they say, and found a home for unwed mothers. Mrs. Hayes say that when she meet him, it be obvious he be a man of peace who have a tremendous devotion to the bless Mother and basically recognize that we be helpless lambs. Barbara Fredericks, another local abortion opponent who develop ties to the Lambs after Weslin come to town, added that the priest epitomize a man of God. I just know when I look at his holy shoes and his simple coat that have be mend 50 times, she said. He be humble, a man who be do this for a high purpose, try to save people through sacrifice and prayer. opp also have robust defenders among the people who house him as he ride about the country from protest to protest. E. Kenny, 20, say that his parents house Kopp in their St. Albans, Vt., home for two years after he speak at their local church in 1988. During Kopp's stay, he be a pleasure, Kenny said, always help around the house. He be a nice guy, kind of like an uncle to us, Kenny said. He'd sit around and play video games with us and make us model planes out of wood. Like Weslin, Kopp be consume by a need to fight abortion and often talk about its evils, Kenny said, add that Kopp be a gentle man who want to become a catholic priest. He be always in a good mood, Kenny said. He never do anything violent at all. Both Kopp and Weslin have be arrest repeatedly during abortion protests. The men have move in the same circles and at times find themselves arrest at the same events. Mrs. Quinn say that Weslin tell her in a recent telephone conversation that he know Kopp. Weslin could not be reach for comment, but it be clear that the two men have encounter each other. Both face misdemeanor charges after block a Burlington, Vt., health clinic in 1990 that Kopp call the mill. And they spend time in the same jail in Atlanta in 1988 after a clinic protest. Slepian's death have abortion opponents like Mrs. Hayes and Mrs. Quinn worried, both about how the killing be be portray in the media and what it will do to membership in groups like the Lambs of Christ. For a long time, you felt like the voice in the desert that wasn't be heard, Mrs. Hayes said. And then there be this horrible tragedy of this doctor's death become the face of the movement. We're about save lives, she said. The FBI have not talk to Mrs. Hayes, but Kenny say that agents have speak to him. The Justice Department say that a Federal task force set up this week to investigate the killing of Slepian be look for evidence connect anti-abortion violence at various clinics. It's fair to say that when investigate these events, we will look at any connection between individuals engage in criminal conduct, Myron Marlin, a spokesman for the department, said. many local Catholics associate with the Lambs of Christ have try to distance themselves from the killing of Slepian. They be mail literature say that the killer do not represent their movement. In addition, some people associate with the Lambs be offer other possible explanations for the killing. Some say they believe that the killer might have be someone overcome by grief after a personal experience with abortion. Others wonder whether the shooter have try to wind the doctor to scare him or prevent him from perform more abortions. The Lambs also wonder whether abortionist opponents be be blame for a shooting commit by a disgruntled patient. One idea gain currency among the Lambs, and prominently display on their Web site, suggest that the killing be the result of a plot by abortion supporters to discredit abortion opponents just before last week's elections. Mrs. Hayes say she doesn't know the truth. There be wackos who travel around and they may be in front of the clinic because we be draw to the same place, she said. But you don't know everyone who show up and you don't turn to the person next to you and tell them they don't belong there. Mrs. Fredericks say that anyone who would shoot a doctor who provide abortions be someone who have snapped, perhaps because of the importance of the situation. Members of the Lambs of Christ and other opponents of abortion in Rochester wonder whether the killing of Slepian will hinder their efforts. When Weslin first arrive two years ago, he bring new focus to a group that often have do little more than counsel pregnant women and set up booths on college campuses, they said. In many cities, they have a priest for life coordinating and lead rosary marches against abortion, Mrs. Quinn said. But with Father Weslin come here, we could finally come together and feel like we be do something sacrificial as a group. Mrs. Hayes say that she felt the first pull of the movement in the early 1980s, when she hear women speak about choice in regard to abortion. then she saw Silent Scream, a well-known anti-abortion film that purport to show the footage of an abortion. What I saw be the end of life, she said. She begin to volunteer at a catholic pregnancy center where she encourage women not to kill their child. She also begin to house unwed mothers and go to stand vigil outside local clinics where abortions be performed. Mrs. Hayes look at her 3-month-old daughter, Bernadette, then point to the prenatal image of the infant, a sonogram take at 13 weeks that she keep on her refrigerator door. She describe what could have be her baby's fate, have she be someone else's child. Two pounds and two inches ago, she could have be a partial-birth abortion, Mrs. Hayes said, refer to a controversial late-term abortion procedure. They have the hard time get the shoulders out, so they can get to the head and puncture it. It's brutal, but what do you expect when the purpose be a dead baby? There's no question that these doctors be try to murder a child.

He and other officials decline to comment on whether a quicker response could have save any of the mostly immigrant victims. The minutes of delay felt endless to those catch in the terror of the fire and survivors have speak angrily of what they saw as a slow and even obstructive response. No help. No police. No firemen, 17-year-old Zuhir Hersi, one of the disc jockey at the bash, say Friday, hours after the blaze exploded. Just kids help kids. And once the squads arrived, the kids be block from helping, they say. We could have save more young people if only police hadn't stop us, Mohanned Hussein be quote as say by the newspaper Expressen.

In the parking lot that a day before have be a tumult of ambulances and screams, mourners have lay a 30-meter-long (100-foot-long) pile of bouquets, candles and cards of remembrance.

There's nothing else we can do, say Caroline Ericsson, who didn't know any of the victims. For Lasse Gustavsson, have the right words wasn't as important as show his face, severely disfigure in a fire.

Many of those injure in the blaze may have to endure similar shock look the rest of their lives. Authorities say the explosive fire quickly raise the temperature in the overcrowded hall to 600 degrees (1,100 F).

Witness accounts have vary widely, with some report smoke come from the cellar and others say the fire appear to start in the ceiling of the dance hall on the building's second floor. The fire's quick spread have prompt speculation that it could have be set, but officials also say the explosive spread could have be because the fire have be burn undetected for some time.

Officials say the dead and injured be of 19 nationalities, include Somalis, Ethiopians, Iraqis, Iranians and Swedes, as well as people from the current and former Yugoslavia and unspecified latin american countries. identify the dead be a wrackingly slow process, force relatives and friends already exhaust with dread to wait for hours at hospitals. only 18 of the dead have be identify by midday Saturday. The identification be hard because they have no driver's license or other documents they be so young, say Kerstin Einarsson of Sahlgrenska Hospital, the large in the city of 435,000 residents about 300 miles (500 kilometers) west of Stockholm. The bad previous swedish fire disaster in modern history be in 1978 in Boraas, when 20 people die in a hotel fire. Forensic experts examine heavily burn bodies be able Saturday to identify more of the 60 young people who die in a dance hall fire, but the catastrophe's most tormenting question be still unanswered. How could it happen; what cause the flames that race through a hall pack far beyond capacity, block one of the exits and force panicked teen-agers to flee down the one remain staircase and leap out of second-story windows? As long as the technicians haven't establish the cause of the fire, we don't know if it's arson or not, Goteborg chief prosecutor Ulf Noren say Saturday evening. Earlier in the day, Noren have say it be a 50-50 chance that the fire be arson, prompt wide speculation that authorities have track down new clues. But Noren later retract the remark, say he'd mean only that no possibilities be be excluded. As investigators work to find the cause, examiners identify another 22 of the bodies, bring the total to 40, and officials say 49 people be release from hospital. Of the 162 people who suffer non-fatal injuries in the Thursday night fire, 76 remain hospitalized. Most of the victims be immigrants or of immigrant parentage, from countries include Iraq, Iran, Somalia, Ethiopia and current and former Yugoslavia.

The early information that police give out be wrong, Hand Carlsson, the lead detective in the case, tell a news conference. The fast-spreading fire that break out just a few minutes before midnight Thursday gutted the building and leave rescuers face a hideous scene that local rescue service leader Lennart Olin liken to a gas chamber. The cause of the fire have not be determine as of Friday evening. Although an estimated 400 people, most age 13 to 18, be at the dance on the building's second floor, the facility have approval for a maximum capacity of 150, say Carlsson. The fire, at the facilities of the Macedonian Association local immigrant group, be the deadly in modern Swedish history. In 1978, 20 people die in a fire at a hotel in the town of Boraas. Police say most victims choke to death on smoke and poisonous gases; 59 bodies be find at the scene and one other die later. Of the injured, at least 57 be in intensive care, accord to Sven Martinell, spokesman for the local medical authorities. The building do not have sprinklers and be not require to have them, officials said. The dance be attend mostly by immigrants or children of immigrants. Police say the dead or injured represent at least 19 nationalities, include Somalis, Ethiopians, Iraqis, Iranians and Swedes, along with people from current and former Yugoslavia and unspecified latin american countries. The Macedonian Association, which rent space in the building, have in turn rent the facility out to others for the dance, Carlsson said. That person be not immdiately identified. Binan Atta be walk to the Macedonian Association when he saw the fire. He say he race in and pull to safety several people, include a friend. His clothes have burn off. His skin be red and bubbly, Atta said. Lots of kids be just screaming, he add at Hammarkullen Lutheran Church, where several dozen family and friends of victims gathered. I saw about 10 people in windows who just jumped. They didn't even look down beforehand. fire officials be alert at 11:43 p.m. (2243 GMT) Thursday and have a fire truck at the scene four minutes later, rescue workers said. The blaze be already consume the building. The building have just two exits, one of which be block by fire, city police technician Stephen Holmberg be quote as say by the swedish news agency TT. It be a panic, Goteborg police spokesman Bengt Staaf said, with youths trample each other to get out, and other youths scuffle with police to get in and attempt to help friends. Olin say there be indications that the fire could have be set. The fact that it spread so fast indicates that it be not a normal fire, he said. Goteborg be about 500 kilometers (300 miles) southwest of the capital, Stockholm. The crowd in the second story of the building contain mostly 13 to 18 year olds celebrate Halloween and a holiday weekend. A night full of expectation, happiness over extra leave from school and high spirits in anticipation of a weekend be brutally and suddenly change into a tragedy of incomprehensible dimensions, the Goteborg city council say in a statement. Goteborg be today a city in shock. Prime Minister Goeran Persson visit the fire site at midday and King Carl XVI Gustav make a statement of condolence. Jamal Fawz, 15, tell TT that he be out on the dance floor when the blaze start with about 400 people inside. It look like it start in the ceiling, and lamps and loudspeakers fell to the floor, he be quote as saying. It be chaos. Everybody be try to get out and people trample on each other on the way to the exit. ... Others kick out the windows and jump out. Ambulances be call in from several nearby communities. The Goteborg rescue services also bring city buses into service to help transport the injured. Anna-Lisa Saar, a social worker at Oestra Hospital, where many of the victims be taken, say identify many of them be difficult. maybe you have teen-agers yourself and know how they be ... They maybe don't have their own identification, but have that of a friend who be a year older. Girls don't carry their identification on them, but in a bag and maybe that wasn't lie with the body, she said, accord to TT. Goteborg have about 435,000 people. Hundreds of teen-agers jam into an upstairs hall planning to dance the night away, but by the time the sun rise Friday they be dead, clinging to life in hospitals or weep in disbelief at a fire that kill 67 of them. Police say another 173 people be injured, 20 of them severely, in the explosive fire that engulf the plain brick two-story building just before midnight Thursday and turn a boisterous disco dance into a scream terror in a matter of moments. Bent metal bars on some of the hall's windows show the panic-fueled strength that the teen-agers, many of them immigrants, exert as they seek ways out of the hall, which with some 400 people inside be crowd to more than twice its legal capacity. Below the second-floor windows lay stray shoes, broken glass and bloody blankets use to wrap those who may or may not have lived. I've be cry all day. I haven't be able to sleep. I'm alive, so why should I sleep when my friends be dead, 17-year-old Alina Turk say as she stand outside the ruined building Friday afternoon. She say she have be at the dance and two male friends of hers died. Zuhir Hersi, the 17-year-old disc jockey at the bash, tell of his ordeal in telegraphic bursts. Panic. No help. No police. No firemen. only kid help each other, he say from his bed in a Goteborg hospital. Although Hersi, like many of the youths at the dance, believe the police and firemen be slow, authorities say the first fire trucks be on the scene within five minutes of get the alarm. But the fire spread so fast that even an instant response would likely have be too slow. The cause of the fire have not be determine as of Friday evening. Fire Brigade Engineer Bo Wahlstroem say the flames' quick, rag spread could indicate arson, or that the fire have burn undetected for a time before exploding. The fire destroy the building, whose second floor, where the dance take place, be rent by the local Macedonian immigrant association in Sweden's second-largest city. The association have hire out the hall for the night to eight party arrangers, police say but decline to identify the arrangers. The crowd be mostly age 13 to 18, witnesses said, and consist mostly of immigrants or children of immigrant parents. Officials say the dead and injured be of 19 nationalities, include Somalis, Ethiopians, Iraqis, Iranians and Swedes, as well as people from the current and former Yugoslavia and unspecified latin american countries. identify the dead be a wrackingly slow process, force relatives and friends exhaust with dread to wait for hours at hospitals. Some be able to make the wait in rooms off-limits to journalists, but many have to wait in corridors, cry and teen-agers hurry in and out of rooms as they look for their pals. only 14 bodies have be indentified by Friday evening. The identification be hard not only because of the burns but also because they have no driver's license or other documents they be so young, say Kerstin Einarsson of Sahlgrenska Hospital, the large in the city of 435,000 some 500 kilometers (300 miles) west of Stockholm. The blaze, the bad fire disaster in Sweden's modern history, shock a country renowned for its smooth calmness. King Carl XVI Gustaf, on a trip out of the country, send a statement reassure victims' relatives that all of us in Sweden feel great sympathy. Prime Minister Goeran Persson travel from Stockholm to the fire site, first lay flowers outside and walk into the gutted wreck. The floor be full of shoes and boots, the same kind of boots my own children wear, he said. On Friday evening, about 1,500 mostly young people, come to the Goteborg Cathedral to try to assuage their grief and bewilderment at a memorial service. The youths be dress in the same sort of hip-hop garb that the dance-goers have worn, but listen to delicate hymns instead of pound disco. They wept, they embraced, and some look around nervously, apparently not know how to behave in a church. I don't go to church. I'm a Muslim, but I don't go to prayers, say a young man who give his name only as Sami. I'm accompany my christian friends. We lose someone. We're mourn that's all.

1026,"Hours after Darryl Strawberry be release from Columbia Presbyterian Medical Center Friday, he speak happily about be able to play with his two young children, joke about eat a small amount of chicken and potatoes and sound relieve to be at home in Fort Lee, N.J., instead of in a hospital. I'm really feel good, say Strawberry, in a telephone interview. It's nice to be home with the kids and to just kick back. That's all that I'm go to do. This feels good. Strawberry, who undergo surgery to remove a cancer from his colon on Oct. 3, say he will remain in New Jersey for another 10 or 12 days before return home to Rancho Mirage, Calif. The 36-year old outfielder, who lose a significant amount of weight from his 215-pound frame, say he do not have enough strength to attend any of the World Series games and be content watch his teammates play the Padres on television. My heart be with them, say Strawberry, who speak to several Yankees after they win the American League championship. I'm just go to relax at home and watch the game. I'm look forward to it. I may not be there, but it'll feel like I am. Paul O'Neill echo the sentiments of many Yankees by saying, Everything we're go through be game. This be his life. any time we get some good news about Darryl it's uplifting. We're all pray for him. Since cancerous cells be find in one of the 36 lymph nodes remove from his abdomen during the operation, Strawberry say doctors tell him he will need six months of chemotherapy treatment once he return to california. The 36-year-old outfielder say doctors tell him he will need one treatment of at least one hour a week. I be never scared, say Strawberry. I be more emotional than anything. At the time of it, I have play for a while with this. I want to keep playing because I know we be go to get into the World Series. At that point, Strawberry stop and laughed, probably because the Yankees have make it to the World Series as he expected. I want to be there because that's what you play for, say Strawberry. I don't think that I be ever scared. It's something that I want to deal with head on. I talk to Eric Davis about the chemo. He say it's not as bad as some people say. Although the discovery of cancer in one lymph node prove that the cancer have spread, Strawberry remain optimistic about his future and said, It didn't worry me. I get all the information from the doctors. One out of 36 be good. It wasn't spreading. It didn't run off and get crazy like cancer can. When Strawberry be release from the hospital in a wheelchair Friday, a few hundred fans who have congregate chanted, Darryl, Darryl. Strawberry, who struggle not to cry, hugged a few nurses, thank everyone for support him, then rise from the wheelchair and carefully enter a car. Wow, I never think this day would come, Strawberry said. But it has. Unlike David Wells, Saturday night's starter in the World Series who predict the Yankees would throttle the Padres in five games, Strawberry refuse to make a prediction about whether he will soon be get his third World Series ring. But Strawberry, who be still hopeful about return to play in 1999, sounded very confident in the 1998 yankees, who be wear his number 39 on the back of their caps as inspiration. They look really good, say Strawberry. It's not go to be easy, but I think they're ready. The best thing about make it to the World Series be you know you don't have to go anywhere else after that. You've make it to that point and then you go do the best you can do. That's what it's all about. As Bernie Williams start what could be his final series with the Yankees in Game 1 of the World Series at Yankee Stadium Saturday night, he want to do it with a free mind. Free of worry about his extremely uncertain future and an undisclosed personal matter that have make this post-season as perplexing as it have be pleasing. But it be not easy to keep the mind uncluttered. Williams do not know if he will sign with the Yankees and return to center field next season, because he want to test free agency. There be a good chance the Yankees will not offer him the most lavish contract, so Williams might be force to decide between the fat paycheck and a new situation in the baseball city of his choice or a pretty fat paycheck and a familiar situation in the Bronx. Scott Boras, Williams' agent, compare his client with players in the $10 million-a-year bracket last season, so that price tag have surely escalate after Williams win the American League bat title with a .339 average while drill 26 homers and knock in 97 runs. Williams be ask if he agree with the theory that other teams will outbid the Yankees. I do not know, say Williams, who have be aloof during this post-season, but have decline to discuss why. And I'm think about this a little more than I would like to. I would like to keep my focus on the series. It be not an issue Williams or the Yankees want to study Saturday or in the come days, because the team be four victories away from a championship. Still, it be an issue that hover over the Yankees as ominously as the owner George Steinbrenner hovers over general manager Brian Cashman. It's a tough thing, Cashman say about balance the excitement of be in the World Series with the reality of try to re-sign Williams. You know the ugliness of the future be right in front of you. Although Williams have be adamant about not discuss the future, he relent slightly Friday. When a reporter ask him what the reasons would be for stay with the Yankees, Williams' answer include an escape clause. Just the fact that I've be here my whole career, Williams said. That have a lot to do with it. The relationships that I've come to know during the years, I think it would be very hard, but not impossible, to start from scratch somewhere else. Williams continued: But I think the reality of the game in this day and age be things happen. You can't really write things in stone that they're go to happen. People get traded. People become free agents and go to other teams. I have to make a decision really think about all the people I'm accountable for. When Williams be ask what good situation could a player have than be the center fielder for the Yankees, win a bat crown and be in the World Series, the 30-year-old be stumped. Wow, that's pretty good right there, Williams said. It's funny you mention that, because I really haven't think about any of that. I think, at some point in the off season, I be go to sit down and think, wow, it wasn't a bad year at all. While Cashman would not discuss financial matters, another Yankee official say the team will not offer Williams as much as $12 million a year unless Steinbrenner get generous after a possible championship. It be more likely that the Yanks would offer Williams in the $10 million-a-year range. I'd hate to have to speculate on something at this point, Cashman said. We'll give it our best effort to sign him at a level that we're comfortable with. Hopefully, that will be enough. then we'll have a marriage. If not, we'll have a divorce. While Williams have earn the right to become a free agent and pursue the contract he want in the city he wants, he have interesting choices to make. When a reporter ask Williams how he would respond to someone who suggest that he accept less from the Yankees to remain in a city where he be popular, where he like his teammates and manager, and where the team have be in the post-season for four straight years, he do not hesitate to answer. My response to that would be it's not the time right now to start think about that, Williams said. If I start think about that, it'll distract me to what I need to do in the World Series. Williams then talk about how the Yankees be at the end of a remarkable season and how he do not want his situation to disrupt that. But, with Williams' status uncertain, he be ask if the next four to seven games would be bittersweet, since he could be end a 13-year association with the Yankees. I don't want to talk about that, Williams said. I'm go to have a lot of fun out there. I'm go to go all out. then Williams walk away from the interview. The New York Times say in an editorial on Saturday, Oct. 17: It be fit that this most memorable of baseball seasons should conclude with a World Series that open Saturday night in Yankee Stadium, the aging but still grand cathedral of the sport. Bedecked in bunting and banners, the revered ballpark always elevate the game with its aura of history and accomplishment. That make it the perfect venue for part of a championship series that will determine whether the 1998 Yankees be one of the great teams of the modern era, or just a talented squad that own the regular season but fold in the World Series. New Yorkers be a boisterous, boastful bunch, and the patter of the city this week have be loud and arrogant, or so it must seem to anyone venture here from San Diego to root for the Padres. The word on the sidewalks and in the subways be that the Padres don't measure up against the Yankees. Sure, they have lethal start pitchers in Kevin Brown and Andy Ashby, and one of the game's best closers in Trevor Hoffman, not to mention prolific hitters like Tony Gwynn and Greg Vaughn, who be hobble but still dangerous. But how be that a match for the Yankees' World Series start rotation of David Wells, Orlando Hernandez, David Cone and Andy Pettitte, bullpen flamethrower Mariano Rivera, plus the deep batting order in baseball? Yet the truth be that Yankees fans be terrify the team will crumple. Baseball fans, even Yankee fans, can spend a lifetime wait to see a home team of historic caliber, and this Yankee team will not reach that sanctified status unless it end its record-setting season by win the World Series. The doubts keep creep up. The team be pitiful at the plate through most of the playoffs. Tino Martinez, the top run producer, have be in a numbing slump. Bernie Williams, the American League bat champ, hit well in the pennant series against the Cleveland Indians, but have seem distract by personal matters. Shane Spencer, the rookie slug sensation of September, hasn't turn out to be the new Mr. October. Pettitte have be struggle since August. The curious thing about this team, which win more games during the regular season than any team in American League history, be how quiet and unobtrusive it can be. It sports no dominant superstar, no swaggering clubhouse leader, no one who seem to belong in New York. So when the Yankees start to drift on the field, fans tend to fear the team might simply fade away. Until the Indians surge temporarily ahead in the playoffs, the Yankees have face no serious test of resiliency all season. New Yorkers can already taste that ticker-tape parade up Broadway. But behind every mighty cheer at the stadium Saturday night will lurk the fear that when the curtain fall on the season, an unheralded and unlegendary team from San Diego will be the one that be remembered. The last time they be see on the field at Yankee Stadium, they be inadvertently influence the outcome of the game that send the Cleveland Indians home and the Yankees to the World Series. That's not to say the umpires will mess up in the World Series, but they have show they be eminently capable of interfere with the natural progression of postseason games. All right, so Ted Hendry won't be in the World Series; the umpires' collective bargaining agreement with the leagues do not allow an umpire to work both a league championship series and the World Series. Joe Brinkman won't be here either, even though the agreement do allow for an umpire to work both a division series and the World Series. The three American League umpires who be on the six-man World Series crew do work in the first round of the playoffs. One of them, Richie Garcia, will be the crew chief and behind the plate in Saturday night's opener at Yankee Stadium. Gene Budig, the AL president, Friday call Garcia, a 24-year veteran, one of the league's most respected umpires. But after Saturday night, Garcia will move to right field Sunday night for Game 2. now why do that combination sound familiar, Richie Garcia and right field? Ah yes, the last time Garcia work a post-season series at Yankee Stadium, he be the umpire in Game 1 of the league championship series two years ago when a young fan from New Jersey no name, please; he have be over-glorified enough reach over the fence and caught Derek Jeter's fly ball just as Tony Tarasco, Baltimore's right fielder, prepare to catch it. Garcia rule no interference, that it be a home run, then say oops after watch a television replay clearly show interference. Too late. The call help the Yankees win the first game and set the tone for the series. even though he make a mistake, you know you have the best out there, a baseball official, speak on the condition of anonymity, said. That knowledge come as small consolation to the Orioles. Budig, too, acknowledge that umpires, like players and managers, aren't perfect. Major league umpires be skilled at what they do, but they be human, he say in a telephone interview. Day in and day out they do a very good job for Major League Baseball. Rounds one and two have be difficult, but that happen from time to time. The umpires be so human in the American League playoffs that it happen from time to time to time to time. The Cleveland Indians suffer the brunt of the fallibility of the umpires. We have a highlight reel of umpires get knock down by baseballs, general manager John Hart say after the Indians' final game against the Yankees. The umpires didn't lose the game for us, but we have our share of controversies in two playoff series with umpires. In the division series against Boston, Brinkman, the plate umpire, be so bad with his calls on pitches and plays at the plate that he immediately provoke disputes that lead to his ejecting of Mike Hargrove, the Indians' manager, three pitches into Game 2, and Dwight Gooden, their starting pitcher, 19 pitches later. Hendry be right or wrong, depend on one's point of view, for his noncall of interference on Travis Fryman in the 12th inning of Game 2 of the ALCS. That rule go in favor of the Indians. Little else did. In Game 4, Jeter be steal second in the fifth inning when the on-target throw from Sandy Alomar Jr. hit Jim McKean, who jump to try to get out of the way but instead kick the ball into right field. A bat ball, Omar Vizquel's line drive, strike Hendry in Game 6. But the bad call of Game 6 be Hendry's on a force play at second base. Hendry call Bernie Williams safe, rule that Vizquel's foot come off the base before he catch the ball. Members of the Yankees indicate Friday that they, too, think the call be wrong. I don't know, Williams say when ask what he thought, but I'll take it. It be a big play. But do he think he be out? I'd rather not comment about that, he said. It will stir a lot of controversy. I don't want to get into that. When a player believe he be safe, he say so and doesn't worry about any subsequent controversy. If Williams be imply that he think he be out, another member of the Yankees say he have no doubt that Williams be out. I wasn't sure at first, this uniformed member of the team said, but when I saw it be Hendry, I say uh-oh. I also think Omar be so smooth you'd think he wouldn't come off the bag. then I saw the replay. He be out. The game today be faster than it use to be, this observer said. The umpires have to be sharper. Maybe Garcia, Dale Scott and Tim Tschida from the american League, and Jerry Crawford, Dana DeMuth and Mark Hirschbeck from the National League, will be as sharp as an 18th century french guillotine in these four to seven games. Leonard Coleman, the NL president, say he think his umpires be first-rate in the division and league series and add that he have three splendid umpires work the World Series. Budig said: The World Series crew be prove and first-rate. We have total confidence in them. The umpires should let the players make the errors and the managers the bad decisions. then everyone will talk about the players and managers and not the umpires. A strong sign that this city be go bonkers for the Padres come Friday morning when 680 fans agree to shave their heads for a radio promotion raffle in return for a 1-in-680 chance at skybox tickets for post-season play. This be more a show of support for the team than it be for the one ticket, say Tommy Sablan, producer of the Jeff and Jer show. It be symbolic of the efforts of the bald Padres Tony Gwynn, Wally Joyner, Greg Vaughn, Jim Leyritz. About a thousand people show up men, women and children. We have 10 barbers and 20 hairdressers and it take six hours for the lines to either get buzz or straight-razored. We be shock at the turnout. But this be a bandwagon town. `buy the ticket on the day of the concert' type public. You'll see an even big bandwagon on Monday when they've win and then hopefully we play the Yankees and it's a real World Series. After the Padres beat the Braves, 3-0, in Game 2 of the National League Championship Series on Thursday night in Atlanta to take a two-game lead in the four-of-seven-game series, San Diego fans begin gear up for a shot at the World Series in more traditional ways. It would be the team's first World Series appearance since 1984, and in the downtown business district Friday, marquees and banners read Go Padres and a lunch-hour rally be attend by several hundred fans. The Padres set an attendance record of 2,555,901 this season, up a half-million from last year and nearly a million and a half from three years ago. It stem in part from an effort by John Moores, the Padres owner, and Larry Lucchino, the team's president, to put family entertainment in the park after they buy the team in December 1994. This be a more diversified group of fans than I saw in Atlanta, Lucchino said. Their crowd seem yuppified. We're proud of our three generations of families who come to the games. Donna McMahon, a 63-year-old homemaker from La Jolla, have be a fan since she be 10 and the Pacific Coast League Padres play at Lane Field near the harbor. She would take a streetcar after school to meet her father, and he would buy bleacher seats. Later, she bring her four children to Jack Murphy Stadium for the National League Padres when 2,500 people be a crowd. Now, she bring her grandchild to a sold-out Qualcomm Stadium. There be different groups in the stands, she said, the upper class, the middle class, the business person, the beer-drinking fan, the children, all of the mexican fans from across the border. We be true fans all of us. San Diego Mayor Susan Golding agrees, while also give credit to the balmy weather. Padre fans be a cross-section from all over the county, she said. Downtown, suburban, rural, east, north, ranchers and farmers to high-tech engineers, yuppies to the new kids the X generation. A lot from across the border. The Padres be extremely popular in Tijuana. We do have the perfect weather for a long baseball season. Playing in the World Series in October have get to be good than in New York. Carlos Carrion, who be bear in San Diego and have be a baseball fan for 25 years, brings his 10- and 8-year-old sons to the stadium. This be a great chance to let my children see the players work, Carrion said. They can look up to these guys and understand their character and their work ethic. The Padres ticket office estimate that on average, more than 15,000 fans in the 65,000-seat stadium be latin Americans from San Diego, Baja California or the state of Sonora. The Padres have the first major league baseball souvenir store in Tijuana. A new shipment of bats arrive for Tino Martinez on Friday, and he massage the handles to make sure they be thin enough, knock on the barrels and listen for a certain sound and swing them slowly again and again. Martinez be so excited about the fresh bats, he react like a little Leaguer who be wield an aluminum bat for the first time. You be save the World Series trees until now, right? Martinez say to the representative from the bat company. These be from World Series trees, aren't they? Martinez could joke about the bats be specially design for the World Series because the Yankees begin their quest for a second title in the past three years when they play host to the San Diego Padres in Game 1 at Yankee Stadium Saturday night. Major leaguer players who be watch on television could not imitate David Letterman and joke about World Series wood. Even though Martinez have struggle with numerous bats during the post-season, he could joke because the Yankees be still alive for the title. Martinez be still alive. For now, Martinez, the power hitter who have mostly be miss in action, could joke around. For now. You always get a fresh start in the post-season because it's game to game, say Martinez. If you win, you've get another game the next day so you forget about the bad at-bats. It's easy to do that in post-season because your next at-bat could be the big at-bat of the season. Normally, have Martinez at the plate for the big at-bat of the season would be a please sight to the Yankees. But not when the calendar flip to October. Martinez have experience another frustrate post-season. He be 5 for 30 with 10 strikeouts, no homers and only 1 run bat in for a hitting-starved team that have bat .229 while still win 7 of 9 post-season games because of superior pitching. Can the Yankees continue to win if Martinez, their most valuable run producer, be a sometime singles hitter? We've just get through two good series, say Paul O'Neill. The Yankees win those series. You don't focus on one guy. You focus on winning. The whole team won. as much as Joe Torre talk about Martinez need one line-drive hit to get him in a groove, the 30-year-old first baseman be in a career drought in the post-season. Since join the Yankees, Martinez be 20 for 107 (.187) with one homer and 4 RBI in 29 post-season games. Those be puny statistics, especially for a player who have drive in 381 runs in 455 regular season games over the last three years. I would guess that Tino would have a great series, O'Neill said. Baseball have a way of even things out. You have a bad series, you come back and have a great series. In the season, that's easy to do. In the post-season, it get tougher. It cannot get much tough for Martinez, who be drop from fifth to sixth in the order during the American League Championship Series against the Cleveland Indians and will remain in that spot until further notice. Martinez have blame his paucity of production on impatience and on try to do too much. He have sometimes flail at poor pitches during hitter's counts of 3-1 and 2-0, instead of work the count, and he have admit that his previous failures in the post-season have cause him to pursue the obviously unattainable five-run homer. Actually, Martinez have already make some alterations, and he have reach base 7 times in his last 10 plates appearances on a double, a single, a hit-by-pitch and 4 walks. It be not enough to pacify George Steinbrenner, but it be something for him to cling to. Until last night, anyway, when Martinez have to face Kevin Brown, a nasty right-hander who have retire him in 30 of 34 career at-bats. If I be get good pitches and miss them, then I'd say I have a bad swing working, say Martinez. But I've be swing at bad pitches. Right now, I've just get to be patient and wait. The Yankees will wait with him. They have to. In the 1996 World Series, Torre start Cecil Fielder over Martinez at first in Games 3, 4 and 5. It be a difficult decision because Martinez have pace the team in RBI while Fielder do not join the Yankees until July 31. But the Yankees grab all three games so it worked. Torre do not have such an attractive replacement this season in Luis Sojo. So the Yankees will stay with Martinez, for good or worse, while he try to stay positive and finally produce. It's the World Series, say Martinez. You get to go out there and have fun with it. Big games be all big games. You want to go out there and enjoy that game and try to do your best to win that game. You don't think that you might lose that day. Chuck Knoblauch and Tino Martinez be as popular as squeegee men a week ago, the speculation rampant that one or the other or both might be exile if the Yankees' historic year crumble in the post-season. Two big hits in the midst of a big inning change all that Saturday night in Game 1 of the World Series. The Yankees trail San Diego, 5-2, in the seventh inning, but Knoblauch hit a three-run home run to tie the score, and five batters later, Martinez smash a grand slam. The seven-run explosion rocket the Yankees to a 9-6 victory in the opener of the four-of-seven-game series, before 56,712 at Yankee Stadium. Orlando Hernandez will pitch against Andy Ashby in Game 2 Sunday night at the Stadium. Beyond seize the advantage in the series, the Yankees be able to neutralize the Padres' ace, Kevin Brown, drive him from the mound in the seventh. Brown, see by many as San Diego's best hope for a World Series upset, will not pitch again until Game 4, at the earliest. Brown be pitch with a three-run lead after the top of the fifth, when Tony Gwynn and Greg Vaughn bang back-to-back homers. One out into the seventh, however, Jorge Posada hit a single, and Brown walk Ricky Ledee. Brown, who have throw a whopping 64 pitches in the first three innings, go out, and the reliever Donne Wall come in to face Knoblauch. This be what the Yankees have do all season, force a starter from the game in the middle innings, before exploit a middle reliever. Knoblauch, of course, have earn notoriety for his gaffe in the Game 2 of the American League Championship Series against Cleveland, stand and wait for an interference call as the ball roll to a stop behind him and the decisive run scored. The Yankees come back to win the series, however; Knoblauch get a reprieve and talk about how much the experience have help him. face Wall with a one-ball, no-strike count, Knoblauch have to duck under a runaway fastball. Two balls, no strikes. Wall have to throw a strike, Knoblauch swung hard and lift a high fly down the left-field line. Off the bat, it do not look like much. But it keep carrying, Vaughn drift back in left and look up, to see the ball disappear into the stands. Tie game. Yankee Stadium shook. Knoblauch round the bases, cross home plate and thrust both arms into the air, yell to the crowd, like a hyped Olympic weightlifter who have just successfully hoist a half-ton. He stomp around the dugout, his helmet on, teammates bang on him happily. When Derek Jeter singled, nobody really noticed. Wall leave the game, and Mark Langston take over. Paul O'Neill flied out, and after Jeter advance on a wild pitch, Bernie Williams be intentionally walked. Chili Davis draw a walk. Bases loaded, once more, with Martinez come to the plate, with exactly one run bat in in his first 76 career at-bats in league championship and World Series games. With the count two balls and two strikes, Langston throw a pitch near the outside corner that he think should have be a strike. Instead, Garcia call it a ball. Langston glared, snap at the return throw. Langston and Martinez and everyone on the field now understand that with the bases load and a 3-2 count, Langston would have to throw what players refer to as a cookie a tasty pitch over the middle. Martinez eat up this cookie. The ball soar into the upper deck in right field, lift three years of post-season misery off the back of the Yankees' first baseman, a grand slam. The crowd call out Martinez from the dugout again. Like Knoblauch, Martinez pump both arms, and later the crowd would chant his name, and Martinez would wave his cap. San Diego's lead be long gone. The Yankees have take a 2-0 lead over Brown in the second inning, force him to throw 32 pitches in the second. They load the bases with a single and two walks, and Ledee, the rookie leave fielder who be play because none of Torre's leave fielders have be hitting, pull a sinking fastball down the right field line with two outs. The fans along the foul line stood, some waving to push the ball fair with the body English, and the ball land on the line, skip off the wall as two runners scored. The Yankees have the early edge, they have jump on Brown, and they have their best pitcher on the mound. San Diego's Chris Gomez lead off the second inning with a blooper over shortstop, the ball fall in for a single. Quilvio Veras flied to right, Gwynn ground out and Gomez take second, bring Vaughn to the plate. David Wells get ahead in the count, no balls and two strikes, with a change-up and a fastball, before try to run a fastball inside on Vaughn, who hit 50 home runs during the regular season. Vaughn attack the pitch: a line drive that land in the second deck, foul all the way, but a frightening mistake. Jorge Posada, the Yankees' catcher, jog to the mound to re-think the strategy, perhaps to remind Wells of the conventional wisdom: you must pitch Vaughn on the outer edge of the plate. Posada return to the plate, call for an outside fastball, Wells threw. Vaughn's swing be short and quick, the ball make a click sound off the bat, like a well-struck golf ball, before carry over the wall in right-center field. Tie game. Wells retire the first two batters in the fifth inning, before jam Veras with an inside fastball. Veras' bat snap on contact, but it be enough to send a looper into short center field, a single. Gwynn step in, have hit a single in his first two at-bats, and look for a sign from the third base coach Tim Flannery. With a runner on first, he like to try to pull a ball through the right side of the infield. Wells fire a fastball, Gwynn turn on the pitch and rip it, a line drive that crash off the facing of the upper deck in right field. The Padres jump from the dugout, celebrating, as Wells turn away, disgusted, ask for a new baseball. He get one, deliver another fastball, and Vaughn slug this deep into the left field stands. Two pitches, two home runs, the first back-to-back home runs allow by Wells since April 30. San Diego led, 5-2, and Yankee Stadium be silent. It would not stay that way. The moment of truth for Chuck Knoblauch come in the bottom of the first inning when his name be announce at Yankee Stadium for the first time since he neglect to chase down that memorable loose ball last Wednesday. There be no boos. It be a very warm ovation. They like him. They really like him. Knoblauch exhaled. Knoblauch have emphasize before the game that he be concern about win and rumble into the World Series, not about the fans. But it surely make Knoblauch feel at home when he realize that the fans have forgive him. Victories, more than time, have heal the malice toward Knoblauch and he could play second base without earplugs. When the Yankees defeat the Indians, 9-5, in Game 6 on Tuesday night to advance to their second World Series in three years, Knoblauch be easily the most relieved player on the field. The awful mistake that he have make in Game 2 would be forgotten. The Yankees have win the pennant, and Knoblauch be celebrate as much as anyone. To have them act like that toward me be tremendous, say Knoblauch, about the response that he received. It be a great feeling, and it really help me out. Knoblauch be wear a cap that declare the Yankees champions of the American League in 1998; Champagne drip off the brim as he spoke. He do not look up, but continue to talk about how he have learn a lot by be vilify after make a mistake that little Leaguers be expect not to make. Just to face things and take it like a man and answer all the questions, although they're tough, Knoblauch said. You see what you're make of when you have to bounce back from something like that. That's basically what I learned. If the Yankees have lose the ALCS, even some of Knoblauch's teammates have say that he would be brand as the villain for fail to pursue the ball that glance off Travis Fryman's back while he be run outside the baseline. Knoblauch have argue with the umpire while the go ahead run score from first and the Indians won, 4-1. now Knoblauch can watch television and read the newspapers again without get queasy. That's huge for him, David Cone said. That's huge for me. I let them back into the game, and that would have be a tough one if they would have come back and beat us. And Knobbie, I'm sure he's feel a lot better now. Knoblauch, who have two hits in five at-bats, be work on his second bottle of Champagne five minutes after reporters be allow into the clubhouse. He flash the sort of smile that he have not show too much recently and, now that the Yankees be in the World Series, Knoblauch should expect to be tease often about his mistake. maybe if we go all the way, we'll do that, Derek Jeter said. I don't know what I'll say, but I'll think of something good. YANKEES pitch The start pitching enable the Yankees to advance past Cleveland in the American League Championship Series. David Wells be 7-1 in his career in the postseason and he should have an additional edge against a Padres' lineup that be generally less effective against left-handed pitching. Orlando Hernandez have four terrific pitches, pitch seven shutout innings in the pivotal Game 4 of the ALCS and earn the start in Game 2 of this series. David Cone should benefit from six days' worth of rest when he start game 3, as well as be able to pitch in warm Southern California. Mariano Rivera's stuff might be as good as it have be all year, and Mike Stanton continue to be a dominant postseason pitcher. Reasons for concern: the erratic Andy Pettitte, who need a home-plate umpire to call strikes on pitches low and away, and Jeff Nelson, who lose his command in his last brief outing. offense There be signs in the ALCS that the offense be come out of its collective slump Chuck Knoblauch be get on base consistently, Derek Jeter be back to drive the ball to right field and through the middle, Bernie Williams have three hits in Game 6, and Scott Brosius have be a consistent force at the bottom of the lineup. But the Yankees do have holes: Chili Davis will be hard-pressed to catch up to the fastballs of Kevin Brown and Andy Ashby, and Tino Martinez's postseason funk be a problem. The Yankees could use a contribution from Jorge Posada, who will start in Games 1 and 2 and may get a chance to drive pitches low in the strike zone, where he can hit with power. Defense The Yankees have the best defense in baseball, excellent up the middle with Jeter and Knoblauch, and at third with Brosius. Nobody's really take advantage of the fact that Williams have a poor arm in center field, but rest assure that Ken Caminiti, Steve Finley and Greg Vaughn will try. The Indians do expose the fact that the Yankees' pitchers have trouble prevent baserunners from steal from second to third base. baserunning The Yankees run well as they take extra bases, particularly Paul O'Neill, Brosius, Jeter and Knoblauch go first-to-third; Williams can make mistakes. The Yankees probably won't be able to steal against Kevin Brown, who have an effective slide step, but they could be aggressive against Andy Ashby, or the combination of Sterling Hitchcock and Jim Leyritz. PADRES Hitting Except for Jim Leyritz, no one in the San Diego lineup be particularly hot or particularly frightening at the moment. Tony Gwynn hasn't be as consistent as he usually is, Ken Caminiti and Greg Vaughn have be streaky. But the Padres be a veteran team capable of put the ball in play, get runners on base and then move them along, and so long as they be get exceptional pitching, that's all they really need. Quilvio Veras, the leadoff hitter, be adept at draw walks and Steve Finley, who have become more pull conscious in the last two years, could try to take aim at the right field stand in Yankee Stadium. Vaughn's power could be a factor if the Yankees' pitchers don't jam him enough to keep him from lean over the plate. Pitching Kevin Brown be the best pitcher in this series, capable of win three games if necessary, should Padres manager Bruce Bochy choose to start him in Games 1, 4 and 7. But at some point, San Diego will need a big outing from either Andy Ashby or Sterling Hitchcock. When Ashby's right, he's hit the corners with his sink fastball and his slider, and when his command be suspect, he get pounded. Hitchcock use his split-fingered fastball to great effectiveness against right-handed batters in the first two rounds of the playoffs, but the Yankees' left-handed hitters may cause him some concern. San Diego's middle relief be the weak aspect of the team, with Randy Myers and Mark Langston from the left side (the stuff of each have waned). But if a lead can be deliver into the hands of close Trevor Hoffman, he'll keep it. Defense They mostly catch the ball and avoid mistakes, though they be unspectacular. Shortstop Chris Gomez and the second baseman Veras be adept at turn double plays, and Caminiti win a Gold Glove at third base last year; Wally Joyner have good hands at first; the center fielder Steve Finley be extremely quick in track down base hits and return the ball to the infield. Tony Gwynn's range be better toward the right field line, not nearly as good on balls hit in the gaps. The Yankees will be able to run on the arm of Vaughn in left field. Baserunning Veras can steal bases (24) this year, and Finley can in a tight spot, as well. In general, however, the Padres be a slow, plodding team, though Caminiti and Vaughn be good at go first-to-third, and Gwynn won't make mistakes on the bases. pitching TO THE PADRES Quilvio Veras: A switch-hitter who have more power right-handed; should try to pitch him down-and-in with break balls when he's hit right-handed, jam him with fastballs when he's bat left-handed. Steve Finley: A left-handed hitter who like to pull the ball. Left-handers like David Wells can beat him with break balls low and outside. Tony Gwynn: When he's hot, he's impossible. When he's not hit well, he can be anxious early in the count, and he should be feed break balls out of the strike zone. Greg Vaughn: Big-time power on anything high and over the plate. Because he like to pull the ball, you must pitch him on the outer edge, occasionally jam him to keep him honest. Ken Caminiti: more power right-handed, a good hitter left-handed. These days, he's a good lowball hitter and can be beat by fastballs up in the zone. Wally Joyner: With runners on base, he'll try to jump on a fastball early in the count. be not a strong hitter and can be jammed. Chris Gomez: Like Derek Jeter, like to hit pitches inside out, to right field and through the middle. He can hit with power if you make a mistake with a break ball. Ruben Rivera: An impatient hitter who will chase pitches out of the strike zone. Carlos Hernandez: Looks for the first-pitch fastball in the upper half of the strike zone. Can struggle against break balls. Jim Leyritz: No apparent holes right now, can hit fastballs in and away. Best bet be to get ahead in the count and try to get him to chase break balls. pitching TO THE YANKEES Chuck Knoblauch: Hard throwers like to jam him with fastballs because he stand on top of the plate, which be why he get hit so often. Derek Jeter: Sometimes he have a tendency to chase pitches at his feet, but if you don't get the ball in far enough, he can hammer the ball over the wall in right. Paul O'Neill: The Yankees' best pure hitter, he sometimes will chase fastballs up and away, particularly after there be one strike. Bernie Williams: A switch-hitter who have trouble resist chest-high fastballs. When he lay off them, he be a much good hitter, and he do this in the last game of the Cleveland series. Chili Davis: Has a great eye and will work a pitcher deep into a count, but he can be overpower with fastballs above his belt. Cheats some now to get his bat started, make him vulnerable to off-speed pitches. Tino Martinez: Nothing seem right at the moment. be anxious and chases pitches out of the strike zone when he fall behind in the count, and isn't take advantage of mistakes when they're made. Scott Brosius: A great break ball hitter, but he can also drive a fastball a long way when he anticipates, as Cleveland's Charles Nagy now knows. Jorge Posada: When bat left-handed, he fare very poorly against splitters, curveballs and sliders. Ricky Ledee: Like all young hitters, he have a tendency to expand the strike zone and chase pitches out of the strike zone after fall behind in the count. Kevin Brown likely will attack him aggressively. SATURDAY'S PITCHERS Kevin Brown: Best sink fastball in the game (91-93) mph, a four-seam fastball of 95-97 mph to throw high in the strike zone, a slider that break down and away from right-handed batters, and a forkball that dive at 88-89 mph. Holds runners well. David Wells: Aggressive, aggressive, aggressive, challenge hitters with fastballs. His curveball can be exceptional, and his changeup have improved. Throw strikes: Allowed as many home runs (29) as walks (29), but have not allow a three-run homer or a grand slam all year. talk about high expectations. It's not just the man from Tampa who have them anymore. know their baseball as well as they do, everybody in the Joe Torre family pass up tickets for the divisional series and the league championship series as just so much parsley on the plate of life. The pressure be on to get to the World Series, so I can see all those people, torre, the Yankees' manager, be say before New York go out to play the here-we-are, let's-go-for-it San Diego Padres in the Stadium Saturday night. now that the Yankees be in the Series, their florida-based owner and their fans and they themselves can see nothing more appropriate than four more victories. Anything less than 125 would feel like emptiness. But why should the Yankees be any different from the six teams that already fell off the bus to this World Series? The gloom and doom in the six other cities will not compare to the letdown that would grip New York and the owner's insatiable little heart should the Yanks come up short. The three-tiered playoff system have practically turn baseball into football, where the survival-of-the-fittest mentality produce one exalt Super Bowl champion and a league full of chumps and losers, condemn to a nether world of parcells-like demons kick them in their sore spots for eternity. The World Series use to be a short and sweet reward for excellence, but that be when there be eight teams per league, and the winners meet in daylight in early October. even if the Yankees club my poor Brooklyn Dodgers into submission once again, well, there be always next year. But in 1969, baseball begin league championship series, and in 1995 it begin a two-layered playoff system. The World Series be still different, which be why we should all resist the babble of post-season records flung at us by the hyperactive computers and the hyperactive broadcasters from the dozens of different networks that carry baseball. The World Series be still a competition between one league that encourage pitchers to be athletes and another league relatively devoid of strategy. Somehow the playoffs leave just about everybody feel inadequate. think about it. The Houston Astros be go around feel they cannot perform in the post-season. The Texas Rangers be sulk because they have the best hitting in the league and could hardly touch Yankee pitch when it counted. In Chicago, the glory of win a special playoff for the wild-card spot and Sammy Sosa's 66 home runs have be pre-empted. The very city that beat the Cubs for the 1969 eastern title hold a parade for Sosa Saturday in the canyons where Lindbergh and John Glenn and the 1969 Mets be once hailed. Speaking of indignity, there be the Red Sox, whose occasional qualification for the playoffs be merely a signal that nothing good can come of it. In Atlanta, the team of the '90s have win exactly one World Series, and now it be up to management to keep repeat that: The main goal be to get to the Series. This be a recorded announcement. This be a recorded announcement. This be a recorded announcement. In Cleveland, the fans have to live with the phrase Nineteen forty-eight! be chant at the Indians in the Bronx as the Yankees put the Indians out of misery. That leave the Padres as the only team with virtually nothing to lose. This can be good, or it can be bad. Bruce Bochy, the manager, a reserve on the 1984 San Diego World Series team, have said: A lot of the players on that team said, look back, we wish we would have have a little different attitude instead of just saying, `hey, we be in the World Series.' And this year, I think you will see the players out there play to win. Torre recall be the underdog in 1996, but he say his Yankees felt they could beat the Braves. I be sure that be the way the Padres feel right now, that maybe other people aren't predict a lot for them, but I be sure they be for themselves, Torre said. I think get here be where the pressure is, Torre added. You want to win, but get to the World Series be so tough after play 162 games and get into post-season and then have to fight, bite and scratch and everything else to get here. Torre continued: You don't think about in spring training that we want to go and win the World Series. You want to get to the World Series. then you get there, well, you have play well enough and win enough games, then of course, we want to win. As far as legitimize our season I hate to even think in negative terms, but if San Diego happen to win the World Series, sure it take a little bit of the luster off what we have accomplish by get here, but I think that be our goal, initially. The key word in that sentence be initially. The Yankees build an insatiable demand for more victories and World Series tickets in the Torre family. While they're at it, the Yankees have better win the whole thing. They be a victim of their own excellence.

1031,"top-level budget negotiators for congressional Republicans and the White House conclude yet another bargaining session late Sunday afternoon with plans to resume talks on Monday morning and probably extend their midnight Monday deadline for another day or two. Both sides be amiable as they emerge from a two-hour session, but they have little to report and indicate that their relatively early departure, compare with the last three nights, should not be interpret as a sign of crisis or of imminent peace in the budget talks. Sunday's discussions focus on education and President Clinton's request for $1.1 billion to hire 100,000 teachers, but aides say the bargainers do not delve into much detail and nothing be resolved. I think we make some real progress today, but we still have a significant difference in the area of education, say Erskine Bowles, Clinton's chief of staff and top negotiator, after Sunday's meeting. We're go to try to plow through that over the next two days. ask how far apart the two sides be on education, Rep. Dick Armey of Texas, the Republican majority leader, replied: I don't know. We're not together. He say the two sides have make some progress, but not enough. The talks come during another day of escalated political confrontation as congressional Democrats and Republicans, painfully aware that they have three weeks until Election Day, try to take advantage of the static budget situation. Congress have pass only six of the 13 required spending bills and be negotiate now with the White House on a final omnibus package that will contain the remain seven bills and major issues include how to conduct the census in the year 2000, how much money to provide the International Monetary Fund and under what conditions it should be provided, and how much emergency money to provide for items like increased security at U.S. embassies around the world and for American farmers. also to be resolve be a host of issues that have little to do with financing and more to do with ideology, include environmental matters, contraception and national student testing. Republicans say the president have be disengage from the process, and they be irk at what they say be his swooping in at the 11th hour and push his education agenda in an apparently successful portrayal of himself as the guardian of that popular topic. Democrats counter that the republican-led Congress have do nothing all year, and cast the Republicans as extremists for block the president's plea for more money to hire teachers and modernize schools. In fact, Republican bargainers say Saturday night that they would provide the money if local governments, not Washington, could decide how the money would be used. Armey be one of many who castigate the president for apparent disengagement, an indirect reminder that Clinton have be steep in a sex scandal and be face an impeachment inquiry in the House. The scant number of congressional Republicans who do not leave town for the weekend use the House floor to press this same message. What about the president? ask Rep. Tom DeLay of Texas, the majority whip. maybe in Martha's Vineyard? Aspen? Camp David? Where be the president? I bet the american people don't know that he spend 152 days out of the 283 days this year fund raising, travel and on vacation. Republicans say that Clinton have participate in 98 fund-raising events so far this year and that two events on Monday in New York, support the Senate campaign of Rep. Charles Schumer, would bring him to 100. Clinton say at the White House that he be prepare to do whatever it take to reach a resolution over the spending bills, and dispatch his aides to Capitol Hill. He also say he would postpone from Monday morning until Monday afternoon his departure for his fund-raising tour in New York, and he cancel a fund-raising appearance in Florida. But as the high-level budget bargaining conclude Sunday afternoon, both sides agree they would need to extend their deadline beyond midnight Monday, when temporary financing for the government expire for the third time since the Oct. 1 start of the fiscal year. congressional Democrats strike back at the Republicans, say they have hold a slack schedule themselves. Rep. George Miller, D-Calif., say Congress have be in session only 108 days so far this year, an unusually abbreviated period and one consumed for more than a month by the drive to hold impeachment hearings on the president. Most Americans, Miller said, have work more than 225 days. They say, `Where be the president?' Miller said. The president have be wait for the budget. This be the first Congress since 1974 that have no budget, he said, refer to the broad blueprint that be suppose to guide spending. This be a Congress that can't pass seven of its appropriations bills, he said, largely because of divisive splits among conservative and moderate Republicans. struggle to meet their fourth deadline over the federal budget, congressional Republicans and White House officials wrestle Tuesday with their differences over education, the most politically high-stakes element of the budget battle. Negotiators end a late-night session without resolve disagreements over not just education, but the census and contraceptives. These be among the big issues that still separate the two sides as each try to formulate a message to take home to voters for the Nov. 3 elections. On education, the issue that President Clinton have propel to the forefront and on which Republicans do not want to appear recalcitrant, both sides have agree to spend more than $1 billion but not on how to spend it. The president insist that the money be spend to hire 100,000 teachers across the country so that the average class can be reduce to 18 students. Republicans, rail against Beltway bureaucrats, say that local school districts should decide how the money be spent, whether it be for teachers or computers. As the two sides break Tuesday night, White House chief of staff Erskine Bowles, the president's top negotiator, emerge from the session saying: We don't have a deal. We make some good progress. The big issue, still, be the 100,000 teachers. He added: There be still some open issues upon which no agreement have be reached, but he sound optimistic about a session schedule for Wednesday morning. I think we've get a chance of wrap up tomorrow, he said. The two sides remain apart on several ideological matters, include whether to allow federal health plans to cover contraceptives and whether to allow those few plans with religious affiliations to refuse to cover contraceptives not only on religious grounds but on moral grounds as well. They be also split on how to conduct the census in 2000, which be one of the thorny issues. It be not one that move voters, but it be vital to both parties because it help determine their relative strength in Congress. House Speaker Newt Gingrich and Bowles meet for much of the day in the speaker's office, shuttle in and out of ante-rooms with their lieutenants but give few clues about the nitty-gritty details of their talks. They have give themselves another deadline of midnight Wednesday to wrap up about $500 billion worth of spending items, but they could easily extend that deadline another day or two. They miss have spending bills in place for the Oct. 1 start of the fiscal year, provide temporary financing for the federal government through Oct. 9, then Oct. 12, then Wednesday. Some of the other central issues, like financing for the International Monetary Fund, be all but nail down, but neither side be ready to declare a final deal until all the other elements of the budget package be in place. We're down to split infinitives, House Majority Leader Dick Armey say of approve money for the IMF. As they work through several issues, republican leaders appear to be calculate the differences in their own party that might sour a final deal when it arrive on the House floor more of a concern than the Senate floor because the Senate have few differences among its Republicans and with the White House. Some conservative Republicans say they be concern over the emerge shape of the final package, particularly elements deal with family planning and emergency spending. They say the president's proposals for emergency spending, on such items as the peacekeeping mission in Bosnia, fix the year 2000 computer bug and provide relief to American farmers, will break the limits in last year's balanced-budget agreement. The administration say such money would come from correspond cuts elsewhere in the budget, but conservatives say it come from raid the surplus. If republican leaders cannot count on their conservatives, they will need support from Democrats to pass the final package. And Democrats on Tuesday express concern over some White House positions, on issues like the census and an apparent compromise with Republicans on aid for farmers. Rep. David McIntosh, R-Ind., a leader of House conservatives, say he believe republican leaders be cede too quickly to the White House. He say that the president appear to be get his way on some issues but that what he really seem to be win be the war of public relations. The president be get what he wants; he's control the situation, McIntosh lamented. When Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott appear on television, McIntosh said, it's in reaction to the president. Nonetheless, McIntosh suggest that he could vote for a final accord. most conservatives be hold out for a good deal than we're hearing, he said, but we'll probably give them the vote because we don't see a much better alternative happen if it go down. Others be distressed, particularly about two contraceptive issues. One would require federal health plans to cover contraceptives. The other would bar overseas family-planning organizations from lobby to change abortion laws in other countries. Rep. Tom Coburn, R-Okla., say he want to see the final language on the health plan measure. As it pass both the House and the Senate, it allow for health plans with religious affiliation to decline to offer contraceptive coverage; Coburn want plan to be able to refuse such coverage on moral grounds as well. The plan cover five specific types of contraception. Coburn say he want two of those Depo-Provera and intrauterine devices to be eliminate from coverage because he say they interfere with fertilization and be therefore consider to cause abortions. Democrats like Rep. Nita Lowey, D-N.Y., who introduce the contraceptive plan in the House, say she strongly object to Coburn's position. She say that health plans base their decisions on what to offer on profits, not morals. The question be whether the White House will insist on keep the contraceptive coverage in the final package and will oppose the moral exception. If the administration allow the moral exception, it could alienate some House Democrats. House Democrats be also worry about the direction the talks be take on the census. This have always loom as one of the big issues separate Democrats and Republicans. The results of a census help determine the future power of the two political parties. But the fact that the two sides be finally talk about it now indicate that they be cover the full range of budget matters that need to be resolved. The White House have propose buying time on the matter by finance the Commerce, State and Justice departments only for five months. The Commerce Department contain the Census Bureau. White House officials say this would put off the nettlesome issue while allow a resolution of the entire spending package, but House Democrats worry it would be a prelude to give in to Republicans down the road. republican leaders like the idea of postpone a decision but say that financing should be restrict only for the Census Bureau. On several touchy environmental issues that have prompt repeat veto threats from the White House, the two sides appear to be opt for compromise over confrontation, with several disputes resolved. But a few particularly difficult issues remain under negotiation. A compromise be strike between the White House and alaskan lawmakers on log in the Tongass National Forest. But compromise still elude them on the question of build a road through a wilderness refuge to connect two communities in Alaska. A sticking point for White House and congressional budget negotiators have be the issue of how the 2000 census will be conducted, and the White House be find itself negotiate on the issue as much with House Democrats as it be with the House Republican leaders. On Monday, White House negotiators, lead by chief of staff Erskine Bowles, try to determine whether Democrats would accept a deal to finance for six months the departments of State, Justice and Commerce, which oversee the Census Bureau. The deal would put off until next March the contentious issue of whether the next census would use statistical sampling to supplement traditional methods of count people. Bowles tell the group of Democrats that the House Republicans be willing to give on a number of outstanding issues that be stall final agreement on the budget, but that they be dig in their heels when it come to finance the census for six months. The Democrats meet in the office of Minority Leader Dick Gephardt. The rationale for the half-year financing be that by next March the Supreme Court be expect to rule on whether use sampling be legal or constitutional. The Supreme Court have already agree to review two low court rulings that say sample would violate federal law. Oral arguments on the cases be set for November. But House Democrats balk at the idea of six months' finance for the census, argue that even if the Supreme Court allow sampling, the Republicans would be under no obligation to approve money for a census that include sampling. The general feeling among many Democrats be that even if we win the case, there would be a lot less leverage in March, especially if it be the only issue leave to be debated, say a House democratic official who insist on anonymity. Democrats contend that now be the time to press the Republicans, while they want to complete work on the budget and go home to campaign. Rep. Lucille Roybal-Allard, D-Calif., who attend the meeting Monday, said, It was, sort of, this be where we are. We've be able to accomplish great things, what do you think? We make it very clear that unless the census be included, along with some other issues, like school construction, the deal wouldn't be acceptable. Statistical sampling would allow the Census Bureau to estimate populations that be difficult to count, and would have the large effect on the counting of African-Americans in cities and blacks and Hispanics in rural areas, groups that be traditionally undercounted by the standard means. Republicans fear, and Democrats hope, that the method would raise the count of people live in traditionally democratic areas, give the party an advantage when new boundaries for election districts be draw follow the 2000 census. At Monday's meeting, the Democrats remind administration officials that Clinton have promise that he would veto any legislation that restrict the Census Bureau's ability to conduct an accurate census. I can't think of any way that restrict the census more than not to fully fund it, say Rep. Carolyn Maloney, D-N.Y. The willingness of House Democrats, include Gephardt, to press the president on the issue represent a realization of their leverage with Clinton, who will need all of their support in the come impeachment inquiry. Gephardt be a major player now, and the irony be we help make him that, say Rep. Christopher Shays, R-Conn., who support the use of sample in the census. The Democrats' position also indicate how little trust many have in the White House on this issue. The proposal to finance the departments of Commerce, Justice and State for six months be similar to one reach last November between Bowles and House Speaker Newt Gingrich. The idea then be that hold all three departments hostage in the census fight would place maximum pressure on all sides to work out their differences over sampling. But House Democrats be not consult before that agreement be strike and later grumble about it. At a meeting of the democratic caucus Tuesday, Ms. Maloney brief lawmakers on dealings with the White House and declare that Clinton have promise that he would hold firm on the census and that she believe him, a participant said. The statement be greet with laughter. There be a certain level of suspicion because there have be times when we have be cut out,said the House democratic official. But I have to say, there hasn't be much evidence of that, this time. struggle to meet their fourth deadline over the federal budget, congressional Republicans and White House officials wrestle Tuesday with their differences over education, the most politically high-stakes element of the budget battle. Negotiators end a late-night session without resolve disagreements over not just education, but the census and contraceptives. These be among the big issues that still separate the two sides as each try to formulate a message to take home to voters for the Nov. 3 elections. On education, the issue that President Clinton have propel to the forefront and on which Republicans do not want to appear recalcitrant, both sides have agree to spend more than $1 billion but not on how to spend it. The president insist that the money be spend to hire 100,000 teachers across the country so that the average class can be reduce to 18 students. Republicans, rail against Beltway bureaucrats, say that local school districts should decide how the money be spent, whether it be for teachers or computers. As the two sides break Tuesday night, White House chief of staff Erskine Bowles, the president's top negotiator, emerge from the session saying: We don't have a deal. We make some good progress. The big issue, still, be the 100,000 teachers. He added: There be still some open issues upon which no agreement have be reached, but he sound optimistic about a session schedule for Wednesday morning. I think we've get a chance of wrap up tomorrow, he said. The two sides remain apart on several ideological matters, include whether to allow federal health plans to cover contraceptives and whether to allow those few plans with religious affiliations to refuse to cover contraceptives not only on religious grounds but on moral grounds as well. They be also split on how to conduct the census in 2000, which be one of the thorny issues. It be not one that move voters, but it be vital to both parties because it help determine their relative strength in Congress. House Speaker Newt Gingrich and Bowles meet for much of the day in the speaker's office, shuttle in and out of ante-rooms with their lieutenants but give few clues about the nitty-gritty details of their talks. They have give themselves another deadline of midnight Wednesday to wrap up about $500 billion worth of spending items, but they could easily extend that deadline another day or two. They miss have spending bills in place for the Oct. 1 start of the fiscal year, provide temporary financing for the federal government through Oct. 9, then Oct. 12, then Wednesday. Some of the other central issues, like financing for the International Monetary Fund, be all but nail down, but neither side be ready to declare a final deal until all the other elements of the budget package be in place. We're down to split infinitives, House Majority Leader Dick Armey say of approve money for the IMF. As they work through several issues, republican leaders appear to be calculate the differences in their own party that might sour a final deal when it arrive on the House floor more of a concern than the Senate floor because the Senate have few differences among its Republicans and with the White House. Some conservative Republicans say they be concern over the emerge shape of the final package, particularly elements deal with family planning and emergency spending. They say the president's proposals for emergency spending, on such items as the peacekeeping mission in Bosnia, fix the year 2000 computer bug and provide relief to American farmers, will break the limits in last year's balanced-budget agreement. The administration say such money would come from correspond cuts elsewhere in the budget, but conservatives say it come from raid the surplus. If republican leaders cannot count on their conservatives, they will need support from Democrats to pass the final package. And Democrats on Tuesday express concern over some White House positions, on issues like the census and an apparent compromise with Republicans on aid for farmers. Rep. David McIntosh, R-Ind., a leader of House conservatives, say he believe republican leaders be cede too quickly to the White House. He say that the president appear to be get his way on some issues but that what he really seem to be win be the war of public relations.

But a few particularly difficult issues remain under negotiation. A compromise be strike between the White House and alaskan lawmakers on log in the Tongass National Forest. But compromise still elude them on the question of build a road through a wilderness refuge to connect two communities in Alaska. House and Senate negotiators agree Thursday to require most federal health plans to cover prescription contraceptives for women, give an unusual victory on Capitol Hill to advocates of abortion rights. But the future of the measure be in doubt because it be attach to a spending bill that include a controversial provision regard the Federal Election Commission. That provision could scuttle the spending bill, which would finance the Treasury Department and the Postal Service and which still must be approve by the House and Senate. The contraceptive measure would require the federal health plans, which affect 1.2 million female federal employees who be of child-bearing age, to cover the five methods of contraception that have be approve by the Food and Drug Administration for use in this country birth control pills, diaphragms, inter-uterine devices, Norplant and Depo-Provera. Currently, only 19 percent of federal health plans cover those methods. The House and Senate approve the contraceptive measure earlier this year. But the opponents of abortion be furious about the approval and persuaded Republican leaders to have negotiators reopen discussion on the matter. The cost of contraceptives have drive up the out-of-pocket cost of health care for women. And many male members of Congress seem persuade to support coverage of contraceptives for women, since almost all of the 285 federal health plans cover Viagra, the male impotency drug. Thursday, with pressure building to resolve the spending bills before Oct. 9, when temporary financing of the government expires, the negotiators agree to include the contraceptive measure in their conference report on the $13.4 billion bill for the Treasury Department and Postal service. Rep. Nita Lowey, D-N.Y., who push the contraceptive measure through the House, hail Thursday's agreement as the first major accomplishment by abortion rights advocate since the Republicans take control of Congress in 1994. She say the negotiators have agree to include the measure because in an election year they do not want to be perceive as oppose contraception or be see as reject a measure that have pass both the House and Senate. But many Democrats say the be upset that the bill contain a provision that be see as interfere with the independence of the Federal Election Commission. That provision would require a four-vote majority among the seven federal election commissioners every four years to retain the general counsel and staff director. The provision be aim at get rid of Lawrence Noble, the current general counsel, who have investigate the campaign finance practices of groups like the Christian Coalition. The contraceptive measure be one of four related matters that have help stall four spending bills. The three other bills that be stall in part because of abortion-related matters include the agriculture bill, in which there be a dispute over whether the federal Food and Drug Administration should use taxpayer money to approve drugs like RU-486, which induce abortions. The foreign operations bill be also stall over whether to finance international family planning programs that may also promote abortion, while the labor and health bill be delay because of a provision that would block access of minors to contraception. address the measure on insurance coverage for contraceptives, Helen Alvarez, a spokeswoman for the National Conference of Catholic Bishops, say that the bill be bad policy. She say contraception have fail to stem the number of abortions, teen-age pregnancies or out-of-wedlock births. Public-relations-wise, it's a good tactic for them, she conceded, but in terms of social policy, this be a failure. For the first time in decades, Congress and the White House negotiate tax and spending legislation this year with the budget in surplus. The result be chaos. The lawmakers be never able to agree on a budget resolution the framework into which all the tax and spending bills be suppose to fit. This have not happen since congressional budget procedures be establish in 1974. then, without the discipline of such an overall plan, the Senate and the House could not pass eight of the 13 spending bills need to keep the government running. So the lawmakers have to stay in session more than a week long than they have hoped. Finally, they lump all eight bills together this week and announce an agreement. But the only way they could get this far be to resort to gimmicks. One be to designate $20 billion as emergency expenditures so that programs do not have to be cut elsewhere to offset the new spending. This will use up more than one-quarter of the anticipated budget surplus in the current fiscal year. Another gimmick extend the tax break for Individual Retirement Accounts to couples with incomes from $100,000 to $150,000. This will actually raise a small amount of revenue in the next five years the period cover by budget accounting but it will make the picture considerably worse in later years. As hard as it be to negotiate a budget in the bad old days of budget deficits, say the politicians involved, it be exponentially more difficult this year. At least in years past, there be a common goal. as much as they disagree on policy and principle, they be all aim at a reduction in the deficit. This year, some members of Congress want to use the surplus for a big tax cut. Others want to pay off the national debt. Others want to spend part of it on medical research, schools and weapons for the Pentagon. Others want to spend large sums on highways. still others want to continue cut government spending. And that be just among the Republicans. The Democrats have their own ideas about the budget, and President Clinton lay down his marker about save the surplus until a way be find to shore up the Social Security system. In budget terms, say Robert Reischauer, a former director of the congressional budget office, this be like the end of the Cold War. There be other differences as well in the way things be negotiate with the budget in a surplus. In 1990, 1993 and 1995, when politicians stake their careers on strike a budget deal to lower the deficit, the fundamental question be how to divide up the bitter medicine of more taxes and less spending. Republicans, for the most part, opposed tax increases and favor cut spending on social programs. Democrats want to raise taxes, especially on the rich, and protect social spending. In the end, balances be carefully drawn. But plenty of politicians President George Bush, to name one lose their jobs in the process. This year, with Democrats and Republicans alike claim victory, the burn issue be how to parcel out the candy. Democrats get more money for education and farm assistance. Republicans get more money for the military and an extension of popular tax breaks for businesses. Some of the $20 billion that will eat into the surplus really will go for emergencies, like relief for victims of Hurricane Georges. But much of the money, like the $90 million that will pay for six new helicopters for the national police in Colombia to use in drug interdiction, be designate emergency spending simply because there be no other way to get it into the budget. For the politicians, the new way be more fun. It be hard to imagine that anyone will be vote out of office because of this year's budget. But that do not make it easy to reach an agreement. The other big difference be that the principal fights this year be not over money at all. They involve delicate policy issues like needle exchanges, contraception, global warming, immigration and the census. In Congress, there be no consensus on these matters. so the only way policy could be set be to wrap them into the giant spending bill. It may be more pleasant to debate policy than money. But it be probably harder to find a way to split the difference. as long as the surplus lasts, the lack of discipline that characterize the budget-writing this year be likely to continue. This be distress to those devote to control government spending. The temptation, say L. Ari Fleischer, spokesman for the House Ways and Means Committee, be to grab the loot and spend it. Some conservatives sound notes of discord Friday over the federal spending agreement, but they also say they would probably vote for the $500 billion package because it boost defense spending and provide aid to farmers. However, no one can vote on the package just yet, because it be not finished. The deal that President Clinton and Republican leaders hail Thursday be a broad outline of areas of agreement on the final portion of the $1.7 trillion budget, not a write document. That be now be craft by the chairmen of the spending committees and their aides, who say Friday that there be still dispute that need to be resolve and that the final document could run to more than 3,000 pages. For example, still unresolved be a dispute over whether airlines can create a peanut-free zone to protect passengers who be allergic to peanuts. House Speaker Newt Gingrich and other members from Georgia, a major peanut-producing state, be fight the proposal, which would force airlines to ban peanuts within three rows of someone with an allergy. Congress give itself until midnight Tuesday to vote on the final bill, agree with President Clinton to a fifth extension of temporary financing to keep the government open. The budget be due Oct. 1, the start of the new fiscal year. The vote be initially expect Friday, but the bill be nowhere near to be written. only a handful of top-level bargainers include Gingrich, Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott and White House chief of staff Erskine Bowles be in the room for the final deal. Excluded be the committee chairmen and the heads of the appropriation committees, who now must write the language that will put the deal into law. Almost everyone on Capitol Hill expect the budget to pass eventually, with the big defections come from conservatives who object to the $20 billion take from the surplus to address so-called emergencies and for the package's failure to offer voters a serious tax cut. The lag time before the bill be officially close be make some conservatives nervous that more members will try to add provisions that will far expand a bill they already consider overly bloated. And some worry that once the hometown pork that be stuff into the bill be publicly revealed, voters could put pressure on members not to support it. The elections be Nov. 3. But several conservatives say that despite these problems, they expect to support the bill anyway. Rep. Mark Souder, R-Ind., said: `most of my friends, who be predominantly activist conservatives, be split about 50-50. If tax cuts be your primary thing, then you're unhappy, but many conservatives have a mixed agenda. My position is, hold the nose and vote yes. We have no tax cuts and far too much spending that I oppose, but that's the nature of compromise. Every member have a little different focus. Souder say he like the extra money for defense spending, and he like the price supports for farmers. Hog farmers in his district, whose big customers be Japan and China, have be hit hard by the collapse of asian markets. Several Republicans say that the bill seem skew in favor of the Democrats. They cite two reasons: Clinton need to curry favor with Democrats to shore up support if the House vote to impeach him, and republican leaders fear that if they have stand up to Clinton, they might have force a government shutdown and Republicans would be blamed. Clinton be buy votes, say Rep. David Hobson, R-Ohio. He be suck up to the liberal Democrats so they would support him in impeachment. Rep. W.J. (Billy) Tauzin, R-La., say the leaders seem motivate by a desire to avoid the political damage they incur from the partial government shutdowns of 1995 and 1996. He also cite the president's need to placate the left by add costly domestic programs. The combination of the lessons learn three years ago and the scandal on the president's side yield the inevitable result, a budget that lean way to the left, Tauzin said. Still, he say he would probably support the bill. It won't be enthusiastically, he said. It won't be hold my nose either. I would have prefer to spend more of this money on a tax cut. I think we would have get a tax cut, but for the scandal. If the president have not be catch up with the scandal, he probably would have follow the Dick Morris strategy and move towards the center. Gingrich say he recognize that some conservatives be wary of the agreement. But he seek to reassure them that the package serve their interests. He cite a $9 billion increase in defense spending. And he note that the Republicans have block several items, include needle-exchange programs in the District of Columbia, national education test and U.S. contributions to a United Nations program that pay for family planning in China, which many in Congress object to because China have a policy of coerce abortions and force sterilization. Gingrich say the agreement be the best that could be achieve when you have a conservative Republican Congress and a liberal Democratic president. Some conservatives who have be especially critical be more understanding Thursday. Rep. David McIntosh, R-Ind., a leader of conservatives in the House, have denounce the bill earlier as a Great Society type of big-spending program. Friday, after a meeting of Republicans, he said, Our leadership find themselves in a bad situation and do a good job. A few remain outright hostile to the bill, as much for the hasty way in which it be cobble together as for what it contained. Rep. Joe Barton, R-Texas, said: `I'm voting `no' unless something revolutionary happens between now and Tuesday. I think it's the process that give the president the ability to stonewall until the very end and then hold us for ransom. The republican leadership in the House and Senate do a good job of limit the highway robbery, but it's still go too far beyond the spending caps. also angry at the rushed endgame be Rep. Gene Taylor, D-Miss., who take to the House floor and say he could not support the final bill. I'm go to urge my colleagues to vote `no,' Taylor said. We have stay here this long. We can stay a little bit longer. And I be go to encourage my colleagues to continue to vote no until we be give adequate time to study the measure that be bring before us. Voting mainly on party lines on a question that have become a touchstone in the debate over development and preservation of wilderness, the Senate on Thursday approve a gravel road through remote wildlife habitat in Alaska. The road, barely 30 miles long, would slice across the edge of a wildlife refuge and wilderness area on the aleutian Peninsula, where it would connect an isolated village call King Cove to a long-range air strip in the town of Cold Bay. Without the road, its backers say, about 700 residents of King Cove must continue to use unreliable air and boat service in emergencies, often risk dangerous winds and seas as they seek medical evacuation to Anchorage. Opponents of the road call the project an unjustifiable precedent that threaten the seasonal breeding grounds of protected migratory birds, and they say that improved air or sea service would be a good alternative. The vote Thursday, 59-38, be a victory for the state's congressional delegation. But with President Clinton likely to veto the measure, the final outcome may depend on whether its sponsors can insert the road proposal into a huge spending bill that be likely to emerge just before Congress heads home for the Nov. 3 elections. Three Republicans vote against the bill, and six Democrats vote for it. The Clinton administration have repeatedly warn that it will veto a big spending bill if it contain an array of anti-environmental provisions that be under consideration. Indeed, the White House seem to be itch for a partisan fight over environmental priorities. But while many Republicans in Congress still appear reluctant to engage in that broad fight, they be willing Thursday to cast their lot with the Senate's two powerful Alaskans, Ted Stevens and Frank Murkowski, both Republicans. A companion bill in the House, sponsor by Rep. Don Young of Alaska, also a Republican, have not come to the floor. even Sen. John Chafee of Rhode Island, a leader of Republican environmentalists, vote for the road. last February Chafee's staff have assemble a score of environmental lobbyists in his office to plan strategy for oppose the road, environmental advocates say Thursday. They speculate that the senator have change his position out of deference to the power of Stevens, who as chairman of the Appropriations Committee exert tremendous influence at a time when a dozen spending bills be in their final stages. A Chafee aide say Chafee vote reluctantly for the road after Alaska's senators convince him of its merits. Stevens say in angry tones Thursday that two-thirds of Alaska's land be off limits to development and that vital health services be be deny to his state's residents. We can't use it without permission from some bureaucrat who be compel by extreme environmentalists, he said. They be so extreme that they say this 330,000-acre Izembek refuge, the small wilderness in Alaska, be so sacrosanct that it can't move its border 60 feet. But Sen. Dale Bumpers, D-Ark., call the road project a dangerous precedent. build a road through a wilderness in Alaska, no matter how short or how long, would be the first time in the nation we have vote deliberately to authorize a road through a wilderness area, Bumpers said. And once you go down that road, nobody know where it be go to end. struggle to meet their fourth deadline over the federal budget, congressional Republicans and White House officials wrestle Tuesday with their differences over education, stag events to demonstrate support for what have become the most public and politically high-stakes element of the budget battle. Negotiators meet into the night to hash out their disagreements over aid for schools, the census and contraceptives. These be among the big issues that still separate the two sides as each try to formulate a message to take home to voters for the Nov. 3 elections. On education, the issue that President Clinton have propel to the forefront of the talks and on which Republicans do not want to appear recalcitrant, both sides have agree to spend more than $1 billion but disagree over how to spend it.

The two sides remain apart on several ideological matters, include whether to allow federal health plans to cover contraceptives and whether to allow those few plans with religious affiliations to refuse to cover contraceptives not only on religious grounds but on moral grounds as well. And they also be split on how to conduct the census in the year 2000. This be one of the thorny issues. It be not one that move voters, but it be vital to both parties because it help determine their relative strength in Congress. House Speaker Newt Gingrich and Erskine Bowles, the president's chief of staff and top negotiator, meet for much of the day in the speaker's office, shuttle in and out of ante-rooms with their lieutenants but give few clues about the nitty gritty details of their talks. They have give themselves another deadline of midnight Wednesday to wrap up about $500 billion-worth of spending items, but they could easily extend that deadline another day or two. They miss the Oct. 1 start of the fiscal year, provide temporary funding for the federal government through Oct. 9, then Oct. 12, then Wednesday.

We're down to split infinitives, Rep. Dick Armey of Texas, the Republican majority leader, say of approve funds for the international fund. As they work through several issues, republican leaders appear to be calculate the differences in their own party that might sour a final deal when it arrive on the House floor more of a concern than on the Senate floor because the Senate have few differences among its Republicans and with the White House.

If tax cuts be your primary thing, then you're unhappy, but many conservatives have a mixed agenda. My position is, hold the nose and vote yes. We have no tax cuts and far too much spending that I oppose, but that's the nature of compromise. Every member have a little different focus. Souder say he like the extra money for defense spending, and he like the price supports for farmers. Hog farmers in his district, whose big customers be Japan and China, have be hit hard by the collapse of asian markets. ","Whether to use the 1st surplus in decades for a tax cut, to pay off the national debt, or for new initiatives made the 1998 federal budget negotiations chaotic.The Oct 1 start of the fiscal year was extended 5 times.Major issues were census statistical sampling, federal health plan coverage of contraceptives regardless of religious affiliation, and school aid decisions by the federal gov't or local jurisdictions.Other issues included a Federal Election Commission provision, a road through an Alaskan wildlife refuge, and an airline peanut ban.Committees crafted the budget document after broad agreement was reached when 8 bills were lumped together.","In 1998, for the first time in decades, the US budget negotiators faced a surplus.Both sides said this was harder than a deficit situation, but they finally spent $1.7 trillion.The last seven spending bills were the most difficult and finally were merged into one package.Controversial issues included health insurance paying for contraception, control of new education allocations, an Alaskan wilderness road, whether the 2000 census would include statistical sampling, and establishing an emergency fund.Conservatives felt the results favored the liberals, but both sides were satisfied and glad to finish before Election Day and avoid a government shutdown.","Budget negotiations between the White House and House Republicans were delayed on several issues.At issue were provisions that included requiring Federal Health Insurance providers to provide contraceptives to women as Well as a provision to build a road across a wildlife preserve in Alaska.The contraceptive issue faced an uncertain future while Clinton likely will veto the road.There is disagreement also on how to spend the funding on education.This year's budget discussions also have been hampered because it is the first time since budget procedures were established in 1974 that there has been a surplus, preventing agreement on a budget resolution.","After several deadline extensions, Congressional leaders and the White House agreed on an omnibus spending package, the final portion of the $1.7 trillion budget.It includes more money for education and defense, business tax breaks, and farm aid, as well as funds for Colombia to use in drug interdiction.To offset the new spending, the surplus will be tapped for $20 billion, to the ire of conservatives.This year, without the common goal of reducing the deficit, reaching agreement was very difficult.Policy provisions involving the 2000 census, contraception, and the Alaskan wilderness were also tied to the spending package and were hotly debated."

There will be no turmoil if Yeltsin leave the political arena. The government be already in charge, (prime Minister Yevgeny) Primakov be strong enough and have the support of the security services, say Yevgeny Volk, director of the Moscow office of the u.s.-based Heritage Foundation. Everyone know Yeltsin be ail and be politically weakened, he said. Yeltsin have a history of health problems, and underwent heart bypass surgery in 1996.

The vote in the Federation Council, which be make up of regional leaders, be 79 to 18 in favor, russian news agencies reported. It do not pas because it require a simple majority of 90 votes. The motion carry no legal weight, but it reflect grow anti-yeltsin sentiment in a chamber that have generally support him. The prime minister reiterate Wednesday that Yeltsin have no plans to resign or call early elections. There be no reason for rock the boat and demand anyone's resignation, Primakov said, accord to the Interfax news agency. What happen to the anti-crisis steps if elections be hold now? Yeltsin's resignation be highly unlikely. If he be to step down or die, Primakov would take power and elections would have to be hold within three months. many Russians view Yeltsin with increase pity. I feel for him. He's clearly not a healthy person, film director Vladimir Khotinenko be quote as say by the daily Kommersant. It's time for him to step aside. Doctors order the president to stay in bed Tuesday and his spokesman, Dmitry Yakushkin, have say Yeltsin would not be in the office all week.

They say Yeltsin be be treat with antibiotics and there be no plans to hospitalize him. Yeltsin, 67, have a history of health problems, include quintuple heart bypass surgery two years ago, so whenever he get sick there be a flurry of speculation about his ability to function. Yeltsin insist he have no major illness and plans to serve out the remain two years of his term. Yakushkin, his spokesman, reiterate Tuesday there be no talk about an early resignation. It's not be discussed, he said. I be personally against such a resignation because I think it would only bring peril to the nation. Yakushkin and other aides seek to play down the seriousness of Yeltsin's illness. Don't panic, Dad be OK, Yeltsin's daughter Tatiana Dyachenko, who be his official image adviser, tell the Kommersant business newspaper. Yakushkin say Yeltsin's personal doctor, Sergei Mironov, confirm that the president be suffer from a respiratory infection know as tracheal bronchitis and that his condition be stable. He must stay in bed like any other person, Yakushkin said. However, know the president's character, he be certain to start work with documents and make phone calls to russian politicians as well as foreign leaders in view of the current situation in Kosovo. But the Nezavisimaya Gazeta newspaper say in a front-page editorial Tuesday that Yeltsin's condition suggest he be suffer from something bad than a cold. It say his absence from the Kremlin during the current economic crisis amounts to a state catastrophe and call on Yeltsin to immediately surrender most of his powers to Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov. A Communist lawmaker also call for an urgent medical check ... on the russian president's health to determine whether he be fit to remain in office, the Interfax news agency said. Yeltsin's obvious inability to perform his functions be damage russian state authority, as power be be misuse by the clique close to the president, say Viktor Ilyukhin, chairman of parliament's security committee. The health of the president, who be also commander-in-chief of the russian military, be a direct threat to the country's national security and a factor of serious concern regard Russia's nuclear weapons, he said. other newspapers give a detailed description of Yeltsin's weaknesses and his erratic behavior on the trip to the former soviet republics of Uzbekistan and Kazakstan his first foray abroad since a visit to Britain in May. The president appear stiff and stumble when he arrive Sunday in Uzbekistan's capital of Tashkent. He have to be support by Uzbek President Islam Karimov and cancel his other public events.

It do not say what have cause them. Russia's Constitutional Court open hearings Thursday on whether Boris Yeltsin can seek a third term. The issue be controversial earlier this year when Yeltsin refuse to spell out his intentions and his aides insist he have the legal right to seek re-election. It have lose some of its urgency, as Yeltsin have grow physically and politically weak and have say he will not run again. The court will take at least a week to consider the issue, the Interfax news agency reported. The russian Constitution have a two-term limit for presidents. But Yeltsin's aides say his first term, from 1991 to 1996, do not count because it begin six months before the Soviet Union collapse and before the current constitution take effect. Communists and other Yeltsin opponents in parliament's lower house, the State Duma, disagreed and appeal to the Constitutional Court in February. While the case have be wait to be heard, events have overtake it. Yeltsin have flatly say he will not seek another term, and the opposition have concentrate its efforts on demand an early resignation, rid a wave of popular discontent over the economic crisis. The call for Yeltsin to step down be back by many participants in a nationwide labor action earlier this month that attract about 1 million people. Yeltsin's grow health problems would also seem to rule out another election campaign. A respiratory infection force him to cut short a trip to Central Asia earlier this week. On Wednesday, parliament's upper chamber, the Federation Council, vote on a resolution call on Yeltsin to resign, but it fail narrowly. even if have passed, the move would have have no legal consequences, but it highlight grow anti-yeltsin sentiments in the chamber make up of powerful regional leaders, most of whom have be loyal to the president. Mikhail Mityukov, the presidential representative on the Constitutional Court, say Thursday that Yeltsin would ignore calls for an early resignation. The president be a strong person, and he have be through far more difficult political situations, Mityukov said, accord to Interfax. Russian President Boris Yeltsin, who be still recuperate from his late illness, have cancel a trip to an asian summit next month, his office say Friday.

Yeltsin have decide to send Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov to the November summit of the asia-pacific Economic Forum in Kuala Lumpur because it deal mostly with financial issues, Yeltsin's office said. But sources in Primakov's office say the cancellation be due to concerns about how the long flight might effect the president's health. The president have be suffer from bronchitis and a cold this week, which force him to cut short a visit to Central Asia on Monday.

In another development, Moscow Mayor Yuri Luzhkov, consider a potential presidential candidate, say Thursday that he wouldn't exclude the possibility of Yeltsin's resignation for health reasons. In an interview with the british Broadcasting Corp., he stop short of call on Yeltsin to step down. But Luzhkov have always be supportive of Yeltsin and have never before question the president's health or ability to govern. accord to our constitution, the president himself have to say he be not able to work, Luzhkov say in an interview with the BBC in Moscow. And because of (Yeltsin's) poor health, he be no longer able to give the country as much time as it demands. Luzhkov's spokesman Mikhail Solomentsev refuse to elaborate on the statement. Yeltsin have a long history of health problems, include a heart bypass surgery two years ago. Each new ailment rekindles speculation about his fitness to govern. The president and his doctors say Yeltsin have no serious health problems and will serve out the final two years of his term. President Boris Yeltsin's doctors have pronounce his health more or less normal, his wife Naina say in an interview publish Wednesday. Mrs. Yeltsin tell the Argumenty i Fakty weekly that she hesitate even to touch on her husband's health when there be so much conjecture on this topic. Still, she note that he have regular medical check-ups. The doctors say now: Everything be more or less normal, Mrs. Yeltsin declared. The 67-year-old Yeltsin's health have long be a concern, and the worry have be amplify by the secrecy surround his condition. Yeltsin suffer from heart disease during the 1996 presidential election and have a heart attack, follow by multiple bypass surgery, in the months after his victory. Mrs. Yeltsin express understand for Russians who take part Wednesday in protests for unpaid wages. She also say that criticism of the president be normal, though it be offensive when it focus on anything other than his professional performance, such as his age. It seem to me ... that people expect a miracle from him, Mrs. Yeltsin said. But surely you can't curse a person for not be a magician. Mrs. Yeltsin refute rumors that her family would leave Russia after Yeltsin leave office in 2000 as absolute nonsense. I think we'll live like all normal people. At least it will be calm than it be now. russian President Boris Yeltsin cut short a trip to Central Asia on Monday due to a respiratory infection that revive questions about his overall health and ability to lead Russia through a sustained economic crisis. Yeltsin's premature return to Moscow also prompt doubts about his capacity to respond decisively in the Kosovo crisis, in which Russia have be lead a campaign to forestall airstrikes. Moscow's NTV station say it be a crucial time for Russia, when presidential decisions be needed. There be no indication that Yeltsin's illness would sideline him for any length of time, and aides say the president would maintain his schedule for the rest of the week.

1033,"Microsoft Corp. have say that material in an unpublished book by two business school professors will be a crucial part of its defense in the antitrust trial schedule to begin next week. But judge from an advance copy of the manuscript, the Justice Department and 20 states that be sue the software giant will find support for their arguments in the book as well. To cite one example, Microsoft contend that its industry-standard Windows operating system and its Internet Explorer browser be a single integrate product. In its suit, the government assert that they be two separate products that Microsoft bundle together to get an unfair edge over its rival, Netscape Communications Corp., in the market for software use to browse the Internet's World Wide Web. In compete on Internet Time: Lessons from Netscape and Its Battle with Microsoft, the authors, Michael A. Cusumano of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology's Sloan School of Management and David B. Yoffie of the Harvard business school, quote a Microsoft executive as say that only with the third version of Microsoft's browser be it integrate with Windows. Microsoft hurry its first browser offerings into the market, the book says, in its race to catch up with Netscape, then take a more ambitious approach with Internet Explorer 3.0, which be introduce in August 1996. In that version it change its software design to use program modules, or components, that could be put together and rearragned like build blocks. In the book, Ben Slivka, a Microsoft general manager, be quote as saying, IE 3.0 be the key thing because we do the componentized browser, He added, We really make Internet Explorer part of the Windows platform. The timing could be legally significant because in its suit the government cite as evidence requests before August 1996 by personal computer makers that want to load Netscape's browser on their machines instead of Microsoft's browser. Microsoft deny the requests, insist its browers and Windows be a single, integrate product. Microsoft's legal team obtain an early manuscript of the new book last month, by issue a subpoena to a Netscape executive who be give a confidential copy by the authors to review. Microsoft have also seek the transcripts of 44 current and former Netscape employees interview by the authors. A federal judge in Boston last week deny Microsoft access to that research materials, but the company may appeal the ruling. The new book, publish by the Free Press imprint of Simon &AMP; Schuster, be be hurry into print so it can be ship within days of the start of the Microsoft trial on Oct. 19. But already, a few quotes from Netscape executives have leak out. The authors decide to send the complete manuscript to The New York Times and three other news organizations Monday, so that the material could be read in context. Microsoft intend to use material from the book as evidence that Netscape's troubles result largely from its own missteps rather than from any alleged predatory practices by Microsoft. The book do detail where Netscape stumbled, shift its strategy too often and run into obstacles in its software development efforts. In private antitrust suits, the argument that the competitor be his own bad enemy be an established defense. But legal experts say that defense may well be far less effective in a federal case in which the government be seek court-mandated changes in Microsoft's business practices rather than the monetary damages that be the goal of plaintiffs in private cases. It seem to me that this debate over Netscape's mistakes be a total sideshow, say Robert Litan, a former senior official in the Justice Department's antitrust division, who be now at the Brookings Institution. But Microsoft have a big legal team, and it seem they be work on every defense they can find. The book quote a former Netscape executive, Ram Shriram, as say the company bungle a chance to win a sizable share of the browser business from America Online Inc. But that be a second-chance to do a deal with America Online, the lead online service. The government's case focus on an early deal in March 1996, when America Online choose Internet Explorer as its preferred browser; in that bargain Microsoft agree to place a startup icon for the online service on the main Windows desktop screen the prime real estate in computing. For a book entitle compete on Internet Time, it be intrigue that one of its central themes be that Netcape get too wed to the notion that the Internet revolution would change everything quickly. Microsoft, by contrast, stick to its three-year planning horizon that enable the company, the authors write, to mesh its short-run tactical plans with a broad strategic view of how to win the war. The book quote Steve Ballmer, Microsoft's president, as saying, The fact of the matter be that customers can't take cataclysmic change every three months. The organization also can't. You can ship products quickly. But you can't say, `oh, we have a radically new strategy' every three months. The government's antitrust scrutiny of Microsoft, the world's large independent software company, have span Republican and democratic administrations and involved hundreds of government lawyers and investigators. But it have by no means be an example of consistent, coordinate public policy. Nor, by all accounts, of politics. Instead, like the software industry itself, the government's pursuit of Microsoft have take leaps, hit dead ends and evolve in ways no one could have control or predict back when it start in 1989. It be in November of that year, on a hot afternoon at a computer-industry convention in Las Vegas, Nev., that Bill Gates, Microsoft's chairman, look like he'd be drag to the news conference with a senior executive from IBM which at the time dominate Microsoft and the entire computer industry. The two companies IBM, then the lead maker of personal computers and Microsoft, the leader in pc operating system software be collaborate on the design and marketing of a new operating system call OS/2. But Microsoft be also begin to sell a compete product, Windows. The industry trade press be full of worried articles: which system be go to become the new standard? With Gates stand uncomfortably at his side, James Cannavino, an IBM divisional president, say that the two companies want to clear the air. OS/2 be the future, he said. As for Windows, he added, it would remain a niche product for under-equipped computers. Windows, he asserted, would never receive all the advanced features of OS/2. Gates certainly do not look happy. But he do not disagree. The news conference get little attention, just a few articles deep inside newspapers and trade publications. But a few weeks later, Norris Washington, a senior antitrust lawyer with the Federal Trade Commission, happen to read one of those articles, in Byte magazine. IBM and Microsoft have now define their unified vision of graphical operating environments, the article said, and it look sort of like a U.S. economic model, divide into lower-, middle- and upper-class products. As Washington saw it, IBM and Microsoft be collude to divide the operating-system market a potential violation of antitrust law. Soon the FTC staff open an investigation of Microsoft and IBM And since that small first step, Microsoft have be under unrelenting scrutiny from federal antitrust investigators for a constantly evolve series of allegations and charges, month after month, year after year, for the last nine years. now come the antitrust trial schedule to begin on Monday, with a multiplicity of charges weave of threads draw from more than a dozen different investigative inquiries during that nine-year span. Microsoft, today the most feared company in the software business and carry a stock-market value of nearly $234 billion, present a huge and highly visible antitrust target. Yet, while the company's allies ask, What be the Clinton administration's political agenda in go after Microsoft? the answer seem to be there be none. In interviews, more than a dozen current and former senior antitrust officials whether friends of the government or of Microsoft all say the Justice Department's antitrust suit be a natural outgrowth of the previous investigations. As for politics, all the officials agree that the antitrust division operate independent of the administration's political considerations. Charles Rule be the assistant attorney general who head the antitrust division during the Bush administration, and he be now a Washington lawyer who serve as an adviser and advocate for Microsoft. When I be there, Rule say of his Justice days, the White House be punctilious in terms of never get involve in whatever we decide to do. There be no communication between antitrust and other branches of government. ask if he believe that policy have change under the Clinton administration, he said: not really. I've see nothing to suggest it. Joel Klein head the antitrust division now, and in an interview deal with his division's role in the Clinton administration's technology policy, not specifically relate to the Microsoft case, he said: There be no statutory restriction, but as a practical matter, civil and criminal prosecutions be invariably carry out without any political contact. Klein said, by way of examples, that he might discuss merger cases involve military or aviation industries with the Defense Department or Transportation Department. But never the White House, he said. For a significant case, we might call the White House and say `an hour from now we be go to hold a press conference.' The last time there be any interference, he added, be the Dita Beard-ITT case. Mrs. Beard, a lobbyist for ITT Corp., be accuse in 1972 of have write a memo say that a $400,000 donation to the Republican National Convention have go a long way toward settle antitrust suits bring against the company by the Nixon administration's Justice Department. The authenticity of the memo be never proved, and Mrs. Beard always deny write it. In any case, Klein says, since Watergate, it's be immaculate. In the case of Microsoft, neither President Clinton nor Vice President Al Gore have ever volunteer a comment. In answer to a question during a news conference in May, just before the suit be filed, Clinton said: I have take the view that I should not comment on matters within the Justice Department. At this time, I do not think I should depart from that policy on this case, even though it obviously will have a big impact on an important sector of our economy. But I have to say, base on what I know to date, I have confidence in the way the antitrust division in the Justice Department have handle the matter. Since then, Clinton have say nothing else about the case, publicly at least. And Gore, who generally represent the administration on technology issues, have never comment at all. In Rule's opinion, the administration would be foolish to involve itself, even if it be politically acceptable to do so. It would be a little odd for the administration to push the Justice Department in this suit, he said. It would be a policy mistake and a political mistake. I would be hard press to explain why they would do that. Taking sides in the highly charge technology world be dangerous, particularly since the Democrats rely on Silicon Valley companies for political donations and support. In fact, the present and former government officials all say the suit be simply a natural extension of the inquiries conduct during the last nine years. They begin at the FTC. Soon after Washington read that article in Byte, the FTC staff open an investigation of the Windows-OS/2 question. But as have happen so often in the following years, turn in the market make the initial inquiry irrelevant. Microsoft abandon its agreement with IBM, and Windows quickly grow to be the industry standard, while OS/2 remain a cipher. But as that issue faded, once government investigators begin look at Microsoft they find other things that trouble them. In 1991 Washington, who still work for the FTC, inform Microsoft that the investigation be be expanded. The agency, his letter said, be now try to determine whether Microsoft be use its dominant position in operating-systems software to stifle competition in other areas. That general idea lie at the heart of the present suit. One former senior FTC official say the commission staff have confidence in the case but realize that the Reagan-era commissioners, who have to approve any suit, might have a different view. We know the commission might have difficulty with a monopolization case, the former official said. They hadn't bring a case in years. And in fact, in 1993 the commission vote 2-2 on the question of whether to file formal charges. The deadlock serve as a dismissal. Then, a few months later, the Justice Department decide to pick up the case. It be far along than most cases we got, recall Robert Litan, a former senior official in the Justice Department's antitrust division who be now at the Brookings Institution. Usually a case would be two or three people complain and a few documents, he said. But this be a fully research record. They give us the files and brief us on what they have done. The Justice Department lawyers pick up the same thread. The general idea behind our inquiry, Litan said, be that they should not be allow to use their monopoly in operate systems to cement a monopoly in other areas. In 1995, Microsoft and the government reach a consent agreement in which the company promise to stop force pc makers to buy one copy of a Microsoft operating system for every computer sell instead of one for every computer on which the operating system, MS-DOS or Windows, be installed. The company also agree to stop tie the sale of one software product to the sale of another. The charges in the present suit be similar in many ways. even with the agreement, the government investigations continued. That same year, Justice Department investigators show up at the offices of Netscape Communications Corp. for the first time to ask questions about their next line of inquiry. America Online have be complaining, a senior Netscape executive recalled, because Microsoft be bundle the Microsoft Network, a compete online service, with Windows. Once more, market forces overtake the investigation. The Microsoft Network never grow particularly popular while America Online prosper and grew. But, not surprisingly, new complaints fill the void. In May 1995, Anne Bingaman, the assistant attorney general who head the antitrust division, remarked: We get complaints about Microsoft all the time. We have become a kind of Microsoft complaints center. And we take them very seriously. In 1996, Netscape's first complaint arrived. In a letter to the Justice Department, Netscape say that Microsoft be use its dominance in personal-computer operate systems to force or persuade computer makers to favor Microsoft's browser, use to explore the World Wide Web, over the one market by Netscape. The next year the Justice Department formally charge Microsoft with violate the consent agreement by tie sales of Windows to installation of the company's Web browser on new computers. It seem like a slam-dunk violation of the consent decree, a natural extension of that case, recall Litan, who have leave the department by then. A Federal District Court judge agreed, but an Appeals Court panel overturn that rule this summer. In the meantime, last May the Justice Department and 20 state attorneys general file their new suit against Microsoft, which be schedule for trial on Monday. It contend that Microsoft have engage in bundling, tying and other predatory behavior similar in many ways to the numerous previous allegations and investigations of the last nine years. A good part of this case be just Round II of the case we deal with in Round I, in the early in the 1990s, Litan said. Or, as the former senior FTC official put it, there's certainly a common thread that run all the way through here. But through the years that thread have be twisted, pull and spin by hundreds of different hands. The case of United States vs. Microsoft Corp., the government's most aggressive move against a monopolist in almost 25 years, be play out against a century of antitrust laws so broadly worded and court rulings so ambiguous that both sides be cite the same rulings to support their oppose arguments. Whatever the outcome of the trial, schedule to begin Monday in U.S. District Court in Washington, an almost certain appeal will leave to the Supreme Court the task of bring legal order to 100 years of clash antitrust doctrines. The case focus on Microsoft's Windows, the operating system that control about 90 percent of all personal computers sell today. The government say its objective be to curb illegal monopolistic business practices that threaten to render large parts of the economy vulnerable to the vicissitudes of a single company. Microsoft assert that the case be intend to give the government control over which features can be add to Windows. however grand the economic stakes, the legal dispute be narrow. The government say that Microsoft's contracts with computer manufacturers and with companies that provide access to the Internet illegally stifle competition. The contracts prohibit manufacturers from substitute Netscape Communications Corp.'s Navigator browser for Microsoft's Internet Explorer. They also prohibit them from remove from the Windows main screen, or desktop, links to sites on the World Wide Web run by Microsoft or its partners. Microsoft's contracts with companies that connect people to the Internet and with businesses that sell goods and services on the Web require favor treatment for Internet Explorer over Navigator in exchange for links on the Windows desktop. In the wake of the lawsuit, Microsoft have voluntarily drop some of these requirements, though it could reinstate them at will. Microsoft say that its contracts be legal because they produce tangible benefits for customers, include easy Internet access. The Justice Department say that the bundling of Explorer with Windows 95 and the inclusion of the browser as part of Windows 98 amount to tying, an illegal practice that force customers of one product to purchase another. The contracts with manufacturers and Internet services be illegal, the government says, because they be intend not only to create a monopoly in the browser market but to protect Microsoft's exist monopoly in operating systems. The latter threat be key, accord to the Justice Department. Browsers have the potential, like an operating system, to act as a software platform on which other programs run. so contracts intend to drive browsers out of the market would also insulate the Windows monopoly. many antitrust experts say the problem face the Justice Department be that the courts have provide no clear definition of tie and no clear guidelines for determine when contracts be illegally exclusionary. Professor Lawrence White of New York University, who be chief economist of the Justice Department's antitrust division in the early 1980s, say that the courts treat tie as an unusual practice when in fact it be ubiquitous. No one, he said, would challenge the right of manufacturers to tie erasers to the tip of pencils, tires to an automobile or buttons to shirts. His point, share widely among economists, be that some tie benefits consumers if, for example, it results in products that be easy to use or enable a company to recover development costs. But tying can be bad if it lock in monopoly power. The courts, White says, have not offer enough guidance for distinguish good tying from bad, which be the nub of the legal dispute. Microsoft say it need only to show that bundle Windows and Explorer pass what might be call a gross consumer benefits test that it offer an immediate benefit, whether or not it cause long-term damage to competition and, therefore, ultimately to consumers. The Justice Department say that Microsoft's practices must clear a high hurdle: yield net consumer benefits that be immediate and large enough to balance possible long-term harm to competition. So which test of consumer benefits satisfies antitrust laws? The simple answer be that no one know for sure, which be why both sides can reasonably cite the same cases without fear of embarrassment. Consider a 1985 case, Aspen Skiing Co. vs. Aspen Highlands Skiing Corp., and a 1951 case, Lorain Journal Co. vs. United States. In the first, Aspen Skiing, the owner of three major ski run in Aspen, Colo. the monopolist have for years sell a ticket in cooperation with Aspen Highlands, a competitor, that give skiers access to both companies' runs. When Aspen Skiing unilaterally cancel the agreement, its rival's revenues shrivel and the rival sued. The Supreme Court rule that Aspen Skiing have violate antitrust laws because there be no evidence its action help consumers. In the Lorain Journal case, the only local newspaper in Lorain, Ohio, refuse to sell advertising to companies that advertise on a new radio station. Here, too, the Supreme Court rule that the exclusionary practice do nothing to benefit consumers. Indeed, in Aspen Skiing, the court even force the monopolist to do business with its rival, a precedent that augur well for the Justice Department, which seek to force Microsoft to install Netscape's browser alongside its own. But Charles Rule, a legal consultant to Microsoft, say that in both cases the courts throw out exclusionary practices only because they offer no consumer benefit. The courts, he argues, never pounce on practices that result in low prices or good products or service. Nor do the courts in either case call for balance immediate benefits against hypothetical long-term harm. Rule argue that Microsoft's practices produce demonstrable consumer benefits. Besides, he says, unlike the actions take by The Lorain Journal or Aspen Skiing, Microsoft's contracts do not prevent consumers from instal Netscape's browser or from use the Web sites of Microsoft's rivals. In truth, though, neither case answer what consumer benefit test should apply to product design. In Jefferson Parish Hospital District no. 2 et al. vs. Hyde, another case cite by both sides, the Supreme Court in 1984 recognize that surgeons and anesthesiologists provide an integrated service. Yet, the court said, a hospital with monopoly power would still not be allow to force surgical patients to use its panel of anesthesiologists if consumers want to purchase the two services separately. That principle could undercut Microsoft's defense that the functional interdependence of Windows and Explorer require bundling. But Microsoft will point to a strong concurring opinion that call for a tough standard for the government to meet when it allege tying. Microsoft will also draw support from several court rulings that allow IBM to change the design of its computers in ways that make it hard for vendors to attach peripheral equipment. But perhaps Microsoft's best argument be that nowhere have the government identify a single case in which the courts explicitly call for throw out a tied product on the basis of a balance test. The courts, Microsoft will emphasize, steer clear of redesign technically sophisticated products. The Justice Department's rejoinder be to note that the sole purpose of antitrust law be to protect consumers, so it make no sense to bless practices that provide a dollar's worth of benefits today but, by stamp out competition, drive prices up by $1,000 tomorrow. The Justice Department will ask the court to at least insist that monopolists use the least exclusionary means possible to achieve whatever services they provide customers. Experts agree that the courts will subject Microsoft's restrictive contracts with Internet companies to a balance test. But exactly how the court will decide whether consumers be help or hurt be up for grabs. A balancing test would have the courts weigh the immediate benefits to consumers of one-click access to Internet sites and of features of a bundled windows-explorer package versus the harm over time of diminished competition in the markets for browsers and operate systems. But a test that make good sense in theory can prove fiendishly difficult to use in practice. Balancing tests be impossibly difficult and arbitrary, say Rep. Thomas Campbell, R-Calif., who be a former law professor at Stanford University. The practical effect of balancing be to hand defendants like Microsoft almost certain victory. Microsoft argues and many antitrust experts agree that the courts have in fact gravitate away from a balance test toward a simpler predation test for exclusionary contracts. Under this standard, a contract be illegal only if it be intend to drive out competition and thus to pave the way for a monopolist to raise prices later. Microsoft will have an easy time defend itself against a charge of predation, which amount to victimize its customers, than it would defend itself against a charge that its bundled product do consumers slightly more harm than good. The antitrust record, say William Baxter, who head the antitrust division under President Reagan, be litter with contradictory, ambiguous and sometimes nonsensical verdicts. He and other legal experts agree that if nothing else, that record leave plenty of legal leeway for the Supreme Court, should it hear the Microsoft case, to stiffen the spine of the antitrust law. The legal tool that the government be use in its assault on Microsoft Corp. the Sherman Antitrust Act of 1890 be brief, vague and malleable. The combination have mean that this bedrock statute of antitrust policy have be at turns toothless and powerful over the years, depend on the politics and economics of the day as interpret by the courts. sponsor by Sen. John Sherman, an Ohio Republican who be the young brother of the Civil War general William Tecumseh Sherman, the act be pass as a nod to a popular backlash against the rise of the industrial trusts in oil, steel and railroads. Farmers, laborers and small-business owners sizable vote groups resent the trusts as vehicles of concentrated power. But the trusts, large national hold corporations, be view by many others as engines of modernization and industrialization. Economists at the time oppose the Sherman Act, and the law that Congress pass be a vaguely word compromise. No one know what impact it would have, but one senator, quote in Matthew Josephson's The Robber Barons, explain that nearly everyone agree that something must be fling out to appease the restive masses. The act's two key provisions, Sections 1 and 2, mention conspiracy, restraint of trade and attempt to monopolize. yet while the Sherman Act be now interpret as the Magna Carta of competition, it never use the term. After it be passed, critics of the trusts deride the impenetrable language of the Sherman Act and call it the swiss Cheese Act. But by the early 1900s, the political climate have changed. The grow antagonism for the trusts, especially as income gaps widened, be tap by an avowed trustbuster, Theodore Roosevelt, who become president in 1901. The Sherman Act have always be an elastic piece of social legislation, use to attack perceived exploitation and the aggregation of power, say Eleanor Fox, a professor at the New York University Law School. The model trust and the principal target of the trustbusters be Standard Oil. Shrewdly, Roosevelt make a distinction between good trusts, which thrive because of their superior efficiency, and bad trusts, which grow not as the result of inevitable economic forces but because of unfair business practices. Throughout the 1880s and '90s, Standard Oil's rivals have complain about the company and the business practices of its founder, John D. Rockefeller. But during those years, the price of kerosene burn to light the nation's homes decline steadily. so standard Oil, it could could reasonably be argued, be an enterprising monopoly. In the early 1900s, though, Standard Oil raise prices in the United States to prop up its profits at a time it be engage in a price war against Royal Dutch/Shell in Europe, where Standard Oil do face genuine competition. When consumers be hurt by the Standard Oil monopoly, popular support for antitrust action against the company swelled, encourage by Roosevelt and his successor, William Howard Taft. The federal suit against Standard Oil be file in 1906, and the Supreme Court approve the breakup of the company in 1911. Standard Oil and the Microsoft case, historians observe, have some common themes. Both be dominant companies of their day, and Bill Gates, the Microsoft chairman, have be call a modern Rockefeller. But there be no presidential involvement and there be no real consumer dissatisfaction in the Microsoft case, say Ron Chernow, author of Titan, a best-selling biography of Rockefeller. And Rockefeller, Chernow added, never go through the kind of honeymoon period of widespread public adulation and favorable press coverage as Bill Gates have had. In the summer of 1995, a whiff of revolution be in the air in Silicon Valley. The Internet offer a new deal in computing, a fresh opportunity for entrepreneurs to try to break Microsoft Corp.'s firm grip on the personal computer software business. lead the challenge be Netscape Communications Corp., whose software for browse the World Wide Web have ignite the Internet boom. Netscape chairman James Clark speak boldly of attack Microsoft head-on. He borrow imagery from the movie Star Wars, refer to Microsoft as the Death Star and Netscape as the leader of a rebel alliance. Microsoft answer with a vengeance. It dispatch hundreds of programmers to work on a compete browser and pour many millions of dollars into market it. It prod computer makers and others to distribute its browser, fold the browser into its industry-dominant Windows operating system and give the browser away free a campaign intend to cut off their air supply, as a senior Microsoft executive describe it. But not only competitors like Netscape have encounter Microsoft's force. Microsoft's partners, its corporate customers and professional investors who finance new ventures have all collide with it. A close look at Microsoft's no-holds-barred push into the Internet software business offer a window into the ways the company use its market muscle to influence the behavior of virtually every player in the industry. Some of the cases recount here figure prominently in the suit bring by the Justice Department and 20 states, schedule to go to trial this month, charge that Microsoft at times go too far and violated antitrust laws. Regardless of the legal outcome, previously unreported details about incidents in the suit and the other examples provide a more complete picture of Microsoft in action. When Compaq Computer Corp. consider load Netscape's browser instead of Microsoft's on its personal computers, Microsoft threaten to stop sell its Windows operating system to compaq. The company quickly change its mind. After Spyglass Inc. begin supply Microsoft with its early browser technology, Microsoft announce that it would give away its browser free. The timing come as a rude surprise to its partner Spyglass. The company lose most of its revenues almost overnight, as the technology, which it have also be license to companies besides Microsoft, suddenly become available free. When America Online Inc., which compete fiercely with Microsoft's online service and electronic commerce divisions, go shop for browser technology, Microsoft make an offer that be too good to pass up: If America Online use Microsoft's browser as the main one for its millions of subscribers, Microsoft would give America Online prime placement on the desktop screen of all personal computers use Windows. When Intel Corp. begin develop its own Internet software, Microsoft complained. Intel, the lead maker of the microprocessors that serve as the electronic brains on most personal computers run Windows, pull back. The chip maker decide that its lucrative hand-in-glove partnership with Microsoft take priority. Microsoft's reach in computing have become so pervasive that nearly every year now, Silicon Valley's top venture capitalists meet privately with a team of top Microsoft executives to learn about the company's plans. The goal, one venture investor observed, be to stay out of the way of the steamroller. Microsoft adamantly deny that it have break any laws in these or similar situations. The company play the game of business hard, and its executives acknowledge that without apology. Yes, Microsoft says, rivals may suffer and partners may be irritate occasionally. But the company insist its actions be guide by its main corporate goal of bring new technology inexpensively and conveniently to the millions of people who use its software. most people in the computer industry say that living in Microsoft's world mean routinely make accommodations to it. Microsoft's power emanate from its near-monopoly on the market for personal computer operate systems, the master control programs that run computers. Because it own the operating system, Microsoft be the essential utility of the information age, say James Moore, president of Geopartners Research Inc., a technology consult firm. It act as a kind of gatekeeper to the pipeline of compute innovation, sit there and decide whether to help some innovation or slow it down. For months, Microsoft and Netscape have talk on and off, circle each other warily. But the event that would define them as unflinching rivals be a meeting on June 21, 1995, in a second-floor conference room at Netscape's headquarters in Mountain View, Calif. That meeting, accord to the Justice Department and 20 states sue Microsoft, be the high-tech equivalent of the storied gatherings in smoke-filled railroad cars that inspire passage of the nation's antitrust laws a century ago. On that day, they say, Microsoft make Netscape an illegal offer to divvy up the market for Internet browse software, a collusion pact that Netscape rejected. Microsoft replies that the prosecutors be misinterpret a routine meeting in the software business and that the company have never try to divide the browser market. Bill Gates, Microsoft's chairman and principal strategist, do not attend the Mountain View gathering, but he consult by telephone with the Microsoft team. Two people who do attend that June meeting have be name as witnesses in the trial schedule to begin next week: Netscape president James Barksdale and Daniel Rosen, Microsoft's general manager of new technology. In the trial, the government will contend that Microsoft present Netscape with an all-or-nothing offer, accord to people who have be question in the federal investigation. rely heavily on notes take in the meeting by Netscape executive vice president Marc Andreessen and on the testimony of Barksdale, prosecutors be expect to assert that the Microsoft proposal have several elements, both incentives and requirements. Microsoft, accord to the people question by the government, would invest in Netscape, take a 15 to 20 percent stake, give Netscape technical information and fine-tune Microsoft's operate systems so that Netscape's software would run good on Windows. In return, the people say, Netscape would give Microsoft a seat on its board, license its technology to Microsoft, give Microsoft advance knowledge of its product-development efforts and not make a browser for the next generation of the Microsoft operate system, Windows 95, which be ship two months after the June 1995 meeting. And Microsoft, the people added, do what it have always deny it do used access to its technology as a powerful lever in business negotiations, by offer Netscape preferential access to the Windows application program interfaces, or apis, the links that enable other companies' programs to run smoothly on the Windows operate system. By turn down the deal, Netscape, they say, would not have that preferred access to Microsoft technology a threat that Microsoft fiercely deny making. Barksdale, Netscape's 55-year-old chief executive, tell a colleague that the encounter with Microsoft in June 1995 be the damned meeting I've ever attend in 35 years in business. Had Netscape accept Microsoft's offer, it would have have Microsoft's money and its endorsement. Netscape would have also be free to sell its browser for use in early versions of Windows and for use on other operate systems like Apple's Macintosh and Unix, a powerful system use mainly in corporations and research labs. But if we have license our technology to Microsoft and step aside, the best we could have hop for be become a company with sales of $100 million or so and hop to be buy out by Microsoft, say Clark, a former computer scientist at Stanford University who found Silicon Graphics Inc., a computer graphics pioneer, before start Netscape. We didn't start Netscape for that. For any company, a meeting with Microsoft be often a charge affair. Every computing device from keyboards to disk drives, and every software program from games to browsers, must mesh smoothly with Microsoft's Windows operate system. This be necessary to make computers reliable and easy to use, but it also give Microsoft its role as the industry's gatekeeper. And since Microsoft itself make all manner of software products beyond the operating system, other companies be put in the uneasy position of require Microsoft's cooperation to be able to compete against it. And in the software industry, where every program be render in the digital code of 1's and 0's, the lines that divide competition and cooperation be often blurred. The talk about that line at the Microsoft-Netscape meeting focus on the division between the operating system the platform, in computer terms and the application programs, sometimes call solutions, that run on top of the operating system. The government suit state that in sworn testimony, Chris Jones, a Microsoft manager who attend the meeting, admit that Microsoft `absolutely' intend to persuade Netscape not to compete. Microsoft reads Jones' testimony very differently, as evidence mainly of the company's clarify its position. If Netscape stay on the applications or solutions side of the operating system, the two companies could be partners, Microsoft said. But if Netscape try to become a player in the platform space, they would compete. Microsoft release portions of the Jones deposition in September as evidence that the government have quote the Microsoft manager out of context. Q. Do you recall any discussion about a desire of anybody on the part of Microsoft who be participate to be able to persuade or influence Netscape not to compete? A. Absolutely. But again, persuade in the sense of force or persuade in the sense of, hey, we think we can have a great business relationship together. Later in the deposition, a Justice Department lawyer ask Jones whether any of the Microsoft executives intend to suggest that there would be any consequences to Netscape or its business if Netscape choose to go in the platform direction you've describe earlier as oppose to the solutions direction. Jones replied: The conversation be something like the following: `we're in the platform business. We're go to invest heavily in this part of the platform because we feel it's critical to our technologies. That's a do deal.' And we're ask them: `What be your business? be your business platforms or solutions? If it's platforms, we're in the platforms business. We're competing.' Microsoft portrays such comments as innocuous statements of fact. But to Netscape, the same remarks could be take as a warning, if not a threat. This be because Internet browse software have the potential to become an alternative platform to the Windows operate system. The browser, sit on top of the operating system, could supplant Windows as the main desktop screen on users' machines and the main layer of program for start other software applications. In addition, Netscape's browser could serve as a powerful platform for distribute and run Java, an Internet programming language develop by Sun Microsystems Inc., a Microsoft rival. In technical terms, Netscape's upstart platform could replace Microsoft's APIs as the essential utility of computing. Indeed, Andreessen have boast in public of Netscape's ambition to relegate Microsoft's Windows to so much software plumb underneath the browser. By the June meeting, Microsoft certainly view Netscape as a serious potential challenger to windows, the corporate crown jewel. On May 26, 1995, in an internal memo, The Internet Tidal Wave, Gates wrote: A new competitor `born' on the Internet be Netscape. Their browser be dominant with 70 percent usage share, allow them to determine which network extensions will catch on. Netscape's strategy, Gates wrote, be to move the key API into the browser to commoditize the underlie operating system. THE BROADER INQUIRY: GOVERNMENT SEES arm-twisting The federal government and the states have recently broaden their allegations against Microsoft by add evidence that it try to bully Intel, Apple Computer Inc. and other companies to squelch competition. They say that like the Netscape meet the new evidence fit a pattern of behavior by Microsoft, which have repeatedly try to limit competition by strong-arming competitors and partners. One episode that fit the pattern, the prosecutors contend, be an effort by Microsoft to pressure Intel to shelve the development of multimedia and Internet software and to limit its cooperation with Netscape. Intel's main business be make the microprocessor chips that act as the electronic brains of most of the computers that run the Windows operate system. Indeed, the fortunes of Intel and Microsoft be so closely align that the two companies be sometimes refer to as a single, powerful entity, Wintel. But Intel also employ hundreds of software engineers, mainly at its Intel Architecture Labs in Hillsboro, Ore. And while Intel and Microsoft be partners, they have also have their conflicts, typically over the direction and pace at which certain innovations should be introduce into the personal computer industry, which they dominate together. Federal and state investigators have focus on Microsoft's strong reaction to work be do by Intel's software engineer a sentiment express in no uncertain terms during a meeting at Intel's Santa Clara, Calif., headquarters on Aug. 2, 1995. The contentious session be attend by several executives from Intel and Microsoft, include Gates and Intel chairman Andrew Grove. An internal Intel memo state that Gates make vague threats about support Intel's competitors and that he be livid about Intel's investments in the Internet and want them stopped. Later, Intel do pull back from its multimedia and Internet software development. Steven McGeady, an Intel vice president who attend the August 1995 meeting, be schedule to appear as a witness for the government. Microsoft reply that the government's accounts of meetings like those with Netscape and Intel be fanciful distortions, create by use a biased selection of documents and witnesses. The government's case, Microsoft asserts, betray an utter failure to accept the computer-industry reality that Microsoft routinely meet with companies to make sure their software and equipment will work well with Windows. Sometimes the talks, Microsoft says, go on to include further levels of cooperation like license technology or a Microsoft investment, as the company discuss with Netscape. In the trial, Microsoft be expect to argue its advance in the browser market be the result of its own business acumen and Netscape's missteps. To document Netscape's errors, Microsoft issue a subpoena last month and obtain the unpublished manuscript of a new book, compete on Internet Time: Lessons From Netscape and Its Battle With Microsoft, which be base on hundreds of interviews with current and former Netscape executives. The book do chronicle the mistakes make by Netscape. But its authors, Michael Cusumano of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology's Sloan School of Management and David Yoffie of the Harvard Business School, think Microsoft be hardly blameless. Microsoft's take-no-prisoners strategy backfired, all but invite retaliation from competitors, the government and even customers, Yoffie said. emphasize that he be offer no legal judgment, Yoffie added, I think Microsoft could have achieve 90 percent of what it do without cross the line as much as it did. THE SPYGLASS LINK: REWARDS AND PERILS OF A PARTNERSHIP On April 6, 1994, Gates and 20 Microsoft executives gather for a daylong retreat not far from the company's headquarters in Redmond, Wash. The subject be the Internet and how it might revolutionize the computer software business. Few concrete plans be make that day, but Microsoft executives insist that a direction be set. Our vision from the outset be to unite the two worlds of the Windows desktop and the Internet, say Steven Sinofsky, a Microsoft executive who attend the meeting. Yet Microsoft badly trail Netscape in the browser field. To hasten its entry, Microsoft license its early browsing software from Spyglass Inc. of Naperville, Ill. The first meeting between the two companies be initiate by Spyglass in April 1994. At the time, it be a tiny company and eager to do a deal with Microsoft. Spyglass be select as the commercial licensee for browser technology develop by the National Center for supercomputing at the University of Illinois. In the summer of 1994, Douglas Colbeth, president of Spyglass, meet with Clark of Netscape at O'Hare International Airport in Chicago. The two men talk in the United Airlines Red Carpet Room, reserve for business-class passengers, and Colbeth recall Clark tell him, We're go to take Microsoft head-on. At the time, Colbeth recall think to himself, Great, now Microsoft will really want to license from me. Today, he noted: Remember, we be a company with a couple dozen people and almost no money in the bank. Netscape have Jim Clark, with his money and reputation, and big-time venture capital backing from Silicon Valley. Netscape have a very different agenda. By July 1994, Microsoft have become quite interested in the Spyglass technology, Colbeth says, and the two companies sign their first licensing agreement the following December. Microsoft, Colbeth recalls, always tell him that it would eventually fold browser technology into its operating system, but its timing be accelerate by Netscape's rapid rise. Microsoft be initially hop to charge for the browser, Colbeth said. But on Dec. 7, 1995, Gates declare that Microsoft would not only deeply integrate its browser into Windows but would give it away. The announcement catch the industry, even Colbeth, by surprise. At the time, Spyglass have license its technology to 82 other companies, include IBM and Digital Equipment, for use in their software products a licensing revenue stream of about $20 million a year. As a result of Microsoft's move, Spyglass saw those revenues vanish within a year, as small Internet software companies go out of business and big customers shift to Microsoft's free browser. Spyglass slash its payroll and scramble into new niches of the software industry to replace its lose sales, which it succeed in do eventually. Whenever you license technology to Microsoft, you have to understand it can someday build it itself, drop it into the operating system and put you out of that business, Colbeth said. THE NONOPTION COMPAQ: SUDDENLY SEES THE LIGHT Well into 1996, Netscape's share of the browser market continue to rise, while Microsoft make little headway, even though its browser be free. Industry analysts and trade magazines agree that Netscape's browser be the clear technical leader. In April 1996, Netscape's Navigator be use by 87 percent of people browse the Web, compare with 4 percent use Microsoft's Internet Explorer, accord to Zona Research. So the big personal computer maker, Compaq, think it make sense to give customers Netscape's browser instead of Microsoft's. But Microsoft would not stand for that and Compaq have no choice but to give in. In June 1996, Compaq want not only to load the more popular Netscape browser on its machines but also to remove the icon for Microsoft's Internet Explorer, which be deliver to the computer maker with Windows 95. Microsoft inform Compaq that if it remove Internet Explorer, the computer maker would lose its license for Windows, say Stephen Decker, Compaq's director of software procurement, in testimony to federal investigators. The ultimatum from Microsoft be deliver bluntly in a letter headed, Notice of Intent to Terminate License Agreement. Faced with be deny the essential operating system, Compaq quickly reverse course and keep the Internet Explorer icon. Microsoft assert that Windows and Internet Explorer be a single product and that Microsoft alone define what be in the product. Nothing in its contracts, Microsoft adds, prohibit computer makers from include compete technologies. While the cutoff letter Microsoft send to Compaq seem an unnecessarily hardball tactic when deal with its large corporate customer, Microsoft chief operate officer Bob Herbold insist that to take one letter here or one snippet of e-mail there to try to portray Microsoft as an arrogant company be unfair. note that a Compaq executive be a witness for Microsoft, Herbold said, We be totally dependent on tremendous relationships with key companies like Compaq. At Netscape, however, the Compaq episode be a watershed. That be the singular act that get me go to the Justice Department, Barksdale recalled. Barksdale say he regard Microsoft's tactic of force Compaq to buy its browser as a condition of obtain an essential product, the Windows operate system, as an illegal act and absolute proof that Microsoft be a monopolist. After investigate the incident, the Justice Department and the states agree with Barksdale that Microsoft be illegally tie the sale of one product to another. Microsoft replies that it have a long history of add new features to its operating system. And from the outset, Microsoft says, it intend that Windows and its Internet Explorer browser would be seamlessly integrated, as they be now in Windows 98. Thus, Microsoft insists, there be no product-tying violation of antitrust laws. In a separate case, a federal appeals court side with Microsoft, uphold the principle that the company could put whatever it want to in its operating system and declare it a single product. But in June 1996, when Compaq want to offer the Netscape product instead of Microsoft's browser, most industry experts view the browser and operating system as two different software programs. It take a long time for the integration strategy to play out, say a former senior Microsoft researcher. Back then, integration be basically bolt a browser onto Windows. THE `BALANCING ACT': AMERICA ONLINE TOSSES IN TOWEL America Online chairman Stephen Case refer to deal with Microsoft as a delicate balancing act. That balance swing sharply from the fall of 1995 to the spring of 1996, when Microsoft use the lure of give America Online a featured place on the Windows desktop as the ultimate bargaining chip. To gain access to computing's most coveted real estate, America Online agree to make Microsoft's Internet Explorer the main browser for its online subscribers, who now number more than 13 million. Yet throughout 1995, as Microsoft prepare to introduce Windows 95, the most significant improvement ever in its operating system, Case be knock on the door of the Justice Department. His complaint be that Microsoft be go to place its new online service, Microsoft Network, a direct competitor to America Online, prominently on the desktop screen of Windows 95, which be introduce in August. This bundle tactic of use the industry-dominant operating system to market Microsoft Network, or MSN, Case argued, give Microsoft an unfair advantage in the young but fast-growing online business. The Justice Department listen and investigated. But ultimately, the government decide against take any action. At America Online's headquarters in Vienna, Va., Microsoft be both fear and loathe at the time. America Online have a designate Microsoft watcher, a young M.B.A. who track its adversary's every move. Above the desk in his small, windowless office be a picture of Gates. Beneath the picture, in large block letters, be the words THE ENEMY. Though America Online be the clear leader in the online services business, it have ample reason to worry about an all-out assault by a rival as rich and aggressive as Microsoft. When he have visit the Microsoft headquarters a couple of years earlier, Case recalled, Gates have bluntly assess Microsoft's options by say he could buy 20 percent of America Online, all of it or enter the online business on his own and bury you. A threat or merely a statement of the facts? A bit of both, Case say recently. But he be mainly articulate what everybody at that meeting kind of intuitively understood. yet by 1996, Microsoft and America Online find they have reason to cooperate. With the explode popularity of the Internet's World Wide Web, the conventional online companies, like America Online and Compuserve, have to provide their customers Internet access as well as their own services. America Online have its own browser, but to keep pace with the rapidly advance technology it make sense to do a deal with Netscape or Microsoft. For both software companies, a deal with America Online, which have 5 million subscribers at the time, could mean a big surge in browser use and market share. Netscape seem the natural partner for America Online, since both companies be Microsoft rivals. On March 11, America Online do announce that it would buy Netscape technology, but it be a standard licensing deal base on a payment-for-use formula. The next day, America Online announce a more significant deal with Microsoft make its browser the default technology the browser America Online subscribers would use unless they specifically ask for Netscape's Navigator. To win the deal, Microsoft offer to give America Online a start-up icon on the Windows desktop precisely the kind of equal treatment on the main Windows screen that Case have ask the Justice Department to require of Microsoft. After we agree to its Internet Explorer browser, Microsoft allow us to be bundle on the Windows desktop, Case said. It be an example of Microsoft's pragmatic side. The pragmatic decision be that the paramount corporate goal be to increase browser market share to protect the mainstay software business. As a result, its new online service, MSN, would have to sacrifice an important marketing advantage over its main rival, America Online. It be Bill's decision, say former MSN general manager Russell Siegelman, refer to Gates. He send me e-mail on it. He say he didn't think it would hurt MSN that much. I disagree with him. To other Microsoft executives, Gates express a different view of the likely impact on MSN. He tell senior vice president Brad Silverberg that put America Online on the Windows desktop would amount to put a bullet through MSN's head, accord to a deposition take by the Justice Department. In the antitrust suit, the government assert that the America Online deal show how Microsoft use the power of its Windows monopoly to give it an edge in the browser war against Netscape. David Colburn, a senior vice president of America Online who take part in the browser negotiations with Microsoft, be a witness for the government. Today, Microsoft have overhaul its Internet strategy to focus mainly on build popular special-interest Web sites in fields like travel, personal finance, automobile retailing and news. And it be put these sites, along with e-mail and search features, in an all-in-one site that use the name MSN.com. I still regard Microsoft as a primary threat, Case observed. Microsoft have a history of get it right in the long run, and there's no reason to think it won't in this business as well. We will always be in Microsoft's cross hairs. THE LESSON: DON'T CONFRONT A STEAMROLLER At Netscape's headquarters in Silicon Valley, the strategy today be one of avoid head-to-head competition with Microsoft whenever possible. Don't do something that be in Microsoft's path that's the lesson learned, observe Clark, the Netscape chairman. Silicon Valley's venture capitalists, the investors who finance so many of the nation's high-tech startups, generally follow the Netscape formula these days. Yet that still leave ample room to prosper. For while compete directly with Microsoft be dangerous, the software industry as a whole be an engine of wealth creation, job generation and technical innovation. And there be an ambivalent side to the venture community's relationship with Microsoft. For if a start-up cannot steer clear of Microsoft entirely, the favored option be to be buy out by Microsoft, which have scoop up many fledgling companies as a way of acquire promise technology and people. Microsoft understand start-up innovation and how to co-opt start-up innovation better than any other high-tech company, say James Breyer, manage partner of Accel Partners, a venture capital firm. As Microsoft have grown, it have come to be see not merely as a competitor but as a force of nature that shape the business environment, like a weather front. Microsoft be incredibly pervasive, say Stewart Alsop, a partner with New Enterprise Associates, a venture capital firm in Menlo Park, Calif. At the board meetings of the companies in which his firm have invested, two issues always come up, he said: One be the price of the company's stock, and the other be what Microsoft be go to do. In the last few years, Microsoft have offer its guidance during almost yearly meetings between senior Microsoft executives and lead venture capitalists. The meetings be part of Microsoft's effort to improve its sometimes prickly relations with Silicon Valley. We work hard to provide clarity about where we're go and where we're not going, say Greg Maffei, Microsoft's chief financial officer. last year's conference take place in October at the Quadrus office building on Sand Hill Road in Menlo Park, the Wall Street of high-tech venture investing. Maffei lead a team of five Microsoft executives who appear before a group of 40 venture capitalists, one of whom stood and ask the question that seem to be on the minds of many of his peers: How do I invest in a company that stay out of the way of the steamroller? Maffei, recall one person who attend the meeting, stand up and deliver a brief lecture on businesses that Microsoft be likely to avoid. His list include specialized software for manufacturing, human resources management, computer-aided design and others. But, this person noted, broad swaths of the industry appear to be designate as off limits include new software platforms that might compete with Microsoft's personal computer operate system. At one point, Ruthann Quindlen, a partner with Institutional Venture Partners, lean over to Vinod Khosla, a co-founder of Sun Microsystems and a partner at the venture capital firm Kleiner Perkins Caufield &AMP; Byers, and say quietly, I guess that leave us wash machines and toasters. Following be the text of the first two sections of the Sherman Act, as pass by Congress in 1890. As the foundation on which federal antitrust law have be built, the act have be amend several times elevate the crime to a felony, increase the fines and prison terms for individuals and set fines for corporations convict of violate it. In the case of Microsoft, the government have invoke the Sherman Act to file a civil suit that seek to change the company's business practices, not a criminal suit that seek financial penalties. An Act to protect Trade And Commerce Against Unlawful Restraints and Monopolies: Section 1. Every contract, combination in the form of trust or otherwise, or conspiracy, in restraint of trade or commerce among the several States, or with foreign nations, be hereby declare to be illegal. Every person who shall make any such contract or engage in any such combination or conspiracy, shall be deem guilty of a misdemeanor, and, on conviction thereof, shall be punish by fine not exceed five thousand dollars, or by imprisonment not exceed one year, or by both say punishments, in the discretion of the court. section 2. Every person who shall monopolize, or attempt to monopolize, or combine or conspire with any other person or persons, to monopolize any part of the trade of commerce among the several States, or with foreign nations, shall be deem guilty of a misdemeanor, and, on conviction thereof, shall be punish by fine not exceed five thousand dollars, or by imprisonment not exceed one year, or by both say punishments, in the discretion of the court. Will it matter to consumers that Bill gate isn't a nice guy? Until last week, most Americans thought of Gates, the chairman of the Microsoft Corp., as a genius and innovator. A nerd perhaps but also a self-styled visionary who almost single-handedly unlock the power of the personal computer. Monday, however, in a Washington courtroom, the Justice Department begin paint a different, darker portrait of Gates. In an antitrust suit bring by the department and 20 states, the man whose company command a 97 percent share of the market for personal computer operate systems be be depict as a nixonian schemer who will go to almost any length to crush his competition. Product innovation, the suit argues, be not a sufficient weapon for Gates. Flashing back and forth between snippets of Gates' videotape deposition and e-mail messages he have send that contradict his testimony, the government seek to establish a pattern of threats and offers of payments by the Microsoft chairman. It also seek to cast Gates as an obsessed man who fear the tiny Netscape Communications Corp. and its potential threat to his domination of the market for Internet browsers, the software use to navigate the World Wide Web. Gates be portray by Justice Department litigator David Boies as a schoolyard bully who rid roughshod over the computer industry with a crudeness that be in stark contrast to his popular image as a benevolent dictator and high-technology guru. accord to a document present by Boies, for example, Gates ask America Online executives in 1996: How much do we need to pay you to damage Netscape? This be your lucky day. The implication, Boies said, be that the amount be irrelevant, and that Microsoft, with its deep pockets and market dominance, make as many offers you can't refuse as need to achieve its goals. Microsoft officials be closely watch market surveys for any hint that the new image of a bare-knuckled Gates might be detract from the company's world-famous brand name, but they insist that the public will continue to draw a distinction between allegations of anticompetitive business tactics and the company's software. Despite what you're reading in the press, people judge us by our products, say Mich Matthews, head of Microsoft's corporate public-relations office. Our experience be that people vote with their pocketbooks. so far, consumers be cast positive votes. last week Microsoft report quarterly profits of $1.52 billion, a stunning 58 percent increase over the level a year earlier. Despite the record profits, some marketing experts say that if the public come to view Gates as a rockefeller-style robber baron, his company and its brand name may suffer. When you have a company with such a visible chief executive, the CEO be really the driver of the brand, say David Aaker, a brand marketing expert at the Haas School of Business at the University of California at Berkeley. There be no question this be go to affect Microsoft's brand recognition. Already there be early warning signals, as political cartoons in newspapers across the country bash Gates last week. One show him hold a globe and saying, If you don't play my way, I'll take my ball and go home; another portray the Microsoft chairman stand next to a henchman dangle someone from a window while a Microsoft secretary say to a caller, I'm sorry, but Mr. Gates be busy teach a competitor about Windows. But some industry analysts believe the new view of a Bill Gates who know how to play hardball may not be such a bad thing for his company. The he-said, she-said round of e-mail messages be drag out in court cases both in Washington and in Silicon Valley, where Microsoft be lock in a legal battle with its archrival, Sun Microsystems Inc., be view by some as little different from the exaggerated trash talk that go on in professional sports. It's like take what Charles Barkley and Michael Jordan say to each other on the ball court and turn it into something more sinister than it really is, say Paul Andrews, co-author with Stephen Manes of Gates (Doubleday, 1993). Indeed, there be evidence that the darker view of Gates and his company have so far take root only in the District of Columbia and in Silicon Valley, where the computer industry have long felt the impact of Gates' tactics, and where bitterness and distrust of Microsoft be deep. In the rest of the country, gate continue to enjoy great popularity. Two weeks ago, while speak before a crowd of almost 7,000 students at Indiana University, a questioner who ask about the Justice Department's suit be roundly booed. BILL GATES, WHIPPING BOY c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service Is Bill gate a high-tech Machiavelli, Public Enemy no. 1 or a threat to the know universe? All three, judge from the numerous political cartoons that pop up in newspapers across the country last week. From Chattanooga to Boston, cartoonists take delight in demonize Gates, who be face an unexpected public relations challenge as Microsoft's antitrust trial unfolds in Washington. other cartoons run the gamut from the predictable (a worker, point to an aquarium in which a large fish be gobble up small ones, say to some visitors, Welcome to Microsoft's research and development department) to the weird (a dweebish man hunch in front of a computer screen star at the words: Our beloved leader, Mr. Gates, be under attack. Leave your possessions. Go to the desert. Await the spaceship). And that be just week One of the trial. Stay tuned. A federal judge Friday push back the starting date of the antitrust trial against Microsoft Corp. by four days, to Oct. 19, while also order the company to comply with the Justice Department's request to examine Microsoft's financial records. Microsoft argue that allow an army of government attorneys to come in and make demands will make it very difficult for us to remain in business. But after win assurances from government lawyers that they would make only narrow, targeted searches of the records, Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson of the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia order Microsoft to open the database for perusal. Microsoft have ask that the trial be delay several more months to prepare a defense against what it say be a last minute broadening of the case by the Justice Department, which have add new evidence. last month, the government say that in the process of prepare for the trial it have discover that Microsoft try to persuade Apple Computer not to market its Quicktime multimedia software to Windows customers. On Thursday, the Justice Department and 20 states add two new people to their witness list to testify about Microsoft dealings with Apple and with Sun Microsystems. Avi Tevanian, a former Apple executive, be add to the witness list in part to describe Microsoft's proposal, which Microsoft deny ever have made. The other new witness be James Gosling, a Sun executive who lead the development of Java, an Internet programming language that Microsoft see as a potential threat to the company's dominance of the software market. The government be charge that Microsoft take illegal steps to prevent Java from gain wide acceptance. To counter that, Microsoft name two new witnesses Friday, Robert Muglia, a senior Microsoft executive who have work with Sun, and Chris Engstrom, an executive who handle some of Microsoft's dealings with Apple. At the same time, John Warden, Microsoft's lawyer, argue that the new allegations have no place in the case. The Justice Department, Warden tell the judge, be try to turn this into something approximate a plenary monopoly case like the IBM case. It become clear and clear and clear with each new filing that they be try to turn this into a broad case, he said. You can't have this bait-and-switch in which they file a complaint allege A, B, C, and then talk about the whole alphabet three times over. As a result, Warden said, Microsoft wanted, at a minimum, another two-week delay, even though a more normal schedule would have the trial start next year. The judge do not respond. instead he enter an order set the Oct. 19 trial date. Late Friday, Microsoft enter a formal motion ask for another two-week delay. A response be expect next week. The case of United States vs. Microsoft Corp., the government's most aggressive move against a monopolist in almost 25 years, be play out against a century of antitrust laws so broadly worded and court rulings so ambiguous that both sides be cite the same rulings to support their oppose arguments. Whatever the outcome of the trial, schedule to begin Monday in U.S. District Court in Washington, an almost certain appeal will leave to the Supreme Court the task of bring legal order to 100 years of clash antitrust doctrines. The case focus on Microsoft's Windows, the operating system that control about 90 percent of all personal computers sell today. The government say its objective be to curb illegal monopolistic business practices that threaten to render large parts of the economy vulnerable to the vicissitudes of a single company. Microsoft assert that the case be intend to give the government control over which features can be add to Windows. however grand the economic stakes, the legal dispute be narrow. The government say that Microsoft's contracts with computer manufacturers and with companies that provide access to the Internet illegally stifle competition. The contracts prohibit manufacturers from substitute Netscape Communications Corp.'s Navigator browser for Microsoft's Internet Explorer. They also prohibit them from remove from the Windows main screen, or desktop, links to sites on the World Wide Web run by Microsoft or its partners. Microsoft's contracts with companies that connect people to the Internet and with businesses that sell goods and services on the Web require favor treatment for Internet Explorer over Navigator in exchange for links on the Windows desktop. In the wake of the lawsuit, Microsoft have voluntarily drop some of these requirements, though it could reinstate them at will. Microsoft say that its contracts be legal because they produce tangible benefits for customers, include easy Internet access. The Justice Department say that the bundling of Explorer with Windows 95 and the inclusion of the browser as part of Windows 98 amount to tying, an illegal practice that force customers of one product to purchase another. The contracts with manufacturers and Internet services be illegal, the government says, because they be intend not only to create a monopoly in the browser market but to protect Microsoft's exist monopoly in operating systems. The latter threat be key, accord to the Justice Department. Browsers have the potential, like an operating system, to act as a software platform on which other programs run. so contracts intend to drive browsers out of the market would also insulate the Windows monopoly. many antitrust experts say the problem face the Justice Department be that the courts have provide no clear definition of tie and no clear guidelines for determine when contracts be illegally exclusionary. Professor Lawrence White of New York University, who be chief economist of the Justice Department's antitrust division in the early 1980s, say that the courts treat tie as an unusual practice when in fact it be ubiquitous. No one, he said, would challenge the right of manufacturers to tie erasers to the tip of pencils, tires to an automobile or buttons to shirts. His point, share widely among economists, be that some tie benefits consumers if, for example, it results in products that be easy to use or enable a company to recover development costs. But tying can be bad if it lock in monopoly power. The courts, White says, have not offer enough guidance for distinguish good tying from bad, which be the nub of the legal dispute. Microsoft say it need only to show that bundle Windows and Explorer pass what might be call a gross consumer benefits test that it offer an immediate benefit, whether or not it cause long-term damage to competition and, therefore, ultimately to consumers. The Justice Department say that Microsoft's practices must clear a high hurdle: yield net consumer benefits that be immediate and large enough to balance possible long-term harm to competition. So which test of consumer benefits satisfies antitrust laws? The simple answer be that no one know for sure, which be why both sides can reasonably cite the same cases without fear of embarrassment. Consider a 1985 case, Aspen Skiing Co. vs. Aspen Highlands Skiing Corp., and a 1951 case, Lorain Journal Co. vs. United States. In the first, Aspen Skiing, the owner of three major ski run in Aspen, Colo. the monopolist have for years sell a ticket in cooperation with Aspen Highlands, a competitor, that give skiers access to both companies' runs. When Aspen Skiing unilaterally cancel the agreement, its rival's revenues shrivel and the rival sued. The Supreme Court rule that Aspen Skiing have violate antitrust laws because there be no evidence its action help consumers. In the Lorain Journal case, the only local newspaper in Lorain, Ohio, refuse to sell advertising to companies that advertise on a new radio station. Here, too, the Supreme Court rule that the exclusionary practice do nothing to benefit consumers. Indeed, in Aspen Skiing, the court even force the monopolist to do business with its rival, a precedent that augur well for the Justice Department, which seek to force Microsoft to install Netscape's browser alongside its own. But Charles Rule, a legal consultant to Microsoft, say that in both cases the courts throw out exclusionary practices only because they offer no consumer benefit. The courts, he argues, never pounce on practices that result in low prices or good products or service. Nor do the courts in either case call for balance immediate benefits against hypothetical long-term harm. Rule argue that Microsoft's practices produce demonstrable consumer benefits. Besides, he says, unlike the actions take by The Lorain Journal or Aspen Skiing, Microsoft's contracts do not prevent consumers from instal Netscape's browser or from use the Web sites of Microsoft's rivals. In truth, though, neither case answer what consumer benefit test should apply to product design. In Jefferson Parish Hospital District no. 2 et al. vs. Hyde, another case cite by both sides, the Supreme Court in 1984 recognize that surgeons and anesthesiologists provide an integrated service. Yet, the court said, a hospital with monopoly power would still not be allow to force surgical patients to use its panel of anesthesiologists if consumers want to purchase the two services separately. That principle could undercut Microsoft's defense that the functional interdependence of Windows and Explorer require bundling. But Microsoft will point to a strong concurring opinion that call for a tough standard for the government to meet when it allege tying. Microsoft will also draw support from several court rulings that allow IBM to change the design of its computers in ways that make it hard for vendors to attach peripheral equipment. But perhaps Microsoft's best argument be that nowhere have the government identify a single case in which the courts explicitly call for throw out a tied product on the basis of a balance test. The courts, Microsoft will emphasize, steer clear of redesign technically sophisticated products. The Justice Department's rejoinder be to note that the sole purpose of antitrust law be to protect consumers, so it make no sense to bless practices that provide a dollar's worth of benefits today but, by stamp out competition, drive prices up by $1,000 tomorrow. The Justice Department will ask the court to at least insist that monopolists use the least exclusionary means possible to achieve whatever services they provide customers. Experts agree that the courts will subject Microsoft's restrictive contracts with Internet companies to a balance test. But exactly how the court will decide whether consumers be help or hurt be up for grabs. A balancing test would have the courts weigh the immediate benefits to consumers of one-click access to Internet sites and of features of a bundled windows-explorer package versus the harm over time of diminished competition in the markets for browsers and operate systems. But a test that make good sense in theory can prove fiendishly difficult to use in practice. Balancing tests be impossibly difficult and arbitrary, say Rep. Thomas Campbell, R-Calif., who be a former law professor at Stanford University. The practical effect of balancing be to hand defendants like Microsoft almost certain victory. Microsoft argues and many antitrust experts agree that the courts have in fact gravitate away from a balance test toward a simpler predation test for exclusionary contracts. Under this standard, a contract be illegal only if it be intend to drive out competition and thus to pave the way for a monopolist to raise prices later. Microsoft will have an easy time defend itself against a charge of predation, which amount to victimize its customers, than it would defend itself against a charge that its bundled product do consumers slightly more harm than good. The antitrust record, say William Baxter, who head the antitrust division under President Reagan, be litter with contradictory, ambiguous and sometimes nonsensical verdicts. He and other legal experts agree that if nothing else, that record leave plenty of legal leeway for the Supreme Court, should it hear the Microsoft case, to stiffen the spine of the antitrust law. shortly before the government file its antitrust suit against Microsoft Corp. in May, Joel Klein, the assistant attorney general in charge of the Justice Department's antitrust division, meet with a Silicon Valley executive. The executive recall tell Klein that unless a case go beyond the Internet browser market, it would have little effect on Microsoft's power to stifle competition across the computer industry. Klein reply that he understand the computer executive's concerns. But he say time be run short and the strong evidence in hand involve Microsoft's battle against Netscape Communications Corp. in the market for the so-called browser software use for navigate the Internet. This be a Netscape case, the executive recall Klein saying. But five months later, the case that the government be bring to trial on Monday extend well beyond Netscape and the browser war to embrace what it describe in a recent court filing as a broad pattern of anti-competitive conduct by Microsoft. Netscape, the government insists, be still a prime example of the pattern but only one of several examples. The 12-person witness list for the Justice Department and 20 states sue Microsoft reflect the new evidence add to the case since May. James Barksdale, Netscape's president and chief executive, will appear first, but he will be follow by executives represent a cross section of the nation's high-technology companies include Intel, IBM, Sun Microsystems, Apple Computer, America Online and Intuit. In bring a more ambitious, complicated case to trial than the one it file in May, the government have choose a high-risk strategy. The law state that new evidence can be add to a suit after it be filed, but not new charges. And so, in his federal courtroom in Washington, U.S.District Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson could decide to rule out some of the new evidence as range too far afield from the original suit. But if the government win its broadened case, the court-ordered remedies would no doubt be far tough on Microsoft. In May, the government's suggest steps amount to equal treatment for Netscape's browser and Microsoft's browser. But the government recently ask that the judge hold a separate hearing on remedies, if it win the case. The remedies under consideration now include more basic changes in Microsoft's business practices perhaps even a breakup of the company intend to loosen Microsoft's grip on computing. That would be precisely the kind of sweep reform that Microsoft's foes would applaud. The government have double the bet and double the stakes, say David Yoffie, a professor at the Harvard business school who be co-author of the book, compete on Internet Time: Lessons From Netscape and Its Battle With Microsoft. Meanwhile, in the Microsoft camp, the government's strategy be dismiss as a desperate act take after a court ruling in June that threaten to undermine the antitrust suit. That rule come in a separate case, involve the interpretation of the consent decree that Microsoft sign with the Justice Department in 1995. In the June ruling, a federal appeals court say that Microsoft could bundle its browser with its industry-standard Windows operating system and call them one product. The appeals-court ruling would seem to undercut the assertion in the government's current antitrust case that the browser and the operating system be two separate products, bundle together and give away in an effort to thwart competition in the browser market. With the appeals-court ruling in June, the government lose the heart of its case, say Charles Rule, a former senior official in the Justice Department, who be now a consultant to Microsoft. So it have take a blunderbuss approach of scramble to throw everything it can find even evidence the Justice Department have have for years into the gun barrel and see what hits. The June appellate ruling do shake the prosecution team. But mostly it strengthen the hand of those within the Justice Department who have be urge that the case be broadened, accord to people who have work on the investigation. At the same time, they say, new evidence be come in as the investigation move ahead and prosecutors race to meet the accelerated trial schedule approve by the court. Speed be a priority from the outset, they say. The Justice Department and the states file their suit in May to move before Microsoft's new operate system, Windows 98, be introduce in June. While not seek to block the release of Windows 98, government lawyers want to get to the the courtroom as early as possible as pc makers and computer users adopt this late version of Microsoft's Windows operate system, which functions as the central nervous system for more than 90 percent of personal computers sold. The key allegations, government lawyers note, have not change since May namely, that Microsoft illegally use its market power in operate systems to defend its monopoly position and to try to extend into new markets. But the only thing that be wrap up in a bow in time for the May filing be the browser, say one person who work on the case. The real game plan be always to get a broad case. What be more, one person noted, the prosecution team be not at full strength until shortly before the suit be filed. David Boies, a renowned courtroom litigator and a former partner at Cravath, Swaine &AMP; Moore who successfully defend IBM in its 13-year confrontation with the government, be name as special counsel for the Justice Department last December. But Boies, who leave Cravath last year, do not start work full-time for the Justice Department until mid-April, because he be still finish private cases for his own firm, Boies &AMP; Schiller. The antitrust suit file in May lean heavily on the Netscape story, mention Microsoft's main rival in the browser market some 130 times in the complaint and a support memorandum. But it also prominently mention Microsoft's tactics against Sun Microsystems, creator of Java, an Internet programming language, and cite it as an example of Microsoft's behavior. It be craft as a template that could be add to without much stretching, one person involve in the case said. And so, as new evidence pile up and seem to fit into a pattern, Klein step by step approve the widening of the case, the person said. And that explains, the person continued, how it be that evidence that have be in the hands of the Justice Department for years have be add to the case since May; only after gather new evidence do it become apparent that the old material fit the pattern of the current case. For example, the government have add the contention that Microsoft pressure Intel Corp., the big microchip maker and a close partner of Microsoft, to curb its development efforts in multimedia and Internet software because they might conflict with Microsoft's plans. The government contend that the arm-twisting occur at meetings between the two companies three years ago, especially one on Aug. 2, 1995, which be attend by Andrew Grove, the Intel chairman, and Bill Gates, the Microsoft chairman. Part of the government's evidence in the intel-microsoft episode be copies of the handwritten note take by Steven McGeady, an Intel vice president who attend the meetings, and a memo write by him on Aug. 28, 1995. The memo, still under court seal, say that Gates make vague threats and be livid about Intel's investments in the Internet and want them stopped. A handwritten note, also under court seal, quote Paul Maritz, a Microsoft executive, as say that Netscape be their common enemy and that Intel's role should be to fill in stuff in and around Microsoft's strategy. These documents be send by Intel to the Justice Department's office in San Francisco in November 1995, in response to a Civil Investigative Demand a civil subpoena serve on Intel on Nov. 10, 1995. On its own, the Intel material be intriguing, but it become part of the antitrust suit only as other evidence surfaced, one person close to the case said. The government be contend that Microsoft also try to urge Apple to stop sell its Quicktime multimedia software in the Windows market and try to convince Real Networks Inc. to pull back in the market for so-called streaming software. The government case have also broadened, people involve in the case say, as more witnesses from the industry have be increasingly willing to testify. In the beginning, most people in the industry believe that the government would lose and Microsoft would retaliate if they come forward, one person said. But as the strength of our case be perceive to improve, more people be willing to come forward, and things snowballed. You get intel, it's easy to get Apple and so on. ","Business rivals are seeking to break Microsoft Corp.'s monopoly on computer operating systems.The Government and 20 states have filed an anti-trust suit against Microsoft, invoking the Sherman Anti-trust Act of 1890.The suit began with a Microsoft vs Netscape battle over browser software but now extends far beyond that aiming at Microsoft's overall aggressive anti-competitive conduct.The effort is extensive but inconsistent because of the ambiguity of anti-trust laws, especially the Sherman Act.The Government is examining Microsoft's financial records and painting a dark image of its Chairman Bill Gates.An unpublished book may be crucial to the trial.","In 1998 the Justice Department filed a civil suit against Microsoft to change its 9-year pattern of anti-competitive conduct.Bill Gates appears a schemer ready to crush competitors by any means.He uses Microsoft's clout to squelch internet competition.A 1996 Netscape complaint over browsers was central to the case, which grew to include Intel, IBM, Sun, Apple, AOL, and Intuit.Microsoft was ordered to let Justice examine its records and sought a trial delay.An unpublished book provided evidence.The 1890 Sherman Anti-Trust Act centered on Standard Oil and was intended to protect consumers, but its wording is broad and rulings have been ambiguous.","The Justice Department and 20 states filed a suit against Microsoft for violation of the Sherman Act, charging it illegally tried to use its dominance as the provider of Windows, the industry standard operating system, to stifle competition in other areas.At the heart of the case are Microsoft's contracts with computer manufacturers that prohibit them from substituting Netscape's Navigator browser for Microsoft's Internet Explorer, but Justice also alleges Microsoft exhibited a broad pattern of anti-competitive conduct with numerous other software companies.Microsoft says that Windows and its browser is one tool that offers immediate consumer benefit.","The government suit against Microsoft is the most aggressive antitrust case in a quarter century.The heart of the case is the Internet browser battle between Microsoft and Netscape.Microsoft says that its Internet Explorer is an integral part of its Windows system, the industry dominant operating system.Microsoft, it is argued, has told computer manufacturers that if they want Windows, they must forgo Netscape.The Justice Department and 20 states are joined in the action brought under the Sherman Antitrust Act.Microsoft's chairman, Bill Gates, usually seen as a visionary is portrayed in much darker tones in the trial."
1038,"An Islamic militant group on Thursday threaten to retaliate if Saudi dissident Osama bin Laden be arrested, and described Washington's no. 1 enemy as a hero to Muslims worldwide. Bin Laden, believe to be in Afghanistan, and a top aide be indict Wednesday by a U.S. District Court in the U.S. embassy bombings in Africa and be accuse of conspire to kill Americans outside the United States. The State Department also announce a reward of up to dlrs 5 million for bin Laden's capture. It be a challenge to the entire Muslim world ... Bin Laden be a hero of the Muslim world, say Omar Warsi, a leader of Pakistan's militant Sunni Muslim group, Sipah-e-Sahaba, or Guardians of the Friends of the Prophet. If anything happen to him, America will be responsible. many sipah-e-sahaba followers be fight in neighbor Afghanistan alongside the Taliban army, which rules 90 percent of Afghanistan and have impose a strict version of Islamic law in those areas. Warsi's group be well-armed with everything from machine guns to rocket launchers. In Pakistan, it have be blame in killings of hundreds of Shiite Muslims, whom the group revile as non-Muslims base on a centuries-old dispute over who be the proper successor to the Prophet Mohammed. Harakat-ul-Ansar, a pakistan-based organization label a terrorist group by the United States, said, however, that foreigners in Pakistan have nothing to fear from us. Harakat be consider a strong supporter of bin Laden, and several Harakat followers be kill in the U.S. missile attack on alleged bin Laden terror sites in Afghanistan. What the United States do be their business, say Abdul Bassit, a Harakat follower. He added, however, that the United States should know bin Laden be a good Muslim, and all the Muslim world think he be a good Muslim. The Taliban say bin Laden be a respected guest who will not be extradited. However, they have set up a judicial inquiry to accept evidence of bin Laden's involvement in terrorist activity and have promise to prosecute him if the evidence warrants it. Washington blame bin Laden's group, al Qaeda, for the Aug. 7 bombings of U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania that kill 224 people, include 12 Americans, and injure an estimate 5,000 people. The United States retaliate Aug. 20, fire Tomahawk cruise missiles at suspected bin Laden training camps in eastern Afghanistan. At least 26 people be killed, but damage to the area be not consider extensive. The U.S. Embassy in Pakistan evacuate nonessential staff and family members prior to the August bombing of Afghanistan, fear retaliation. While some embassy workers be back, their dependents and about 30 percent of the staff have not be allow to return. Embassy officials say no fresh security warnings follow Wednesday's indictment. Security measures already in place include cement barricades block the road lead to the U.S. Embassy in Islamabad and razor-sharp barbed wire top the brick-walled compound. In the northwestern Pakistani city of Peshawar, on the border with Afghanistan, the U.S. consulate be surround by barbed wire and protect by an armored personnel carrier and dozens of armed police. The New York Times say in an editorial on Monday, Oct. 26: Since the deadly bombing of two american embassies in Africa in August, there have be a troubling accumulation of evidence that the State Department inexplicably ignore warnings of possible terrorist attacks against the installations. The late and most disturbing account suggest that nine months before the truck bombing in Kenya, the department receive a detailed description of the planned attack but do little to strengthen security at the embassy. The pattern of negligence demands examination by the Clinton administration and Congress. shortly after the bombing, the department acknowledge that the american ambassador in Kenya, Prudence Bushnell, have earlier recommend that the embassy be move to a safer location. Her advice be rejected. On Friday, Raymond Bonner and James Risen of The New York Times report that an egyptian now believe to have be directly involve in the bombings outline the Kenya plot to american intelligence officials last November. Mustafa Mahmoud Said Ahmed's account be so specific he say terrorists be plan to detonate a truck bomb in the embassy's underground garage that it call for more than a temporary increase in security. Unhappily, it be discounted, even think to be a ruse to lure the embassy into new security measures that terrorists could monitor and defeat. The logic of this be hard to fathom, and hard still to explain to relatives of the Americans and Kenyans kill in an attack nearly identical to the plan Ahmed described. Since the bombings, the department have be quick to close embassies temporarily if attacks seem imminent. It would be interest to know if the intelligence behind those decisions be any more credible than Ahmed's warning. No one at the State Department be happy with the department's handling of security matters, but the tendency to blame limited funding and bureaucratic inertia be disheartening. Of course, additional money would have make it possible to harden defenses at more embassies, and Congress have now add to the security budget. But more decisive leadership in the department could have assure preventive steps be take in East Africa. The Taliban's chief justice accuse the United States on Wednesday of look for an excuse to launch another missile attack on his war-shattered homeland. And that excuse be Osama bin Laden, the man Washington call Enemy no. 1 and blames for the Aug. 7 bombings of U.S. embassies in East Africa, Justice Noor Mohammed Saqib say an interview with The Associated Press. On Aug. 20 the United States retaliate by fire Tomahawk missiles at suspected terrorist camps in eastern Afghanistan, kill 26 people. accord to U.S. intelligence sources, the camps be be use to train members of bin Laden's al Qaeda terrorist group. America be look for an excuse to fire more rockets on our dear Afghanistan and that excuse be bin Laden, Saqib said. Washington, which have post a dlrs 5 million reward for bin Laden's arrest, hasn't rule out further attacks on Afghanistan. Saqib, who head a judicial inquiry establish by the Taliban to investigate the terrorism charges against bin Laden, say the United States have become insecure. America fear its shadow ... in every part of the world it be afraid and see every danger connect to bin Laden, he say in an interview in the Afghan capital of Kabul. In Afghanistan, bin Laden be consider an honor guest by his Taliban hosts. They cite Afghan tradition, which demand the host guarantee his guest protection. So far Saqib say he have no evidence of bin Laden's involvement in terrorist activities. The Taliban have refuse to turn over bin Laden to the United States, but they say if there be evidence they will try him under Islamic law. In the 90 percent of Afghanistan rule by the Taliban a harsh brand of Islamic justice have be imposed, include the death penalty. We want good relations with the United States and all Muslim and non-muslim countries, but they have to respect our ways, he said. Saqib say his inquiry will wind up on Nov. 20 and if there be no evidence against bin Laden the case will be close at least for the Taliban. Bin Laden be not a sinful man ... America have be silent ... they have give no evidence, he said. It be too shameful for America who be now see by all that world to have no reason to go after bin Laden. The man accuse of orchestrate the U.S. embassy bombings in Tanzania and Kenya be declare a free man Friday in Afghanistan, where he have live for years with the permission of the hard-line Islamic Taliban militia. The Taliban, who control about 90 percent of Afghanistan, on Friday close their three-week inquiry into allegations that Osama bin Laden be wag a war of terror against the United States. It's over, and America have not present any evidence, Afghanistan's chief justice, Noor Mohammed Saqib, tell The Associated Press in an interview at the Supreme Court building in the Afghan capital, Kabul. Without any evidence, bin Laden be a man without sin. ... He be a free man. The Taliban have tell bin Laden, however, that political activity be ban and he have agree to respect that, the Taliban information minister say in a statement Friday. The minister, Amir Khan Muttaqi, also dispute U.S. assertions that bin Laden be a rich man, say the Saudi dissident have have his foreign assets frozen, a claim not immediately corroborated. Police and soldiers on Friday block off the street in front of a house where members of a terrorist gang be believe to have assemble the bomb that blow up the U.S. Embassy, kill 11 people. Wearing gloves and masks, detectives from the Tanzanian Criminal Investigation Division could be see search the yard of the house that be surround by a high fence. Residents, who be question Thursday by Tanzanian police and FBI agents, tell reporters Friday there be four regular visitors to the house. They all come at night and use a white 1989 Suzuki Samuri, which be in police custody. Two men, tanzanian Rashid Saleh Hemed and Egyptian Mustafa Mahmoud Said Ahmed, have be formally charge by a tanzanian magistrate in the Aug. 7 embassy bombing. Police be look for two other suspects identify Ahmad Khalfan, a Tanzanian of Omani origin and Fahad, a Kenyan of Yemeni origin. A relative of Hemed tell The Associated Press the house in the Bungoni neighborhood of Ilala district have be rent by Ahmad Khalfan. The house be south of the center of Dar es Salaam and about 6.5 kilometers (4 miles) southwest of the embassy building. The relative, who speak on condition of anonymity, say in addition to khalfan, the three other visitors to the house be Fahad, Ahmed and Hussein. He do not furnish second names for them, and it be not clear whether Ahmed be the same Egyptian charged in the Dar e Salaam bombing. Residents say police show them photographs, but they be not able to identify them because it be always dark when they arrive and left. But all be able to identify the Suzuki vehicle. Officials believe a 1987 Nissan Atlas refrigerator truck actually carry the bomb into the embassy compound. It have be identify by its chassis, all that remains. There have be speculation that two men in the Suzuiki use a remote control device to detonate the bomb. A nearly simultaneous attack in neighbor Kenya kill 213 people, include 12 Americans, at the U.S. Embassy in Nairobi. U.S. authorities have charge four people in connection with the Nairobi blast. Three be in custody in New York, and a fourth be a fugitive. Mohamed Sadeek Odeh, one of the three men in custody in the United States for the Nairobi bombing, tell police in Pakistan where he be arrest after arrive from Nairobi Aug. 7 that Ahmad Khalfan be a member of the group responsible for the bombing in Dar e Salaam. accord to the same Pakistani police sources, Odeh identify Fahad as be involve in the Nairobi embassy bombing. A federal grand jury in Manhattan return a 238-count indictment Wednesday charge the Saudi exile Osama bin Laden with conspire to bomb two U.S. embassies in Africa in August and with commit acts of terrorism against Americans abroad. Government officials immediately announce that they be offer two rewards of $5 million each for information lead to the arrest or conviction of bin Laden and another man charge Wednesday, Muhammad Atef, who be describe as bin Laden's chief military commander. Bin Laden be believe to be live in Afghanistan under the protection of the Taliban, the Islamic fundamentalist movement that rules that country. Atef's whereabouts be unknown. Prosecutors also unseal an early indictment, issue in June, that include similar but less detailed charges against bin Laden. That indictment be return before the embassy bombings and be the result of a two-year investigation into his activities in Somalia and Saudi Arabia, as well as reports that he have connections to a circle of Islamic militants in Brooklyn. The new indictment, which supersede the June action, accuse bin Laden of lead a vast terrorist conspiracy from 1989 to the present, in which he be say to be work in concert with governments, include those of Sudan, Iraq and Iran, and terrorist groups, to build weapons and attack american military installations. But the indictment give few details of bin Laden's allege involvement in the embassy attacks. The indictment do not, for example, specify whether prosecutors have evidence that bin Laden give direct orders to those who carry out the attacks. nothing in the document indicate why the original indictment be keep secret for months, but the secret charges be return about the time that american officials be plot a possible raid into Afghanistan to arrest bin Laden. Mary Jo White, the U.S. attorney in Manhattan, said, It's very common to have seal indictments when you're try to apprehend those who be indicted. Both indictments offer new information about bin Laden's operations, include one deal he be say to have strike with Iraq to cooperate in the development of weapons in return for bin Laden's agree not to work against that country. No details be give about whether the alleged deal with Iraq lead to the development of actual weapons for bin Laden's group, which be call Al Qaeda. The government say Wednesday that bin Laden's group have use private relief groups as conduits for transmit funds for Al Qaeda. The groups be not identified. Prosecutors also say bin Laden's group have conduct internal investigations of its members and their associates, try to detect who might be act as informants, and have kill those who have be suspect of collaborate with enemies of the organization. The government indicate early that its knowledge of bin Laden's activities stem in part from the cooperation of one such informant, who it say Wednesday have work for bin Laden, transporting weapons and explosives, help to buy land for his training camps and assist in run his finances. While the June indictment against bin Laden suggest that the government have a great deal of knowledge of his dealings in the months before the embassy attacks, the new charges be an indication of how quickly the government have work to solve the embassy attacks, which occur just three months ago. Ms. White say bin Laden be charge with plot and carry out the most heinous acts of international terrorism and murder. cite the more than 250 people kill in the embassy attacks and the more than 1,000 wounded, she added, In a great sense, all of the citizens of the world be also victims whenever and wherever the cruel and cowardly acts of international terrorism strike. The investigation of bin Laden be continuing, say Ms. White and Lewis D. Schiliro, assistant director of the FBI in New York, whose agents have fan out around the world to look into the embassy attacks. Our investigative strategy be clear, Schiliro said. We will identify, locate and prosecute all those responsible, right up the line, from those who construct and deliver the bomb to those who pay for them and order it done.

A federal prison official say Monday that the government move under a rarely used federal rule that allow prison officials to limit an inmate's contacts to prevent future acts of violence and terrorism. A spokesman for the federal prosecutor's office decline to say whether the authorities foresee further threats of terrorism. But the law allow officials to impose restrictions where they believe there be a substantial risk that an inmate's communications could result in death or serious bodily injury. Under the provision, approve by the Justice Department, prison officials may segregate prisoners from other inmates, and cut off their correspondence, visits, interviews with the news media and use of the telephone.

1043,"Lebanon's Parliament on Tuesday ratify a constitutional amendment to clear the way for the election of the army's commander, Gen. Emile Lahoud, as president. Lahoud have receive the backing of Syria, the main power broker in the country, make the election by Lebanon's pro-syrian Parliament later this week just a formality. A total of 113 deputies vote for the amendment and four deputies against, include the general's cousin, Nassib Lahoud, a presidential aspirant. Eleven deputies be absent. Among those who be absent be Walid Jumblatt, a Cabinet minister who have say he would boycott the session to protest the choice of a military man even though Lahoud have wide public and political support. The 128-member legislature be expect to meet Thursday to elect Lahoud after outgo President Elias Hrawi signs the constitutional amendment. The amendment to Article 49 of the constitution revoke a ban on senior civil servants from run for the presidency. The new president will be swear in Nov. 24, the day Hrawi leave office. Hrawi have serve for nine years, include a three-year extension in 1995 to his six-year term. Lahoud, a Maronite Catholic, will keep alive a 55-year-old tradition under which the president be a Maronite, the prime minister a Sunni Muslim and the Parliament speaker a Shiite Muslim. Lahoud, appoint army commander in 1989 amid a rebellion in the fractured military during the 1975-90 civil war, be credit with rebuild the 55,000-strong lebanese army and in end the reign of militias. many hope he will copy his success with the military in the government, which be plague by nepotism and waste of public funds. But some fear of military dominance of public life. Prime Minister Rafik Hariri have decline an informal invitation from Lebanon's new president to form the next government, spark a political crisis in this country as it rebuild from its devastate civil war. Sources close to the prime minister, whose Cabinet have be in care-taker capacity since last Tuesday's swearing in of Emile Lahoud as president, say Hariri turn down the invitation from Lahoud to select a new Cabinet. There have be no formal announcement from Lahoud reappointing Hariri as prime minister. Although Hariri's move could be a bargaining tactic, since he remain the front-runner for the premiership, the apparent tension between the two powerful men could affect Lebanon's economic stability as it recover from the 1975-90 civil war. Hariri, 53, the architect of Lebanon's multibillion dollar postwar reconstruction program, have be in power since 1992. A billionaire businessman who make his fortune in Saudi Arabia, Hariri be credit with restore economic confidence and stabilize the national currency. Lahoud, 62, commander of Lebanon's army who be propel to power with widespread popular backing, pledge in a tough inauguration speech to clean up the graft-riddled administration. The british-trained general make his name rebuild the army after it disintegrate in the civil war. Previous dispute among government leaders have cost the Central Bank hundreds of millions of dollars in its efforts to stabilize the lebanese pound. such political disputes in Lebanon in the past be solve only with the intervention of Syria, the main power broker in this country. Damascus support both Lahoud and Hariri. Lahoud have be expect to issue a presidential decree last week ask Hariri to form the next government. The decree be to be issue after the president poll members of the 128-seat Parliament on their choice for prime minister. But many legislators, who in the past give their overwhelming support to Hariri, do not name him and, instead, leave it to the president to select a prime minister. The two leaders meet Friday, but no presidential decree followed. The sources close to Hariri, speak on condition of anonymity, say the prime minister's decision to bow out come because he do not feel Lahoud be follow constitutional procedures in select the premier. The Hariri camp argue that the president can poll Parliament members on their choice for prime minister but cannot accept a mandate to name a person of his choice. The dispute, in fact, appear to be the opening salvo of a struggle on how Lebanon will be govern during Lahoud's six-year term. Toward the end of former President Elias Hrawi's nine years in office, Hariri virtually have a free hand in run the country. Parliament on Thursday formally elect Gen. Emile Lahoud, the popular army commander who have the backing of powerful neighbor Syria, as Lebanon's next president. All the 118 legislators present at the session cast votes in his favor. Lahoud be to be swear for a six-year term on Nov. 24, the day President Elias Hrawi leave office. Prime Minister Rafik Hariri's efforts to win a fourth term in office have hit a snag after he fail to receive the expected speedy appointment from new President Emile Lahoud. Hariri be still the front-runner to form the next government but Saturday's Daily Star newspaper quote sources as say that Hariri be outrage that only 62 of the 128 members in Parliament declare their support for him during a meeting with Lahoud Friday. accord to the constitution, a president must begin his term by appoint the prime minister and a Cabinet through a decree issue after consult with Parliament members. A presidential decree be expect Friday but nothing come through after a meeting between Lahoud and Hariri. Hariri have even schedule Friday a traditional meeting between the prime minister-designate and former prime ministers, but that be canceled. The state-run National News Agency say that while only 62 deputies tell Lahoud they support Hariri, the rest refuse to divulge their choice or leave it to the president to decide. A TV station own by Hariri say he win the backing of at least 100 deputies. The delay reflect the tug-of-war among the power brokers in the country. Under a formula aim at prevent the recurrence of the 1975-90 civil war, power in Lebanon be share equally by a Maronite Christian president, a Sunni Muslim prime minister and a Shiite Parliament speaker. While the Christian Lahoud may have no objection to appoint the Sunni Hariri, it be possible that Parliament Speaker Nabih Berri's 19 Shiite supporters in the legislature be hold out to emphasize their value. The lead An-Nahar and other newspapers say the delay could last for days. But in the end, it be Hariri that be most likely to be rename on the strength of his record in office. Hariri, Lebanon's top businessman, have almost single-handedly create a multibillion dollar program to rebuild a country destroy by the civil war. He be also credit with stabilize the currency and restore confidence in the postwar economy. But his government under former president Elias Hrawi be dog by accusations of corruption. Hariri, who have be prime minister since 1992, be appoint three times during the extended term of former President Elias Hrawi. He have remain in office as caretaker prime minister since Lahoud succeed Hrawi on Tuesday. Lahoud, a general who as army commander rebuild the military from 1989 until his election by Parliament in October, have pledge in his inauguration speech Tuesday to clean up the corruption-plagued administration. The commander of Lebanon's army will become the country's next president after win the crucial backing of Syria, the powerbroker in Lebanon. Congratulations, your excellency the general, Lebanese Prime Minister Rafik Hariri tell army commander Emile Lahoud in a telephone conversation Monday that be headline on the front-page of the leftist newspaper As-Safir. Lebanese media say the matter be settle Monday at a meeting in Damascus between outgo President Elias Hrawi and Syrian President Hafez Assad, whose country dominate its weaker, small neighbor. Agriculture Minister Shawki Fakhoury, a Hrawi confidant, say Tuesday that Lahoud be expect to be elect by the 128-member Parliament at an extraordinary session on Oct. 15. The election be a formality since other candidates have little chance now that Syria have throw its weight behind Gen. Lahoud. In another formality before the election, the Parliament will amend the constitution, which forbid senior public servants from run for president. The new president must be swear in on Nov. 24, the day Hrawi leave office at the end of his six-year term. The choice of Lahoud, a Maronite Catholic, will continue a 55-year-old tradition under which the president be a Maronite, the prime minister a Sunni Muslim and the Parliament speaker a Shiite Muslim. Agreement among the three officials be essential for the smooth running of the government. Since Lahoud have a good relationship with Hariri and Speaker Nabih Berri, little change be expect in government policy. Lahoud's nomination end weeks of suspense over the identity of the next head of state. Lahoud, a 62-year-old naval officer train in Britain and the United States, enjoy wide public and political support at home and have good relations with Syria. But the choice could not have be seal before a final say from Assad, who keep 30,000 troops in this country. His word be refer to in the Beirut media as the password. Lahoud, elevate from rear admiral to general and appoint army commander in 1988 amid a rebellion in the fractured military during the 1975-90 civil war, be credit with rebuild the 55,000-strong lebanese army and in end the reign of militias. In Lebanon, the army commander head the air force, navy and the ground forces. Many hope he will copy his success with the military in government, which be plague by nepotism and waste of public funds. But some fear that a military man in the nation's high office could mean a return to the use of intelligence services to track civilian life the case under Fouad Chehab, the only other army commander to become president, who rule from 1958 to 1964. The election of a military man be a threat to democracy in Lebanon, Raymond Edde, a christian politician living in self-imposed exile in France, tell the An-Nahar newspaper. Prime Minister Rafik Hariri, the business tycoon who launch Lebanon's multibillion dollar reconstruction from the devastation of civil war, say Monday he be bow out as premier follow a dispute with the new president. He accuse President Emile Lahoud of violate the constitution and demand that he acknowledge it before he could reconsider his position. Hariri's move could be a ploy to gain more power as a new government be formed, but the crisis atmosphere generate by the possible departure of the billionaire businessman could affect Lebanon's economic recovery. I'm not a candidate, Hariri say in a live interview with CNN. He demand that Lahoud admit that he act unconstitutionally by allow 31 Parliament deputies to authorize him to name a prime minister instead of name one themselves. Such an action might put the country in danger, Hariri warned. ask if there be a risk of renew conflict in Lebanon over the allege tampering with the constitution, Hariri said: If the president continue with this, I don't know what will happen. But the dispute between the two leaders appear to be over who will have the upper hand in govern the nation of 3.2 million. Lahoud, 62, be an army commander who want to assert his authority at the start of his six-year presidential term. Hariri, 53, virtually have have a free hand in run the country since he become premier six years ago under former President Elias Hrawi. A brief meeting on Monday between the two do not help resolve the disagreements. Hariri's Cabinet have be serve in a caretaker capacity since Lahoud's inauguration last Tuesday. Lahoud on Monday set the stage for choose a new prime minister when he schedule a fresh round of consultations with Parliament for Tuesday and Wednesday. In a statement, Lahoud say Hariri be ask but decline to form the next government after a previous round of consultations. The offer come after the 128 legislators poll by the president give Hariri a majority but fell short of the near unanimous backing he have receive in his previous three mandates since 1992. Hariri be credit with restore economic confidence and stabilize the national currency. His globe-trotting travels to drum up political and economic support be sometimes instrumental in draw international financial aid and investment. But he be fault for decline living standards at home and a rise in corruption in government. Lahoud pledge in a tough inauguration speech to clean up the graft-riddled administration.

It add that the money markets remain stable. A Cabinet minister and a close Syria ally on Wednesday criticize the syrian-backed choice of the army commander as president, and say he will boycott a vote to elect the military man for the executive post. Walid Jumblatt, the minister for displaced persons, say he and his party's three legislators will not vote when the 128-member Parliament elect the president, likely sometime before Oct. 23. Although a boycott by Jumblatt's Progressive Socialist Party will hardly spoil the chances of Gen. Emile Lahoud, it could embolden others to express discontent at the choice and the process of his election. Lahoud be virtually assure of the job: the prime minister and the parliament speaker first approve Lahoud, who then win the all-important backing of Syria, the main power broker in Lebanon. Historically, we do not approve that a military man take control of the country, Jumblatt tell reporters after a meeting with outgo President Elias Hrawi. Although opposition to Syria's hold on Lebanon's politics be common among anti-syrian politicians, it be rare for somebody like Jumblatt to openly speak against a decision personally clear by syrian President Hafez Assad who keep 30,000 troops in Lebanon. Like Jumblatt, some in Lebanon fear that a military man as president could mean intelligence agents will track civilian life just as they do between 1958 and 1964 during the presidency of Fouad Chehab, the only other army commander to become head of state. In nominate Lahoud, rules be not respected, Jumblatt said. Things be suppose to run in a more democratic way, say Jumblatt, whose Druse militia fought christian forces during the 1975-90 civil war. The new president must be swear in on Nov. 24, the day Hrawi leave office after a six-year term. Jumblatt say there be adequate political diversity and competition in the country, imply that choose a military man for president be unnecessary. Deputy Prime Minister Michel Murr seek to calm fears about military intrusion. He tell reporters that Lahoud will keep the army out of politics just as he keep politics out of the army. Lahoud, a 62-year-old naval officer, enjoy wide public and political support at home and have good relations with Syria. He gain public admiration for reunite an army fracture by civil war and in end the reign of militias. many hope he will cleanse the government of nepotism and wastage of public funds. Lahoud's nomination complies with a tradition that the president be a Maronite Christian, the prime minister a Sunni Muslim and Parliament speaker a Shiite Muslim. The government be run by the joint efforts of the three officials. Jumblatt say his party will also boycott a parliamentary session to amend the Constitution so that senior public servants can run for president. Criticism of the nomination process also come from a meeting of Catholic bishops on Wednesday. Nevertheless, the bishop welcome the choice of Lahoud, a fellow Catholic, a statement said. Parliament on Thursday formally elect Gen. Emile Lahoud, the popular army commander who have the backing of powerful neighbor Syria, as Lebanon's next president. All the 118 legislators present at the session cast votes in his favor. Lahoud be to be swear in for a six-year term on Nov. 24, the day President Elias Hrawi leave office. Prime Minister Rafik Hariri have decline an informal invitation from Lebanon's new president to form the next government, spark a political crisis in this country as it rebuild from its devastate civil war. Sources close to the prime minister, whose Cabinet have be in care-taker capacity since last Tuesday's swearing in of Emile Lahoud as president, say Hariri turn down the invitation from Lahoud to select a new Cabinet. There have be no formal announcement from Lahoud reappointing Hariri as prime minister. Although Hariri's move could be a bargaining tactic, since he remain the front-runner for the premiership, the apparent tension between the two powerful men could affect Lebanon's economic stability as it recover from the 1975-90 civil war. Hariri, 53, the architect of Lebanon's multibillion dollar postwar reconstruction program, have be in power since 1992. A billionaire businessman who make his fortune in Saudi Arabia, Hariri be credit with restore economic confidence and stabilize the national currency. The dispute appear to be the opening salvo of a struggle on how Lebanon will be govern during Lahoud's six-year term. Toward the end of former President Elias Hrawi's nine years in office, Hariri virtually have a free hand in run the country. Lahoud, 62, a former commander of Lebanon's army, be propel to power with widespread popular backing. He pledge in a tough inauguration speech to clean up the graft-riddled administration. The british-trained general make his name rebuild the army after it disintegrate in the civil war. Similar political disputes in Lebanon in the past have be solve only with the intervention of Syria, the main power broker in this country. Damascus support both Lahoud and Hariri. Lahoud have be expect to issue a presidential decree last week ask Hariri to form the next government after the president poll members of the 128-seat Parliament on their choice for prime minister. But many legislators, who in the past give their overwhelming support to Hariri, do not name him and, instead, leave it to the president to select a prime minister. The two leaders meet Friday, but no presidential decree followed. The sources close to Hariri, speak on condition of anonymity, say the prime minister's decision to bow out come because he do not feel Lahoud be follow constitutional procedures in select the premier. ","Lebanon's leadership changed in Nov 1998.Army commander Emile Lahoud was elected to a 6-year term as President by the Parliament and took office on Nov 24.He had the backing of Syrian President Assad, the powerbroker in Lebanon, and a special constitutional amendment in Oct cleared his way.He did not immediately ask Prime Minister Rafik Hariri to form a new government.Hariri, the nation's top businessman, had served three terms and rebuilt the nation, but some accused him of corruption.His support in the Parliament had also slipped, but many believed Lahoud was trying to assert his authority.When finally asked to form a government, Hariri refused.","Power in Lebanon is shared equally by a Maronite Christian president, a Sunni Muslim prime minister, and a Shiite Parliament speaker, an arrangement made to prevent a recurrence of the 1975-90 civil war.Syria, with 30,000 troops in Lebanon is the main power broker there.The Lebanese parliament amended the constitution to permit popular army general Emile Lahoud to become president.Prime minister Rafik Hariri, the architect of Lebanon's postwar reconstruction, expected to get a fourth term but a conflict with the new president led him to bow out as premier.Lebanon's economic stability has been threatened by the conflict.","Lebanon's Parliament voted the country's top military man, Gen. Emile Lahoud, president.Lahoud, who promises to clean up a graft-riddled government, is popular and is backed by powerful Syria.It is unclear, though, whether Prime Minister Hariri, in office since 1992 and credited with the country's economic recovery, will continue to head the cabinet.31 of 128 legislators chose not to support him, leaving it to the president to name the next prime minister.Consequently, Hariri withdrew his candidacy, claiming the president acted unconstitutionally when he accepted the mandate to name a prime minister.Hariri's administration was plagued by nepotism.","Army Commander and Maronite Catholic Emile Lahoud was named Lebanon's president for the next 6 years, chosen by outgoing President Hrawi and Syria's Hafez Assad.Traditionally the president is a Maronite, the PM a Sunni, and Speaker of Parliament a Shiite.Election by Parliament is a formality.The constitution was amended to permit senior public servants to be president.Lahoud rebuilt the army and ended militia reign.Walid Jumblatt opposed a military president, fearing a return of surveillance on civilians.PM Rafik Hariri, a businessman who rebuilt the country and economy, refused his delayed re-appointment by Lahoud, who vowed to fight corruption."
1050,"try to deflect foreign criticism of a crackdown on democracy campaigners, China send a respect labor rights activist from jail into U.S. exile Sunday even as it prepare to put a prominent dissident on trial. Xu Wenli's trial Monday and his almost certain conviction would deprive a nascent opposition political party of a potent organizer and a moderate voice. He be the third and most influential leader in the China Democracy Party try in a three-week campaign that have see at least 32 members detain or questioned. For organize the party and thereby challenge the rule Communist Party, Xu, 55, be accuse of subvert state power, a crime punishable by 10 years to life in prison. To prevent supporters from rally outside Beijing's no. 1 Intermediate People's Court, police detain two of Xu's colleagues Sunday and keep watch on the homes of at least two others, friends and a Hong kong-based rights group reported. As police move against Xu's friends, labor rights campaigner Liu Nianchun be take from a prison camp outside Beijing and, with his wife and daughter, be put on a plane to Canada and then New York, his first taste of freedom in more than 3 1/2 years. Authorities release Liu on medical parole five months before the end of his sentence provide he go abroad, say his brother, exile democracy campaigner Liu Qing. His wife claim for two years that Liu's health be worsening. But only last month do authorities grant a comprehensive exam. Doctors find tumors, perhaps cancerous, in the 50-year-old's mouth, stomach and bowels, Liu Qing said. The timing of Liu's exile and Xu's trial be the most brazen in a string of high-profile dissident releases calculate to influence western governments. Human rights groups immediately denounce Liu's release as cynical and manipulative. The chinese government continue to play hostage politics with no true commitment to international human rights standards, say Xiao Qiang of Human Rights in China, a New york-based lobbying group that Liu Qing heads. Over the past two years, as China try to woo the West, Beijing sign two key U.N. rights treaties and win praise for bring its spotty legal system closer to international standards. The rule Communist Party relax some controls on dissent views among academics. Xu Wenli and other dissidents saw opportunity in the more open atmosphere. Over the past six months, dissidents in 14 provinces and cities have try to use chinese laws to set up and register the China Democracy Party. In a sign of the opposition party's appeal, 205 dissidents from across China issue a petition Sunday call for the immediate release of Xu and two other leaders, the Hong kong-based Information Center of Human Rights and democratic Movement in China reported. To wipe out the opposition movement, authorities have violate recently revise laws that be suppose to protect the rights of criminal suspects. They rush Xu and fellow leader Qin Yongmin to trial with less than four days notice give to their families, instead of the 10 require by law. Qin and a third principal organizer, Wang Youcai, be also denied legal counsel. Police detain or scar off prospective lawyers, force the two to argue their own defenses in separate trials on Thursday. No verdicts have be announced. The Beijing court appoint Xu a lawyer, but his wife, He xintong, suspect it be merely a formality in what she expect to be a show trial. He hasn't even read the whole indictment. How be he go to represent my husband? He Xintong say after talk with the lawyer and his aide. Authorities have turn down requests by Xu's colleagues to attend the trial, and He say she have be give one pass, for herself. Xu edit an influential dissident journal in the Democracy Wall movement 20 years ago and spend 12 years in prison, most of them in solitary confinement. Since his parole end last year, Xu have play the role of elder adviser to dissidents. He become openly involve in the China Democracy Party in November, organize the group's branch in Beijing and nearby Tianjin. Shortly before his arrest, he call on party members and exiled dissidents to convene a nationwide congress. The trials of three outspoken dissidents over, Communist Party leader Jiang Zemin signal Wednesday that China will sustain a crackdown on dissent throughout next year. In his second hard-line speech in six days, Jiang vow to crush any challenges to Communist Party rule and preserve social stability. He demand that officials talk politics a euphemism for follow party orders. The speech, to senior law enforcement officials, use uncompromising language heard less frequently over the past 18 months as chinese leaders seek to improve relations abroad. Jiang's harsh tone punctuate the summary trials and convictions for subversion this week of three political critics who try to form an opposition party. To underscore the party's intolerant mood, national newspapers run brief accounts Tuesday and Wednesday of the 13-, 12- and 11-year prison terms give to xu Wenli, Qin Yongmin and Wang Youcai. Dissidents be rarely mention by official media, and the reports serve as a warning to China's 1.2 billion people. In the speech, report by state television, Jiang say stability be crucial over the next year. He note two key events on the political calendar: the 50th anniversary of Communist Party rule on Oct. 1 and China's recovery of the Portuguese colony of Macau on Dec. 20. We must strengthen the ideological and political education of officials and raise their awareness of and resistance to the sabotage acts of hostile domestic and foreign forces, China Central Television quote Jiang as saying. Whenever any element that undermines stability raise its head, it must be resolutely nip in the bud. Jiang do not exclusively target political enemies. He liken their threat to that of white-collar and ordinary criminals and tick off a list of potentially volatile problems inefficient state industries, legions of laid-off workers, stagnate farmers' incomes and corrupt officials. The emphasis on stability and warnings to those who would disrupt it be reminiscent of party pronouncements in the waning years of Jiang's mentor, Deng Xiaoping. After Deng die in 1997 and Jiang emerge victorious from a major party conclave, he project a more confident image. Reform, not stability, be the bywords of the past year. Academic debate over the past year be the bold in 10 years by China's relatively control standards. Party leaders too tout efforts to build a more comprehensive, predictable legal system and win praise from western governments for sign U.N. rights treaties. Our active developments of foreign affairs have reach new achievements, Jiang said. Our country's stature have rise a step higher. By arrest and convict Xu, Qin and Wang in less than three weeks, China trample its own legal safeguards for criminal suspects and raise questions about its commitments to U.N. rights treaties it sign over the past 15 months. Despite the swift punishments give the three, dissidents have continue to campaign for justice. Four elder members of the dissident community send a letter to U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan and U.N. human rights commissioner Mary Robinson call on China to stop persecute political critics and release political prisoners. We have experience extreme disappointment, worry and shock over the long sentences give Xu, Qin and Wang and the recent detentions of several other Chinese, the four write in a letter date Tuesday that be release by New york-based Human Rights in China on Wednesday. In addition, 214 dissidents in China plan a 100-day series of rotate 24-hour fasts begin Thursday to protest the sentences, the Information Center of Human Rights and democratic Movement in China report Wednesday night. The fasts be to have begin with lawyer Wang Wenjiang, whom authorities prevent from represent Wang Youcai, and Wang Zechen in liaoning province in northeastern China, but the two activists be detain by police Wednesday evening, the Hong kong-based center said. The british ambassador in Beijing, Tony Galsworthy, and others deliver a protest message to the chinese government demand the immediate release of Xu, Qin and Wang, the Foreign Office in London confirm on Wednesday. It be convey on behalf of the European Union, the United States, Canada and Norway. In stern judgments cap a decisive crackdown on dissidents, chinese courts sentence two prominent democracy campaigners to 13 and 11 years in prison Monday for try to organize an opposition political party. The 13-year prison term give Xu Wenli after a 3 1/2-hour trial in Beijing be the long for a chinese dissident in three years. His colleague in the China Democracy Party, Wang Youcai, be sentence to 11 years, in a verdict announce by a court in Hangzhou four days after his trial. Xu's conviction deprive the would-be opposition group of a potent organizer and the fractured dissident community at large of a strong and moderate voice. Xu remain defiant during his tightly control trial on subversion charges. He refuse to answer questions from prosecutors and judges and respond only to those from his lawyer, the court-appointed attorney, Mo Shaoping, said. When the court ask if he would appeal, Xu Wenli say he would not appeal, Mo said, quote his client as say this be political persecution. Xu's daughter also criticize the verdict. All he want to do be to advocate free speech and make sure the party registers peacefully. But the government fail this test, and now my father have to go to jail again for it, say daughter Xu Jin, a graduate student at Boston University. Security forces have orchestrate a concerted crackdown, trample China's slim legal safeguards to crush the China Democracy Party. In three weeks, at least 32 people have be detain or question and Xu, Wang and another lead member, Qin Yongmin, have be put on trial. All three be charge with try to subvert China's Communist Party-led system. Xu and Qin be give less than four days to prepare their defenses. last Thursday, Wang and Qin face trials without legal counsel after police detain or scar off potential lawyers. No verdict have be announce in Qin's case. Judges in Beijing and Hangzhou find that Xu and Wang plot subversion by found branches of the China Democracy Party in both cities and accept money from abroad, the official Xinhua News Agency say in a rare mention of dissident activities. The courts rule the two should be severely punish as repeat offenders, Xinhua say in an indirect reference to their previous democracy campaigning. Wary of the China Democracy Party's appeal, scores of uniformed and plainclothes police seal off Beijing's no. 1 Intermediate People's Court Monday for Xu's trial. Foreign reporters be kept 500 meters (yards) away from the building. Xu's wife be the only friend or family member give permission to watch the proceedings, along with an audience select by court officials. She be escort from her home to the courthouse by three plainclothes officers. Hours after the verdict, He Xintong still have not return home nor have she contact her daughter. Police detain at least two of Xu's democracy party colleagues and keep watch on the houses of others. Members of the China Democracy Party will struggle to the end for the realization of democracy, say Gao Hongmin, whose home be under surveillance. Gao, who help Xu organize the party's Beijing branch, say authorities would not be able to arrest all the party's supporters. In just six months, the party attract enough of a following to try to register branches in 14 provinces and cities. The U.S. government and exile dissidents, many of whom support the party's efforts, denounce the sentences and call for the dissidents' release. We be deeply disappointed with both the guilty verdict and the extremely harsh sentence give to Mr. Xu, say U.S. Embassy spokesman Bill Palmer. No individual should be arrested, try or sentence for exercise internationally recognize freedoms. Xu, 55, edit an underground journal in the Democracy Wall movement 20 years ago and spend 12 years in prison, mostly in solitary confinement. Since his parole end last year, he have be behind-the-scenes advisor to a host of dissident activities. He support Qin Yongmin, another Democracy Wall veteran, in set up an independent human rights monitor and advise others to run for local legislative seats in Beijing. Xu become openly involve in the China Democracy Party in November. Wang Youcai, a student leader of the Tiananmen Square democracy demonstrations in 1989 and now 32, publicly declare the China Democracy Party's formation in June and say the group intend to challenge the Communist Party's 49-year ban on opposition politics. Police have sporadically detain supporters of the democracy party. The decisive move come on Nov. 30 as chinese Communist Party leader Jiang Zemin return from Japan, end a busy two years of diplomatic forays. In a speech broadcast nationwide on Friday, Jiang warn against subversives try to bring down the system and vow never to copy western democracy. To allay international criticism, China release a respect labor rights campaigner, Liu Nianchun, from 3 1/2 years in prison camps on Sunday and send him into exile in the United States. German Foreign Minister Joschka Fischer, who draw China's anger recently by meet with exiled dissident Wei Jingsheng, say China's sentence of two dissidents Monday be unacceptable and flout an international treaty the country recently signed. The reaction of chinese courts be totally unacceptable, Fischer said, call for the dissidents' immediate release. The accuse simply try through peaceful means to exercise their right to free speech and assembly, which be guarantee by China's constitution, and by the United Nations' International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights which China recently signed, Fischer say in a statement. chinese courts sentence dissidents Xu Wenli and Wang Youcai to 13 and 11 years for try to organize an opposition political party. Hours before China be expect to sign a key U.N. human rights treaty and host british Prime Minister Tony Blair, police haul a prominent human rights campaigner in for question Monday. Qin Yongmin's late run-in with the authorities come as he try for the second time in a week to legally register a human rights monitoring group. Qin say a civil affairs official in the Hubei provincial capital of Wuhan accuse him of engage in illegal activities. The police come soon after he return home. As I'm send this statement, the Wuhan Public Security Bureau be again take me away, Qin say in a hastily scrawl message on the bottom of the typed statement fax to reporters. Qin, detain briefly two weeks ago, be question for about three hours before be release and threaten with prosecution if he persist in try to set up his China Human Rights Observer. Qin hop the harassment would stop after China signs the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, but he say if local authorities don't observe the treaty we will unswervingly push ahead with protect human rights to the last. China plan to sign the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights on Monday at the United Nations. By the time the ink be dry, Blair should be land in Beijing on Tuesday morning for the first visit by a british prime minister in seven years. The treaty be suppose to guarantee freedoms of speech and assembly. But even after China signs, the treaty would not come into force until ratify by the legislature, which may attach reservations effectively nullify some provisions. Blair have vow to discuss differences over human rights with chinese leaders. His visit have draw appeals from dissidents and an international press freedom group urge him to persuade chinese leaders to free political prisoners. In an open letter, three dissident say that while chinese leaders say they respect human rights principles, in law and practice the government allow rights abuses and persecution of dissidents. Thousands of political prisoners be believe to remain in chinese prisons, labor camps or detention centers, say the letter, a copy of which be release by the Hong kong-based Information Center of Human Rights and democratic Movement in China. The letter call for the release of Shi Binhai, a journalist who compile a popular book on political change; Fang Jue, a businessman who call openly for political reform; and other imprisoned activists. paris-based Reporters Without Borders urge Blair to call for the release of Gao Yu, Liu Xiaobo and Liu Jingsheng. The three be among 13 journalists imprison simply for attempt to practice their profession, it say in a statement. By sentence two of the country's most prominent democracy campaigners to long prison terms, China on Monday take its harsh steps yet in its current crackdown on organize political opposition. After a trial that last just three and a half hours, Xu Wenli at 55 the dean of the dissident movement, and a man who have already spend 12 years in prison for advocate democracy be sentence to 13 years for subversion of state power. Xu's allege crimes include help to organize a new political party, call for an end to Communist rule in interviews with foreign journalists, call for independent labor unions and, prosecutors said, accept $500 from a dissident abroad. He be defend by a lawyer who be appoint by the court just four days ago and meet his client only once. also sentence Monday, to 11 years in prison, be Wang Youcai, 32, founder of the China Democracy Party, which have now be suppressed. Wang be try on subversion charges on Thursday in a brief court session, with no defense lawyer, in the eastern city of Hangzhou. The punishment of a third veteran democracy campaigner, Qin Yongmin, 44, have not be announced. His trial begin in the central city of Wuhan on Thursday and may reconvene on Tuesday, relatives said. A similarly long sentence be expected. Monday's sentences, which come just six months after President Clinton's visit to Beijing, where he publicly challenge China's leaders to move quickly toward political reform, be harshly criticize by the State Department. They also appear to spell the effective end here of the China Democracy Party, which these three men, along with hundreds of lesser-known individuals, try to organize in recent months. The long sentences also crush the hopes of many liberal intellectuals here that China's warm relations with the United States in recent years and its signing of global treaties on human rights might bring a significant easing of political controls. Xu be try Monday morning in the Beijing Intermediate Court. When after a brief recess the three-judge panel announce his 13-year sentence, xu stand up and shouted, I protest! say his wife of 28 years, He xintong. Then, say Ms. He and lawyers who be present, he shout that the judges be unfair and that he would not appeal his case because the proceedings be illegitimate. With the sentencing of Xu, China's Communist government have silence one of its most energetic and persistent critics, one who have give over his adult life to the cause of democracy. Xu first come to prominence during the Democracy Wall movement of the late 1970s, then serve 12 years in prison, much of it in solitary confinement. In the last several months, sense a new opportunity to speak out and make constant use of fax machines and e-mail, he and Qin try to draw attention to China's obligations under two international covenants it have sign one on economic and cultural rights, and one on civil and political rights. In the face of several temporary detentions and stiff warnings, they continue their activities. Wang, in contrast, first become involve in dissident activities in 1989, while a graduate student in physics in Beijing, when he become a leader of the Tiananmen Square demonstrations. After the student movement be smash by the army, he be on the most-wanted list, then be arrest and spend two years in prison. During Clinton's visit to China in June, Wang announce the formation of the China Democracy Party. Hundreds around the country, include Xu and Qin, begin promote the idea. But while the government have allow somewhat free discussion of political topics in universities and obscure journals in the last year, it have not allow any challenges in print or in the form of organize groups to the principle of Communist Party rule. In a speech on Friday celebrate 20 years of economic reforms, the president and Communist Party chief, Jiang Zemin, emphasize the primacy of the party, saying, The western mode of political systems must never be adopted. After learn of Monday's sentences, the american Embassy here, which have spend the last two years build improve relations between China and the United States, issue a strong condemnation of what it term the deplorable decisions. We be deeply disappointed with both the guilty verdicts and the extremely harsh sentences, the statement said. No individual should be arrested, tried and sentence for exercise internationally recognize freedoms, include those guarantee in the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, to which China have commit itself. Like Thursday's trials, both of which proceed with no defense attorneys because prospective lawyers have be warn off by police or detained, Monday's proceeding show that in cases involve security issues, police and courts could write their own rules. accord to the criminal procedure law, defendants be to be notify at least 10 days before a trial, but Xu be tell only four days ago that his trial would be Monday. His wife, who until Monday have not be allow to contact him since his arrest on Nov. 30, be tell three days ago. Under the law, defendants also have the right to a lawyer of their choice, but Xu be assign a lawyer by the court late last week. Before Monday morning's trial, the lawyer, Mo Shaoping, saw his client only for one brief meeting, an associate of Mo's said. Xu's wife refuse to meet the lawyer before the trial. Meeting him would be tantamount to cooperate with the whole charade, she say in a telephone interview this weekend. respond to the accusations during Monday morning's trial, Xu's lawyer argue that Xu have engage in the peaceful expression of his own views and that this could not amount to subversive activities against the state, an associate of the lawyer said. But in a decision that be clearly preordained, the court declare Xu guilty and sentence him to spend what may be much of the rest of his life in prison. Born in 1943 in the southeastern province of Jiangxi, Xu be interested in politics even as a teen-ager, his wife said. In the 1960s, as an idealistic Marxist, he decide to get his learning in society rather than attend a university. He serve in the navy for five years, then become an electrician with the Beijing railroad before become involve with the democracy movement and go to prison. On Monday afternoon, in a police station hours after the trial finished, xu be allow a half-hour with his wife. He tell me he'd be able to handle the pain, she later recount in a telephone interview. He say that this would give him time to think things over and calmly reflect on what have happened. Ms. He, who have be marry to xu since 1971, say she expect to see him in monthly visits to prison. The couple have a daughter, Xu Jin, who be a graduate student in fine arts at Boston University. In an early interview, soon after her husband be arrest on Nov. 30, Ms. He say Xu have tell her, I can't change the way I am. If he receive a long sentence, he tell his wife, she should go on and enjoy her life. And if I die, xu say as they part that day, please plant a tree for me. Six months after President Clinton travel to Beijing and challenge China's leaders to move rapidly toward political reform, the administration's policy of engage Beijing be call into question Monday when chinese courts sentence three of the nation's most prominent dissidents to long jail sentences. Critics of China on Capitol Hill and human rights groups say the tough prison terms be evidence of the failure of the administration's policy of encourage trade and diplomatic ties with China in hopes of democratic reform. The dissidents Xu Wenli, who be sentence Monday to 13 years in prison, Wang Youcai, who receive an 11-year sentence, and Qin Yongming, who be report to have receive 12 years be charge with subversion. The State Department say it have receive reports from sources it do not identify that a third lead democracy campaigner, Qin Yongmin, have be sentence to 13 years in prison after a trial last week in the city of Wuhan. Relatives of Qin in China deny the reports, however, and say that his trial continued. Given Clinton's effusive praise for China's senior leaders during his trip to Beijing last summer, the administration find itself on the defensive Monday and harshly criticize the prison sentences, even as it continue to insist that the administration's policy of engagement be help push Beijing toward democracy. James Foley, a State Department spokesman, say the United States deeply deplore the jail terms and call for the immediate release of the dissidents. These three men appear to have be involve in nothing more than efforts to form a new political party, he said. While condemn the prison sentences, Foley and other american officials be careful to note the administration's assessment that there have be progress in human rights in China, some of it link to Clinton's meeting in Beijing with Chinese President Jiang Zemin. There have be improvements in the human rights situation in China, modest improvements, Foley said. The severe prison terms and other recent instances of harassment of democracy campaigners in China be steps backward in relationship to what have be an improved human rights performance, he said. Critics of the administration's China policy note that the long prison sentences be hand out less than a week after Jiang deliver a pointed speech in Beijing in which he make clear that China's economic reforms be not a prelude to western-style democracy. The western mode of political systems must never be copied, he said, add that those who challenge the Communist Party's supremacy would be crushed. Rep. Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., who have long be among China's harsh critics in Congress, say the prison sentences hand out to xu and Wang be the clear demonstration since the president's visit to China last summer of Beijing's true intentions regard human rights. They be pathetic, really pathetic, she say of the administration. The administration can say what it wants, but it must know Monday that its policy on China be an embarrassment. What the chinese have learn be that they have all the latitude in the world. Mike Jendrzejczyk, Washington director for Human Rights Group, say the jail terms be proof of the need for the administration to revise its China policy, which he describe as almost entirely drive by the administration's desire to encourage trade. He say that while there have be some signs of progress in the human rights situation in China over the last year notably, China's agreement to sign international treaties on civil and economic rights the overall picture be bleak. On balance, he said, any progress China have make by allow great openness may have be cancel out by a more repressive attitude. Human Rights Watch, the large american-based human rights group, call on the administration to consider postpone or cancel a plan visit to China early next year by Commerce Secretary William Daley and a high-level trade delegation as a protest over the prison sentences. That would get Beijing's attention, Jendrzejczck said. other China experts and scholars insist that the administration be right to continue its policy of engagement with China, and that there be reason to believe that political reform would follow economic reform, as Clinton have argued. Peter Rodman, a former Nixon and Reagan administration official now at the Nixon Center in Washington, say that the United States cannot control the evolution of a society as complex as China's. He say the harsh prison sentences give out Monday to the dissidents be to be expected, especially since Xu and Wang have be involve in try to set up a political party to challenge the Communists. The pattern of this regime be that every once in a while, they ease up a bit and somebody go too far and there's a crisis, he said. I don't think you can blame the United States for this crackdown, nor can you give us credit for any political reforms. On human rights, I just don't think there's much more we can do. China release a respected, but ail labor rights campaigner from a prison work camp Sunday and immediately send him into exile in the United States. Releasing Liu Nianchun appear to be an attempt by the government to blunt international criticism over Monday's upcoming trial of prominent dissident Xu Wenli. Xu be the third leading member of a would-be opposition political party put on trial for subversion in a three-week crackdown that have see at least 32 dissidents arrest or interrogated. Beijing police Sunday detain one of Xu's China Democracy Party colleagues, Zha Jianguo, to prevent him from attend the trial, Xu's wife said. Although pleased that Liu Nianchun be free, human rights groups decry the chinese government's timing as manipulative. We don't want to give any credit to the chinese government for this cynical game it be playing, say Xiao Qiang, director of New york-based Human Rights in China. After 3 1/2 years in prison, Liu be take from the Tuanhe labor camp on the outskirts of Beijing, driven to the capital's airport and put on a Canadian Air flight, ultimately bind for New York, his mother and brother said. Accompanying Liu into exile be his wife, Chu Hailan, and their 11-year-old daughter, the family said. Liu Nianchun's release follow the same pattern China use in free its two most famous dissidents, Wei Jingsheng in Nov. 1997 and Wang Dan in April. Authorities release Liu on medical parole, exactly five months before the end of his prison term, provide he go into exile, say his brother and exile democracy campaigner, Liu Qing. Liu Nianchun, 50, have be in ill-health for at least two years. In an exam authorities finally agree to provide last month, doctors discover Liu have tumors in his mouth, stomach and bowels, Liu Qing said. Like Wang and Wei, the United States and other western governments have lobby China to release Liu. chinese leaders have be force well-known dissidents into exile throughout the 1990s, finding that once abroad they lose their influence among dissidents at home. In the only official comment on the release, the Xinhua News Agency report that judicial departments take into account Liu's health and behavior in the labor camp in approve his parole for medical treatment. I be very happy for Liu Nianchun, but at the same time send people directly from prison into exile be a type of human rights violation and persecution, Liu Qing say in a telephone interview from his home in New York's Brooklyn borough. Liu Nianchun be one of the most respected figures in the fractured, persecute dissident community. His more than 3 1/2 years in prisons and labor camps be a sad illustration of the way China's Communist Party rulers punish people they deem a threat. Liu be imprison three times in the past 17 years. His last arrest come after he sign a petition call for labor rights in May 1995. Liu be never put on trial. Fourteen months pass before his wife, Chu Hailan, first learn of his fate and whereabouts: a three-year spell in a labor camp in the frigid, remote northeast. His term be the maximum police may impose on criminal suspects without trial. Labor camp officials later extend Liu's sentence by a year for try to escape, a charge Chu claim be fabricated. Inside the labor camp, Liu once start a hunger strike to protest his treatment. He be beat with cattle prods and confine to a room of 2 square meters (2 square yards) where he could only sit or stand. His wife endure police harassment, beatings and detentions in campaign for his release. Chu be drag away and hit by security forces when she try to hand a letter to U.N. human rights chief Mary Robinson outside a Beijing hotel in september. German Foreign Minister Joschka Fischer, who draw China's anger recently by meet with exiled dissident Wei Jingsheng, say China's sentence of two dissidents Monday be unacceptable and flout an international treaty the country recently signed. The reaction of chinese authorities be totally unacceptable, Fischer said, call for the dissidents' immediate release. The accuse simply try through peaceful means to exercise their right to free speech and assembly, which be guarantee by China's constitution, and by the United Nations' International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights which China recently signed, Fischer say in a statement. chinese courts sentence dissidents Xu Wenli and Wang Youcai to 13 and 11 years for try to organize an opposition political party. His friend and political mentor be jailed, rob their budding opposition political party of its most potent organizer, but Zha Jianguo be not afraid. A bag pack with toothbrush, toothpaste and medicine lie ready at his Beijing home for the day chinese police take him away. He have tell police interrogators he expect to be jailed, likely for a few years less than the 13 give China Democracy Party leader Xu Wenli on Monday. Democracy be a process, and in that process a small number of people will be sacrificed, Zha, a 47-year-old former manager of a computer design company and vice chairman of the party's Beijing branch, tell The Associated Press in an interview Thursday. We want to use our sacrifice to arouse the people, and we believe that sacrifice be worthwhile. With a mixture of defiance and cool clarity about the chances for success, Zha say he and other China Democracy Party members will continue organize and campaign for change. His tenacity hold despite the summary trials and harsh punishments for Xu, Wang Youcai and Qin Yongmin prominent party principals from the provinces who be sentence to 11 and 12 years and despite threatening signs from the rule Communist Party. Chinese President Jiang Zemin warn in a speech publish Wednesday that political subversives threaten what he call China's fragile social order. Whenever any element that undermines stability raise its head, it must be resolutely nip in the bud, Jiang said. Zha maintain that such tactics be unnecessary. In its manifestoes, the Democracy Party espouse peaceful means to target the undemocratic system, not the political power of the Communist Party. We believe elections hold after the establishment of a democratic system should decide who have the power, say Zha. What many the world over consider democracy be legally subversive in China for threaten the Communist Party-led system. In the past month, authorities have arrest and convict Xu, Qin and Wang and detain or interrogate at least 29 other party members. Police take Zha from his home Sunday afternoon and hold him for nearly 24 hours to keep him from Xu's trial. Until the crackdown, the China Democracy Party distinguish itself from past attempts at opposition by its openness. Organizers publicly announce their intention to set up the party. They try to register with authorities. Statements be fax to foreign media and human rights groups to circumvent China's state-controlled media. Now, the party's members about 500 by Zha's count be be drive underground. Party members will concentrate on increase ranks and will be more guarded in the use of telephones and faxes and their occasional meetings, Zha said. If Xu and the other two be the first round, then the second round be very likely and it will be bigger, Zha said. In such an unbalanced contest, we be force to use more secretive means. The arrests of Xu, Wang and Qin deprive the party of its more influential members, Zha said. All have prove track records, Xu and Qin as dissident editors in the Democracy Wall era movement 20 years ago, Wang as a student leader of the Tiananmen Square democracy demonstrations in 1989. But from another aspect, this have strengthen the resolve of even more party members to struggle on, Zha say of the arrests. Zha get interested in politics as a radical youth, follow Mao tse-tung's appeals to go to the countryside in 1968. When he return to Beijing in 1989, he march in the Tiananmen protests and continue his activism. Friends introduce him to xu Wenli in 1995. have be release from prison two years before, xu be still not openly involve in dissident politics, but he hold court in his Beijing home to discuss China's future.
