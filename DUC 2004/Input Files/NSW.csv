From court papers filed investigation embassy bombings East Africa August, clear informant provided crucial information federal investigators. They cited source papers filed support extradition two associates bin Laden arrest Germany Britain. Bin Laden, Saudi exile, thought living Afghanistan. The source also basis many significant charges indictment bin Laden himself, including assertion directed attacks U.S. soldiers Somalia attempted obtain nuclear weapons. It known whether source custody somewhere, hiding government protection. As recently 11 days ago, records show, source swore 5-page affidavit New York notary summarizing allegations bin Laden. Government officials adamantly declined say anything identity CS-1, stands confidential source. But least one operative bin Laden's group East Africa concluded year ago knew identity crucial turncoat: Sidi Tayyib, businessman married one bin Laden's relatives. The operative's concerns inflamed report British newspaper Tayyib cooperating Saudi U.S. authorities. In August, 1997 article, The Daily Telegraph said Tayyib custody Saudi Arabia since May given intelligence officials details bin Laden's bank accounts businesses. The news Tayyib's possible defection, East African operative wrote report apparently intended group's commanders, almost made explode. An important man close links bin Laden seems fallen enemy's hands, take appropriate security precautions that, operative, Haroun Fazil, wrote summary security concerns. Fazil since charged embassy attacks remains large. The report typed computer seized last year Kenyan authorities, according government filing last week U.S. district court Manhattan. Thus far, U.S. prosecutors charged least six members bin Laden's organization terrorist activities conspiracy. In one recent filing, said case part based testimony confidential source, suggesting informant agreed testify trial bin Laden associates. The arrangement appears resulted plea bargain source cooperating hopes receiving lesser sentence. There indication source yet sentenced seems likely sentencing would take place investigation ensuing trials complete. In affidavit prepared last week, source acknowledged pleading guilty terrorism charges United States said stemmed attacks U.S. targets, specifically identified. The source described taking oath allegiance follow bin Laden's orders, gave detailed account bin Laden's group, including history inner workings. The source told private statements bin Laden al Qaeda members, encouraging attack U.S. troops citizens stationed Middle East Africa. I either heard statements myself, source said, I read learned al Qaeda members. The government also said court papers source helped identify bin Laden's signature 1996 document urging Muslims kill Americans. Tayyib's whereabouts unknown could reached comment. The Taliban's chief justice accused United States Wednesday looking excuse launch another missile attack war-shattered homeland. And excuse Osama bin Laden, man Washington calls Enemy No. 1 blames Aug. 7 bombings U.S. embassies East Africa, Justice Noor Mohammed Saqib said interview The Associated Press. On Aug. 20 United States retaliated firing Tomahawk missiles suspected terrorist camps eastern Afghanistan, killing 26 people. According U.S. intelligence sources, camps used train members bin Laden's al Qaeda terrorist group. America looking excuse fire rockets dear Afghanistan excuse bin Laden, Saqib said. Washington, posted dlrs 5 million reward bin Laden's arrest, ruled attacks Afghanistan. Saqib, heads judicial inquiry established Taliban investigate terrorism charges bin Laden, says United States become insecure. America fears shadow ... every part world afraid sees every danger connected bin Laden, said interview Afghan capital Kabul. In Afghanistan, bin Laden considered honored guest Taliban hosts. They cite Afghan tradition, demands host guarantee guest protection. So far Saqib says evidence bin Laden's involvement terrorist activities. The Taliban refused turn bin Laden United States, say evidence try Islamic law. In 90 percent Afghanistan ruled Taliban harsh brand Islamic justice imposed, including death penalty. We want good relations United States Muslim non-Muslim countries, respect ways, said. Saqib said inquiry wind Nov. 20 evidence bin Laden case closed  least Taliban. Bin Laden sinful man ... America silent ... given evidence, said. It shameful America seen world reason go bin Laden. The man accused orchestrating U.S. embassy bombings Tanzania Kenya declared free man Friday Afghanistan, lived years permission hard-line Islamic Taliban militia. The Taliban, control 90 percent Afghanistan, Friday closed three-week inquiry allegations Osama bin Laden waging war terror United States. It's over, America presented evidence, Afghanistan's chief justice, Noor Mohammed Saqib, told The Associated Press interview Supreme Court building Afghan capital, Kabul. Without evidence, bin Laden man without sin. ... He free man. The Taliban told bin Laden, however, political activity banned agreed respect that, Taliban information minister said statement Friday. The minister, Amir Khan Muttaqi, also disputed U.S. assertions bin Laden rich man, saying Saudi dissident foreign assets frozen, claim immediately corroborated. One clear unstated objectives last August's raid Afghanistan kill Osama bin Laden many lieutenants possible, administration officials acknowledge. According officials, White House lawyers conducted secret review months attack concluded operations legal U.S. international law. The officials said raid timed 70 cruise missiles would hit bin Laden's camps moment Central Intelligence Agency believed would meeting chief operatives. A 1976 executive order bars anyone working U.S. government plotting carrying assassinations. But officials said White House legal opinion drafted Afghan strike asserts president authority target infrastructure terrorist groups attacking Americans. A top U.S. counterterrorism official said week infrastructure bin Laden's group mostly human. As said time Aug. 20 strike, objective disrupt training, organization infrastructure bin Laden terrorist network Khost camps, said David C. Leavy, spokesman National Security Council White House. Targeting infrastructure, officials acknowledged, also mean destroying leadership terrorist group. Command control enemy justifiable target, Leavy said. Senior administration officials said never discussed killing bin Laden planning sessions. His death, said interviews attack, would simply side benefit. U.S. intelligence officials say believe bin Laden camp day attack, appears left unscathed missiles hit. Officials said reports least one senior lieutenants may died attack, total casualties complex 50 100. Administration spokesmen drawn distinction attempting kill specific person like bin Laden attacking group people command terrorist organization. Administration officials denied since August raid intended kill bin Laden, Saudi exile charged federal prosecutors leading global war U.S. interests. He linked Aug. 7 bombing two U.S. embassies East Africa. But less subtle explanation offered Oct. 13 Defense Secretary William Cohen, said visit Saudi Arabia United States going bin Laden colleagues. We quite successful, Cohen continued, sent message. Kenneth Bacon, Pentagon spokesman, said secretary retracted statements. The Los Angeles Times recently reported administration believed legal right use deadly force terrorist leaders. Bin Laden's organization significant concern Clinton administration even bombing U.S. embassies East Africa. Last spring, officials said, U.S. intelligence considered daring raid Afghanistan capture Saudi exile. Officials said roughly time, White House drafted legal justification military attacks terrorist leadership. That review, officials said, provided legal basis August fire cruise missiles meeting believed bin Laden lieutenants would gathered. The review, National Security Council, basis saying operation violate presidential order banning assassinations. That ban imposed President Ford 1975, congressional investigators uncovered evidence CIA plotted assassinate Fidel Castro, Cuban leader, others. The order said: No person employed by, acting behalf United States government shall engage in, conspire engage in, assassination. While is, face, sweeping unqualified ban, subject interpretation intense debate years. In 1986, Reagan administration responded terrorist attack U.S. soldiers Germany bombing raid Libya. The targets included residence Libyan leader, Moammar Gadhafi. And Gulf War, U.S. forces used powerful bombs attempt kill Saddam Hussein, president Iraq. The legal review conducted White House would appear provide precedent future operations similar circumstances.

6,"He classic small-town prodigy, creativity big-city profiteer. When shot take, invented new one. When one pass to, reconfigured play teammate open. Larry Bird, Indiana countryside inside Boston Garden, luminous exception governing rule. That why, six years retirement National Basketball Association, name basketball's prominent, beginning induction Hall Fame 7,000 Bird watchers Civic Center Friday night. Deservedly enshrined forever exceptional, becomes Bird, exception, case study contentious potentially disastrous labor war. No, really, Bird said, I asked whether troubled likelihood legendary name soon representing symbol greed unsympathetic millions. There's always player's name attached things. I know time I happy it. That would 1988, Celtics wanted compensate Bird $4.9 million bonus push back pain, go savior. Three years later, contract arbitration involving Knicks' Patrick Ewing, agent David Falk would contend NBA conspired Celtics circumvent salary cap, order satisfy Bird. Alan Greenspan, I sure, would agree salary cap convoluted enough give anyone headache, let's say cap exist team negotiating one own. The process unsealing cap re-sign particular player eventually became known making use Larry Bird exception. And stand, onetime exception become expensive rule owners want play anymore. I understand sides, said Bird, safely middle, Bird, former exception, Bird, present Indiana Pacers' coach. Without getting exception, I think important players stay place. Important, meant, franchise stability fan identification. You son 7 years old, goes 7 17 10 years played, Bird said. A lot people Boston told followed me, time young college. The Bird years numbered three Celtics championships, best player pro basketball's famous team ever had. He Magic Johnson created basketball renaissance began college title showdown Salt Lake City spread worldwide, like infectious smile. They stood pass, team play, decade selflessness given way one selfishness. The NBA Michael Jordan reached greater heights anyone imagined could, league suffers sickness soul. If Larry Magic done did, might survive we're go through, said Bill Fitch, Bird's first Celtics coach, who, Bill Walton, stood night that, said, gave closure playing career. The owners, always, exaggerating misery, time, much easier root players. The president union Ewing, one day commands players boycott world championships NBA's corporate fingerprints them, next day helps television commentary work David Stern's women's annex. Ewing leads fight protect $100 million contracts 21-year-olds achieved single playoff victory, linked big payoffs agents like friend Falk. The battle waged name salary cap makes exceptions unexceptional, rewards everyone Bird. I believe field allowance truly special ones, Walton said. But group small. When I growing sport, players got recognition champions, ones always made feel good game, sports. That's Larry Magic played, always dreaming special team. It hype, money. That quite case, been. Bird businessman's ball player day arrived, flannel shirts blue-collar ethic. He hired late Bob Woolf, one original heavy-hitting agents, got record rookie contract. Then went turned 29-victory catastrophe 61-victory contender. A rare Bird, honest exception rule. Despite modest encouragement new proposal delivered players owners, National Basketball Association Tuesday canceled first two weeks regular season, first time league's 51-year history lose games labor dispute. The NBA's deputy commissioner, Russ Granik, announced cancellation nearly three half hours meetings concluded Manhattan hotel. The decision cancel 99 games Nov. 3 Nov. 16 came players association proposed implementation tax system instead hard salary cap, proposal owners said would respond Friday. We tried best today try possible salvage season, said Alonzo Mourning, Miami Heat center. Unfortunately, work out. After 35,001 games without blemish, NBA joins National Hockey League, National Football League Major League Baseball lost games labor dispute. Taking account three- four-week period would needed training camp free-agent signings season starts, league said would decide two weeks whether make cancellations. I'm sad disappointed, said NBA commissioner, David Stern. I consider collective failure, I honestly know else could done. I things I like think best interests game. And I believe is. The decision came sides agreed substantive talks since owners imposed lockout player July 1. Seventeen players, including union president Patrick Ewing vice presidents Mitch Richmond, Herb Williams, Dikemebe Mutombo Ty Corbin, attended meeting along Stern, Granik five members ownership committee  Madison Square Garden president Dave Checketts owners Abe Pollin Washington, Gordon Gund Cleveland, Les Alexander Houston Jerry Colangelo Phoenix. The talks featured players association implied bevy concessions made owners felt would accommodate league's desire swing revenue pendulum back toward owners. The dispute involves distribution approximately $2 billion league-wide income. The main sticking point owners' insistence salary cap without exceptions, implementation believe would bring player salaries' line revenue growth. While players discuss elimination Larry Bird exception  clause allows player secure amount money wants re-signing current team  address exception taxation proposal. The main points follows:  A 50 percent tax would imposed salary earned $18 million, clause would affect players exercised Bird rights. For example, player made $20 million, team would forced put $1 million fund would likely distributed low-revenue teams. There could provisions made players, said Jeffrey Kessler, chief outside counsel union. We want anything would encourage Chicago getting Michael Jordan back. And I think league feels way. The proposal similar luxury tax proposed union 1995 negotiations, would nearly liberal.  A salary cap credit would go effect league pays 63 percent revenues salary. Whatever figure number reduces salary cap next year. If figure $29 million salary cap, 29 teams would work salary cap $1 million less previous season. But players would assurance salary cap would go least $2 million credit goes effect.  Also, 63-percent threshold met, reduction annual 20 percent raises would take effect multi-year contracts. Players would either get raises 10 percent rate growth league revenues. The union said clearly addresses league's desire bring salaries line revenues. Since owners re-opened current agreement 57.1 percent revenue going toward salaries, 63-percent figure would probably come substantially owners agree proposal.  Teams would get right first refusal free agents fourth year incoming rookies, meaning player would contractually obligated team first four years deal. Currently, rookie scale three years includes clause enables player exercise Bird rights two seasons  clause Kevin Garnett parlayed astronomical $126 million deal last year Minnesota.  Finally, players agreed make marijuana banned substance. Details testing negotiated specific discussions took place regarding testing performance-enhancing drugs, provision owners included last proposal. In return concessions, players want increase minimum salary  currently $272,500  creation average salary exception. This would allow every team salary cap able sign one free agent per year average salary  currently $2.6 million. We're buoyed fact first time they've decided submit counterproposal, union's executive director, Billy Hunter, said. I know I'm optimistic, I earnestly say look ballplayers eye say made valiant effort. Asked players would finally tested financially cancellation games, Hunter added: It's us blinking. We want reach agreement. We're tired rhetoric, we're tired game-playing. Our position along want accept bad deal. Granik said refunds fans would made end calendar month first refund would include monies canceled preseason games. He estimated losses hundreds millions dollars. I think serious concern whether tax system address kind needs economically, added. But there's possibility. Added Stern, We owe fans go back look notion whether tax rate might begin achieve result wanted. It look promising, we're going spend next two days see give favorable response. Though decision cancel games surprising, represent major shift prior labor stalemates. Both sides reluctantly hammered deal 1995 start training camp sole notion missing games preserving NBA's perfect record. Tuesday, could come accord. I'd like think last games cancel, Granik said. But unless something else works, there's dramatic breakthrough, I think certainly season that's jeopardy. In decision almost certainly lead first work stoppage National Basketball Association history, league Monday announced cancellation 114 preseason games. Citing stalled negotiations Players Association new collective bargaining agreement, league officials said would decide next week whether cancel first week regular season games. While decision expected 10 days, nonetheless sent strong signal owners players probably willing cancel least part regular season order settle labor dispute. Both sides agree would take least three weeks hold abbreviated training camps sign 200 free agents new contracts. Privately, officials sides believe season start scheduled Nov. 3 even December. Unlike Major League Baseball, National Football League National Hockey League, NBA never lost regular-season game labor strife. Since we're even negotiating, conclude likely we're going miss part regular season, deputy commissioner Russ Granik said Monday night. We'll try defer decisions last minute, right look good. The two sides meet Thursday  first official bargaining session since Aug. 6. Commissioner David Stern group owners walked meeting dismissing merits new proposal players. Neither Granik players association executive director Billy Hunter sounded week's meeting would go long way toward signing new agreement  precursor playing again. I think choice miss games point, Hunter said. In fact, I think they've intended along. They've locked us out, they've refused negotiate they've given us proposal that's ludicrous. Not sides still awaiting outcome arbitration decision due Oct. 18 - Fordham Law School dean John Feerick rule whether 200 players $800 million guaranteed contracts paid lockout  owners players also making time win public opinion test fans' loyalties canceling games. Monday 11 cities throughout country, players holding make-shift press conferences training-camp venues, NBA arenas gymnasiums. Patrick Ewing, union president, several teammates speak SUNY-Purchase Purchase, N.Y., Knicks train season. With training camp originally scheduled open Oct. 6, message players clear: owners would call end lockout, would ready play today. About 100 players expected attend, speak sign autographs fans afterward. I wish would put energies trying negotiate deal rather various things they've doing, Granik said. The dispute essentially owners players judiciously divvy $2 billion income. It began last year contention owners employees receiving fair share pot. The owners allowed terminate current agreement clause enabled player salaries reached 53.8 percent total basketball-related income. The owners say figure currently hovering around 57.1 percent. Though many economic issues need resolved, main point contention since labor agreement expired owners declared lockout July 1 clause allows teams pay free agents whatever want, regardless salary-cap rules governing NBA's 29 teams. Called Larry Bird exception, created allow Hall Fame Boston Celtics forward re-sign Celtics near end career. Michael Jordan exercised clause last two years Chicago Bulls, earning $30 million per season  figures $5 million team allowed spend players. But exorbitant salaries paid several unproven stars last years $100 million deals sprouting routinely, owners determined swing income pendulum back toward enforcing restricted salary cap  hard cap  putting ceiling much one player could earn. Last year, players received $1 billion dollars salaries benefits made proposals guaranteed increase number 20 percent next four years, Granik said prepared statement. Our proposals would result average player salary $3.1 million minimum salary 10-year veterans $750,000. Unfortunately, union leadership unwilling give serious consideration offered. Hunter labeled claims optimistic projections, shot number new proposals presented players Sept. 25. If left current deal place, would gotten much anyway, added. All we're saying is, we're position accept hard cap. Monday's decision cancel preseason came less two weeks NBA indefinitely postponed training camp canceled first week exhibition games. Through tickets sales alone, Granik estimated losing exhibition season would cost league $35 million $40 million. Decisions cancellations regular season games expected made next week, added. A league official said games would canceled blocks one two weeks, depending upon circumstances regarding negotiations. Thursday's bargaining session suddenly become last hope starting season time. Hurdles could overcome quickly, I reason believe Thursday, Granik said. Added Hunter: Of course expect much get done. When Russ David decide negotiations going real substantive, something happen. What they're banking players going miss paychecks cave November. It's they've ingested something pass. And passes, they'll negotiate. The first substantive talks two months opposing sides National Basketball Association's labor dispute came went Thursday without hint settlement. Still, five-hour meeting described cordial league almost like two bulls letting little steam players association produced another scheduled round talks next Tuesday. Barring major compromise, enough time preserve full season prevent league losing first regular-season games labor strife November. Russ Granik, NBA's deputy commissioner, said league would wait next week's meeting deciding cancel regular-season games. He also discussed possibility significantly shortened season. We made determination need exact number games order representative season, Granik said. But recognize beyond certain point can't possibly sell fans we're NBA season. Whether's 60 games, 50 games 49 53, we're yet. We months face decision. Perhaps progress involved Thursday conference room midtown Manhattan hotel question-and-answer session league's latest proposal players. Patrick Ewing, union president, vice presidents Herb Williams Dikembe Mutombo attended meeting union's executive director, Billy Hunter, union lawyers. No owners present, Granik, Commissioner David Stern league's lawyers spent day explaining intricacies two-week-old proposal players. At one point two parties broke lunch, Stern Hunter raised voices accused handling constituencies poorly, participant meeting said. But two seen shaking hands laughing meeting concluded shortly 3 p.m. There venting sides, Hunter said. We've placid respectful. Today, took coats inclined take gloves little bit. Having done that, I think kind loosened sides. Hunter added: Did anybody blink today? They're sort look us kind nuance find course negotiations might, way another, give indication we're mouthing one thing might open something else. We're looking body language, too. I think they're ready make deal. The last formal meeting sides Aug. 6 ended Stern owners abruptly marched received proposal players. In critical ruling North American National Basketball Association players' union, arbitrator John Feerick decides Monday whether 200 players guaranteed contracts paid lockout. If players win, owners liable dlrs 800 million guaranteed salaries, although vowed appeal lose. The league already sued players Feerick's jurisdiction. If win, I think emboldens spirit resolve players, union director Billy Hunter said. But I think anybody celebrating there's guarantee end lockout. It means pay 200 players, they've indicated us intent file immediate appeal take far order avoid payment. So even rule favor, hollow victory. The players going get paid Nov. 15 circumstance, Hunter said. If owners win, remove last wild card players holding. The sides negotiated since last Tuesday, union proposed superstar tax highest contracts. The league made counterproposal Friday, asking tax imposed much lower threshold. Hunter dismissed league's latest proposal Friday afternoon, said sides would best served awaiting Feerick's ruling. It's unlikely negotiations held week, since union holding meeting NBA players agents advisory committee Las Vegas Wednesday Friday. We've got get sense players are, consider reasonable they're willing order get season commence, Hunter said. The union filed grievance Feerick lockout imposed July 1 owners' announcement June 29 would honor guaranteed deals. In six-day hearing summer, union argued owners protected liable guaranteed salaries work stoppage inserting lockout language standard player contract. The Sacramento Kings inserted lockout clause center Olden Polynice's contract 1994, approved league. The union used existence clause argue teams protected similarly. Most players due receive first paychecks Nov. 15, although dozen clauses entitling paid summer. None received paycheck. The NBA argued tenet labor law allows employers withhold pay employees lockout. The league also called former union director Simon Gourdine testify. He said understanding negotiated old labor agreement 1995 players would paid owners chose reopen agreement impose lockout. More 220 National Basketball Association players guaranteed contracts find Monday whether paid management lockout, long-awaited arbitrator's decision may affect leverage league's dispute players major ramifications American sports-labor law. But neither players owners counting ruling arbitrator, John Feerick, speed negotiations, especially Feerick finds favor players, award could approach $800 million salaries. NBA attorneys indicated union decision goes management, seek vacated appealing U.S. District Court Manhattan then, necessary, 2nd U.S. Circuit Court Appeals, process could prevent players getting paid several months. The NBA already canceled first two weeks regular season labor dispute. The league litigation pending U.S. District Court Manhattan. If players win ruling, NBA intends renew motion disqualify Feerick. The motion brought last summer grounds collective bargaining agreement existed and, therefore, jurisdiction hear matter. If rules favor, I think emboldens spirit resolve players, said Billy Hunter, union executive director. But understand end lockout. It means pay 200-some players. And still litigation alive may take resolve. At most, hollow victory. Feerick taken full 30 days render decision. Whatever decides, ruling watched carefully. There precedent locked-out athletes paid. During NBA summer lockout 1995, players missed paychecks file grievance. Neither National Hockey League players locked first three months 1994-95 season. The union argued owners protected inserting clauses non-payment lockouts strikes individual player contracts. In support arguments, union pointed clauses individual player contracts contained language precluding payment lockout. The league relying basic tenets labor law, hold employees paid strikes lockouts. A ruling union would significant future negotiations players owners. The deterrent factor lockout employees subject collective bargaining agreement get paid agreement expires unable reach new agreement. If Feerick finds favor players, economic incentive guaranteed contracts reach agreement quickly. They would essentially paid playing basketball. If Feerick finds favor owners, reality paid may spur players reach agreement quickly. But Hunter disputed notion, conference call Friday talked openly entire season's canceled players would back away ultimate goals. I'm concerned, Hunter said. There's demonstration there's going change resolve. After players saw proposals league recent posturing NBA owners, well, I two players call tell me, need be, they'd willing hock everything they've got. Another significant development may thedeparture many players Europe dispute settled, according least two player agents. I think would case-by-case basis, yes, there's already people talking that, said Bill Strickland, member union's agents advisory committee. Steve Kauffman, another member committee, said would explore possibility one client, Nets center Rony Seikaly, would sign professional team Greece. We look void deal team, Kauffman said. But would want right work temporarily could come back honor contract.' Russ Granik, NBA deputy commissioner, said league approved idea players' earning living elsewhere lockout settled. Proposals exchanged last week included concept luxury-tax system player salaries appeared reflect first signs progress negotiations since lockout began July 1. But sides termed figures other's proposal unacceptable, unclear whether either side willing compromise. I think get carried away possibilities yet, Granik said. When explored idea tax system, taking players word wanted make headway. But call first proposal meaningless charitable. They proposed something impact. As stands, can't solution. The owners' goal slow growth player salaries relation leaguewide revenue next three years, players want keep earning much possible. As labor battles go, current one National Basketball Association players weird even sports standards. There real possibility most, all, coming season canceled. In union battle interests best paid, make union scale, dominating discussion. And workers, management, considering trying make union disappear. The current arrangement produced unbalanced pay scale immense proportions. Last year players ever received union minimum, $242,000 rookies $272,000 veterans. The number players making $1 million $2 million year  middle class, NBA terms  fell sharply. But Michael Jordan made $33 million. This surprise. Sports entertainment business, unlike movies. Big stars get millions, get union scale. Over years, NBA efforts stem rise salaries failed. The important loophole salary cap lets team sign free agent whatever willing pay. When adopted, assumed team would pay lot rival could pay. But worked way. In current negotiation, league offered guarantee payroll rise 20 percent next four years, $1 billion $1.2 billion, says open proposals split money way players want, whether raising minimum salary guaranteeing raises veterans. The union says worried middle class, seems determined preserve free market. The league got broadcasters, NBC Time Warner's cable channels, agree pay year's television fees whether games broadcast. (They paid back later years, either reduced fees extra games show.) Owners hoped players would think management willing wait out, come terms small part season canceled. But union acting unhurried. It turned aside requests negotiations week, saying players meet first. Then issue union suicide, tactic rejected players 1995. The idea players union, would illegal antitrust laws owners collude. The sky would limit. That tactic might fail. The courts could reject union decertification vote sham, case players may fear teams would feel free offer less old union minimum. But players go route, could long time real negotiations get going. Billy Hunter, union's executive director, warned owners week prolonged lockout could destroy league's popularity. That seers said four years ago, baseball's World Series canceled labor troubles. But fan memories relatively short, baseball seems popular ever. With mind, owners players may choose battle months. In critical ruling North American National Basketball Association players' union, arbitrator John Feerick decides Monday whether 200 players guaranteed contracts paid lockout. If players win, owners liable dlrs 800 million guaranteed salaries, although vowed appeal lose. The league already sued players Feerick's jurisdiction. If win, I think emboldens spirit resolve players, union director Billy Hunter said. But I think anybody celebrating there's guarantee end lockout. It means pay 200 players, they've indicated us intent file immediate appeal take far order avoid payment. So even rule favor, hollow victory. The players going get paid Nov. 15 circumstance, Hunter said. If owners win, remove last wild card players holding. The sides negotiated since last Tuesday, union proposed superstar tax highest contracts. The league made counterproposal Friday, asking tax imposed much lower threshold. Hunter dismissed league's latest proposal Friday afternoon, said sides would best served awaiting Feerick's ruling. It's unlikely negotiations held week, since union holding meeting NBA players agents advisory committee Las Vegas Wednesday Friday. We've got get sense players are, consider reasonable they're willing order get season commence, Hunter said. The union filed grievance Feerick lockout imposed July 1 owners' announcement June 29 would honor guaranteed deals. In six-day hearing summer, union argued owners protected liable guaranteed salaries work stoppage inserting lockout language standard player contract. The Sacramento Kings inserted lockout clause center Olden Polynice's contract 1994, approved league. The union used existence clause argue teams protected similarly. Most players due receive first paychecks Nov. 15, although dozen clauses entitling paid summer. None received paycheck. The NBA argued tenet labor law allows employers withhold pay employees lockout. The league also called former union director Simon Gourdine testify, Feerick upheld union objections prohibited Gourdine saying whether understanding negotiated old labor agreement 1995 players would paid owners chose reopen agreement impose lockout. Patrick Ewing want sound like striking longshoreman demanding health benefits. I'm going try put dollars cents. But Ewing, president National Basketball Association Players Association, played public-relations game Tuesday expounding themes labor unrest: strong-willed unity short-sighted proposals. On day training camps scheduled begin, players across country held news conferences 14 NBA cities proclaim ready practice regular season. We want show public we, players, want play, said Ewing, flanked five teammates. Today supposed start training camp. We want practice want season start. But unfortunately, owners locked us season postponed. The owners players scheduled hold first bargaining session since Aug. 6 Thursday Manhattan. Neither side predicting progress toward signing new collective bargaining agreement beginning season scheduled Nov. 3. The league canceled entire 114-game preseason Monday. Next week, consider canceling first-ever regular season games league history. With wide philosophical differences $2 billion annual income distributed, sides privately said expect play regular season game December. Billy Hunter, union's executive director, offered glimmer hope. He spoke optimistically potential quick resolution. Standing feet away Ewing, said, I hope owners commissioner gotten message: we're serious deal. I'm prepared make quantum leap. I think we're far off. I think there's lot jockeying, lot rhetoric lot games played. But owners decide want deal, they'll get one. But soon after, began lambasting owners' latest proposal, includes eventual phasing Larry Bird exception  clause enables free agents earn unlimited salaries current teams. That clause represents major rift negotiations. Owners would like implement restrictive salary cap would eventually put ceiling much one player earn. I know going come speedy resolution, Ewing said. They're entrenched want, hard cap. And feel hard cap, players, cannot survive. We would stupid ignorant accept deal. Said Hunter, If go proposal, joke. It's step backwards. I cannot understand it. If intent reach agreement late stage negotiate earnest, wrong way go it. League officials respond players' comments. All want fair share feel like they're trying take away us, Ewing said. `There's perception we're strike. It's way around. We've locked out. Besides Ewing, Knicks included former union president Buck Williams, former vice president Herb Williams, Allan Houston John Starks. Marcus Camby also showed briefly. When media horde closed in, however, third-year forward went look late-arriving teammates inside practice facility. He stopped gym door, locked. They locked us out, said Rockets forward Mario Elie. Everybody's got get corrected. It's us. They're ones closed us down. The stalemate elicited talks possibly bringing mediator coming weeks, Major League Baseball 1994 help solve labor dispute. But players convinced commissioner David Stern owners set testing resolve genuine headway made negotiations. That means missing paychecks November, something Ewing said players prepared do. Both sides still awaiting outcome arbitration decision due Oct. 18. Fordham Law School dean John Feerick rule whether 200 players $800 million guaranteed contracts paid lockout. Feerick's decision could give new leverage one side. But players lose arbitration, 400 athletes  many extravagant lifestyles tremendous financial obligations  allegiances instantly tested. It's like want see strong are, Ewing said. Based proposals we've received, we're strong. So far, seems though NBA dug position, Buck Williams said. I think they're concerned point making deal. He added, We're far apart Grand Canyon right now. The National Basketball Association, embroiled labor dispute players, Tuesday canceled first two weeks 1998-99 season. It first time league's 51-year history lose regular-season games. The NBA's deputy commissioner, Russ Granik, announced cancellation nearly three half hours meetings concluded Manhattan hotel. The decision cancel 99 games Nov. 3 Nov. 16 came players association proposed implementation tax system instead hard salary cap, proposal owners said would respond Friday. We tried best today try possible salvage season, said Alonzo Mourning, Miami Heat center. Unfortunately, work out. After 35,001 games without blemish, NBA joins National Hockey League, National Football League Major League Baseball lost games labor dispute. Taking account three- four-week period would needed training camp free-agent signings season starts, league said would decide two weeks whether make cancellations. I'm sad disappointed, said NBA commissioner, David Stern. I consider collective failure, I honestly know else could done. I things I like think best interests game. And I believe is. The decision came sides agreed substantive talks since owners imposed lockout player July 1. Seventeen players, including union president Patrick Ewing vice presidents Mitch Richmond, Herb Williams, Dikemebe Mutombo Ty Corbin, attended meeting along Stern, Granik five members ownership committee  Madison Square Garden president Dave Checketts owners Abe Pollin Washington, Gordon Gund Cleveland, Les Alexander Houston Jerry Colangelo Phoenix. The talks featured players association implied bevy concessions made owners felt would accommodate league's desire swing revenue pendulum back toward owners. The dispute involves distribution approximately $2 billion league-wide income. The main sticking point owners' insistence salary cap without exceptions, implementation believe would bring player salaries' line revenue growth. While players discuss elimination Larry Bird exception  clause allows player secure amount money wants re-signing current team  address exception taxation proposal. The main points follows:  A 50 percent tax would imposed salary earned $18 million, clause would affect players exercised Bird rights. For example, player made $20 million, team would forced put $1 million fund would likely distributed low-revenue teams. There could provisions made players, said Jeffrey Kessler, chief outside counsel union. We want anything would encourage Chicago getting Michael Jordan back. And I think league feels way. The proposal similar luxury tax proposed union 1995 negotiations, would nearly liberal.  A salary cap credit would go effect league pays 63 percent revenues salary. Whatever figure number reduces salary cap next year. If figure $29 million salary cap, 29 teams would work salary cap $1 million less previous season. But players would assurance salary cap would go least $2 million credit goes effect.  Also, 63-percent threshold met, reduction annual 20 percent raises would take effect multi-year contracts. Players would either get raises 10 percent rate growth league revenues. The union said clearly addresses league's desire bring salaries line revenues. Since owners re-opened current agreement 57.1 percent revenue going toward salaries, 63-percent figure would probably come substantially owners agree proposal.  Teams would get right first refusal free agents fourth year incoming rookies, meaning player would contractually obligated team first four years deal. Currently, rookie scale three years includes clause enables player exercise Bird rights two seasons  clause Kevin Garnett parlayed astronomical $126 million deal last year Minnesota.  Finally, players agreed make marijuana banned substance. Details testing negotiated specific discussions took place regarding testing performance-enhancing drugs, provision owners included last proposal. In return concessions, players want increase minimum salary  currently $272,500  creation average salary exception. This would allow every team salary cap able sign one free agent per year average salary  currently $2.6 million. We're buoyed fact first time they've decided submit counterproposal, union's executive director, Billy Hunter, said. I know I'm optimistic, I earnestly say look ballplayers eye say made valiant effort. Asked players would finally tested financially cancellation games, Hunter added: It's us blinking. We want reach agreement. We're tired rhetoric, we're tired game-playing. Our position along want accept bad deal. Granik said refunds fans would made end calendar month first refund would include monies canceled preseason games. He estimated losses hundreds millions dollars. I think serious concern whether tax system address kind needs economically, added. But there's possibility. Added Stern, We owe fans go back look notion whether tax rate might begin achieve result wanted. It look promising, we're going spend next two days see give favorable response. Though decision cancel games surprising, represent major shift prior labor stalemates. Both sides reluctantly hammered deal 1995 start training camp sole notion missing games preserving NBA's perfect record. Tuesday, could come accord. I'd like think last games cancel, Granik said. But unless something else works, there's dramatic breakthrough, I think certainly season that's jeopardy. ","The National Basketball Association joined the NHL, the NFL and baseball when it canceled first the preseason games then two weeks of regular season.In litigation that is complicated by a dispute over the distribution of nearly $2 billion in league income, the main sticking point is the owner's insistence on a salary cap without exceptions.Top players are avoiding discussion of the Larry Bird exception, which allows a player to secure any amount he wants in resigning with his current team except as it applies to their taxation proposal.Also pending is an arbiter's decision as to whether players will be paid during the lockout.","The Larry Bird exception has been used to pay some NBA players much more than the salary cap allows.Stalled labor dispute over NBA salaries cancels preseason games and threatens regular season games.NBA owners and players plan meeting, which is unsuccessful.Players submit proposal at next meeting.Owners to respond by Fri.First 2 weeks of the season, 99 games, are cancelled.An arbitrator will decide on Mon. whether or not NBA players with guaranteed salary contracts should be paid during the owners' lockout.As the NBA labor battle goes on, most, if not all, season games may be cancelled.Lesser paid players may suffer if union doesn't survive.","In a dispute over a new collective bargaining agreement the National Basketball Association owners declared a lockout on July 1, 1998.They wanted to discard a clause in the old agreement allowing teams to pay their own free agents whatever they wanted, substituting a hard salary cap.The players wanted to keep earning as much as possible.On Oct. 5 all 114 preseason games were cancelled.The players then proposed a 50% tax on salaries above $18 million that the owners rejected.On Oct. 13 the NBA cancelled the first two weeks of the regular season.By Oct. 21 the entire season seemed in jeopardy in the interests of the best paid.","In a dispute between the owners and NBA players over how to divide the $2 billion in league-wide income, all preseason and the first 99 1998-1999 regular season games were cancelled.The Larry Bird exception, a clause in the old agreement that allowed teams to pay their own free agents any amount, regardless of salary-cap rules, is the major issue.The owners want a restricted salary cap.The players have proposed a superstar tax, and the owners have presented a counter proposal, but negotiations have stalled.Meanwhile, both sides are awaiting a ruling by arbitrator Feerick on whether $800 million in guaranteed salaries will be paid during the lockout."

The delegation travel Kuala Lumpur Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum Nov. 14-18. David said free trade focus discussions among government leaders attending. What I hope say APEC strong affirmation free-trade agenda strong affirmation foreign direct investment agenda, added. In little week, world's leaders converge businesslike city heart Southeast Asia annual meeting Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation forum. They could hardly meeting provocative place. On Sept. 1, Malaysia discontinued trading currency, ringgit, imposed sweeping controls flow capital stock currency markets, particularly investment overseas. In so, Malaysian prime minister, Mahathir Mohamad, effect slammed door global economy President Clinton leaders coming champion. Mahathir's decision drew jeers international investors policy- makers, warned Malaysia seeking quick fix would retard desperately needed reforms leave odd man Asia finally recovered regional malaise. Now, though, Mahathir's allies marshaling new economic data say indicate capital controls breathing new life country's moribund economy. Malaysia's foreign reserves rose strongly September, anecdotal evidence consumers starting spend again. It's nice able say since adopted capital controls, economy improved, said Zainal Aznam Yusof, deputy director Institute Strategic International Studies, research organization helped draft policies. But want see whether strongly sustainable. Critics said predictable capital controls would short-term tonic Malaysia's economy. Because country sheltered vagaries capital flows currency fluctuations, said, government able ease interest rates encourage consumer spending. Still, mere fact Malaysia's experiment yielded positive results guarantees issue come APEC meeting. With Mahathir leading campaign, cause capital controls fiery advocate penchant getting skin Westerners. Mahathir outspoken political leader, said Chia Yew Boon, independent analyst Singapore. There way likes Clinton Jiang Zemin going able muzzle him, added, referring President Jiang China. Policy-makers United States expressed fears Malaysia's gambit seen successful, economically weakened countries region, like Indonesia, might tempted try it. So far, Indonesian officials said would stick recovery plan devised International Monetary Fund, stresses economic austerity open markets. But officials Japan expressed sympathy Mahathir's policies, Paul Krugman, economist Massachusetts Institute Technology, advocated using emergency measure. Yusof said recent events vindicated Malaysia's contention needed insulate ravages global financial system. He said recent near-collapse prominent American hedge fund underscored sudden flows capital destructive consequences. The Long-Term Capital Management hedge fund, based Greenwich, Conn., nearly wrecked series wrong bets Treasury securities collapse economy Russia prompted flight capital country. The LTCM fiasco really provides case study could go wrong global economy, Yusof said. With capital controls protection, Yusof said Malaysia picking pieces shattered economy. In addition growing foreign reserves, said Malaysia improved trade balance revived consumer purchases durable goods. Foreign investors also wholly abandoned Malaysia, experts predicted would. While foreign direct investment fell September  $142 million, average monthly rate $321 million period January September  dry completely. For every comforting statistic, though, critics produce alarming one. They said increase Malaysia's foreign reserves merely due new capital restrictions, stipulated Malaysian currency held outside country would worthless unless repatriated Sept. 30. The skeptics also noted bank lending declined September, despite several reductions interest rates. So consumers buying new cars home appliances merely dipping savings, means buying spree end savings depleted. The argument imposing capital controls, regain control monetary policy, would increase supply money lessen liquidity crunch, said K.S. Jomo, professor political economy University Malaya here. But that's happening. The biggest flaw Malaysia's policy, Jomo others said, timing. With Asian crisis year old, much foreign capital country already gone. The critics said Mahathir spooked would-be investors without even locking ones used here. There case made temporary imposition capital controls, avert crisis, respond one, Jomo said. In fact, Asian currencies, like Indonesian rupiah Thai baht, actually rebounded since Malaysia suspended trading currency fixed exchange rate 3.8 ringgit dollar. Analysts liken situation buying insurance policy disaster come gone. More important, capital controls slowing much-needed corporate banking reforms. The government's rescue Renong, major conglomerate close ties Mahathir, going ahead, though analysts predict government eventually scrap much-criticized plan. The rescue politically connected companies remains tense issue here. On Monday, trial Malaysia's former deputy prime minister, Anwar Ibrahim, charges corruption sex-related crimes, Anwar angrily denied Mahathir's claim approved bailout. Anwar's sensational trial reminder Mahathir's economic policies cannot disentangled politics. Malaysia's 72-year-old prime minister clashed former protege respond Asian crisis, dismissed Anwar day imposing capital controls. During boom times, Mahathir support policies wrapping anti-foreigner language. In speech Monday, attacked familiar target, saying foreign currency traders cause currency turmoil, adding: They spread worldwide. They precipitated current recession every country. But Mahathir's treatment Anwar stirred anger sparked growing social unrest Malaysia. With protesters chanting reform usually orderly streets city, experts said Mahathir needed capital controls work order soothe country's agitated population. Things heat economy improve, said Chandra Muzaffar, professor political science University Malaya. Then whole question Mahathir leadership remain issue. In regard, least, leaders converge Kuala Lumpur two weeks able identify embattled host. The leaders Malaysia's ruling party met Tuesday discuss replacement ousted deputy prime minister Anwar Ibrahim, faces trial next month case test country's legal system.

In fact, Malaysia country trying self-defense mechanisms capital controls. Hong Kong recently spent fortune investing stock market ward speculators. And Washington trying figure hedge funds watching Federal Reserve help bail major one going under, seeing investments others send U.S. dollar tailspin Japan's yen. Ironically, Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad, made one typical anti-free-market comments last year's summit, probably could opened year's I told so. But even major domestic problems. Mahathir, 72, widely credited creating modern Malaysia 17 years power, dismissed Anwar Ibrahim, expected successor, apparent dispute battle country's economic mess.

Habibie, spoken Anwar's treatment. The Philippine leader said considering skipping summit Asia-Pacific leaders Malaysia November protest arrest Anwar, described personal friend. He later said would attend summit made earlier remarks sympathy toward Anwar. The Philippines, Malaysia Indonesia founding member countries ASEAN, also includes Brunei, Laos, Myanmar, Singapore, Thailand Vietnam. Among Asia's leaders, Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad notable man bold vision: physical social transformation would push nation forefront world affairs. It almost came true. In 17 years prime minister, Mahathir, 72, medical doctor, fostered economic liberalization led world's fastest rates growth. He drove Malaysians productive, embrace high technology begin major investments around world. He created national affirmative-action program allowed country's ethnic Chinese, Malays Indians share improved living standards new sense Malaysian identity pride. This year Mahathir's year triumph, perhaps paving way retirement, inauguration huge public works projects impressive gatherings foreign leaders sportsmen. But today, dizzying turnaround, Malaysia Asia's critical list, economy teetering edge disaster stability shaken seems entirely avoidable political cat fight. Last month, Mahathir dismissed arrested deputy heir apparent, Anwar Ibrahim, 51, accusing corruption illegal sex acts. The move set street demonstrations aroused international condemnation, particularly Anwar's many friends foreign governments. One region's stable prosperous nations suddenly uproar. It appears Indonesia, Thailand, Japan South Korea, pressures economic collapse spawned political crisis. In nations, result change leadership. The question is: Is Mahathir next? The answer far clear. Unlike Indonesia, little evidence simmering discontent Malaysia. The ouster former President Suharto Indonesia predicted many people. Almost one seems foreseen eruption here. Malaysia familiar political demonstrations. Unlike Indonesians, Malaysians rarely riot. Many people puzzled disturbed encountered water cannon riot police streets recent weeks. What we're seeing unprecedented, said Ambassador John Malott United States. This never happened Malaysia, nobody knows going go. You write lot scenarios totally uncharted waters. Mahathir, confident nation-builder, seems flailing watches legacy crumble. An economy growing 8 percent year last decade headed contraction perhaps 6 percent. Angry frustrated, closed Malaysia international financial markets one month ago, turning back foreign investors embraced fueled country's rapid growth. The move intended effect bringing home Malaysian currency, insulating speculators Mahathir blames crisis, giving adrenaline jolt self-contained economy. It move seems tune recent round questioning economic orthodoxy International Monetary Fund. But foreign economists expect work long. Mahathir attacking fundamental beliefs free market, capitalism, Wall Street, foreign diplomat said. We either watching economic theory rewritten reconfirmed  I think rewritten. The day making economic gamble, Mahathir set severe political crisis tenure, dismissing Anwar, man grooming successor. Two weeks later, Anwar arrested home held incommunicado 10 days, says beaten jailers. Last week charged 10 counts corruption sexual misconduct could result prison term 34 years. The harshness moves unleashed surge largely unsuspected discontent mobilized Anwar's motley fellow constituencies: liberal democrats, young professionals politically assertive Muslims. For first time decades, Malaysians thousands demonstrated streets mosques met tear gas water cannon. Many people beaten hundreds detained, although later released. With emergence still-tentative opposition movement, fear expressed one Western diplomat downward spiral suppression breeds discontent breeds suppression breeds discontent. People whisper Mahathir's days may numbered. But venture guess number might be. Given control levers power lack focus leadership opposition, Mahathir could ride storm Anwar's trial proceeds. But struck harsh blow morale nation, sense confidence worked hard build slogan Malaysia Can! In generally decorous nation, depth anger expressed two men called father son disturbing hear. Anwar, says prime minister, despicable sodomist. Mahathir, says former deputy, senile insane. Malaysians, stolidly accepted Mahathir's authoritarian rule mixture gratitude emerging pride, seem stunned. Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad said Friday choosy successor. The man need necessarily religious preoccupied virtuous deeds times, national news agency, Bernama, quoted Mahathir saying Friday prayers Al-Falah Mosque northern town Jitra Kedah state. It sufficient person things acceptable people, Mahathir said. So far Mahathir, 72, designated three heirs-apparent 17-year rule. One resigned. Another challenged Mahathir leadership ruling party, lost. On Sept. 2, fired last one, Anwar Ibrahim, calling morally unfit office. Anwar mounted nationwide campaign prime minister detained national security risk charged illegal homosexual acts corruption connection allegations. Mahathir told reporters later Anwar working toward toppling prime minister president governing coalition's dominant party, United Malays National Organization. He appeared good actually planning ways bringing down. At first, I believe people told this, I know true, said Mahathir.

We hope make clear president Milosevic people Yugoslavia extreme gravity situation, said. Under NATO threat end punishing offensive ethnic Albanian separatists Kosovo, President Slobodan Milosevic Yugoslavia ordered units army back barracks may well avoid attack alliance, military observers diplomats say. Milosevic, one hand excoriated Washington scourge Kosovo yet hand treated key peace Bosnia, acted European Union, NATO United Nations prepared review Monday possible military intervention. Russia stepped warnings action dispatched foreign defense ministers unusually high-level mission see Yugoslav president Sunday Belgrade. As often, Milosevic appears bowed foreign demands nick time yet still accomplished wanted. This weekend, foreign diplomatic observers Kosovo reported military stand-down taken place province, Milosevic's forces waged fierce offensive Albanian rebels. The observers said except segments three brigades, units Yugoslav army home. The daily reports observer mission, made U.S., European Union Russian military experts, one key elements helping Washington European capitals decide whether Milosevic met demands cease-fire. By putting army back barracks, sending police units Kosovo ordering end burning looting villages, Milosevic may well avoid NATO attack, diplomats Washington said. But time, acknowledge NATO looked way, enjoyed three-month license overwhelm Kosovo Liberation Army  rebel army fighting independence Kosovo ethnic Albanian majority  terrorize rural civilian population supports it. His military operation created 250,000 refugees, Clinton administration gearing take care winter variety relief organizations. U.S. officials said expected Richard Holbrooke, U.S. envoy dealt Milosevic negotiating end war Bosnia, meet Monday discuss political plan Kosovo. The heart disagreement Kosovo Serbia, Yugoslavia's principal republic, insists keeping Kosovo province, ethnic Albanians chafed Milosevic's repression since stripped province virtual autonomy 1989, seek independence. The West, fearing precedent independence Kosovo would set conflicts world, trying mediate middle course. In essence, diplomats said believed plan Holbrooke present Milosevic calls three-year interim period leading status fairly close pre-1989 autonomy arrangement. Since Kosovo conflict flared March, critics Washington's policy toward Milosevic argue able choreograph every move suit goal: pushing Albanian population submission impunity. The United States allies waited four months cleaned clock Kosovo Liberation Army, said Morton Abramowitz, head International Crisis Group, policy analysis organization, taken three weeks discuss military action, result 500 Albanian villages destroyed. Administration officials acknowledge NATO failed live earlier threat June strike Serbia, Milosevic took advantage indecision plunged ahead artillery tank offensive lightly armed guerrilla forces, whose bedrock popular support helped win effective control large swaths Kosovo territory, including key roads. While that, Milosevic skillfully managed key requirement Washington: made sure war spill neighboring Albania Macedonia, fragile countries traditionally volatile area. All along, biggest fear Washington Kosovo conflict would engulf neighboring countries encourage Albania ethnic Albanian population Macedonia join cause. Such possibility raised specter new Balkans conflict three years peace secured Bosnia. Milosevic catered Washington's concern conflict contained. The Yugoslav army mined Kosovo's borders Macedonia Albania, ensuring refugees could escape limiting routes arms supplies rebels. The Yugoslav leader also understood Washington unsure deal disorganized Albanian political leadership Kosovo unbending Kosovo Liberation Army, whose main chiefs hardened emigres returned Switzerland Germany. For example, Holbrooke persuaded Milosevic meet May Ibrahim Rugova, top Albanian political leader Kosovo, encounter turned little photo opportunity. For procedural breakthrough, Holbrooke recommended lifting ban foreign investment Serbia put place month before. After meeting Rugova, Milosevic stepped military operations Kosovo, forcing Washington reverse carry investment ban. In late June, Holbrooke met two self-styled Kosovo guerrilla commanders province's western town Junik broke contact. Clinton administration officials said time concerned NATO intervention would bolster separatist forces. To try put best face situation, Washington worked Moscow get Milosevic accept presence international monitors would patrol Kosovo report military action. The monitors slow getting organized. By August, Yugoslav army, backed Serbian special police, full swing rebels burning looting villages process, monitors found difficult gain access fighting. They drove roadblocks, knew something going sounds smoke, could precise. In recent days tanks artillery withdrawn, access improved, monitors say. But areas central Kosovo around Likovac Gornje Obrinje monitors ruled limits land mines roads. The mines believed planted guerrillas. Gornje Obrinje site massacre 18 ethnic Albanian women, children elderly people Sept. 26. A British reporter walked across fields village Sunday said 10 mortar shells, apparently Serbian police Yugoslav army, fired village early Sunday afternoon. The Yugoslav army police forces responsible vast majority atrocities Kosovo conflict, said report New York-based group Human Rights Watch, released Sunday. The report said rebels also violated laws war taking civilian hostages carrying summary executions. But violations guerrillas lesser scale government abuses, author report, Fred Abrahams, concluded. The report focused called watershed conflict  attack police forces three ethnic Albanian villages late February early March Drenica region central Kosovo. At least 83 people, including 24 women children, killed attack, involved helicopters, artillery armored personnel carriers. In Yugoslav capital, Belgrade, four-hour drive north rolling countryside Kosovo's capital Pristina, Milosevic remains politically secure. That part, domestic critics say, diplomats like Holbrooke head U.N.refugee agency, Sadako Ogata, insist going see him, thus enhancing stature. The American envoy Richard Holbrooke met President Slobodan Milosevic Yugoslavia Monday night according American diplomats told take steps pull back military Kosovo Province face NATO attack. Milosevic also told, diplomats said, insure roughly 250,000 ethnic Albanian refugees forced flee homes fighting last six months allowed return home. Most refugees reluctant return many Serb police officers destroyed homes villages remain neighborhoods. After delivering sternest message far Milosevic Kosovo conflict, Holbrooke said news conference NATO's military plans attacking Serbia moving ahead serious, intense sustained basis. Holbrooke's mission Milosevic described American diplomats die trip, added, We're serious juncture. Shortly Holbrooke's meeting Milosevic, Yugoslav leader issued defiant statement Serbian television said threats aggression outlined Holbrooke represented criminal act. Milosevic, rarely comments meetings foreign diplomats whose tough words cast unusually ominous tone, also said Holbrooke's position constituted support Albanian terrorists Albanian people. Milosevic apparently accusing Holbrooke supporting ethnic Albanian guerrillas Kosovo Liberation Army, fighting make Serbian province Kosovo independent nation. The Yugoslav leader added seven days skirmishes military action. An American diplomat familiar themes Holbrooke planned stress Milosevic said expectation American envoy would walk Monday night agreement. Rather, point underscore Yugoslav leader make explicit expected him. It quite ultimatum, diplomat said, matter steps taken show compliance. The essence Holbrooke's demands centered issues outlined United Nations Security Council resolution two weeks ago. The resolution ordered Milosevic withdraw extra army police forces sent Kosovo deal guerrillas send back bases military forces normally stationed province. So far, American diplomats said, Milosevic withdrawn troops field barracks. Such move essential, American diplomats said, create conducive atmosphere possible negotiations future status province. The U.N. resolution also calls political solution. Holbrooke U.S. ambassador Macedonia, Christopher Hill, discussed Milosevic political document drawn State Department calls broad autonomy Kosovo. Milosevic withdrew autonomy 1989 began campaign Serb nationalism. The countryside central Kosovo eerily silent since last Thursday. The sound artillery thuds mortar rounds noticeably absent coils white smoke signified burning villages vanished green hills valleys. Police checkpoints relaxed areas sealed time last week Yugoslav army open patrols diplomatic monitors United States, European Union Russia. These monitors, many former military officers, reported Yugoslav army stood seen virtually military action since late last week. There sporadic shooting, monitors reported. But superficial calm good enough Serb military capacity resume fighting quickly, NATO military officer said Monday. The officer added cease-fire Kosovo pretty much enacted. He also said trend toward compliance positive. The interior ministry police must also reduce presence around villages refugees fled confidence return, military officer said. Some interior ministry police officers left province, enough, added. On question badly damaged KLA Yugoslav army's three-month offensive, NATO officer said, It's fair assessment KLA dismantled destroyed. Holbrooke's first stop Monday Brussels, met secretary-general NATO, Javier Solana. On Tuesday plans travel Pristina, capital Kosovo, scheduled meet ethnic Albanian leader Ibrahim Rugova present political proposal future status Kosovo. He expected back Belgrade Tuesday afternoon another session Milosevic. The United States Russia ratcheting pressure President Slobodan Milosevic, warning NATO airstrikes inevitable unless takes decisive action soon end humanitarian crisis southern Serbian province. Fearing airstrikes, Yugoslav generals put nation's air defense high alert, tried belated compromise moving tanks heavy equipment Kosovo. A Western diplomat said 120 Yugoslav army armored vehicles, including tanks, pulled out. In Brussels, Belgium, however, U.S. special envoy Richard Holbrooke told reporters Monday situation Kosovo bad two weeks ago. Holbrooke en route Belgrade meeting Milosevic. While level fighting (in Kosovo) may abated temporarily, capacity resumption there, Holbrooke said meeting NATO Secretary General Javier Solana Supreme Allied Commander Europe Wesley K. Clark. The situation therefore remains fully serious today week two ago, said. We hope make clear president Milosevic people Yugoslavia extreme gravity situation. On Sunday, Milosevic met Russian Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov Defense Minister Igor Sergeyev, Serbian President Milan Milutinovic Yugoslavia's top defense officials. The Russians using NATO force Kosovo. However, Ivanov Sergeyev said airstrikes could occur decisive measures immediately taken radical improvement situation, Foreign Ministry spokesman Vladimir Rakhmanin told ITAR-Tass news agency. To avoid attack, Yugoslavia must end hostilities, withdraw army security forces, take urgent measures overcome humanitarian crisis, ensure refugees return home take part peace talks, said. In Berlin, German Gen. Dieter Stoeckmann told German radio NATO action could come within days. NATO's decision may depend report U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan scheduled present Security Council Monday whether Yugoslavia meeting U.N. demands. Serb authorities appeared ready compromise installing interim government rebellious province Serbia, dominant republic Yugoslavia. Serbian police Yugoslav army routed separatist Kosovo Albanian rebels crackdown began late February. The conflict killed hundreds  Albanian civilians  left 275,000 refugees. A Yugoslav statement said nation's leaders wanted Kosovo dispute solved peacefully, case attacked, shall defend country means. The government said Friday fighting ended blamed continuing violence ethnic Albanian rebels, fighting independence Serbian province. Although United States Europeans want end fighting, also oppose independence majority Albanian province, fearing could destabilize Balkan countries Albanian populations. In Kosovo capital Pristina, KLA offered help NATO forces asked. KLA spokesman Jakup Krasniqi said statement published Monday Albanian language newspaper Bujku wish (airstrikes) would become reality shall provide assistance... asked us. Krasniqi accused ethnic Albanian politicians given independence become servants enemy, agreeing accept autonomy independence. Serbs reported two attacks Sunday civilian cars Albanian terrorists 25 miles (40 kilometers) south Pristina, Kosovo's provincial capital. Elsewhere, policeman killed stepping mine, Serb Media Center said. The Kosovo Information Center, allied ethnic Albanians, reported heavy fighting government forces guerrillas 25 miles (40 kilometers) southwest Pristina. Ethnic Albanian political leaders rejected new interim government, drawn without participation. The council composed seven Serbs, five ethnic Albanians rest Turks Muslims. Momentum outside involvement increased past week amid revelations massacres ethnic Albanian civilians forests Kosovo. London's Sunday Telegraph reported Britain preparing troops armored units Kosovo, deployed post-airstrike peacekeeping role. The defense ministry refused confirm deny report repeated Britain ready participate NATO attack. French Foreign Minister Hubert Vedrine met Sunday night British counterpart, Robin Cook, discuss situation Kosovo, France's Foreign Ministry said. Vedrine Secretary State Madeleine Albright lengthy telephone conversation well, spokesman said. On Sunday, Human Rights Watch said Milosevic's government ethnic Albanian rebels committed atrocities since conflict began, government abuses much greater scale. The report New York-based human rights organization says Milosevic primary responsibility gross government abuses. With threat NATO attack mounting, Yugoslavia's prime minister warned Monday nation faces immiment danger war claimed government taking steps comply international demands peace Kosovo. In New York, U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan said systematic terror inflicted Kosovo civilians within recent days Yugoslav forces mostly responsible. But Annan said means necessary provide independent assessment compliance required Security Council suggested 15 members may want make judgement respect. But U.S. special envoy Richard Holbrooke said situation southern Serbian province bad two weeks ago. Holbrooke spoke Brussels, Belgium en route Belgrade, planned drive home Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic extreme gravity situation. Meanwhile, Yugoslavia's prime minister told emergency session parliament Monday country faced imminent danger war. Kosovo province Serbia, main republic Yugoslavia. The threats serious, Prime Minister Momir Bulatovic said. And I call parliament conclude Yugoslavia faced imminent danger war. Yugoslavia defend attacked. One option could parliament declare state emergency  step could lead general mobilization military-aged men. In attempt head NATO action, Bulatovic said government accepted Russian proposal Organization Security Cooperation Europe investigate crisis. Yugoslavia repeatedly rejected mission Kosovo Yugoslav membership 54-nation organization restored. Bulatovic also claimed longer fighting rebellious, majority Albanian province. He said five 10 special police units removed Kosovo others returned barracks province. In Brussels, however, Holbrooke made clear half-measures would enough satisfy Washington prevent NATO attack. While level fighting may abated temporarily, capacity resumption there, Holbrooke said meeting NATO Secretary General Javier Solana Supreme Allied Commander Europe Wesley K. Clark. The situation, therefore, remains fully serious today week two ago, said. We hope make clear president Milosevic people Yugoslavia extreme gravity situation. Meanwhile, head Yugoslavia's republic, Montenegro, called Milosevic accept international demands avert NATO attack. We avert clash whole world, confrontation bound lose, Montenegro's pro-Western president, Milo Djukanovic, said statement. Djukanovic, staunch Milosevic critic, called Yugoslav president address nation unambiguous message accepted U.N. resolutions agreements made Russian President Boris Yeltsin. Djukanovic blamed Yugoslavia's problems Milosevic's undemocratic regime. Fearing airstrikes, Yugoslav generals put nation's air defense high alert moved tanks heavy equipment Kosovo. A Western diplomat said 120 Yugoslav army armored vehicles, including tanks, pulled out. Belgrade counting Russia block U.N.-sanctioned military moves Western Alliance.

Serb authorities appeared ready compromise installing interim government rebellious province Serbia, dominant republic Yugoslavia. Serbian police Yugoslav army routed separatist Kosovo Albanian rebels crackdown began late February. The conflict killed hundreds  Albanian civilians  left 275,000 refugees. Ethnic Albanians compromise 90 percent province's 2 million-strong population, favor independence substantial self-rule. Momentum outside involvement increased past week amid revelations massacres ethnic Albanian civilians forests Kosovo. Although United States Europeans want end fighting, also oppose independence Kosovo, fearing could destabilize Balkan countries Albanian populations. In Kosovo capital Pristina, KLA offered help NATO forces asked.

Krasniqi accused ethnic Albanian politicians given independence become servants enemy, agreeing accept autonomy independence. Ethnic Albanian political leaders rejected new interim government, drawn without participation. The council composed seven Serbs, five ethnic Albanians rest Turks Muslims. With NATO attacks said days away, top U.S. envoy Richard Holbrooke delivered last-minute warning Monday Yugoslavia's president halt crackdown ethnic Albanians Kosovo face airstrikes. But Slobodan Milosevic showed signs backing down. Following meeting Holbrooke, Milosevic's office issued statement denouncing NATO threats criminal act favored separatist ethnic Albanian guerrillas. The statement, broadcast government television, said fighting Serbian province past seven days crisis represented threat countries southern Balkans. Holbrooke, U.S. ambassador-designate United Nations, met Milosevic several hours late Monday arriving Brussels, Belgium, conferred senior NATO officials. Holbrooke issued statement meeting. Before boarding plane Yugoslav capital, Belgrade, however, Holbrooke said conditions southern Serbian province improved since alliance started two weeks ago finalize plans air raids force Milosevic halt offensive Kosovo Albanian separatists. Holbrooke said planned drive home Milosevic extreme gravity situation. Holbrooke negotiated peace deal Milosevic Balkan leaders ended 3 1/2 year Bosnian war 1995. In Washington, U.S. President Bill Clinton expressed concern Milosevic playing classic game making false promises avoid NATO military strikes. Clinton, telephone call Russian President Boris Yeltsin, said Milosevic's compliance U.N. demands must verifiable, tangible irreversible, press secretary Joe Lockhart said White House. What happens next depends President Milosevic, Lockhart quoted president telling Russian leader, opposed use force Moscow's longtime ally. As Holbrooke tried resolve crisis negotiations, British Foreign Secretary Robin Cook said decision NATO military action imminent. We getting ready NATO action later week expect decision taken, Cook told reporters special session Cabinet called Prime Minister Tony Blair. In Brussels, NATO officials said ready launch airstrikes within hours receiving order attack. If first airstrike failed deter Serb forces, senior NATO official said condition anonymity, alliance could unleash fully fledged air campaign involving hundreds planes. At United Nations, Secretary-General Kofi Annan said Yugoslav forces increased attacks Kosovo's ethnic Albanians even U.N. resolution demanded cease-fire. In widely anticipated report Security Council, Annan listed apparent violations Sept. 23 U.N. resolution, decried appalling atrocities Kosovo, said clear beyond reasonable doubt Yugoslav forces responsible bulk them. The U.N. chief also said rebel forces Kosovo Liberation Army also responsible human rights violations, charge KLA quickly denied. NATO countries awaiting U.N. chief's report determine whether use military force stop offensive ethnic Albanians, seeking autonomy like 1989, independence, Yugoslavia. Albanians province outnumber Serbs 9-to-1. Despite Annan's unwillingness declare Serb noncompliance, U.S. State Department spokesman James Foley said Clinton administration believed Milosevic met conditions laid U.N. Security Council. Foley cited absence formal cease-fire, failure arrange meaningful dialogue ethnic Albanian leaders continued presence major army units southeastern Kosovo near Albania's border. The European Union nations divided Monday whether launch air strikes without U.N. Security Council backing. The EU foreign ministers, meeting Luxembourg, agreed tighten economic sanctions Milosevic, unlikely stricter travel curbs Yugoslav officials freezing Yugoslav assets abroad would anything symbolic. Meanwhile, Yugoslavia's prime minister told emergency session parliament Monday country faced imminent danger war. Yugoslavia comprised dominant Serbia smaller Montenegro. The threats serious, Prime Minister Momir Bulatovic said. And I call parliament conclude Yugoslavia faced imminent danger war. Yugoslavia defend attacked. One option parliament declare state emergency  step toward mobilization military-aged men. But parliament voted introduce measure first bomb drops territory. In attempt head NATO action, Bulatovic said government accepted Russian proposal investigation 54-nation Organization Security Cooperation Europe. Yugoslavia repeatedly rejected mission Kosovo Yugoslav membership organization restored. The prime minister also said longer fighting Kosovo, 2 million residents. He said five 10 special police units removed Kosovo others returned barracks province. One diplomat Kosovo, spoke condition anonymity, said significant redeployment Yugoslav army troops Kosovo parts Serbia, including mechanized brigade pulled Sunday. Some army units remain field, enormous fear violence resume, particularly among refugees, tens thousands living hills forests without shelter. ","Yugoslavia failed to comply with a U.N. resolution demanding that the forces sent to Kosovo to suppress the ethnic Albanian separatist uprising be withdrawn and is now threatened with NATO airstrikes.Though Milosevic moved some units from the Serbian province, U.S. special envoy Holbrooke called the situation serious.Russia, previously against a NATO attack, said the strikes could occur if steps aren't taken to end the crisis.Hundreds, mostly Albanian civilians, have been killed and thousands are refugees.While the U.S. and other nations want peace, they oppose Kosovo independence, fearing it could destabilize other Albanian-populated Balkan states.","Under threat of NATO attack, Milosevic orders back most army units.US envoy says situation is as grave as it was 2 weeks ago, despite temporary abatement of fighting.US and Russia increase pressure on Milosevic to end the humanitarian crisis in Kosovo or face NATO airstrikes.US envoy tells Milosevic to pull back his military and let Albanian refugees return home.Yugoslavia claims it is taking steps to comply with peace demands.However, NATO says that UN Security Council conditions have not yet been met.US envoy gives Milosevic last minute warning to halt ethnic crackdown in Kosovo.Milosevic calls NATO threat criminal act favoring guerrillas.","Yugoslav President Slbodan Milosevic does not appear to be complying completely with UN demands to withdraw his troops and stop anti-Albanian activity in Kosovo.U.S. special envoy Richard Holbrooke said the level of fighting may have abated but the situation is such that it could resume.The U.S. and Russia have ratcheted up pressure on Milosevic warning him of inevitable NATO air strikes.Yugoslavia claimed it ""is faced with the imminent danger of war"", will defend itself if attacked and called NATO's threats a ""criminal act"".Yugoslav generals put the nation's air defense on high alert then pulled some armored equipment out of Kosovo as a compromise.","On Oct. 4, 1998 Yugoslav President Milosevic ordered his forces in Kosovo back to their barracks.While supressing the Albanian independence movement they had massacred hundreds of civilians and left 275,000+ refugees.NATO threatened airstrikes unless hostilities ceased and peace talks began.U.S. envoy Holbrooke insisted that Milosevic pull all forces out of Kosovo.Milosevic called the NATO threat ""a criminal act"" and said Holbrooke aided Albanian terrorists.Russia also urged an end to hostilities, but the Yugoslavs denied any fighting and vowed to defend their country if attacked.Neither side budged as NATO seemed to wait for a U.N. decision."
17,"A North Korean man arrived Seoul Wednesday sought asylum escaping hunger-stricken homeland, government officials said. Kim Myong Sup, 23, living hiding third country since fleeing North Korea last year, Ministry Foreign Affairs Trade said. The ministry generally uses term third country avoid naming China, required treaty North Korea return defectors homeland. The ministry described Kim former athlete, said details background method escape North Korea available. About 200 North Koreans defected South Korea past three years, including 60 far year. All complained severe food fuel shortages country. The Koreas divided communist North capitalist South 1945. They fought Korean War 1950-53 never signed formal peace treaty. Hunger malnutrition Cambodia reaching crisis levels comparable effects famine North Korea, U.N. World Food Program representative said Tuesday. Though North Korea suffering simple lack food, faltering economy Cambodia combined weak health care education causing similar levels malnutrition children, said Ken Davies, WFP's country director. There enough rice. The problem people poor access it. The problem poverty, Davies said. The WFP currently supporting 1.7 million hungry Cambodians  15 percent population  food-for-work direct assistance programs, Davies said fears still plenty getting enough eat every day. The problem bad little worse North Korea, Davies said. The situation much worse people recognize. According recent WFP survey, 49 percent Cambodian children age 5 stunted lack food 20 percent suffer acute malnutrition. By comparison, similar survey North Korean children 7 found 65 percent stunted 16 percent suffer acute malnutrition. Cambodia produced rice surplus export last two years expects another year, WFP statistics show 25 percent rice-growing areas account 75 percent surplus. The majority Cambodian farmers producing enough keep families fed increasingly saddled debts incurred run reserves harvest, Davies said. Money-lenders rural Cambodia typically charge 100 percent interest, must paid rice harvest time, giving many farmers handicapped start next crop season. Poor sanitation, lack health care ignorance modern child rearing  problems left mostly unaddressed under-funded health education sectors Cambodia  exacerbated food security problem, Davies said. Davies urged new government substantially increase annual expenditures health, education rural development first step long-term solution Cambodia's food crisis. The poverty getting worse right situation malnutrition children crisis, Davies said. Cambodia typically earmarks half annual budget defense security. In 1998 budget, education allocated 6.5 percent, health 4.4 percent rural development 0.2 percent. Actual disbursements three ministries often 60 70 percent budgeted amount annual revenues fall short expectations, according aid workers. A 1999 budget draft proposed reduction health ministry's allotment, caused outcry September health officials U.N. World Health Program. The draft later readjusted provide unprecedented 33 percent increase health spending. North Korea entering fourth winter chronic food shortages people malnourished risk dying normally curable illnesses, senior Red Cross officials said Tuesday. The officials warned international complacency hostility toward North Korea food crisis stretches isolated communist country shows little willingness adopt far-reaching changes revive ruined economy. Humanitarian suffering cannot routine part world, said Margareta Wahlstrom, Red Cross' undersecretary disaster relief, returned Beijing Tuesday week inspecting aid agency's operations North Korea. She Red Cross officials saw ravages North Korea's slow-motion famine: electricity supplied half capital, Pyongyang, time; elderly looking swollen, sign long-term hunger; generation children stunted, 10-year-olds looking like 6-year-olds 5-year-olds like 2-year-olds. Everywhere, bakeries government ministries, people served noodles cakes made soybeans mixed acorns, grass herbs, Red Cross president Astrid Heiberg said. Heiberg likened additives cattle food noted doctors reported rise stomach illnesses mixtures. This really part daily life, said. You would give children elderly mother knowing would get cramps stomach diarrhea unless stomach moaning. Three years floods drought started 1995 devastated North Korea's collective farming planned economy, already teetering loss Soviet bloc trading partners. With goods money barter buy foreign supplies, country lacks sufficient fertilizer crops, fuel parts machinery. The Red Cross inspectors saw soldiers people harvesting cabbage, winter's main vegetable. The grain harvest finished U.N. estimates little improved last year's: 3 million tons, enough meet two-thirds needs North Korea's 22 million people. As long, harsh winter begins, doctors confirm official statistics show widespread malnutrition, tuberculosis rise hunger-weakened patients unable recover operations sickness, Heiberg said. Doctors worry respiratory illnesses common winter may take toll weakened population, said. One 10-bed hospital countryside keeping three patients time food care more, said Heiberg. The Red Cross wants focus latest dlrs 9 million appeal getting essential medicines blankets warm clothes North Korea. Food aid largely turned U.N. agencies. Despite catastrophic hunger home, North Korea plans send 317 athletes officials next month's Asian Games Thailand, South Korean officials said Thursday. It largest sports delegation communist country sent abroad recent years. North Korean Sports Minister Chang Ung said 209 athletes country compete 21 events Bangkok, hoping win medals women's judo, women's soccer, wrestling, table tennis, weightlifting boxing. Chang made remarks interview published recently Chosun Shinbo, newspaper run pro-North Korean residents Japan, said Seoul's Naewoe Press, obtained report. Chang said North Korea sending large delegation Bangkok prepare 2000 Sydney Olympics. North Korea enter last Asian Games, Hiroshima, Japan, 1994. It sent 18 athletes officials Winter Olympics Nagano, Japan, February. Naewoe run South Korea's main government intelligence agency specializes monitoring communist news media. Three years floods drought started 1995 devastated North Korea's collective farming planned economy, forcing country rely outside aid feed 23 million people. Famine-threatened North Korea's harvest better year last could worse, senior U.N. aid official said Saturday. North Korea needs minimum 4.5 million 5 million tons grain feed 23 million people, managed last year harvest 2.8 million tons, Namanga Ngongi, deputy head World Food Program said. Although hard figures yet available, prospects year harvest better, Ngongi told reporters Beijing visiting North Korea. It may worse last year. Poor harvests, economic collapse three years floods drought, produced chronic food shortages North Korea left heavily reliant foreign aid. Fertilizer lacking, fuel power tractors farm machinery, meaning planting harvesting must done hand. Every year gets worse, Ngongi said. But despite need food aid, Ngongi said government month ago cut number counties WFP access 171 145, reducing number people get aid 6.7 million 5.8 million. Most receiving WFP aid children aged 6 months 6 years. Ngongi said government cited security concerns  notably lack peace treaty rival South Korea  decision. The government said ban would temporary, Ngongi added. Ngongi, spent four days inspecting WFP relief efforts North Korea, said people generally looked better visit last year. But also said could see large part population weak. Everybody consuming low level. So may severely malnourished, well nourished all, said. U.S. officials toured hardest-hit regions North Korea summer said 2 million people may died famine. Ngongi said saw malnourished children said 10 11 years old, appeared 4 5 years old. About 30 percent children one primary school visited class. A lot children weak come school, said. But Ngongi said foreign food aid saved lives. A lot people alive today thanks international community's support, said. A congressman visited remote parts North Korea last week said Saturday food health situation desperate deteriorating, millions North Koreans might starved death last years. The congressman, Tony Hall, D-Ohio, longtime interest world hunger, passed Tokyo return United States showed photographs taken North Korean children patchy hair, protruding bones, open sores signs severe malnutrition. Hall also brought back bag officials called substitute food distributed government food station: dried leaves straw, coarse even cattle would normally turn away. They grind powder make noodles, Hall said. The noodles nutrition indigestible, leaving people holding aching stomachs, said. North Korea admitted facing serious economic difficulties, sharply diverging assessments serious are. Some visitors United Nations organizations said food situation seems bit better year two ago. Hall said divergence might arisen North Korean capital, Pyongyang, life seem slightly better three previous trips North Korea. But rural areas foreigners often allowed visit, added, overall situation worse ever. Based visits four hospitals, Hall also emphasized public health care declined sharply. In one hospital, assistants holding patient surgeons conducted stomach operation without electric lights anesthesia. Ordinary North Koreans suffering, part, government's hard-line policies alienated would-be donors aid agencies. The United Nations repeatedly appealed relief aid North Korea, latest appeal raised less one-third target. In September, Doctors Without Borders announced pulling staff 13 North Korea feared aid going politically connected rather needy. North Korea release mortality figures health statistics, Hall said United Nations gathered would soon release data indicating 30 percent North Korean children age 2 acutely malnourished 67 percent children physically stunted. Hall said thought overall least 1 million people died total probably closer 3 million. In indication seriousness professional demographers view situation, U.S. Bureau Census recently published estimates suggesting North Korea's population peaked 1995 21.55 million since fallen 21.23 million year. That would decline 320,000 three years, period North Korea's population would expected grow 925,000 people, based population growth rate early 1990s. Nicholas Eberstadt, American specialist North Korean population figures, says simply enough hard information estimate death toll famine. But notes one political tidbit: North Korea's constitution stipulates one delegate country's people's assembly every 30,000 citizens. This year's assembly expand previous ones did, rather 687 delegates, previous assembly held 1990. While Eberstadt counsels caution, could mean North Korea's population, eight years expected add several million people, back 20.6 million people fewer. The United States supplying grain North Korea, strains growing secret underground complex North experts worry may heart new nuclear weapons program. The United States warned last week agreed framework basis relations North Korea jeopardy unless North lets American experts visit underground complex resolve doubts. North Korea said show complex Washington promises complex nuclear one, pay vilifying us impairing prestige. Washington refuses pay, North Korea warning standoff could lead agreement fall apart. Their shameless wicked demand open infringement upon sovereignty wanton interference internal affairs, declared North Korea's leading newspaper, Rodong Sinmun. More five years severe food shortages near-total breakdown public health system led devastating malnutrition North Korea probably left entire generation children physically mentally impaired, new study international aid groups found. The study, first scientific nutritional survey North Korea, confirms disturbing reports international aid workers, past year gained increasing access population highly isolated secretive country. Among shocking findings, researchers World Food Program, Unicef European Union found that, long-term food shortages, staggering 62 percent children 7 years old suffer stunted growth. They discovered that, despite huge international food aid program past three years, severe malnutrition widespread among toddlers crucial stages brain development, suggesting generation's physical mental abilities develop normally losses never recovered. Separately, international medical workers groups like Red Cross, begun document effects food shortages severely compounded breakdown public health services. Even basic water purification systems stand idle lack essential ingredients like chlorine, Red Cross workers say, leaving vast numbers people severe diarrhea unable absorb completely little food have. As North Korean dictatorship slowly, often grudgingly, granted increased access international aid groups last six months, increasingly clear saddening picture hunger haas emerged result large formal study informal surveys observations foreign aid agencies. Past assessments magnitude disaster country 23 million considered flawed based interviews small number North Korean refugees fled China. And researchers aid workers ground North Korea seen evidence cannibalism starving children dying roadside  descriptions surfaced lurid refugee reports  find many ways equally disturbing: A population withering nearly decade chronic hunger, people weakened malnutrition colds stomach flus quickly turn lethal, future generation irretrievably lost. Now last hard facts  situation grave, said Judith Cheng-Hopkins, regional director Asia World Food Program, taken part research. To famine slow motion. People cope year year, probably lot drop off. But totality hard gauge. For three weeks fall, crews led foreign scientists finally permitted fan across North Korea conduct first random sample nutritional survey children, providing far solid data crisis. They found 62 percent children 7 stunted growth, symptom long-term malnutrition. Thirty percent 1-year-olds suffered moderate severe malnutrition. This means high likelihood impaired mental physical development, nervous system matures dramatically essential first year. The researchers said available scientific data suggest 10 years ago, malnutrition rare North Korea. Even situation improves, unlikely improve degree country fully recover saw, said Judit Katona-Apte, senior program adviser World Food Program. People small well developed otherwise somewhat limited mental capacities. Likewise, Red Cross representatives year tested water supply 840 hospitals clinics operate, found one water suitable human consumption, said Sten Swedlund, head Red Cross delegation North Korea. But course drink  choice, said recent trip Beijing. There close relationship problems caused lack food health sector that's bad shape. Virtually children 7 malnourished also diarrhea, said. None aid groups able study issue hunger-related deaths, North Koreans released relevant figures, although experts agree probably one million perhaps many three million died prematurely since food shortages began. But public health experts say number perished might difficult tally case, deaths probably quick starvation, immune systems weakened years hunger, common colds easily give way lethal pneumonia ordinary bout infectious diarrhea proves fatal. Still, disturbing clues: In one limited study conducted World Food Program groups last year 4,000 children hand-picked government, 10 percent parent dead. In fall's independent nutritional survey, 18 teams experts sent eight North Korea's nine provinces looked 1,800 rural urban children seven. In addition finding 62 percent children stunted growth, teams found 16 percent children suffering acute malnutrition underweight height, sign severely underfed time study. That figure higher country East Asia puts North Korea among world's worst 10 countries terms malnutrition. While 16 percent figure quite bad India Bangladesh, worst world 18 percent malnutrition rate, experts say North Korea's number ways understates problem. In India Bangladesh, pockets severe poverty alternate pockets relative plenty, North Korea whole country degree underfed. Even war-torn countries, famine pockets, Dr. Katona-Apte said. It's hard think another country that's affected way. The survey results especially sobering since researchers studied children 7, group received nearly food donated abroad. After three years food donations, many foreign aid workers country remarked children nurseries kindergartens looking better  older siblings failing. So month ago, World Food Program began providing elementary schools high nutrition biscuits children aged 7 12. We reason believe many people suffering elderly neglected age group getting weaker weaker, Swedlund said. There 100 Westerners living Pyongyang, capital city, many say long-term hunger readily apparent there. If walk street Pyongyang ask child old is, usually three years, Swedlund said. She may 7 looks 3 4. Dr. Katona-Apte, nutrition expert worked Bangladesh Sudan, said shocked first visited North Korean kindergarten last year. There two children sitting desk obviously severely malnourished  thin patchy hair, said. And sitting working. This accepted normal! They school, really hospitalized placed nutritional rehabilitation. If saw refugee camp, would recommend immediate intervention. But severely depleted public health hospital system, option exist, others said. Many Korean doctors know diagnose treat malnutrition; seen decade. And, case, hospitals lack food proper nutritional supplements. Swedlund said hospitals lacked medicines, glass replace broken windows colder inside out, received coal since 1994. He said even hospitals, sanitation water purification systems virtually nonexistent, country lacks chlorine purification fuel run water pumps. He said next year, Red Cross would start address problems, spending $3.5 food hospital patients $1 million water treatment. With options, vast numbers North Koreans resorted eating substitute food, hard cakes noodles made mix nutritional plants, like soybeans sweet potatoes, combined indigestible filler, like cornstalks straw. This constitutes 40 percent food intake, Swedlund said. It's becoming regular part food basket. Doctors North Korea say many people suffer stomachaches eating partly indigestible material, said, added, If hungry, fills stomach. Although North Koreans date food problems series floods droughts mid-1990's, foreign researchers worked North Korea say medical records childhood growth patterns indicate hunger began several years linked collapse Soviet Union, long North Korea's main supplier food, fuel fertilizer. North Korea mountainous country, less 20 percent arable land. It food importer decades, mostly former Soviet Union, also China. The country come grips fact part structural problem can't blamed weather anymore, Ms. Cheng-Hopkins said. Still, others praised normally rigid secretive government slowly loosening restrictions. Swedlund said three years country, international Red Cross, collaborates North Korean Red Cross, found officials increasingly responsive doctors willing share medical records bring problems. Travel still restricted. There 100 counties, home 30 percent population, aid groups access therefore refused provide food medical supplies. Still, number counties open workers increased steadily, freedom move improved. Ms. Cheng-Hopkins said half follow-up inspections unannounced, noted researchers nutritional survey allowed select villages visit enter homes random. Workers Red Cross World Food Program said observed extreme scenes people dying acute starvation believe would occurring frequently. I seen acute starvation like I seen Bangladesh, Dr. Katona-Apte said. But mean can't exist. We're still really limited see. Swedlund said unlikely counties still closed foreigners markedly different open ones. And surmised closed counties might harbor pockets death devastation, said accepted North Korea's explanation excluded areas national security reasons. One thing I've learned important national security issues North Koreans, said Swedlund, retired admiral Swedish Navy. And I really think areas important standpoint, added, going map closed areas describing Western intelligence experts know military installations there. He also rejected notion North Korean military stealing donated food, charge leveled organization Doctors Without Borders, angrily pulled North Korea last summer protest many restrictions groups working there. Now aid groups say starting get somewhat better cooperation North Koreans, hope repeat nutrition survey every 6 12 months. And still analyzing tantalizing findings: Boys twice likely suffer stunted growth girls, every child whose mother dead malnourished. A generation North Korean children already scarred life, said Astrid Heiberg, president International Federation Red Cross Red Crescent Societies, interview Beijing trip North Korea. We need continue mobilize resources prevent even greater catastrophe. The founder South Korea's largest conglomerate plans visit native North Korea next week gift 501 cattle, company officials said Thursday. The visit delayed month dispute 500 cattle donated Chung Ju-yung, founder Hyundai group, trip North June. North Korea claimed 71 cattle died Seoul government agents force-fed indigestible vinyl strips lumps rope shipping North. Calling North's claim nonsense, Seoul's Ministry National Unification ordered Hyundai check thousands cattle raised ranch west coast. The ministry later acknowledged lumps rope found stomachs cattle ranch, said material kill animals donated North Korea. It blamed deaths stress caused long shipment truck North. The South Korean government said would authorize second shipment cattle unless North retracted accusations. On Thursday, South Korean Unification Minister Kang In-duk said North Korea sent letter Hyundai last week, saying misunderstanding southern authorities issue dead cattle cleared. Kang said North's letter cleared stumbling block Hyundai's additional cattle donation. During visit, Chung expected reach agreement details Hyundai's plan start sightseeing tours scenic mountain North. The tours, originally scheduled begin September, delayed cost, security matters. Hyundai hopes send ship 2,000 tourists week four-day tours Diamond Mountain North's east coast beginning November. Animosity distrust two Koreas run deep. The Korean states separated communist North capitalist South 1945. They fought three-year war early 1950s. Years food shortages stunted growth millions North Korean children, two-thirds children age seven suffering malnourishment, U.N. experts said Wednesday.

24,"This Newt Gingrich supposed well. The planning. The strategy. The big picture. The vision. His vision brought GOP majority Congress 1994 made first Republican House Speaker 40 years. But admission, Gingrich's vision seems blurred time around, costing Republicans net five seats Tuesday's election leaving party's narrow governing majority even narrower. The disappointing election results also left Gingrich open fractious challenge post speaker. Members aides said Wednesday fury speaker bubbled overnight members trying organize slate candidates replace Gingrich leadership team House Republicans convene Nov. 18 select leaders next year. As Rep. Mark Sanford, R-S.C., put it, When company's stock price goes down, usually CEO gets fired. Top Republican aides, speaking anonymously, even blunter. People angry last night, one aide said. Today mixture seething dismay. It's ugly. And Newt knows it. His career line. Another aide said, Most people really angry Newt, one knows it. But dipping toe water seeing temperature is. A possible slate could contain names Reps. Robert L. Livingston Louisiana replace Gingrich, Steve Largent Oklahoma replace Dick Armey Texas majority leader, Jennifer Dunn Washington replace John A. Boehner Ohio conference chairman. Rep. David M. McIntosh Indiana also said considering run speaker, clear whether would part slate. Rep. Tom DeLay Texas, majority whip, said secure. Armey bluntly acknowledged scramble going wings oust leadership. Told Nightline Republicans head, Armey replied: They're welcome they're big enough take it. Publicly, Gingrich expressed confidence keeping job speaker. But grim-faced last 24 hours closeted Wednesday top strategists making calls shore support among members. He looks like victim accident, said Rep. Peter King, R-N.Y., supports Gingrich. He's somber tone. The question, always Gingrich, many members prepared rebel leadership. In past, couple dozen members openly expressed dissatisfaction him, coup attempt last year fizzled lack support. I'm hoping people understand need serious reassessment year, said Rep. Charles T. Canady, R-Fla., said hoped challenge speaker 1996 elections, Republicans also lost seats. The reality this: Our majority keeps shrinking, Canady said. If shrinks more, gone. But Gingrich built support among moderates, perceived election repudiation conservatives. Rep. Sherwood L. Boehlert, R-Utah, said results showed right direction party. To maintain majority, we've got moderate views, Boehlert said. Thomas Mann, Congressional scholar Brookings Institution, said moderates supported Gingrich part appealing alternative emerged. They know sees broader world prepared moderate makes sense, Mann said. Newt's gone way support moderates. He's nurtured relationship them. But Mann others said anger building Gingrich several reasons, including signing budget deal last month seemed capitulate President Clinton, offering clear legislative agenda Republicans communicating clear political message. We defined hate said Rep. Mark Souder, R-Ind. But voters sophisticated that, Republicans better something say we're going. The anger grew last days speaker approved $10-million anti-Clinton advertising campaign allowed Democrats turn election referendum Gingrich, never nearly popular public Clinton been. As slowly absorbing implications loss, speaker seemed unable news conference Wednesday morning pinpoint party suffered net drop five seats House. As late Tuesday afternoon, predicting net pickup 10 30. Until look better, I frankly understand things happened yesterday, said, I'm sure anybody else country either. But said Republicans maniacally focused basic message cutting taxes, saving Social Security preventing drug abuse, campaigned aggressively themes. He contrasted lack focus year Contract With America proved successful 1994. People thought stood something pretty big, said. But Gingrich also seemed aware mounting concern leadership, repeatedly casting election results victory leadership team Republicans stayed majority three elections row first time 70 years. He also suggested would challenge little support. The people normally quoted people would fact take party narrower base, Gingrich said, referring periodic eruptions concern among conservatives leadership. I'd like see plan confident last 60 days would successful share it. An intense struggle control House underway, Rep. Bob Livingston conducting telephone campaign replace Rep. Newt Gingrich speaker Gingrich fighting counter-campaign given members pause ousting him. At time, small band Republicans vowed Thursday would vote re-elect Gingrich circumstances, move that, Republicans' shrunken House majority, could tie party knots months could throw speakership Democrat. Rep. Matt Salmon, R-Ariz., said: I personally made decision I cannot vote Newt Gingrich speaker January, six others told feel way, seven people not, takes six deadlock vote. Fury speaker boiled since Tuesday's elections, Republicans suffered net loss five seats House. They blamed Gingrich, party's chief strategist. But many already angry said failure articulate clear message party going elections messy budget process gave President Clinton political edge contradicted Republican principles fiscal conservativism containing massive amounts pork spending. House Republicans meet Nov. 18 vote secret ballot leaders. Whoever wins party's nomination speaker stands election full House January. Even Gingrich wins secret ballot, could denied re-election speaker January Salmon least five others refuse vote him. Because Republicans control House 12 seats, would take six votes Gingrich deny majority allow Democrats potentially elect one speaker. With chaotic unacceptable prospect looming, Livingston told Gingrich step aside good party, according Republican officials. The officials said Livingston spoke Gingrich shortly disastrous election returns also election, reflecting Livingston's earlier displeasure speaker budget process. Several Republicans said Livingston, chairman Appropriations Committee one members stature stand speaker, Gingrich working phones Thursday struggle votes. Livingston said nothing publicly challenge Gingrich, several members aides said Thursday would announce intentions, possibly soon Friday, determined could win. He 'til ducks row, right lot people still loyal speaker, said aide Republican who, like many others, trying straddle line fealty speaker may retain power encouragement challenger offers salve embattled party. Stunned Democratic resurgence mid-term elections, congressional Republicans tore Wednesday blame failure make traditional opposition party gains off-year election. The soul-searching recriminations  possibility congressional leadership challenges  came election results showed Republicans unable increase 55-45 hold Senate Democrats picked five seats House. The Democratic surge marked first time since 1934 president's party gained seats midterm election, whittled Republican House majority mere six votes. The Democratic victories even remarkable political year marked months-long scandal President Clinton's affair Monica Lewinsky. The Republicans' new 223-211 majority (assuming Democrat leading Oregon holds win), one independent, amounted smallest congressional majority since Republican-controlled Congress 1953, last time Republicans controlled House captured 1994. With attention shifting House Judiciary Committee impeachment inquiry, Rep. Henry Hyde told fellow Republicans panel conference call Wednesday witness Republicans likely call would independent counsel, Kenneth Starr. Hyde, chairman, told lawmakers hoped committee vote possible articles impeachment Thanksgiving, act would take issue hands put Gingrich's. Committee Democrats declined comment Wednesday could discuss Hyde's plan among themselves. Trying put best face results, Speaker Newt Gingrich said Marietta, Ga., Republicans still held onto House three elections row first time since election 1932. But furious rank file Republicans burned phone lines other, discussing whether mount leadership challenges chambers next weeks. We've got reach southern white males running Washington Republican Party, said Rep. Joe Scarborough, conservative Florida. He said Republicans year left without accomplishments run on. We need agenda first all, said. We went entire calendar year without agenda. Rep. Chris Shays, moderate Connecticut called election devastating loss said simply, There going major changes leadership. All segments party want see change. At White House, Clinton called election results vindication party's policies. If look results, said, clear unambiguous. The American people want business, concerns, children, families, future addressed here. That's messag e election was. One first difficult questions facing Congress proceed impeachment inquiry face public resistance removing Clinton office, Republican majority slim almost certain 218 votes required impeachment cannot assembled. In public statement released Wednesday, Hyde said The Committee continues clear constituional duty complete work fair expeditious manner. Our duty changed becasue constitution changed. But Sen. Robert Torricelli, D-N.J., said election results guaranteed impeachment fail. I think serious effort remove President Clinton office effectively over, said. It simply Newt Gingrich Trent Lott decide exit strategy. From side aisle, Rep. Rick Lazio, Long Island Republican, said, The inquiry wrapped expeditiously, fairly ought resolved immediate future. For past year, Republicans struggled keep control House 228-207 majority find consensus among party's competing factions. With numbers reduced, Republican leadership need carry tortuous balancing act unite hard-core conservative faction wants aggressive social agenda bloc moderates want party return center. Any small Republican faction enormous leverage. The new arithmetic House may even lead Democrats' moderate Republicans' forming ad hoc majorities issues, taking control away Republican leaders. Already seeing possibilities, Rep. Peter King Long Island, N.Y., said northeastern Republicans would strengthened. It gives us much leverage leadership makes easier protect New York, said. It's going weaken position strident conservatives anti-northeast conservatives. Just two weeks ago, Gingrich foreseen election gains ranging 10 seats 40. Seeming uncharacteristically uncertain Wednesday, said trouble accounting results. Things happening none us fully understand--neither party judgment, said. Taking share blame party's losses, Georgia Republican said misjudged public would recoil Clinton scandal amplified modern media world scandal would drown Republican themes. I mean I totally underestimated degree people would get sick 24-hour-a day talk television talk radio degree whole scandal became sort disgusting sheer repetition, said. And result I think probably underestimated need really aggressively push much stronger message cutting taxes saving Social Security, winning war drugs, reforming education national defense. Majority Leader Sen. Trent Lott Mississippi also admitted mistakes, saying party presented clear enough message final 96 hours campaign. He also conceded Congress' final scramble pass $500 billion budget bill hurt party. One lessons Republicans need listen carefully people need clear understanding concise message apply across nation, said Washington. Both Lott Gingrich said Republicans would put emphasis next year tax-cutting shoring Social Security system. Even two leaders spoke, angry rank-and-file lawmakers making phone calls trying assess whether mount challenges Republican leaders steered Congress since Republican's assumed control four years ago. One senior Republican staffer said House become tinderbox intrigue. Scarborough said, The long distance charges Washington offices probably going roof today. Everybody's calling everybody. Everybody recognizes something's terribly wrong direction Washington Republicans Republican governors well New York, Massachusetts, Florida Texas. And Gingrich gone way identify Republican campaign's last-minute ad blitz attacking President Clinton, caucus knows responsible. Gingrich faced uprising before, foiling coup attempt disgruntled conservatives leadership team summer 1997. Any move remove remains long-shot. But House leadership elections set mid-November, Republicans said time dissatisfaction caucus crossed ideological lines moderates like Shays well. We got shellacked, said Rep.

Some envisioning trying run entire new ticket headed Rep. Bob Livingston, Appropriations Committee chairman Louisiana including Rep. Steve Largent, Oklahoma conservative. Asked whether Tuesday's election results could cost speakership, Gingrich said, I'm particularly concerned. Republicans close said expected anger dissipate. In Senate, leadership races take place early December, Republicans talking mounting challenges mid-level leadership figures. Several senators expressed particular pique toward re-election chairman, Senator Mitch McConnell Kentucky, poured party dollars much time trying defeat Democratic champion campaign finance overhaul, Russell Feingold Wisconsin. Feingold close race. Some lawmakers Wednesday approached Sen. Chuck Hagel Nebraska see would replace McConnell. Hagel confirmed talked eight senators, considering whether challenge McConnell.

A week White House congressional Democrats disavowed war Speaker Newt Gingrich, James Carville, President Clinton's former campaign strategist chief outside defender, put forth new battle cry Wednesday: He muzzled. Not that, Carville went beyond customary denunciations Gingrich Republicans and, interview, trained fire leaders party sufficiently aggressive four weeks Election Day. My sense frustration I believe Democrats much better chance much better anyone expects, Carville said. And I think anyone's emerging try pull together. Everybody ought pushing, leadership Congress, White House, DNC. We ought hammer Gingrich every day. How take Congress back make case people running it? I never heard strategy like that. Sounding increasingly agitated, went on: The people left activated election Democrats. The right wing, they're bouncing walls. They're going vote. Rep. Dick Gephardt, minority leader, complained Erskine Bowles, White House chief staff, Carville appeared NBC News program Meet Press Sept. 27 declared, Cpl. Cue Ball Carville rolling battle Newt Gingrich. The concern among House Democrats, one expressed White House officials well, Carville's vitriol would make Democrats appear overly partisan could especially damaging Democrats marginal districts want appear easy president. But Wednesday, Carville anything timid. If Gephardt people think they've quieted down, said, I'm quieted. Carville said told officials White House, Don't waste breath calling telling say this. Carville insisted would rather battle Republicans fellow Democrats. If want fight me, can, said. I'm going fight Republicans. Yet could help ridicule party. Asked describe Democrats' strategy election, Carville said, If one, one's shared me. Just four years ago, good bet Newt Gingrich would pivotal figure U.S. politics turn millennium. Seemingly overnight taken moribund minority party turned pumped-up, issue-driven House majority. With promise balance budget, end welfare represent conservative social values, appeared rearranged political map Congress Ronald Reagan done presidency. But Gingrich's leadership shaky even maintains hold speaker's office, danger marginalization. A change dramatic suggests something far profound miscalculation election tactics. What looked like one major realignments U.S. political history might turn nothing temporary shift. The Gingrich revolution fueled anger, revolt white working-class Americans perceived Democratic bias favor blacks minorities, middle-class rejection politics big government big deficits. They resentments Ronald Reagan exploited successfully. But old political habits moribund Republican leadership allowed Democrats retain control Congress throughout 1980s, turned Reagan's economic program undisciplined tax-cutting spree created prosperity along huge budget gaps. Gingrich's attention-grabbing rhetoric, energy talent political organization finally took Reagan's formula success congressional elections 1994. But power, ran head Bill Clinton, whose political instincts even better. The president co-opted parts Contract With America, particularly balanced budget welfare reform. He adapted Republican social message call things like school uniforms television rating systems, symbolized responsibility parental control without supporting government intrusion private lives. The Republican right's genuine contempt Clinton based part well-known flaws president's character. But mainly reaction ease diverted supposed flood tide revolution. They expected genuine successes Gingrich's first year office would lead still larger victories minimal government taxes, unfettered free enterprise return conservative Christian values. But public happy led another direction, focus concerns aging baby boomers health care Social Security. The government seen enemy issues budgetary looked like potential ally. Back 1994, parties stunned sudden change congressional fortunes may overestimated meant. In particular may realized quickly good economic times, drop crime national welfare reform could blunt power race U.S. politics. The Democrats become literally minority party white voters resentfully identified policies cities, blacks immigrants. But last week union workers Catholics returned Democratic fold. Without race wedge issue, solid black Democratic vote became powerful advantage key states. Blacks, women Latinos angry Republican anti-immigration initiatives winning coalition California, North Carolina New York. The speaker right say election expected. There may indeed Republican majority America, appears resemble Republicanism Dwight Eisenhower rather Newt Gingrich  pro-business, wary debt inherent distaste bringing messy social issues like abortion. The Republicans begun talking compassionate conservatism politics inclusion may peddling political mush, peddled victory Tuesday. The congressional Republican Party's long sojourn wilderness House minority may left accustomed opposition figure for, attached politics anger make sense nation mood moderation. Gingrich suggested mistake let Republicans drift along politics impeachment almost maniacally focused things like tax cuts. But looking maniacal got trouble first place. Winning control Congress many years tough Gingrich 1994. But ten times tougher forge politics depend rage. House Speaker Newt Gingrich, orchestrated Republican revolution recent years overseeing impeachment inquiry President Clinton, driven office Friday party swiftly turned unexpected losses Tuesday's midterm elections. Catching virtually everyone Capitol Hill surprise, Gingrich announced Friday night two conference calls Republicans would seek re-election Speaker Nov. 18 vote would leave Congress altogether term expires January. This give us chance purge poison system, Gingrich said, according party aide listened one calls. Gingrich's resignation stunning reversal one combative personally confrontational politicians America. He made name decade ago bringing one Democratic speaker, Jim Wright, continued assaultive style Tuesday's elections last-minute commercials reminding voters Clinton scandal. His reflexive pugilistic response evident even Friday night. In second conference call, according several people listened, Gingrich blamed House conservatives downfall. Although revolutionary zeal harnessed take control Congress 1994, become bitter critics last two years tumultuous speakership. Friday night called cannibals blackmailed quitting. Rep. Michael P. Forbes, R-N.Y., said: Newt said marginalized Republican Party engaged cannibalism. He said, `Refer clips.' He's blaming others. Another Republican described conference call way: He started statesmanlike, could see anger building. When someone asked leaving, said, `A handful members blackmailed conference.' He said, `They're hateful.' And said, `They're cannibals.' Gingrich announced move hours Rep. Robert L. Livingston Louisiana announced running speaker, putting forward pragmatist manager. After Gingrich calls, Rep. Bill Archer Texas announced considering run speaker. Livingston Archer chairmen two powerful committees House. In statement Gingrich said, The Republican conference needs unified, time move forward. He said hoped colleagues would pick successor reconcile discipline, work together communicate effectively. Referring wife, told colleagues resigning Congress Marianne I tired. We need time get know again. He also acknowledged knack bringing negative attention party. If I stay, told colleagues Friday night, controversial nature would overshadow successes might have, understatement recalled suggestion two years ago forced shutdown government miffed sit back Air Force One trip President Clinton. According another Republican took notes, Gingrich said resignation: There lot bitterness amongst members. So long I around, I always target news media, would mean would never able get message out. Clinton said: Newt Gingrich worthy adversary leading Republican Party majority House joining great national debate best prepare America 21st century. Despite profound differences, I appreciate times able work together national interest, especially Speaker Gingrich's strong support America's continuing leadership freedom, peace prosperity world. Many Republicans took opportunity portray Gingrich visionary. Rep. Sherwood Boehlert New York said first conference call, shock surprise strong expressions appreciation leading us Promised Land. His supporters said Gingrich votes win election nominate speaker, conducted secret ballot. But, agreed, party's slim, six-vote majority meant every vote would battle. Kenneth Duberstein, former official Reagan administration, said, I doubt votes speaker, I'm sure votes govern. He said deep rifts party, Gingrich would able implement plans. In unusually biting reaction, Rep. Dick Gephardt Missouri, Democratic leader, said hoped Gingrich's resignation would clear fierce partisan air fostered. I hope whoever succeeds Newt Gingrich speaker immediately begin process repairing damage wrought institution last four years, Gephardt said. House Republicans predicted Gingrich's resignation would set wide-ranging hectic scramble replace anticipated. There lot pretenders throne test waters, said Boehlert, supported Gingrich re-election speaker. There shortage candidates. The presidential campaign 2000 began Wednesday, like not. The millennial election fought political playing field whose rough outlines, exact boundaries, drawn voters Tuesday's elections, delivered crushing disappointment giddy hopes Republicans unexpected elixir recently ailing Democrats. President Clinton called astonishing triumph issues investigations said Democrats many major victories clear message. Republicans agreed. Of course next 18 months bring many surprises many reversals fortune. But election results offered important guidelines. Tuesday great day Vice President Al Gore, least three reasons. He worked furiously successfully last ten days balloting persuade Democratic loyalists stay home sulk, appearing behalf fewer 224 candidates, according office. A moderate within spectrum party, watched moderates win crucial elections, notably California gubernatorial race, Lt. Gov. Gray Davis, cautious pragmatist like Gore, smashing victory. The returns  even break Senate Democratic gain five House Representatives  also made impeachment President Clinton less likely. And better shape Clinton term ends, better chance Gore, sidekick six years now, stands presidential nomination process and, ultimately, election. But California voters also complicated nominating process set Gore strategists work tactics uncomplicate it, consider state absolutely central presidential aspirations. In referendum 1996, California adopted primary system Republicans, Democrats independent voters would receive ballot, candidates parties listed. That violates rules major parties, measure ballot Tuesday, Proposition 3, would rescinded 1996 change. But failed, raising possibility California's March 7 primary mere political popularity poll, convention delegates chosen caucus convention  nightmare. Tuesday bad day Republican right. High-profile right-wingers lost across country, Attorney General Dan Lungren California governor's race Sen. Lauch Faircloth, denied re-election North Carolina, Rep. Mark Neumann Wisconsin, failed Senate race despite huge spending advantage Sen. Russell Feingold, Ellen Sauerbrey Maryland, proved unable second try prevail unpopular Democratic governor, Parris Glendening. Both conservatives moderates party said Republicans get back basics. Even Speaker Newt Gingrich conceded results sober every Republican called new strategic thinking. If make referendum president 67 per cent approval rating, tried do, surprised election goes you, said Gov. Tom Ridge Pennsylvania, moderate whose promoters mention weekly possible vice-presidential nominee. Sen. John McCain Arizona, conservative tends steer away divisive social issues, re-election 68 per cent vote. He studying possibility presidential race, Republican nominee hope win, said interview Wednesday, congressional Republicans leaders need learn lessons. I hope debacle wake-up call people, said. You've got something  smaller government, better education, something. We're seen party that's everything. Polls taken late year's campaign bore McCain out. They showed Republicans longer identified issues electoral bread butter, low taxes law order. Tuesday also fresh demonstration, anyone needed one, political utility pitching tent big enough almost everyone. Black politicians North Carolina, Maryland California reported fears indifferent black turnout proved groundless. Black votes proved indispensable considerable number hard-pressed Democratic candidates, especially felt interests directly threatened. The figures Hispanic voting, assembled exit polls candidates' precinct analyses, showed dramatic differences. In California, outgoing Republican governor, Pete Wilson, played anti-immigration card vengeance, major Democratic candidates  Davis Sen. Barbara Boxer, re-election trailing early polls  cleaned among Hispanic voters. He took 78 percent, 72. But Bush brothers, Jeb Florida George W. Texas, took half Hispanic vote highly successful gubernatorial campaigns. So McCain. Jeb Bush married Hispanic woman, brother speak Spanish fluently frequently, Senator McCain long espoused Hispanic causes. Both George W. Bush McCain draw strength, decide run, proven ability appeal Hispanic voters, well general electoral strength. George W. Bush took 69 percent vote Texas, Democrat sat governor's chair four years ago, second-largest bloc electoral votes. Florida fourth-largest. Governor Bush Texas uttered rallying cry moderates. A leader compassionate conservative, said victory speech, erase gender gap open Republican party new faces new voices. But figures right saw things differently. James Dobson, leading religious broadcaster, said Republicans fared poorly Gingrich Sen. Trent Lott Mississippi, majority leader, caved president budget de-emphasized social issues abortion flag desecration. He called explicitly ouster Gingrich. Likewise, millionaire publisher Steve Forbes, another probable candidate 2000, said leadership lot answer for. Tuesday proved potency education issue, suggested emerge major theme 2000 campaign. Clinton, limited involvement campaign, Gore, extensive participation, stressed Democratic programs build schools hire teachers. Almost quarter California voters  almost twice many voters California state  named education pressing concern. Elsewhere, Democrats governorships Alabama South Carolina odds, partly emphasizing rivals' opposition lotteries help pay schools. In Iowa, Democrat elected governor first time since 1969 platform featured dilapidated condition state's schools promise remedy it. Tuesday demonstrated overriding importance money modern American politics. Feingold, one principal backers campaign-finance reform, survived fight another day, opponents reform. And returns House races, showing six 401 members sought re-election won, underlined hard is, present system, challenger raise enough money compete effectively. The difficulties raising money may doom many would-be presidential candidacies. Gore needs, Bush, Forbes former Gov. Lamar Alexander Tennessee. But many others will? Finally, Tuesday delivered indecisive message impeachment. Close two-thirds voters nationwide told exit pollsters intended send message Clinton, made clear response questions disliked House inquiry president's alleged misdeeds wanted see end. In two states, Kansas Nebraska, majority voters say favored even congressional censure Clinton, much milder form punishment advocated many Clinton backers. Some Republicans said privately hearings Clinton matter, Democrats began talking deal, equivalent plea bargain would bring matter early close. Nevertheless, Republican members House Judiciary Committee said needed press ahead Constitutional process House set motion. Among taking view Rep. Bob Barr Georgia, fierce foe president, Rep. Mary Bono California, whose tone muted. But Rep. David Dreier California, incoming Rules Committee chairman, said election played role ensuring one us desire drag out. Stunned Democratic resurgence mid-term elections, congressional Republicans tore Wednesday blame failure make traditional opposition party gains off-year election. The soul-searching recriminations  possibility congressional leadership challenges  came election results showed Republicans unable increase 55-45 hold Senate Democrats picked five seats House. The Democratic surge marked first time since 1934 president's party gained seats midterm election, whittled Republican House majority mere six votes. The Democratic victories even remarkable political year marked months-long scandal President Clinton's affair Monica Lewinsky. The Republicans' new 223-211 majority (assuming Democrat leading Oregon holds win), one independent, amounted smallest congressional majority since Republican-controlled Congress 1953, last time Republicans controlled House captured 1994. With attention shifting House Judiciary Committee impeachment inquiry, Rep. Henry Hyde told fellow Republicans panel conference call Wednesday witness Republicans likely call would independent counsel, Kenneth Starr. Hyde, chairman, told lawmakers hoped committee vote possible articles impeachment Thanksgiving, act would take issue hands put Gingrich's. Committee Democrats declined comment Wednesday could discuss Hyde's plan among themselves. Trying put best face results, Speaker Newt Gingrich said Marietta, Ga., Republicans still held onto House three elections row first time since election 1932. But furious rank file Republicans burned phone lines other, discussing whether mount leadership challenges chambers next weeks. We've got reach southern white males running Washington Republican Party, said Rep. Joe Scarborough, conservative Florida. He said Republicans year left without accomplishments run on. We need agenda first all, said. We went entire calendar year without agenda. Rep. Chris Shays, moderate Connecticut called election devastating loss said simply, There going major changes leadership. All segments party want see change. At White House, Clinton called election results vindication party's policies. If look results, said, clear unambiguous. The American people want business, concerns, children, families, future addressed here. That's message election was. One first difficult questions facing Congress proceed impeachment inquiry face public resistance removing Clinton office, Republican majority slim almost certain 218 votes required impeachment cannot assembled. In public statement released Wednesday, Hyde said The Committee continues clear constitutional duty complete work fair expeditious manner. Our duty changed constitution changed. But Sen. Robert Torricelli, D-N.J., said election results guaranteed impeachment fail. I think serious effort remove President Clinton office effectively over, said. It simply Newt Gingrich Trent Lott decide exit strategy. From side aisle, Rep. Rick Lazio, Long Island Republican, said, The inquiry wrapped expeditiously, fairly ought resolved immediate future. For past year, Republicans struggled keep control House 228 seats find consensus among party's competing factions. With numbers reduced, Republican leadership need carry tortuous balancing act unite hard-core conservative faction wants aggressive social agenda bloc moderates want party return center. The Democrats held 206 seats, one held indepenndent. Any small Republican faction enormous leverage. The new arithmetic House may even lead Democrats' moderate Republicans' forming ad hoc majorities issues, taking control away Republican leaders. Already seeing possibilities, Rep. Peter King Long Island, N.Y., said northeastern Republicans would strengthened. It gives us much leverage leadership makes easier protect New York, said. It's going weaken position strident conservatives anti-northeast conservatives. Just two weeks ago, Gingrich foreseen election gains ranging 10 seats 40. Seeming uncharacteristically uncertain Wednesday, said trouble accounting results. Things happening none us fully understand--neither party judgment, said. Taking share blame party's losses, Georgia Republican said misjudged public would recoil Clinton scandal amplified modern media world scandal would drown Republican themes. I mean I totally underestimated degree people would get sick 24-hour-a day talk television talk radio degree whole scandal became sort disgusting sheer repetition, said. And result I think probably underestimated need really aggressively push much stronger message cutting taxes saving Social Security, winning war drugs, reforming education national defense. Majority Leader Sen. Trent Lott Mississippi also admitted mistakes, saying party presented clear enough message final 96 hours campaign. He also conceded Congress' final scramble pass $500 billion budget bill hurt party. One lessons Republicans need listen carefully people need clear understanding concise message apply across nation, said Washington. Both Lott Gingrich said Republicans would put emphasis next year tax-cutting shoring Social Security system. Even two leaders spoke, angry rank-and-file lawmakers making phone calls trying assess whether mount challenges Republican leaders steered Congress since Republican's assumed control four years ago. One senior Republican staffer said House become tinderbox intrigue. Scarborough said, The long distance charges Washington offices probably going roof today. Everybody's calling everybody. Everybody recognizes something's terribly wrong direction Washington Republicans Republican governors well New York, Massachusetts, Florida Texas. And Gingrich gone way identify Republican campaign's last-minute ad blitz attacking President Clinton, caucus knows responsible. Gingrich faced uprising before, foiling coup attempt disgruntled conservatives leadership team summer 1997. Any move remove remains long-shot. But House leadership elections set mid-November, Republicans said time dissatisfaction caucus crossed ideological lines moderates like Shays well. We got shellacked, said Rep. Christopher Cannon, conservative Utah. We beat agenda. Republicans discussing possible challenges Gingrich, second-in-command, Rep. Dick Armey, members senior leadership team. Some envisioning trying run entire new ticket headed Rep. Bob Livingston, Appropriations Committee chairman Louisiana including Rep. Steve Largent, Oklahoma conservative. Asked whether Tuesday's election results could cost speakership, Gingrich said, I'm particularly concerned. Republicans close said expected anger dissipate. In Senate, leadership races take place early December, Republicans talking mounting challenges mid-level leadership figures. Several senators expressed particular pique toward re-election chairman, Senator Mitch McConnell Kentucky, poured party dollars much time trying defeat Democratic champion campaign finance overhaul, Russell Feingold Wisconsin. Feingold close race. Some lawmakers Wednesday approached Sen. Chuck Hagel Nebraska see would replace McConnell. Hagel confirmed talked eight senators, considering whether challenge McConnell. Hagel lambasted Republican leadership election outcome. This big loss us, said. We squandered historic opportunity last night. To break even loss. Most incumbents coasted victory Tuesday night. But returning. Five House Republicans defeated: Vince Snowbarger Kansas, Bill Redmond New Mexico, Jon Fox Pennsylvania, Mike Pappas New Jersey, Rick White Washington. One Democrat also lost re-election bid  Rep. Jay Johnson Wisconsin. The new House members include 17 Republicans least 22 Democrats. David Wu, Democrat leading Molly Bordonaro, Republican race one House seat Oregon, final victory announcement expected Friday absentee ballots counted. Unlike self-proclaimed revolutionaries Republican class 1994, many newly elected members career politicians rose ranks local state government. Three Democrats sons former lawmakers, Mark Udall Colorado, son Morris Udall represented Arizona; Tom Udall New Mexico, son Udall brother, Stewart, former congressman secretary Interior, Charlie Gonzalez, Texas seat father, Henry. A struggle control House way, Rep. Robert Livingston conducting telephone campaign could lead running Newt Gingrich speaker. But Gingrich's counter-campaign given members pause ousting him. At time, small band Republicans vowed Thursday would vote re-elect Gingrich circumstances, move that, Republicans' shrunken House majority, could tie party knots months. Rep. Matt Salmon, R-Ariz., said: I personally made decision I cannot vote Newt Gingrich speaker January, six others told feel way, seven people not, takes six deadlock vote. Fury speaker boiled since Tuesday's elections, Republicans suffered net loss five seats House. They blamed Gingrich, party's chief strategist. But many already angry said failure articulate clear message party going elections messy budget process gave President Clinton political edge contradicted Republican principles fiscal conservativism containing massive amounts spending local projects. House Republicans meet Nov. 18 vote secret ballot leaders. Whoever wins Republican nomination speaker must stand election full House January. Even Gingrich wins secret ballot, could denied re-election speaker January Salmon least five others refuse vote him. Because Republicans control House 12 seats, would take six votes Gingrich deny majority. With chaotic unacceptable prospect looming, Livingston told Gingrich step aside good party, Republican officials said. The officials said Livingston spoke Gingrich shortly election returns also election, reflecting Livingston's earlier displeasure speaker budget process. Several Republicans said Livingston, chairman Appropriations Committee one members stature stand speaker, Gingrich working phones Thursday struggle votes. Livingston said nothing publicly challenge Gingrich, several members aides said Thursday would announce intentions, possibly soon Friday, determined could win. Rep. Peter King, R-N.Y., one several members spoke Livingston Thursday. He told he's making number phone calls, he's gotten positive response running speaker, he'll decide within next 48 hours, King said. He till ducks row, right lot people still loyal speaker, said aide Republican who, like many others, trying straddle line fealty speaker may retain power encouragement challenger offers salve embattled party. Many Republicans immediately blamed Gingrich party's losses Tuesday. Talk quickly emerged next day slate candidates oppose Gingrich lieutenants. The list possible candidates leadership positions included Rep.e Steve Largent Oklahoma, talked Livingston Thursday challenging Gingrich, Republican officials said, speaking condition names reported. Those officials said Largent told Livingston wanted run ticket would challenge Rep. Dick Armey, majority leader. But, officials said Livingston challenge Gingrich, Largent would run speaker instead. Other names floated Wednesday leadership posts. They included Reps. David McIntosh Indiana speaker Jennifer Dunn Washington conference chairman. Added mix Thursday name Rep. Christopher Cox, California conservative. As sign uncertainty prevailing among House members Thursday, Rep. Henry Hyde, chairman Judiciary Committee one House's venerable members, rebuffed chance endorse Gingrich speaker. Hyde said Gingrich bore responsibility party's losses Tuesday. Leadership takes credit things go right, said. They ought take blame things go wrong. Asked Gingrich remain speaker, Hyde said: I rather think will, remains seen. The energy many vented publicly Wednesday anger toward Gingrich seemed devoted Thursday intense internal political calculations whether Livingston could succeed toppling Gingrich whether succeed. While many support veteran understands House shown shrewd political skills managing massive federal budget, others reviving images Louisianan hot-head gave party bad name government shutdown two years ago tends toward arm-flailing heated moments. One conservative leader said allies reservations Livingston obsessed trying keep social issues budget process. The budget, said, vehicle conservatives years add restrictions federal money abortion things can't get Senate past presidential veto. If Livingston challenger, I doubt cause rallying real conservatives Congress. Some moderates said prepared support him. Rep. Marge Roukema, R-N.J., said, I would amenable Livingston. Still, cautioned, I'm Newt. But wrong sit seriously look options. Ken Johnson, aide Rep. W.J. (Billy) Tauzin, R-La., said boss emblematic confusion among broad base House Republicans. Billy loyal Speaker Gingrich Dick Armey, he's still loyal them, also wants hear say committing next election, Johnson said. Everyone asking question: Can refocus message re-energize base without re-aligning leadership? Salmon said refusal support Gingrich matter based Gingrich's track record one failed strategy another, including impeachment process pork-laden budget. With challenge way, Gingrich trying show members responsive concerns. After election night portrayed Republicans victorious even lost seats, next day took responsibility losses. In another move, Gingrich indicated willing cede control party's congressional campaign committee, allowing whole House select members. Gingrich also making strong personal appeals Republicans. Said one top House aide: He'll get support. How much? Only vote-counters know. ","Speaker of the House Newt Gingrich has announced that he will not seek re-election to the post when the vote comes up on November 18th.He also announced that he would be leaving the House when his current term as Speaker expires in January.This announcement comes on the heels of a poor Republican showing in the mid-term elections.Although the Republicans retained a majority in the House, the Margin of Republican control shrank in the face of Democratic gains.Gingrich had been seen as the man who led the Republicans our of the doldrums into control of the House and the Senate.","Most Democrats, except for former Clinton strategist James Carville, were hesitant to attack Speaker Newt Gingrich as the 1998 elections approached.Republicans were expected to add to their majority in Congress.However, Republicans lost seats in both the House and Senate.Republicans became disenchanted with the Gingrich ""vision"" and blamed him for the losses.An active campaign began to replace Gingrich as Speaker with Louisiana Congressman Robert Livingston as the main actor.After a losing struggle to maintain his position, Gingrich resigned as Speaker.House Republicans then turned their attention to impeachment proceedings of President Clinton.","The 1998 election ended the political career of Newt Gingrich, who had become Speaker in 1994, leading a conservative, issue-driven, GOP majority.In Oct Democrats were urged to go after him.Although both houses retained a narrowed GOP majority, Newt, with his combativeness and Impeachment-fixation, was blamed for the failures by both wings of his party.The 1998 winners were Gore, Clinton, and moderates.Newt's issues seemed dead in the booming economy and old Democratic loyalists ignored Clinton's morals and returned to the fold.As fellow Republicans jockeyed for his positions, Newt resigned as Speaker on Nov 6 and also decided to leave his House seat.","James Carville complained that fellow Democrats didn't join his war against Speaker Newt Gingrich leading up to the congressional elections of 1998.Gingrich had led the impeachment inquiry against President Clinton in the House.When, contrary to all predictions, the Democrats gained five seats in the House and held their own in the Senate, Republicans enlisted in Carville's cause, blaming Gingrich for the election results.Gingrich battled fiercely as Rep. Livingston rallied forces against him, but ultimately Gingrich accepted defeat agreeing to cede the speakership and his seat in the House.He blamed his defeat on blackmail by Republican cannibals."
26,"America Online verge agreeing purchase Netscape Communications Corp., Internet pioneer center government's antitrust suit Microsoft Corp., executives involved talks said Sunday. The proposed deal complex, three-way transaction involving AOL, Netscape Sun Microsystems Inc. AOL, leading on-line service 14 million subscribers, would acquire Netscape's popular site World Wide Web software business. AOL would also enter joint marketing development partnership Sun Microsystems strengthen Netscape's business selling large corporations heavy-duty software needed serve Web pages Internet technologies many thousands users time. The purchase, exchange AOL shares Netscape stock, valued roughly $4 billion. A completed deal could announced soon Monday morning. But executives involved talks cautioned Sunday night details remained negotiated. The Netscape deal, consummated, would realign three businesses forefront modern economy  on-line services, Internet software electronic commerce. It would strengthen two Microsoft's leading rivals, AOL Sun Microsystems. At time, however, would end independent existence Netscape, Internet software maker regarded serious challenger Microsoft's dominance personal computer software market. Netscape, founded 1994, struggled last 18 months assault Microsoft. Its Navigator runaway leader market browser software used navigate World Wide Web. But Microsoft, responding Internet revolution, entered market aggressively, quickly matching quality Netscape's technology bundling Microsoft browser, Internet Explorer, industry-standard Windows operating system giving away free. Eventually, Microsoft's browser technology caught Netscape's. Earlier year, Netscape announced layoffs started distributing Navigator free well, Microsoft steadily gained browser market. Since then, Netscape focused mainly two businesses  advertising transaction fees Netcenter Web site selling industrial-strength software corporations building Internet sites conduct electronic commerce. AOL believes expertise increase revenues Netscape's Web site and, helped Sun's programmers vast corporate sales force, accelerate Netscape's software sales well, executives involved negotiations said. Among large corporations, Sun's version Unix, Solaris, among popular operating systems powerful computers run Netscape's server software. The much smaller Netscape would placed wing AOL Sun Microsystems. The three companies combined revenues $12.4 billion last year. Microsoft, comparison, revenues $14 billion. This deal would insure fundamental elements Netscape survive within bigger companies drive technologies forward, said David B. Yoffie, professor Harvard business school co-author Michael A. Cusumano Massachusetts Institute Technology recent book, Competing Internet Time: Lessons Netscape Its Battle Microsoft. The impact deal, any, government's antitrust suit Microsoft uncertain. It appear support key theme Microsoft's defense  namely, operates fast-moving industry corporate alliances shift time. Thus, Microsoft argues, antitrust policy tread gently. But deal, government officials insist, direct effect current case. No matter much alliances shift, affect central fact Microsoft's monopoly used abused market power protect monopoly, said David Boies, Justice Department's lead trial lawyer Microsoft case. Executives representing Netscape, AOL Sun Microsystems government witnesses Microsoft trial. And serious merger talks Netscape Chief Executive Officer James Barksdale AOL Chairman Steve Case began month ago, start Microsoft trial, according people close talks. Industry analysts suggest companies may emboldened take stronger anti-Microsoft steps based partly perception antitrust case would weaken Microsoft. And representatives Kleiner Perkins Caufield &AMP; Byers, Silicon Valley venture capital firm regarded power broker among Microsoft's rivals, sit boards Netscape, Sun AOL. Still, executives involved talks said timing proposed deal unrelated antitrust trial. Nor it, one person noted, regarded single-minded attempt circle wagons Microsoft. Indeed, AOL, according one person close talks, plans keep Microsoft's Internet Explorer browser default choice on-line service. One government's allegations antitrust suit Microsoft Netscape main browser AOL Microsoft used Windows monopoly bargaining chip. To win browser deal, Microsoft offered AOL prime real estate Windows desktop, main screen 90 percent personal computers sold today. Staying Microsoft's browser seen proof AOL still regards placement Windows desktop crucial, well careful step avoid undermining one allegations government's case. For AOL, Netscape purchase would accelerate evolution toward Internet. At present, flagship on-line service hybrid  proprietary service, added gateway World Wide Web. In addition, consumers subscribe AOL's dial-up service, also Web site, aol.com, attracts 24 million visitors month, according Media Metrix/Relevant Knowledge, market research firm. Its big Web site offers wide range information, entertainment, Internet chat e-mail, leading example all-in-one sites become known portals. Netscape's Netcenter traffic slipped bit recent months, 16 million visitors month, it, too, major portal. Together, huge player intensifying portal battle viewers resulting advertising revenues. Yahoo current leader among portal sites 25 million monthly visitors, Microsoft's site attracts 20 million month. Though known new-media company consumers, AOL also interested boosting electronic commerce business Netscape purchase. AOL recently done work Eastman Kodak, American Greetings companies, promoting products on-line subscribers also building Internet infrastructure software conduct electronic commerce. AOL notes projections like recent one Forrester Research Inc., predicted worldwide Internet commerce could reach high $3.2 trillion 2003, 5 percent global sales. Sun Microsystems, analysts say, could strong partner AOL market Internet commerce software. Sun corporate software company sales force several thousand. As moves increasingly Internet technology, AOL prove excellent partner Sun terms developing using Sun's Java, Internet programming language. And Netscape's browser longer generates revenue own, distribution channel Java technology. Having Netscape's browser safely hands friendly company strategic importance Sun, since Microsoft owns alternative browser market. AOL expected pay little, any, premium Netscape's stock price Friday, executives close deal said, since Netscape shares doubled last month. In last week alone, Netscape's stock jumped $12, nearly 45 percent, following reports discussing possible partnership AOL. The stock closed Friday $39.1875, $2.625. AOL's shares gained $1.50 Friday, closing $84.875. Envisioning thoroughly networked world World Wide Web limitless marketplace information, entertainment, products services, America Online Inc. Tuesday laid details agreement buy Netscape Communications Corporation $4.2 billion. By moving quickly toward companies recently come see inevitable convergence technology media, America Online hopes secure solid lead battle already joined giants like Microsoft Corp. International Business Machines Corp. transform greater part cyberspace vast virtual mall. Part vision rests alliance Sun Microsystems America Online negotiated part deal. Sun brings cyber-savvy sales force effort but, even importantly, strong technology partner developing Netscape's industrial-strength software running Internet sites. Sun indeed technology heavyweight. It owns Java programming language specially designed Internet applications, Solaris, among popular commercial operating systems powerful computers big corporations use serve Internet services like World Wide Web, e-mail retail transactions. It also manufactures highly respected line powerful computers based microprocessor chips. But America Online  big Internet players compete  real potential gold mine lies road, perhaps five years away, people venture line information shopping personal computers inexpensive Internet appliances costing $200 each, maybe included free part subscription service, cellular phones now. Today, wired remains comparatively elitist activity  estimated 25 percent American households access Internet last year, 5 percent households bought merchandise line. But executives America Online Netscape hope deal accelerate timetable day Net ubiquitous, people tap World Wide Web appliance-like devices, pagers, cell phones, television set-top boxes computers routinely use telephone today. A new generation Internet devices able deliver service anywhere key part deal long run, said Stephen M. Case, 40, chairman America Online. For present, however, idea make America Online, nation's leading online service, standard way get onto Internet, executives explained. Netscape, Internet pioneer, crucial part effort, said. There assurance vision technological future prove accurate or, even does, America Online-Netscape combination lead way. Still, long-range game plan helps explain brought America Online Netscape together. And ability companies' executives sell vision Netscape's whiz-kid programmers particular determine whether merger succeeds. Netscape's headquarters Mountain View, Calif., likely become prime target Silicon Valley headhunters. As case software company, Netscape's key asset talented programmers, many code hackers may reluctant work America Online, still reputation middle-brow service catering online newcomers, known derisively newbies. Stock options financial incentives tailored try keep Netscape employees board. But people want change world, we've got clear joining America Online, along Sun component, really bigger opportunity us, said Marc Andreessen, 26-year-old cofounder Netscape led team young programmers supercomputing center University Illinois Silicon Valley start Internet software company 1994. This ought preeminent Internet company next decade, Andreessen declared, speaking cell phone streetcorner Palo Alto, Calif. For part, Andreessen, Netscape executive vice president, become Netscape's chief technology officer next three four months, merger completed. His new job America Online yet determined, likely chief technology officer combined company well, America Online executive said. Already, according one Netscape board member, Andreessen delivered 12-page single-spaced memorandum Case, setting view technological road map new company follow future, emphasizing opportunities electronic commerce environment people linked Internet. Netscape, populated computing sophisticates, America Online, known on-ramp Internet technologically challenged, seem corporate odd couple. But two companies, executives explained, evolving toward year. In telephone interview America Online's headquarters Dulles, Va., Case described Netscape enterprise morphed company dependent sales software used browse World Wide Web  Microsoft's cross-hairs  business relied advertising revenues popular Netcenter Web site selling software corporations handle electronic commerce. The Netscape transformation largely reaction Microsoft's competitive assault browser business  central element government's antitrust suit Microsoft. Microsoft bundled browser industry-standard Windows operating system, gave away browser free. The government alleges steps part pattern anticompetitive practices, Microsoft maintains moves intended mainly benefit consumers. Early year, laying workers suffering large loss last year, Netscape announced would also distribute browser free. It seems stabilized business around new model. Netscape announced Tuesday earned $2.7 million revenues $162 million fourth fiscal quarter, ended September. Yet America Online also changed last couple years, moving well beyond reputation online service beginners. It Internet chat service runs all-in-one site Web, known portal, includes e-mail, Internet searching, news, entertainment online shopping. America Online really changed closed online service novice users Internet media technology company diverse set brands, Andreessen said. These two companies moving direction, fit good one. America Online Inc. wants become next Microsoft two promising information-age fields Microsoft Corp. another company  Internet media business electronic commerce. With proposed purchase Netscape Communications Corp., AOL, nation's largest dial-up online service 14 million subscribers, hopes take significant step toward ambitious goal. If $4 billion deal completed  companies reached final agreement Monday night  AOL would acquire leading Internet brand enlarge wired audience absorbing millions regularly visit Netscape's popular NetCenter site World Wide Web. Acquiring Netscape would really enhance America Online's role premier Internet media company, said James F. Moore, president Geopartners Inc., consulting firm. America Online assembling kind audience numbers convince people Internet becoming mainstream media. In new media business, traditional media like television newspapers, eyeballs translate advertising revenue. But really intrigues media executives consumer marketers new media  news, entertainment services rendered computer code  is inherently two-way medium people interact tap key click mouse button The interaction advertisers marketers want see, course, buying. And potential exploiting instant, direct connection consumers fueled recent optimism electronic commerce. Today, companies selling everything books baby clothes Internet. Most companies progressed beyond experimentation stage, handful encouraging success stories like Amazon.com, on-line bookstore. By 2003, Forrester Research Inc., whose business analyzing trends cyberspace, projects Internet commerce could reach $3.2 trillion, 5 percent sales worldwide. AOL forefront convergence media commerce converge, integration reflected lineage leaders. Steve Case, chairman, new-product manager Pepsico's Pizza Hut chain, Robert Pittman, president, former MTV executive. Microsoft also investing heavily new media electronic commerce. It online service, MSN, competes AOL, well information-and commerce Web sites focus travel, cars real estate. It also owns Sidewalk, network local sites list movies, restaurants stores cities around country including Seattle New York. Its MSNBC Internet news service half joint venture NBC. Microsoft expected formidable competitor media-and-commerce business. It shortage bright people money rival. Besides deep pockets, Microsoft built-in advantage computer-based medium Windows operating system runs 90 percent personal computers sold today. Its control Windows desktop gives valuable piece commercial real estate information age. In theory, least, owning desktop screen help Microsoft steer consumers online offerings  issue key government's antitrust suit Microsoft. But far, Microsoft started slowly fields Internet media electronic commerce. Microsoft may want to, dominate new markets, said Richard Shaffer, principal Technologic Partners, research firm. America Online recognizes big opportunity emerging growth businesses like electronic commerce instead trying take Microsoft head-on. Still, Netscape deal completed, AOL also find software business way never past. Netscape known pioneer commercial development software used navigate World Wide Web. Microsoft saw browser software direct threat industry dominance pursued market aggressively, bundling browser Windows giving away free  tactics challenged government. But Netscape longer generates revenues browser, also distributes free, sale heavy-duty software sold corporations. Much software used technological back office electronic commerce  used building Web sites processing transactions. A surprising element proposed deal AOL intends hold onto Netscape's corporate software business instead selling established software company. America Online credibility market, observed Michael A. Cusumano, professor Massachusetts Institute Technology's Sloan School Management. Executives close AOL explain decision need provide full-line offerings electronic commerce, corporate Web site computer screens consumers. But AOL decided needs help preserve strengthen Netscape's corporate software business. To that, brought Sun Microsystems Inc. side deal, complicated transaction considerably. AOL, according executives close proposed deal, Netscape, joint marketing development partnership Sun. As part deal, AOL agree purchase $300 million worth Sun's computers service, Sun apparently agree purchase sizeable amounts Netscape software, Sun's sales force must sell. Still, AOL Sun longer-term objective well  one promises place direct conflict Microsoft. For nearly year, William J. Raduchel, Sun's chief strategist, working closely AOL, according Sun executives. A former Harvard economics professor taught Scott McNealy, Sun chairman, Raduchel focused Sun's Internet programming technologies, called Java Jini, seen potential threats Microsoft's dominance. By combining Sun's technology prowess AOL's powerful consumer brand, Sun executives say, potential kind end-run around Microsoft's grip desktop computing. In research laboratories, Sun working stripped-down network computer  simple-to-use information appliance, could cost little $200 given away part subscription service. The concept AOL's Internet media electronic commerce services could delivered many homes today many people still shun expense difficulty using personal computer. The appliance would mainly receiver screen, computing power residing vast central computers serving information users request tapping buttons. Sun's technological specialty kind centralized network computing. If long-term AOL-Sun vision ever materialized  certainly three-to-five year bet, least  could give companies boost technological independence Microsoft. Microsoft Corp. argued federal court Monday proposed acquisition Netscape Communications Corp. America Online seriously undermined government's antitrust suit software giant. From legal standpoint, proposed deal pulls rug government, William Neukom, Microsoft's senior vice president legal affairs, said Monday morning courthouse steps. The reasoning behind assertion, Microsoft says, proposed deal demonstrates Netscape larger software industry healthy vibrant  even illegal anti-competitive practices alleged government's suit. But David Boies, government's lead attorney, said irrelevant. Whatever deal ends  ends deal  going remove obstacles Microsoft placed path competition industry, said. Michael Lacovara, Microsoft lawyer questioning government witness, economist Frederick Warren-Boulton, suggested trial Monday proposed acquisition undermined Warren-Boulton's argument, Microsoft seems headed toward obtaining monopoly Internet browser software match one apparently holds operating systems. After all, 22 percent Americans use Internet reach America Online. And present AOL uses Microsoft's Web browser, Internet Explorer, service's default choice. In exchange that, Microsoft places AOL advertisement Internet link Windows 98. Lacovara asked witness whether, AOL's service contract expires January, would expect AOL continue distribute Microsoft software. Yes, Warren-Boulton responded. It clear AOL's incentive changed proposed merger Netscape. He noted America Online officials said need among online services featured Windows forced accept Microsoft terms  establishing Internet Explorer default choice. Lacovara asked Warren-Boulton question lay entire cross-examination witness  Microsoft's larger assertion Monday proposed Netscape-AOL deal. Surely combination, asked, tells something nature competition software industry? Warren-Boulton's answer probably one Lacovara after. To extent potential merger result Microsoft's actions exclusive contracts actions, said, unfortunate see disappearance firm like Netscape, brightest, newest star. Warren-Boulton's purpose stand government establish Microsoft monopoly operating-system software; 90 percent world's computers use Microsoft operating system. That foundation government's case since federal antitrust law forbids certain behavior monopolist would legal firm faces healthy competition. Through repeated, often circumlocutious questioning, Lacovara tried make case Microsoft's overwhelming market share ephemeral. The software industry vibrant fast moving, suggested, Microsoft could toppled position moment  point view company encourages among employees. On Friday Monday, Lacovara repeatedly pointed companies placing operating systems market, software companies  principally Microsoft's greatest rivals  writing software new systems. But Warren-Boulton argued existence fringe competitors operating system market mean way Microsoft monopoly power. On Monday afternoon, Lacovara made issue success Apple Computer Co. selling new iMac computer. He entered evidence Apple news release issued last month showing, among things, 12.5 percent people buying Apple's new iMac computer previously owned Windows machine. Apple computers use different operating system, Mac-OS. The outcome Microsoft antitrust case may long way off, one thing already clear: This first major e-mail trial. The government's prosecution Microsoft Corp.'s defense, striking degree, legal campaigns waged electronic messages. The human testimony often pales next e-mail evidence. On stand videotaped testimony, people questioned shrug, mumble forget. The e-mail alive ideas competitive zeal, punctuated profanity exclamation points. The second week trial ended prosecutors frustrated lengthy cross-examination Microsoft's lead lawyer left time government show several hours videotaped deposition Bill Gates, Microsoft chairman. With new witness, executive Apple Computer Inc., taking stand Monday, uncertain Gates tape played. The Justice Department 20 states suing Microsoft believe tape strengthen case shows Gates saying involved plans take government alleges illegal steps stifle competition Internet software market. The Gates videotape, said David Boies, Justice Department's trial lawyer, offers opportunity judge Gates' credibility. But Gates credibility gap, one, becomes issue videotape taped remarks compared contrasted e-mail wrote received. The e-mail record, government insists, shows Gates waist-deep plotting anti-competitive deals bullying tactics denies professes never heard taped deposition. If machinations central government's case, summon Gates trial? The government need put Gates stand, e-mail memoranda, Stephen Houck, lawyer states, told court. The Microsoft legal team months preparing e-mail defense. First, Microsoft argues, anything looks damaging taken context. I urge honor, John Warden, Microsoft's lead lawyer, told Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson, view considerable skepticism crazy quilt e-mail fragments seem form core government's case. But Microsoft also mounted e-mail counterattack, culled millions messages obtained subpoena competitors pretrial discovery. Warden's cross-examination ritual present government witness internal e-mail company pose declaration question. These interrogations two refrains: Isn't true company exactly accusing Microsoft doing, true Microsoft prevailed predatory monopolist superior technology? Microsoft accused trying prod companies stay way. So last week, example, Warden produced e-mail Stephen Case, chairman America Online, suggesting partnership Netscape Communications Corp. companies would focus respective strengths. That division labor, Case wrote, would best way achieve goal Marc Andreessen, Netscape's cofounder, described earlier e-mail beating Beast From Redmond wants see us dead  reference Microsoft's headquarters Redmond, Wash. Printouts e-mail another form written communication. By 1920s, typewriters became common, typed memoranda started used court cases. From 1950s 1980s, legal experts say, explosion documentation fueled new technologies electric typewriters, photocopying fax machines, personal computers. And e-mail, add, played important role legal inquiries years, like Iran-contra case 1980s e-mail found Oliver North's computer proved crucial. But Microsoft case result sweeping government antitrust investigation high-technology company e-mail supplanted telephone common instrument communication. E-mail revolutionized investigations kind, one senior Justice Department official said. While investigation, Microsoft handed government estimated 30 million documents, mostly e-mail. In trial, two sides submitted 3,000 exhibits, mainly e-mail. And e-mail, people often communicate frankly informally writing letter report  tap out, punch button gone cyberspace. But e-mail communication documentary evidence, legal cases provides rich, contemporaneous record people thinking planning time. It sharp contrast formal oral testimony, often coached lawyers crafted selective memory. The e-mail record certainly makes I-don't-recall line response harder sustain, said Robert Litan, former senior official Justice Department's antitrust division Brookings Institution. It also powerful ammunition pointing contradictions testimony. And government attacking Gates' credibility videotaped deposition, taken three days August. The government offered glimpse strategy first day trial. It showed brief clips point deposition Gates asked meeting June 21, 1995, which, government alleges, Microsoft offered divide browser market Netscape make investment company, chief rival market. In taped deposition, Gates says recalled asked one subordinates whether thought made sense invest Netscape. He said asked June 1995 meeting replied, I see something made sense. But e-mail May 31, 1995, Gates urged alliance Netscape. We could even pay money part deal, wrote, buying piece something. The contradiction Gates' deposition e-mail, though, speak issue whether Microsoft made illegal offer Netscape. To sure, Microsoft  said e-mail communications  counts most. But e-mail looks bad gets record, end Microsoft's lawyers going spend much trial  trying explain away, said Stephen Axinn, leading antitrust litigator firm Axinn, Veltrop &AMP; Harkrider New York.

America Online verge agreeing purchase Netscape Communications Corp., Internet pioneer center government's antitrust suit Microsoft Corp., executives involved talks said Sunday. The proposed deal complex, three-way transaction involving AOL, Netscape Sun Microsystems Inc. AOL, leading on-line service 14 million subscribers, would acquire Netscape's popular site World Wide Web software business. But part deal, AOL would also enter joint marketing development partnership Sun Microsystems strengthen Netscape's business selling large corporations heavy-duty software needed serve Web pages Internet technologies many thousands users time. The purchase, exchange AOL shares Netscape stock, valued roughly $4 billion. A completed deal could announced soon Monday morning. But executives involved talks cautioned Sunday night details remained negotiated. The Netscape deal, consummated, would realign three businesses forefront modern economy  on-line services, Internet software electronic commerce. It would strengthen two Microsoft's leading rivals, AOL Sun Microsystems. At time, however, would subsume Netscape, Internet software maker regarded serious challenger Microsoft's dominance personal computer software market. Netscape, founded 1994, struggled last 18 months assault Microsoft. Its Navigator runaway leader market browser software used navigate World Wide Web. But Microsoft, responding Internet revolution, entered market aggressively, quickly matching quality Netscape's technology bundling Microsoft browser, Internet Explorer, industry-standard Windows operating system giving away free. Earlier year, Netscape announced layoffs started distributing Navigator free well, Microsoft steadily gained browser market. Since then, Netscape focused mainly two businesses  advertising transaction fees Netcenter Web site selling industrial-strength software corporations building Internet sites conduct electronic commerce. AOL believes expertise increase revenues Netscape's Web site and, helped Sun's programmers vast corporate sales force, accelerate Netscape's software sales well, executives involved negotiations said. Sun's version Unix, Solaris, among popular operating systems large, powerful computers run Netscape's server software. This deal would insure fundamental elements Netscape survive within bigger companies drive technologies forward, said David B. Yoffie, professor Harvard business school co-author Michael A. Cusumano Massachusetts Institute Technology recent book, Competing Internet Time: Lessons Netscape Its Battle Microsoft. The impact deal, any, government's antitrust suit Microsoft uncertain. It appear support key theme Microsoft's defense  namely, operates fast-moving industry corporate alliances shift time. Thus, Microsoft argues, antitrust policy tread gently. But deal, government officials insist, direct effect current case. No matter much alliances shift, affect central fact Microsoft's monopoly used abused market power protect monopoly, said David Boies, Justice Department's lead trial lawyer Microsoft case. Executives representing Netscape, AOL Sun Microsystems government witnesses Microsoft trial. And serious merger talks Netscape Chief Executive Officer James Barksdale AOL Chairman Steve Case began month ago, start Microsoft trial, according people close talks. Industry analysts suggest companies may emboldened take stronger anti-Microsoft steps based partly perception antitrust case would weaken Microsoft. And representatives Kleiner Perkins Caufield &AMP; Byers, Silicon Valley venture capital firm regarded power broker among Microsoft's rivals, sit boards Netscape, Sun AOL. Stock prices vaulted record levels Monday, furthering recovery recently two months ago seemed nearly unthinkable. I thought serious correction since 1990, I never thought wrote bull market over, said Byron Wien, U.S. equity strategist Morgan Stanley Dean Witter &AMP; Co. Now seems behind us. The Dow Jones industrial average rose 214.72 points, 2.34 percent, 9,374.27. The record first since July 17, Dow closed 9,337.97. Since Aug. 31, Dow stood 7,539.07 steep slide, blue-chip gauge risen 24 percent. For year, Dow 18.54 percent chance rising 20 percent fourth consecutive year, something never accomplished before. Broader averages also climbed. The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock index set record, rising 24.66 points, 2.12 percent, 1,188.21. The Nasdaq composite index reach new high posted biggest percentage gain Monday, rising 49.21 points, 2.55 percent, 1,977.42. And Russell 2000 index smaller-company issues gained 3.86 points, nearly 1 percent, 398.15. Monday's action energized daily record number mergers acquisitions valued $1 billion more. The merger announcements prompted investors change estimates much companies worth also indicated coming declines outstanding shares stock. This may supply-demand story, demand stocks rising supply stock reduced one company another merges, said Hugh Johnson, chief investment officer First Albany Corp. The flow money mutual funds fairly strong, pressure managers put money work. Two deals seemed catalysts broad swaths stocks. News Bankers Trust may close accepting $8.9 billion offer Deutsche Bank Germany heightened interest financial-services bank stocks. And word America Online may acquire Netscape Communications $4 billion stock powered Internet technology stocks even loftier valuations. Among financial companies, J.P. Morgan gained 6 1/16, 115 11/16. American Express 4 3/8, 108 15/16. Merrill Lynch jumped 4 3/8, 76. And Donaldson, Lufkin &AMP; Jenrette rose 3 9/16, 42}. Netscape active stock Monday, gaining 2}, 41 15/16. America Online gained 4 3/8, 89\. Other Internet stocks also surged, analysts said group, seen meteoric gains recent weeks, ripe steep correction. Yahoo Amazon.com became $200 stocks Monday. Yahoo rose 30 7/16, 221 7/16. And Amazon.com gained 37 3/8, 218. The performance Internet stocks unsettling sign, Wien said. Still, more-established technology shares also good day. IBM rose 7, 166 5/8. Microsoft jumped 5 9/16, 119 3/16. And Intel closed 113 9/16, 1{. After Monday's big price moves, Wien said according calculations, stocks 10 percent overvalued. By contrast, middle July market 20 percent overvalued, said. Nonetheless, market's recovery, buttressed three cuts interest rates Federal Reserve Board, left many longtime Wall Street hands grasping historical parallels. At point new ground, said Laszlo Birinyi, heads market research firm. At beginning year, I said target Dow 10,000 end 1998. If anyone asked market went looks like corrective blip, I would said new target would 9,000. I surprised 10,000 figure came back table year. The New York Times said editorial Wednesday, Nov. 25: America Online's effort acquire Netscape set partnership Sun Microsystems reminder rapidly corporate landscape change fast-moving technical fields. But lessen need Justice Department vigorously pursue antitrust suit Microsoft, dominant player software. The department presented solid evidence Microsoft used monopoly operating systems muscle rivals partners head competition software realms. The Internet risen quickly information medium four years ago, book The Road Ahead, Bill Gates scarcely mentions it. In addition, couple years ago America Online, world's biggest online service, much trouble getting rid bugs system widely derided America On Hold. Now Microsoft moved aggressively Internet Justice Department accusing predatory behavior, America Online rocketed forward make deals Internet players. In antitrust suit Microsoft, federal government charges company illegally bundled browser Windows operating system smother Netscape's chances marketing browser. Now corridors outside antitrust trial Microsoft's lawyers maintain Netscape found new partner America Online need protection government. But could easily argued Microsoft bludgeoned Netscape dissolution, forcing distress sale America Online. Nor clear customers America Online choose Netscape's browser vehicle buying selling Internet. Even newly musclebound form, America Online remains dependent Microsoft's good favorable placement AOL icon main desktop screen. It may that, years hence, America Online, Netscape Sun put together alternative means Internet telephone lines, cables like. But day, fairness requires Justice Department action insure Microsoft use current position thwart consumer choice. Only companies know get products consumer incentive innovate turn Internet revolutionary medium promises be. ","As the government continued to press its anti-trust suit against Microsoft, AOL has begun negotiations to purchase Netscape.Netscape is at the heart of the antitrust suit.Netscape alleges that Microsoft marketing practices, packaging its Internet Explorer in its operating system denied market opportunities to Netscape.The AOL deal, a three-way negotiation between AOL, Sun Microsystems and Netscape, would combined three Microsoft rivals.AOL is counting on the Netscape purchase to allow it to expand its internet Market by helping business operate on the internet in an effort to join Media and technology.","In a bid to become a leader in the lucrative cyberspace economy, AOL will buy Netscape and set up a partnership with Sun.The venture will let AOL offer corporations end-to-end services, including servers, software, and accessibility to consumers.Eventually, AOL hopes to capitalize on the production of cheap devices offering Internet access to more homes.News of the deal helped push the Dow Jones to a new high.Meanwhile, Microsoft, accused by the Justice Department of using its operating system dominance to squelch competition in the browser market, claims the deal shows the software industry is healthy and that Netscape needs no government protection.","As the U.S. government pressed its antitrust case against Microsoft Corp. in November 1998, America Online (AOL) proposed an alliance with Netscape Communications and Sun Microsystems.The three-pronged deal promised to provide on-line services, Internet software and electronic commerce.AOL was to buy Netscape and forge a partnership with Sun, benefiting all three and giving technological independence from Microsoft.Microsoft lawyers argued unconvincingly that AOL's purchase of Netscape would undermine the government's antitrust case, based in large part on Netscape's complaint.It remained to be seen whether AOL could achieve a vast virtual mall.","America Online became the leading force in cyberspace for individuals to exchange e-mail and check the latest news.AOL saw a bright day ahead as a company that could provide online services, Internet software, and electronic commerce.To position itself better in this growing market, AOL sought to buy Netscape and work an alliance with Sun Microsystems.Netscape has faltered because of the ubiquity of the Microsoft Windows operating system requiring its browser.Microsoft argued that a vibrant technology market and rising stock prices undercut antitrust charges against it.At the trial the government presented thousands of e-mails supporting its case."
27,"President Leonid Kuchma called Friday corrections Ukraine's program market reforms, pledged reforms would continue. Kuchma elaborate comments group Ukrainian economists, saying changes necessary country's economic problems. Kuchma urged economists come recommendations national meeting economists November, Interfax news agency reported. Ukraine suffered economic problems since 1991 collapse Soviet Union especially hard hit financial crisis neighboring Russia, main trading partner. The Russian crisis hurt bilateral trade, caused Ukrainian currency fall led withdrawal investors Ukraine. In recent months, Kuchma implemented economic reforms decree, prompting International Monetary Fund release first installment long-awaited dlrs 2.2 billion loan. Many reforms, however, remain stalled. National Bank chairman Viktor Yushchenko Washington week consultations IMF officials. Yushchenko warned bank would spend dwindling reserves support hryvna currency, avoided comments currency recent days. Kuchma met Friday Yushchenko, Prime Minister Valery Pustovoitenko senior officials discuss ways stabilize hryvna.

When world's finance ministers central bankers gathered last year Hong Kong, nervously congratulated containing  least moment  nasty financial brush fire Asia. In year's time, many predicted hallway chatter, troubles Thailand Indonesia would look like replay Mexico 1995  rough bump road world enjoying remarkable prosperity. Talk bad market calls. Twelve months later, financial mandarins clog Washington limousines glide endless receptions annual meeting International Monetary Fund World Bank, everything could gone wrong world economy has: worst downturn Japan since World War II, economic meltdown Russia, depression Indonesia plunging 100 million people poverty line, deep fears happens next Latin America. What makes year's IMF meeting remarkable, though, harshest criticisms directed monetary fund itself, and, extension, U.S. Treasury, viewed power behind IMF. This year, place confident predictions, mutual recriminations. Arguments breaking whether true culprits crony capitalists weakened leaders like Russian President Boris Yeltsin, huge investors poured money world's emerging markets reckless abandon mid-1990s panicked past twelve months. Whatever reason, one reality prevails: Hundreds billions dollars fled economies four continents  seeking safest havens possible, often United States  money returning anytime soon. And subtext every seminar capital flows every conclave nervous ministers painfully blunt questions: Can stopped? Or world headed global recession? Fifty-three years ago IMF created Bretton Woods conference sought stabilize world economy secure peace World War II. Now attack sides, charged worsening bad situation misjudging economics, politically tone-deaf volatile capitals world, Jakarta, Indonesia, Moscow. For first time, disturbing questions whether institution still capable, financially politically, containing kind economic contagion caught world unaware. Once, IMF's critics largely found Africa South Asia, fund often viewed arrogant; today include Wall Street's biggest players top officials powerful economies Asia Europe. Only  including former Secretary State George Schultz members Congress increasingly suspicious international institutions  talking scrapping IMF altogether. But almost everyone talking creating new financial architecture old one clearly cannot: smother financial wildfires leap around globe. President Clinton, British Prime Minister Tony Blair leaders, months silence, edged debate, cases wresting issue first time finance ministers central banks. Their fear, advisers say, 15 months financial turmoil threatening political stability. Such concerns turned year's meeting tumbled mass worries groping short long-term solutions. The Japanese, French, Southeast Asians arriving Washington different diagnoses went wrong, different solutions set right. The United States set plans, mix suggestions force disclosure financial data countries around world impose American-style financial standards regulation. Meanwhile, ideological argument breaking whether world slow long march toward free open markets  strategy pressed Clinton administration past six years. Others argue unwise start rebuilding hospital patients still operating tables. Last year standard answer us given came this: `We IMF World Bank, know best,' Indonesian Foreign Minister Ali Alatas said breakfast Washington day, reflecting crisis turned 30 years astounding growth country overnight depression. Then said everything went wrong fault, said. But now, I think people know much problem came outside, need something better. And IMF beginning fight back, awkward role institution dominated Ph.D. economists unaccustomed openly challenged. Every place turn read story, came in, made things worse, said Stanley Fischer, deputy managing director fund, born Northern Rhodesia  Zambia  became chairman Massachusetts Institute Technology's economics department taking job put center financial storm. We frequently get blame, well-deserved, said. But politically convenient governments around world cry, `The IMF made us it,' pin mistakes us. That's fine. We'd rather loved, we'd like effective. MISCALCULATIONS, POLITICS AND SAFETY NETS On steaming January day, Michel Camdessus, IMF's top official, slipped Jakarta private residence President Suharto sat four-hour meeting tick off, line line, huge reforms Indonesia would implement return tens billions dollars emergency aid. Two previous deals collapsed Suharto ignored fund's conditions, Camdessus insisted strike deal directly Suharto, Asia's longest-serving leader. It meeting men knew different worlds power politics: Suharto rose general central Java, Camdessus detonated mines Algeria French army entering French Treasury way becoming head France's central bank. It there, senior IMF official recalled. He told dismantle national airplane project, clove monopoly, distribution monopolies. At one point, Camdessus looked impassive Suharto said, You see means family, reference vast investments country's key industries. He said, `I called children, understand.' But within months, exchange Jakarta came symbolize IMF's twin troubles: Its inability understand reckon national politics countries need radical reform, focus economic stabilization rather social costs actions. Suharto intention fulfilling agreement. It was, one former Cabinet members said, delaying move obvious everyone except Camdessus. Perhaps one reason IMF sometimes appears tone-deaf senior staff almost entirely composed Ph.D. economists. There officials deep experience international politics, much less complexities Javanese culture work Indonesia. Historically, experts politics security gravitated United Nations, development experts World Bank, economists IMF  creating dangerous gaps crisis like one. As result, fund rudimentary understanding would happen demands met Indonesia's state monopolies quickly dissolved. While system lined pockets Suhartos friends, also distributed food, gasoline staples country stretches 3,000 miles thousands islands. To help balance budget, fund demanded quick end expensive subsidies keep price food gasoline artificially low. But that, combined huge currency devaluation sparked crisis, resulted high prices shortages fueled riots continue day, millions Indonesians lose jobs. The IMF  unintentionally, officials insist  also sped Suharto's resignation, insisting elimination crony capitalism, code words removing Suharto family center economy. Ultimately, may prove Indonesia's salvation, new government contain rioting ethnic Chinese minority  whose money desperately needed save country's fast-shrinking economy. It worth noting, Fischer said week, programs Asia  Indonesia, Korea Thailand  took hold change government. Nonetheless, Indonesia experience revived argument IMF focused stabilizing banks currencies, preventing capital flight freeing markets, blind social costs actions. Among toughest critics sister institution, World Bank, whose main charge alleviating poverty. You've seen tension almost every day, one senior World Bank official said recently. The bank gone extraordinary lengths recent months differentiate role fund, announce tripling aid poorest countries hit economic chaos. Even U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan joined argument, warning speech Harvard recently globalization succeed, must succeed poor rich alike. It must deliver rights less riches. It must harnessed cause capital alone, development prosperity poorest world. IMF officials say changing strategies see exacting great social cost. It's difficult formula get exactly right, Fischer said August, Russia teetering IMF sending $4.8 billion aid rapidly wasted. You need enough discipline send right message markets keep investors fleeing. But need enough leeway keep people suffering otherwise would. In recent months, noted, IMF allowed spending sustain subsidies basic goods longer periods Indonesia, Korea elsewhere. There new flexibility IMF senior Indonesian official concluded recently. It lot better. A U.S. PAWN, OR A RUNAWAY AGENCY? The Clinton administration admits IMF many failings, many display year. But insists world gone global financial crises without IMF century  result 1930s. I doubt situation past year would much worse  greater devaluations, defaults, contagion, greater trade dislocations  without program agreed IMF finance provided, Deputy Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers told Congress last week. Many Republicans Democrats unconvinced. Even though Senate overwhelmingly approved $18 billion contribution fund help fight new crises, House defeated measure two weeks ago. The fund's last hope getting money, free nearly $100 billion contributions nations waiting United States act, come House Senate try resolve budget differences conference committee next 10 days. A rejection, Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin insists, would send message around world United States turning back one institution charged restoring economic stability. Everywhere else world, though, politicians businessmen insist one biggest problems IMF that, contrary view Congress, acts U.S. Treasury's lap dog. Ask Jakarta Moscow, response same: The IMF never ventures far without looking back approving nod master. When United States weighs in, however, IMF called rescue country deep trouble. Only IMF  U.S. Treasury  leverage extract commitments return billions aid. In theory, U.S. influence limited: It 18.5 percent vote fund. Germany, Japan, France Britain 5 percent each. But practice United States usually gets way, exercising influence behind scenes, often interactions Fischer Summers. The two met Fischer MIT faculty Summers graduate student taking one classes, later becoming colleague MIT. Each served chief economist World Bank. It Summers instrumental placing Fischer fund's no. 2 job, days talk constantly. It's usually warm relationship, Fischer said summer. Remember, job cannot turn outsiders advice  can't call chief economist Wall Street firm, even many academic friends, many issues confidential. The Treasury's relations Camdessus often strained plays role world diplomat, traveling globe trying coax along political leaders. The tensions obvious start Asia crisis. The fund made little secret displeasure United States offering direct aid Thailand, major U.S. ally, sign support confidence. Mindful backlash Congress Mexico bailed U.S. money, last thing Treasury planned do. Summers, turn, thought fund forcing Thais implement reform commitments rigorously enough disclose true financial picture. Within U.S. government dissension: The State Defense Departments felt United States Thailand, backed Treasury asked would like pony aid budgets. There conflicts. When Japan used last IMF meeting propose setting $100 billion Asia Fund  one would exclude United States would probably offer aid much relaxed conditions IMF does. Rubin called Camdessus breakfast one morning told Japanese proposal would undercut IMF's authority. We've dispute Michel, Rubin reported aides returned orange juice croissant. One shot back: And 8 a.m. Camdessus backed Rubin's insistence walked away money Asia could used. Japan says back similar proposal weekend, time $30 billion fund. Camdessus also rankled U.S. officials statements amounted cheerleading reassure markets  sometimes face facts. In June, Russia way collapse, Camdessus declared contrary markets commentators imagining slow collapse Russia's economy, crisis. This major development. The bailouts Russia South Korea prime examples Washington muscles IMF's turf soon major U.S. strategic interests involved. Last Christmas, South Korea slipped within days running hard currency pay debts December, sent secret envoy, Kim Kihwan, work rescue package. I bother going IMF, Kim recalled recently. I called Summers' office Treasury home Seoul, flew Washington went directly there. I knew would get done. Within days Treasury dispatched David Lipton, experienced veteran emergency bailouts, leaving post undersecretary international affairs month, shadow IMF staff's negotiations government Seoul. Fischer displeased. To make negotiation effective, clear authority negotiating, said. WHO LOST RUSSIA? The pattern repeated summer, United States raced put together $17 billion package Russia. The IMF's staff Moscow declared Russia needed money  needed enact policies would restore confidence investors. The Americans Germans came different conclusion. Soon after, U.S. officials gathered White House situation room consider might happen Russia ruble devalued market reforms collapsed push IMF come emergency money. So fund began assembling last-ditch program prop country resisted reform plans seven years. Camdessus, though, still hesitant, questioning whether IMF risk scarce resources Russia. We pull Michel along, senior Treasury official recalled. As turned out, Camdessus' instincts right approach championed Rubin Summers proved disastrously wrong. The first installment payment  $4.8 billion  wasted, propping currency long enough, words one IMF official, let oligarchs get money country. Then Yeltsin reversed commitments, let ruble devalue anyway, began printing money abandon fired virtually every reformer government  resulting collapse IMF agreements indefinite suspension aid program. Now, inside IMF Capitol Hill, recriminations lost Russia. Publicly, Fischer argues apologies owed attempted Russia. But IMF officials complain privately let Rubin Summers run roughshod them, striking deal fell apart within weeks Russian parliament rebelled Yeltsin backed away commitments. Summers responds United States took calculated risk vastly better Russia succeed succeed. The Russian collapse touched new rounds economic contagion, investors fleeing Latin America, triggering huge losses hedge funds like Long Term Capital, Greenwich, Conn., investment firm needed rescued Wall Street powerhouses whose money invested. Russia turning point, said Robert Hormats, vice chairman Goldman, Sachs &AMP; Co. It made world realize countries fail, even IMF Treasury intercede. And changed perception risk. Now, countries meet face future IMF warned could bleak, need reverse perceptions, watch countries slowly starve lack capital. The emerging markets calling controls short term investments. The French want stronger IMF. The Americans say answer disclosure, investors better warned, tougher regulation. These usually nice, quiet meetings; everyone polite, top U.S. official said earlier week. Not year. Ukraine's parliament Friday refused approve President Leonid Kuchma's decree establishing state fund compensate people savings lost banks. Deputies voted 240-47 prepare revised version decree debate later month. They must consider decree Oct. 10, else automatically takes effect constitution. Leftist factions, voted proposed legislation, said would fully guarantee return savings lost financial instability recently hit Ukraine. The fund Kuchma proposed establish would accumulated money special National Bank account repay people case bank kept savings went bankrupt became insolvent. Although decree provided compensation deposits amounting 500 hryvna (dlrs 147 current exchange rate), authors said would cover 90 percent Ukrainians keep money banks. The measure meant prevent mass withdrawals deposits Ukrainian banks already experienced people, scared fall national currency turmoil neighboring Russia, started stock food, clothing household goods. Government officials say Ukrainians recently withdrawn least 10 percent 3 billion hryvna (dlrs 882 million) deposited banks. Russia's new prime minister picked unusual way reassure nation Thursday. After two weeks deliberations announced still plan rescue country economic crisis. I want repeat  program, Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov said. It yet worked out. In nations statement might provoke alarm. But Primakov seeking calm anxious public worried Kremlin's cure could worse disease. It Russians something concerned about. Thursday Primakov convened meeting top aides try hammer strategy overcoming economic woes. A main item agenda plan drafted Yuri Maslyukov, Communist government's senior policy maker economic issues. It take long Maslyukov's plan hit street. A newspaper, Kommersant Daily, published full Thursday morning. Not surprisingly Maslyukov's plan calls greater state role economy, including controls hard currency. A new State Bank Reconstruction Development would established using nationalized assets failed commercial banks. Wages pensions would paid two months, minimum wage would indexed inflation. There would huge tax cuts, combination suggested government committed printing additional money. The exchange rate ruble would set central bank, based changes inflation balance payments. Maslyukov's plan also implies Russians would able buy dollars exchanges country. It stipulates hard currency could enter country special authorization. Exporters would required sell hard currency reserves. That allusion currency controls sent shock waves Russian public. Russians come treat dollar second currency, many people squirreled away dollars hedge inflation. It obvious stupidity, Otto Latsis, commentator newspaper Noviye Izvestiya, said. People give dollars away. They go black market need to. Yegor Gaidar, former prime minister favors free markets, said plan war dollar predicted would lead shortage imports. As criticism grew, Primakov rushed distance talk currency controls. The rumors state's becoming monopolist inflow hard currency country nonsense, said, asserting document published Kommersant Daily one six possible plans. Primakov may opposed wildly unpopular currency controls. He may worried plan would would set panic buying dollars, depressing ruble. Or may simply trying keep distance Maslyukov's plan Russia tries wrangle next disbursement, $4.3 billion, International Monetary Fund. The particulars could modified, many people following maneuvering say believe represents basic thrust government's thinking. Primakov called greater state regulation expansion money supply, two themes Maslyukov's plan. The plan also many similarities plan presented government Gorbachev-era advisers. We think close final document, said United Financial Group, Russian investment business. It unclear long Primakov carry without spelling detailed strategy. The ousted tax chief, Boris Fyodorov, argued IMF provide aid Primakov taken tough measures build free market. Primakov has, however, sought turn logic head, arguing government's economic strategy depend fund's willingness provide aid. His aim appears to pressure fund implying fund's fault Russia forced default loans take draconian measures home. Or Primakov put Thursday, without fund's money, Russia impose unpopular measures.

The United States disappointed economic confusion within new Russian government Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov, said Secretary State Madeleine Albright Friday, warned Russia dangers anti-Western policy. In first comprehensive review U.S.-Russian relations since Primakov confirmed prime minister last month, Albright said Washington deeply concerned Russia's direction think crisis would soon abate. We heard lot talk recent days printing new money, indexing wages, imposing price capital controls restoring state management parts economy, told U.S.-Russia Business Council Chicago.

If Communist Party way  planning months  millions Russians take streets Wednesday biggest demonstrations years. But Communists politicians Communist stamp approval running country economy question marchers demonstrating against. President Boris Yeltsin economic advisers easy targets two months ago. But Yeltsin seems shadow today, advisers gone. The Communists, undergone sort resurgence playing discontent, working hard cast outsiders government help run  keep focus protests Wednesday Yeltsin policies. Even strategy may backfire, however, discontent Yeltsin necessarily translate support predecessors. An adviser Communist Party leader, Gennadi Zyuganov, made headlines long ago called new government bourgeois. The characterization striking, new prime minister, Yevgeny Primakov, one Zyuganov's top choices post. The deputy prime minister charge economy, Yuri Maslyukov, Communist Party figure headed Gosplan, infamous central-planning program helped bring Soviet Union ruin. We slogans aimed government, first secretary Moscow Communist Party committee, Alexander Kuvayev, said recent interview. All slogans aimed president economic course country. Only president fully blamed course brought country situation. Anger Russia's fate, own, drawing Russians back Soviet-style slogans old-style hostility toward capitalism. The ardently pro-Communist newspaper Sovietskaya Rossiya devoted front page Thursday said results contest among readers protest slogans. The entries ranged catchy kitschy, from, Legislator, official, banker  study Constitution; exam Oct. 7, to,  Imperialist! Help Russia return exported capital, pay debts once. Russia seen nothing approaching sort economic chaos despair since 1993, hyperinflation swept economy. There real way knowing whether latest travails produce huge ugly crowds small, peaceful ones. A deputy editor political analyst newsweekly, Itogi, Masha Lipman, said situation unlike 1993, Yeltsin sought, won, popular mandate referendum. He used dissolve Communist-dominated Parliament increase power. That led autumn showdown, shelling Parliament tanks total defeat, time being, Yeltsin's legislative opponents. You interpret demonstration Communist mandate, I think act like Yeltsin, Ms. Lipman said. Support Communists smallest level, maybe 20 percent. In survey 1,714 people released last week All-Russian Public Opinion Center said nearly half population supported idea demonstrations Yeltsin, barely one-tenth likely participate way. Nobody interested sort struggle, Yuri Levada, heads center, said interview. This mainly general expression great wave distrust authorities, mainly president. He's great scapegoat sins. There seems little enthusiasm demonstrations sort. Only thousand people turned Sunday fifth anniversary shelling Parliament Yeltsin's subsequent triumph Communists. The Communist Party Federation Independent Russian Unions, leftist organization says main sponsor protests, predict 9 million Russians participate Wednesday. The government vowed keep order without resorting force. But concerned enough summoned 11,000 police officers patrol Moscow 6,000 military troops intervene violence erupts. Protests since 1993 generally tepid, deep-seated feeling here. Some demonstrations last week, less practice runs, hinted similarly dampened marches year. President Boris Yeltsin would respond strongly effort prohibit Russians buying foreign currencies, believing move would like bringing another Iron Curtain country, spokesman said Friday. The president clearly understands ban would clear violation rights ... would mean return Iron Curtain everyday life, said presidential spokesman Dmitry Yakushin. The remarks came media reports government economic plan works would prohibit Russians buying U.S. dollars foreign currencies, institute strict economic controls, rolling back seven years reforms. Though government officials say plan one six possibilities, Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov warned Thursday might forced take unpopular measures rescue Russian economy receive next installment dlrs 22.6 billion loan International Monetary Fund. Central Bank Chairman Viktor Gerashchenko Finance Minister Mikhail Zadornov flew Washington Friday negotiations IMF dlrs 4.3 billion installment. IMF officials said want Russian government come sound economic program loan given, made clear currency controls boosting money supply printing rubles acceptable. But Primakov said country's plan would dependent IMF loan, way around. No short-term economic plan known another three weeks, long IMF set make decision, said First Deputy Prime Minister Vadim Gustov. A draft version government's fourth-quarter budget would rely heavily IMF loan, Kommersant newspaper said. Without loan, government would engage major deficit spending. Calls Soviet-style controls  part plan drafted First Deputy Prime Minister Yuri Maslyukov leaked press  apparently created rift within Cabinet. The plan drew heavy criticism Zadornov, Gerashchenko called idea banning foreign currency sales mad idea. Meanwhile, Russia's stock market dropped 5 percent 38.8 Friday, trading light downward move meant little. The stock market continued fall since crisis hit Aug. 17. And tax collection September, result collapse Russia's banking system, said Alexander Pochinok, head government's finance credit department. Revenues totaled 14.3 billion rubles (dlrs 875 million), 700 million rubles (dlrs 43 million) less expected. The government wants reverse trend raising taxes oil gas companies, idea expected meet sharp resistance lower house Russia's parliament, wants cut tax rates, Pochinok said. Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov said Saturday economic crisis would bring end government's program privatizing state property. Privatization accomplished growth production, growth investment growth production effectiveness renewal major funds, Primakov said meeting Western businessmen. We shall conduct privatization serves interests people, state, business, said, according ITAR-Tass news agency. Primakov reassured businessmen, members prime minister's consultive council foreign investment Russia, government plans ban circulation U.S. dollars Russia. But, said, government would take steps staunch flow dollars Russia. Responding media reports government economic plan would prohibit Russians buying U.S. dollars foreign currency, Primakov said reports absolutely correspond reality, ITAR-Tass quoted saying. He said need regulate influx dollars Russia, government take steps prevent called dollar drain. Russian companies stashed dlrs 2.5 billion outside country September alone, Interfax news agency reported Friday, quoting central bank figures. Primakov said foreign investors force help Russia minimize losses current economic crisis. We much interested foreign investments, especially ones go real production sector, Primakov said, according Interfax. We need continuous dialogue foreign investors, without difficult us overcome current difficulties. He said Russia wanted long-term investments. Foreign capital coming country via short-term operations, Primakov said. This, said, liking yours. Viktor Gerashchenko, central bank chairman, said Friday government must act stem flow dollars Russia. Gerashchenko Finance Minister Mikhail Zadornov Washington Saturday annual meeting International Monetary Fund, plan spell measures Russia taking bail finance system. Russia wants IMF release second dlrs 4.3 billion installment loan approved July, month country's economy crashed government effectively defaulted foreign loans. IMF officials said want Russian government come sound economic program installment given, made clear currency controls boosting money supply printing rubles acceptable. In season crashing banks, plunging rubles, bouncing paychecks, failing cropsand rotating governments, maybe ultimate insult. But nation bore Tolstoy Chekhov, still regards well-written letter labor love, buckling little week, longer wish good health Baba Anya Omsk. The Post Office broke. In 60 country's 89 statelike regions, 1,000 mail cars sidetracked, many stuffed 18 tons letters, newspapers parcels. The state Railway Ministry refuses carry mail Post Office makes good 210 million rubles old bills  $13 million today's dollars, $35 million dollars six weeks ago. Air mail, amounts one every four five letters, also suspended one Moscow's major airports week, Post Office coughed 5 million rubles old bills. A second airport still demanding 3 million rubles past-due debts. So much mail backed post offices Moscow elsewhere simply stopped accepting out-of-town mail, except areas easily reached truck. Delivery schedules fallen weeks, perhaps months, behind. The situation really extraordinary, said Vladimir Sherekhov, deputy chief mail service administration government's Communications Committee. We've never anything like before. Maybe Post Office lucky. Extraordinary rule elsewhere Russia. Until Friday, lower house Parliament preparing sue government failure provide soap, heat, toilet paper copy-machine paper legislature's monumental downtown offices. It turned politicians exhausted funds cutting short recess returning address nation's economic crisis. Earlier week, officials said Russia's Arctic shipping routes may close next month half nation's icebreakers disrepair money fix them. The oldest ships ancient nickname Granny. Such anecdotal evidence Russia losing wheels, like one old, ill-maintained Volga sedans, everywhere. But oddly, real signs public distress particularly common, perhaps system rarely seems shed part big postal system. If U.S. Postal Service increasingly pipeline sweepstakes notices bills, Russian Post Office still holds special place national conversation. Russians still write letters other, frequently fervently, many remote regions get news mail. Millions use mails ship canned goods provisions needy relatives friends faraway areas, especially vital service winter. And last years, Post Office become vehicle growing mail-order trade books, clothes catalog items readily available outside big cities. Exactly rumbled halt dispute. What clear Post Office Railway Ministry suffer ails every Russian venture, private public alike: Nobody pays bills. The state Railway Ministry complains continually stiffed customers believe railroads honor-bound carry freight whether paid not. The government specified nearly 40 categories freight railroads must carry next nothing. Among biggest deadbeats power ministries  military interior departments  pay Soviet times feel little need pay now. It's psychology formed socialist period, said Tatiana Pashkova, deputy spokeswoman ministry, situation exists Post Office. We've dispute long time. Always try understand differences. But can't carry cargo free. No kidding, says Post Office: It, too, owed 200 million rubles government agencies, barred raising rates even though freight costs outstripping revenues. Moreover, Post Office also required government carry forms mail, pension checks, reduced rates. Officials state Communications Department say also suspect ulterior motive railroads' actions: struggle dominate thriving mail-order business. Here's competition us railroads delivery parcels, I think decisions made railroads mainly explained competition, Sherekhov said. They blame us carrying commercial cargoes instead mail. The Railways Ministry's spokeswoman, Ms. Pashkova, said commercial cargoes indeed problem, railroads know Post Office already gotten cash transport packages. The railroads still waiting share money, said. In meantime, situation come boil. In late September railroads cut mail service Moscow, effectively decapitating postal system forcing officials draft fleet trucks move letters city. Hundreds empty full rail cars clogged local yards point moving cars position unloading become difficult. At last count, 39 loaded cars awaiting service one yard. And customers getting angry. We've gotten kinds complaints, said Viktor Salikov, deputy Communications Department's mail shipping center. People even coming us, searching mail sent weeks ago.

Once completed, 16-nation space station mass 1 million pounds, longer football field, house seven astronauts cosmonauts. Endeavour's astronauts connected first two building blocks international space station Sunday, creating seven-story tower shuttle cargo bay. It first time Russian-built Zarya control module made-in-America Unity chamber ever touched. It looked perfect and, hopefully, long-lasting fit. We capture Zarya, commander Robert Cabana announced moment two pieces came together. Congratulations crew good ship Endeavour, replied Mission Control. That's terrific. The 240-mile-high construction job began two hours earlier Nancy Currie's capture Zarya (Russian Sunrise) using shuttle robot arm. We're halfway home, Cabana said. Then came hard part: stacking two giant cylinders cargo bay. The two station pieces big  77 feet tip one tip combined mass 70,000 pounds  Currie crewmates rely computerized vision system camera views, rather direct line sight. This first time blind docking ever attempted. Currie positioned solar-winged Zarya, still end shuttle robot arm, several inches directly Unity. It slow going; wanted needed perfect alignment. Once sure it, Cabana fired Endeavour's thrusters, brief burst raised shuttle thereby Unity enough docking mechanisms two station components snap together. The historical moment occurred South Pacific. It took several tries, however, Zarya Unity pulled tightly together. The docking ring would retract properly; Mission Control quickly traced problem attached robot arm asked crew release hold docked Zarya. That trick. The union  intended last station's 15-year lifetime  set stage spacewalk two astronauts Monday attach electrical connectors cables two components. Mission Control thought Sunday's work might take hours longer planned gave six astronauts plenty time tasks. But everything occurred less supposed to, aside piece space junk strayed close. Before beginning final approach Zarya, six astronauts steer clear chunk rocket launched last month California. Mission Control ordered pilots fire shuttle thrusters put extra three miles Endeavour space junk, putting Endeavour total five miles orbiting debris. The smaller gap would probably little close comfort, Mission Control said. The bigger worry, far, Endeavour's pursuit capture Zarya, coupling Unity. The shuttle's 50-foot robot arm never handled object massive 41-foot, 44,000-pound Zarya, power propulsion module launched Kazakstan Nov. 20. It provide necessary electricity steering fledgling space station permanent control module launched next summer. Minutes Zarya's capture, Cabana called two antennas module still undeployed Russian flight controllers feared. The antennas must fully deployed order Zarya's manual docking system work; system needed next summer, officials said. The problem Zarya battery; astronauts took replacement part. The 36-foot, 25,000-pound Unity, first American-made component, serve connecting passageway, vestibule, future modules. It crucial Zarya Unity joined; could connected robot arm, NASA would sent two spacewalking astronauts manually fit together. In all, three spacewalks planned Endeavour's 12-day flight, hook electrical connections two modules install handrails tools future crews. The joined modules released Endeavour work completed. NASA estimates 43 launches 159 spacewalks needed mission assemble entire orbiting complex. Once completed, 16-nation space station mass 1 million pounds, longer football field, house seven astronauts cosmonauts. For second day row, astronauts boarded space shuttle Endeavour Friday liftoff NASA's first space station construction flight. Let's go this, said commander Robert Cabana. Amen, replied launch controller. Rain cloudy skies threat. But NASA confident master alarm Endeavour's cockpit would behave; went 4{ minutes go countdown Thursday, forcing delay. NASA five minutes less day launch Endeavour order meet first space station part, put orbit two weeks ago Russians. The shuttle contains second station component. The master alarm blared red lights flashed shuttle lift early Thursday. By time controllers traced problem momentary drop hydraulic pressure decided press ahead, late  missed cutoff second two. Sure, frustrating, said Bill Readdy, shuttle program director veteran shuttle commander. But things right. We things book, we're going cut corners even means shaving second two. The six astronauts crawled shuttle, two threw hands. Cabana held thumb index finger half-inch apart: We close. The problem confined one Endeavour's three hydraulic pressure units. The pressure dropped long enough trigger alarm, evidently sensitive switch, returned normal. NASA engineers spent day examining problem, found nothing wrong systems confident would reoccur. Endeavour's flight already year late cash crunch Russia, one NASA's partners building international space station. The one-day delay cost NASA $600,000, mostly fuel overtime pay. Aboard Endeavour American-made connecting passageway named Unity. The astronauts use shuttle robot arm capture Russian space station piece attach Unity. Then, two spacewalkers hook electrical connections cables two cylinders, attach handrails tools future crews. Until alarm sounded, looked though weather would problem. Rain clouds moved Atlantic 1{ hours liftoff, drifted away minutes spare. Secretary State Madeleine Albright dignitaries around world gathered drizzle see Endeavour crew off. Here 16 countries cooperating venture future, said Albright, expected back Friday's attempt. This good investment. The planet's daring construction job began Friday shuttle Endeavour carried orbit six astronauts first U.S.-built part international space station expected cost $100 billion. After last-minute alarm shuttle forced postponement early Thursday, launch went flawlessly 3:36 Friday morning, right schedule. The night sky clear, moon full. With roar, Endeavour made fiery ascent briefly turned Florida coastline night day. More five minutes 500 miles later, spaceship's main engines could still seen distance, twinkling like new star. On 12-day flight, Endeavour's astronauts locate Russian part already orbit, grasp shuttle's robot arm attach new U.S. module. Wielding tools hundreds miles Earth, working methodically cold void, astronauts starting five-year assembly likely make construction Pyramids great cathedrals look like child's play. Construction station, research facility, require estimated 160 space walks, which, safety reasons, always done two people. When complete, international space station, dominated solar power arrays, cover area equal two football fields. Modules interconnected laboratories living quarters seven astronauts form habitat equal two 747 jetliners. The station's batteries alone, lined up, would extend half-mile. The project entails high risk, technical difficulty putting together unforgiving environment space, along dangers inherent flying space shuttle construction site. The work complicated international politics worries money. The Russians, whose participation partnership clinched post-Cold War deal five years ago, wild card. Moscow's economic political woes left Western officials unsure ability willingness come share money technology. At time, station's costs rising, critics among scientists worry appetite money consume federal financing. The project's total cost subject debate, credible estimates put price assembly operation decade, station's estimated lifetime, $110 billion. Of that, American taxpayers spend roughly $96 billion, project's 15 foreign partners $14 billion. The station intended grand laboratory where, environment weightlessness, investigators develop new materials new drugs explore physiology's remaining mysteries, part humans may someday know adapt long space flight worlds. Friday, case, little heard project praise. Great show, Endeavour, mission control Houston radioed six astronauts shuttle went orbit. At Florida spaceport, Secretary State Madeleine Albright lauded launching team new venture. That truly, truly fantastic, told team liftoff. And important, added, many nations working together kinds issues 21st century going concerned with. So congratulations you, secretary said. Stupendous work. The main cargo Thursday Unity module, first U.S.-built station part. Small compared giants come three dozen shuttle flights assembly, unit 18 feet long, weighs 13 tons serve connecting hub modules. Saturday, one astronauts, Lt. Col. Nancy Currie Army, shuttle's robot arm hoist Unity payload bay secure Endeavour's docking system, moving unit horizontal vertical position. Then, Sunday, astronauts rendezvous module known Zarya, Sunrise, Russia launched orbit Kazakhstan Nov. 20. Financed United States built Russia, Zarya, 41 feet long, kind tugboat embryonic station, furnishing power propulsion well communication rendezvous abilities. When Endeavour's payload bay within 10 feet Zarya, Colonel Currie reach robot arm pull Russian module position Unity. The mechanical arm never moved anything big. Zarya, completely weightless space, 21 tons mass. If mishandled, crush kill. As Col. Currie holds Zarya steady, Endeavour's commander, Col. Robert Cabana Marine Corps, veteran three space flights, nudge shuttle forward join two station pieces together. When mated special attachments, Zarya Unity form station's first element, 63 feet long 78 feet wide tips solar arrays. Starting Monday, pair space-walking astronauts hook electrical connections data cables units, attach antennas install tools handrails future visitors. The builders Col. Jerry Ross Air Force, 50, Dr. James Newman, 42, physicist. Their series three space walks continue Wednesday end Saturday, Dec. 12. As construction goes outside, astronauts inside Endeavour busy making preparations enter new station connecting tunnel docking system. Next Thursday, crew enter embryonic station first time, installing portable fans lights. Friday enter, prepare arrival 1999 next major element, first one built financed Russia. The astronauts Endeavour pilot, Maj. Frederick Sturckow Marine Corps, mission specialist, Sergei Krikalev Russian Space Agency. After separating new outpost, crew bring Endeavour back Kennedy Space Center Dec. 15, mission length shy 12 days. Gretchen McClain, NASA's director Washington international space station, said interview overall costs actually small individual Americans. Over lifetime, said, annual cost equal pizza soft drink nation's 96 million taxpayers. U.S. costs construction, added, $24 billion, operations year 2012 $10.4 billion, total $34.4 billion. Most experts outside agency consider figure ridiculously low ignores many billions dollars spent early development work well cost numerous shuttle flights, run $800 million apiece. Following series intricate maneuvers skillful use space shuttle Endeavour's robot arm, astronauts Sunday joined first two many segments form international space station. The shuttle crew six snared Russian-made Zarya control module chasing around Earth ever-closing orbits throughout day. Less hour rendezvous 240 miles Earth shortly 6 p.m., Lt. Col. Nancy Currie Army deftly used 50-foot arm grab 40,000-pound cylinder craft passed Russia slowly pull toward shuttle. Seeing Zarya close, Col. Robert Cabana Marines, shuttle commander, confirmed two antennas failed deploy module following launch Kazakhstan Nov. 20. There earlier indications antennas, used later station manually assist spacecraft dockings, extended. Currie took almost two hours painstakingly move Zarya American-made Unity docking port positioned Endeavour's cargo bay. When two pieces aligned within inches one another, Cabana fired small thruster rockets raised shuttle, allowing modules clamp together. The two station pieces, together measuring 77 feet end end combined mass 70,000 pounds, first 100 major components united space next five years form orbiting outpost would weigh almost million pounds span area size two football fields. More 40 additional missions U.S. shuttles Russian rockets used haul components supplies orbit, astronauts nations spend almost 1,800 hours spacewalks assemble entire structure. The spece station expected cost partnership 16 nations $40 billion construct. Bringing pieces together first step mating them. A pair astronauts make three spacewalks week, first Monday, hook electrical communications cables, remove covers, attach handrails perform tasks get modules work one unit. The difficult part Sunday's mating $240 million Zarya $300 million Unity bringing together shuttle caught Russian unit. Currie use Canadian-built robot arm place Zarya top Unity without able see pieces joined. Unity, raised Endeavour's cargo bay Saturday, large blocked Currie's view mating fixtures shuttle's windows. She used views remote cameras computerized vision system built arm estimate relative positions two large segments. The computerized system examined markings modules, computed relationship one another using marks displayed results laptop computer. We've never done anything like before, Currie said flight, adding practiced difficult maneuver 100 times last two years. The flight Endeavour, took Cape Canaveral, Fla., last Friday, gone according plan early Sunday, mission control ordered shuttle change orbit slightly avoid piece space debris. Air Force space debris trackers noted shuttle pass within 1.6 miles spent stage American booster rocket launched last month. Although considered safe distance, shuttle controllers decided widen separation five miles extra precaution. Endeavour astronauts closed Sunday capture first piece international space station, Russian-made Zarya control module connected Unity chamber aboard shuttle. Stacking two giant cylinders 240 miles Earth considered difficult part mission. The job fell Nancy Currie, shuttle crane operator deftly hoisted repositioned Unity cargo bay Saturday. The two station pieces big  77 feet tip one tip combined mass 70,000 pounds  Currie crewmates going rely computerized vision system camera views, rather direct line sight. Such blind docking never attempted before. Mission Control gave astronauts plenty time tasks. The main thing I've tried last two years working flight make sure time. We margin everything, said flight director Bob Castle. Before beginning final approach Zarya  Russian Sunrise  shuttle's six astronauts steer clear chunk rocket launched last month California. Mission Control ordered pilots fire shuttle thrusters put extra three miles Endeavour space junk, putting Endeavour total five miles orbiting debris.

A last-minute alarm forced NASA halt Thursday's launching space shuttle Endeavour, mission start assembling international space station. Another attempt Endeavour crew six astronauts scheduled Friday 3:36 a.m. This first time three years, 19 flights, shuttle countdown stopped spaceship fueled crew aboard craft ready go. The uncommon delay prompted frowns furrowed brows here, although officials stressed entirely warranted. We want err conservative side, Ralph Roe, launch director Kennedy Space Center, said news conference sudden halt countdown 19 seconds liftoff. Everything going smoothly rare nighttime launching, set 3:58 Thursday morning. The weather, forecast iffy, turned fine, sky alight nearly full moon. But length so-called launching window was, planned, unusually short  10 minutes. That brevity result Endeavour's rendezvous space-station part Russia put orbit last month. The show-stopper arose four minutes liftoff computer space shuttle set master alarm. Controllers studied data discovered momentary pressure drop one hydraulic systems control movements shuttle's engines rudder flight surfaces. Officials eventually decided pressure drop insignificant, resolved press ahead. But late: time run one procedures needed keep shuttle's fuel supercold. So countdown aborted 19 seconds blastoff. The six astronauts began emerge shuttle hour later ultimately headed bed rest another attempt early Friday. ","On Friday the shuttle Endeavor carried six astronauts into orbit to start building an international space station.The launch occurred after Russia and U.S. officials agreed not to delay the flight in order to orbit closer to MIR, and after a last-minute alarm forced a postponement.On Sunday astronauts joining the Russian-made Zarya control module cylinder with the American-made module to form a 70,000 pounds mass 77 feet long.NASA estimates 43 more launches and 159 more space walks are needed to assemble the complex.When completed the 16-nation space station will be longer than a football field.It will be used to study adaptation to space flight.","Russia and NASA jointly decided against a Russian cost-cutting proposal to orbit the 2nd space station, a 16-country cooperative project, closer to Mir, citing complexity, risk, and bad sun angles.After 5 years of assembly, the research station will house 7 people.A 12-day shuttle mission will attach the US Unity module to the Russian Zarya, already in orbit.Thursday's launch was delayed by a pressure drop.A 2nd attempt Friday was perfect.Unity was attached to Zarya in a blind docking using cameras and computer images.Electrical and cable connections come next.Unity will serve as a passageway for future modules.Two Zarya antennas failed to deploy.","After discarding a suggested change of orbit, the Russian Space Agency went ahead with plans to launch its Zarya module of the international space station on Nov. 20, 1998.Although delayed for a day, U.S. plans to launch the space shuttle Endeavour carrying the U.S. module Unity and six astronauts were carried out on Dec. 4.The astronauts' job was to connect Unity with the already-orbiting Zarya as the first step in assembling 100 major components of the planned space station.Using the shuttle's 50-foot robot arm, the two modules were joined setting the stage for a spacewalk by two astronauts the next day to attach electrical connectors and cables.","The International Space Station when completed will have a million pound mass and be longer than a football field.It will house up to seven space explorers.The initial assembly of space station components involves linking the US Unity, carried into space by the shuttle Endeavour, with the Russian Zarya.The Russians had asked for a different launch profile in order to be able to transfer equipment from its MIR station, but that was not possible.Endeavour astronauts successfully completed the complicated maneuvers to join the two space objects.NASA estimates that 43 more launches will be required to completely assemble the 16-nation space station."

The exception Italy, cut 4 3.5 percent. It expected drop common rate time euro launched. Unifying interest rate critical step laying groundwork monetary union, analysts generally expected rates settle around level Germany's, 3.3 percent cut, 3 percent. However, interest rate levels become contentious political issue center-left governments Germany France pushing rate cuts help spur growth combat unemployment, stuck 10.9 percent nations adopting euro. The head European Central Bank set monetary policy euro nations, Wim Duisenberg, Thursday suggested governments reform rigid labor markets create jobs, pressure cut rates. The remarks Brussels  cuts made  gave hint rate drop imminent, made clear resistance political pressure strong ever. So strong, fact, Dutch Finance Minister Gerrit Zalm said feared bank would delay decision. What feared that, order prove independence, ECB would go analysis would wait longer, would nonsensical, Zalm said. Hans Tietmeyer, runs German Bundesbank ECB modeled, hinted rate cut designed boost confidence new currency, dampened global economic crises Europe's worsening outlook. The coordinated rate cut could lead reduction current pessimism reduction financial market turbulence, Tietmeyer said. The cuts seemed desired impact. Frankfurt's main index closed 2.1 percent, France's 1.8 percent. The cuts also boosted markets Spain, Belgium, Italy even Britain, among nations launching euro. The reaction is, `Oh good, they're little bit prop euro economy.' But confidence taken quite hit across Europe recently, I think action ECB needed next year, maybe 2.5 percent, James Mitchell, senior London-based strategist Nomura. An economist Banque Bruxelles Lambert, Liesbeth Van de Craen, said cuts timely. We clearly headed slowdown, said. Until recently, Europe's economies held relatively well damage Asia Russia's economic crises unstable financial markets. But two days ago, Duisenberg painted bleakest picture yet Europe's economies, warning growth likely slow 2.5 percent next year earlier expectations 3 percent. The rate cuts may help. By making cheaper borrow money, rate cuts lead investment new businesses, making less worthwhile save inducing people spend. That expands economy. The 11 countries launching euro Austria, Belgium, Ireland, Italy, Finland, France, Germany, Luxembourg, Netherlands, Spain Portugal.

Struggling avoid sidelined Continent-wide equities market promised Europe's soon-to-be-introduced single currency, French authorities said Thursday Paris stock exchange would join alliance London Frankfurt seen precursor pan-European market. The Bourse Paris also announced would play host meeting Nov. 27 nine European exchanges discuss steps conditions needed create unifying competitive pan-European equity market. The two announcements show introduction currency, euro, reshaping Europe's financial landscape, requiring Europeans think Continental rather national terms finance business. And suggested exchange authorities Paris, ruffled announcement July strategic alliance London Stock Exchange Deutsche Borse Frankfurt, abandoned effort set rival market also seeking gain initiative organizing Nov. 27 gathering. Some doubt remained, however, timing technicalities French entry alliance. Foreign Minister Dominique Strauss-Kahn said, Paris joining alliance creation January 1999 joint company. However, officials London Frankfurt  welcomed idea principle  declined say whether timing arrangements far advanced Strauss-Kahn implied. I'm afraid I can't confirm anything like that, spokeswoman London Stock Exchange said. The appearances well ahead reality point, said American banker, spoke condition anonymity. Not that, notion Europe-wide exchange raises technical questions compatibility trading systems also regulations governing stock market operations countries use euro beginning January.

Back economists dourly predicted huge migrations, particularly unskilled laborers moving southern countries prosperous north. Actually, huge industries like steel shrank 1970s '80s, job opportunities working-class Europeans. There 15 countries within European Union, small percentage citizens moved countries, according estimates prepared Eurostat. Those mostly find jobs service industry waiters, maids garbage collectors. There still legal barriers preventing doctors, lawyers academics finding work countries.

Looking process afar, Harold Bloom, member American Academy Arts Letters, said award committee unsettling record selections nationally 'correct' politically 'correct.' The winners list prestigious, concedes, means uniformly lustrous. Absolutely not! Outrageously not, said telephone interview New York. They include kinds fifth-raters. ... James Joyce never got one, heaven's sake. Neither Marcel Proust. Bloom's U.S. favorites include Cormac McCarthy, author Blood Meridian; Philip Roth, author American Pastoral; John Ashbery, best living poet. A review recent winners may foreshadow year's laureate. Seven past 10 men  favor woman? Two past three poets  favor prose writer? Four past 10 wrote English, last three laureates European. In comparison, three Asian writers ever won. Bei Dao personal favorite mine, said Abe Harumasa, editor-in-chief Japanese literary magazine Bungei. The choice could interpreted motivated partly politics, given poet's association China's democracy movement, clear he's wonderful poet. Minoru Takeuchi, professor Chinese literature Japan's prestigious Kyoto University, cited novelists Pa Kin Xie Bing Xin worthy. The latter known portrayals struggles Chinese women. China, translates publishes works many Nobel winners, desperately wants first laureate, added. Spain's Nobel hopes pinned Francisco Ayala, 92, winner year's renowned Prince Asturias prize, said Jose Maria Martinez Cachero, author, university professor secretary jury selected Ayala. Other presumed Latin candidates Peru-born Mario Vargas Llosa, member 200-year-old Royal Spanish Language Academy, Martinez Cachero said, Portugal's Jose Saramago, whose works translated 20 languages. For part, Saramago, 75, said recent Associated Press interview he's weary speculation year, again, might win. Let's get that, said. I write. Jose Saramago, 75-year-old Portuguese writer took literature relatively late life whose richly imaginative novels soon following loyal readers across Europe vocal admirers United States, awarded year's Nobel Prize Literature Thursday Swedish Academy Stockholm. A tall, balding man whose large, tinted glasses often give mien severity, Saramago first Portuguese-language writer  one first card-carrying Communists  become Nobel Literature laureate. He also fourth successive European win prize, Italy's Dario Fo 1997, Poland's Wislawa Szymborska 1996 Ireland's Seamus Heaney 1995. In citation Thursday, Swedish Academy praised Saramago parables sustained imagination, compassion irony continually enables us apprehend elusory reality. Although Saramago discounts influence Latin American magical realism work, novels often use supernatural, allegorical, paradoxical irrational ways addressing complex questions faith existence. Many novels set backdrop political historical events, unwavering concern individual fate gives fiction distinctive voice independent character. His best-known books, published United States, Baltasar Blimunda, The Year Death Ricardo Reis, The Stone Raft The History Siege Lisbon. His latest book available English, Blindness, one characters mysteriously become blind, described symphonic new novel Andrew Miller The New York Times Book Review Sunday. There cynicism conclusions, clear-eyed compassionate acknowledgment things are, quality honestly termed wisdom, Miller, novelist, wrote. We grateful handed us generous measures. Saramago learned award Thursday Frankfurt airport, preparing fly home via Madrid Lanzarote Canary Islands attending Frankfurt Book Fair. Earlier week, participated round-table Portuguese writers topic, Why I still Communist. He immediately returned fair received cheers bouquets roses. I personally happy myself, said. I also happy country. Later told news conference: The Portuguese language wait 100 years this. There ways means protecting language become museum, something alive. The writer's role protect work it. The award also celebrated Lisbon, President Jorge Sampaio described recognition Portuguese culture, local Communist leader, Carlos Carvalho, saw credit party. As member party, noted solemnly, Saramago makes great contribution ideals struggle social change. The laureate's fiction, though, never overtly political. Saramago, whose body work includes poetry, essays, plays journal well 10 novels, unusual emerged major literary figure age 60. His novels since translated 30 languages, selling particularly well Portugal, Brazil, Spain, Italy Germany. While well known United States, novels always critically well received there. For late blooming, though, Saramago long dreamed becoming writer. Born family rural laborers raised Lisbon, forced poverty leave school teen-ager learn trade car mechanic. Yet managed publish small novel age 25. Later, found work Lisbon publishing company, oppressive censorial atmosphere Salazar dictatorship discouraged writing. It Portugal's April 1974 revolution Saramago felt free find voice. A member Portuguese Communist Party since 1969, served editor Lisbon newspaper, Diario de Noticias, 18-month period left looked likely seize power Portugal. But anti-Communist backlash November 1975 forced newspaper began translating French texts Portuguese make ends meet. In late 1970s, also turned novels, publishing three succession 1977, 1978 1980. But 1982, Baltasar Blimunda (Memorial Convento Portuguese), achieved international breakthrough. This rich, multifaceted polysemous text time historical, social individual perspective, Swedish Academy noted Thursday. The insight wealth imagination gives expression characteristic Saramago's work whole. Set 18th-century Portugal Inquisition, book tells baroque efforts war veteran, Baltasar, visionary, Blimunda, escape heavens aboard flying machine powered human wills captured hypersensory Blimunda. This fantastic story takes place real background tortuous construction massive Mafra Convent thousands men held grip Inquisition. When novel published United States 1987, Irving Howe acclaimed brilliant The New York Times Book Review. Mr. Saramago constantly present voice European skepticism, connoisseur ironies, Howe wrote. I think I hear prose echoes Enlightenment sensibility, caustic shrewd. In next novel, The Year Death Ricardo Reis, also homage great Portuguese poet Fernando Pessoa, appears ghost, Saramago sets story early years Salazar dictatorship, tale following romantic sexual misadventures poet-physician. Writing The New York Times, Herbert Mitgang called rare, old-fashioned novel  lyrical, symbolic meditative. Saramago, whose sense literary freedom evident unconventional punctuation conflicting use tenses, sought different form freedom The Stone Raft, imagines confusion unleashed Iberian peninsula suddenly breaks free rest Europe begins drifting toward New World threatens collide Azores. To delight Britons, Gibraltar left behind. Unsurprisingly, bitter satire, The Gospel According Jesus Christ, proved controversial, God shown using innocently human Jesus create religion spawned violence intolerance. When Lisbon jury picked book Portugal's entry 1992 European literary prize, country's conservative government vetoed choice blasphemous. It Saramago decided leave small, crowded apartment Lisbon relative solitude Lanzarote. The History Siege Lisbon, published United States last year, whimsical tale set motion decision humble proofreader publishing house insert word key passage standard history Portugal. With lunatic creative act, Edmund White put The New York Times Book Review, totally derails national saga affirming crusaders fact help liberate 12th-century Lisbon Moorish occupation. White ended July 1997 review prescient remark. Word Saramago overdue Nobel Prize, noted. No candidate better claim lasting recognition novelist. With recent publication Blindness United States, Saramago's latest novel, Todos os Nomes, All Names still awaits translation English. In tradition Andre Gide Julian Green, though, embarked journals. The fourth volume Cadernos de Lanzarote published Lisbon. Saramago receive Nobel Prize, worth equivalent $967,500 year, ceremony Stockholm Dec. 10. Three American pharmacologists awarded Nobel Prize Monday surprising discoveries natural production gas, nitric oxide, mediate wide variety bodily actions. Those include widening blood vessels, helping regulate blood pressure, initiating erections, battling infections, preventing formation blood clots acting signal molecule nervous system. The prize, physiology medicine, went Dr. Robert Furchgott, 82, State University New York Brooklyn; Dr. Louis Ignarro, 57, University California Los Angeles, Dr. Ferid Murad, 62, University Texas Medical School Houston. The announcement significant phase discoveries two Monday's winners meeting 1986 elicited avalanche research activities many different laboratories around world, said Nobel committee Karolinska Institute Stockholm, makes awards. Its citation said research led new treatments treating heart lung diseases, shock impotence. Ignarro discovered principle led use Viagra anti-impotency drug, said Dr. Sten Orrenius, professor toxicology Karolinska Institute. Nitric oxide starts process blood vessels penis widen produce erection. Nitric oxide, chemical relative anesthetic gas nitrous oxide, better known common air pollutant formed nitrogen burns, automobile exhaust fumes. But scientists know distributed widely body. The discoveries honored Monday made largely 1980s time scientists knew bacteria produced nitric oxide think important animals humans. The award committee said first discovery gas act signal molecule organism. The discovery startling nitric oxide totally different known signal molecule unstable converted nitrate nitrite within 10 seconds. Recipients Nobel Prize, including lobbied for years, often profess surprise learning award. This year's winners refreshingly candid. Furchgott said planned sleep late Monday, holiday, awakened 5:30 home Hewlett, N.Y. He said knew previous Nobel prize winners nominated award, still somewhat surprised receive it. I guess I good friends voting, Furchgott said. He said could get back sleep. Murad said pondered odds thought maybe I could win prize, maybe couple years. He described award culmination career said happens, incredible. Ignarro traveling Italy. Dr. Gerald Levey, dean UCLA, said actually anticipated day four years now. The three 1998 winners never worked together, talked lot shop talk meetings, Furchgott said. Dr. Valentin Fuster, president American Heart Association head cardiology Mt. Sinai Hospital Manhattan, said discovery nitric oxide function one important history cardiovascular medicine. Doctors learned prize-winning research heart disease, endothelium, inner lining arteries, makes less nitric oxide. Drugs like nitroglycerine, however, help replenish stores nitric oxide. Now, drug companies trying develop powerful heart drugs based newer knowledge nitric oxide's role signal molecule. Researchers also learned nitric oxide produced endothelium rapidly spreads cell membranes underlying muscle cells arteries. Then shut muscle contractions arteries, thus widening reducing blood pressure. Inhalation nitric oxide gas saved lives people certain lung diseases, particularly infants developed dangerously high pulmonary blood pressure. But regulating amount nitric oxygen inhaled critical much lethal. Nitric oxide plays harmful role collapse circulatory system, shock, resulting overwhelming microbial infections. Bacteria release products cause white blood cells release enormous amounts nitric oxide. As result, blood pressure drops. Scientists trying develop drugs block production nitric oxide infections. White blood cells also play role attacking cancerous cells. The gas also induce type programmed cell death known apoptosis. Scientists studying nitric oxide's effects immune system stop growth cancers. They also exploring nitric oxide's possible role regulating body temperature. Doctors measuring production nitric oxide lungs intestines diagnose number ailments, including asthma colitis, studying role menstruation. Nitric oxide formed nerve cells spreads rapidly directions activate cells vicinity influence many functions, like behavior mobility intestinal tract. Nitric oxide also studied role smell memory. Nitric oxide's role still unfolding; scientists written thousands scientific papers recent years started journal, Nitric Oxide. The Nobel committee cited Furchgott performing 1980 ingenious experiment showed drug, acetylcholine, widened blood vessels inner layer, endothelium, intact. Furchgott concluded blood vessels widen endothelial cells produce signal molecule called EDRF, endothelium-derived relaxing factor, relaxes smooth muscle cells blood vessels. Furchgott's findings led quest identify factor, citation said. (OPTIONAL TRIM CAN BEGIN HERE) The citation refer accident Furchgott's laboratory played major role discoveries. In 1995, Annual Review Pharmacology Toxicology, Furchgott wrote May 5, 1978, first series planned experiments arteries rabbit, technician follow directions correctly. The technician performed one step experiment instead supposed wash drug used earlier phase experiment. Furchgott expected arteries would contract. Instead, relaxed. It first time seen drugs study produce reaction, used insight plan additional experiments. Furchgott omitted technician's name paper another 1996 Journal American Medical Association. On Monday, said David Davidson technician. (OPTIONAL TRIM ENDS HERE) The committee cited Ignarro concluding 1986, brilliant series analyses conducted independently Furchgott, EDRF identical nitric oxide. Furchgott said Ignarro made announcement symposium 1986 Mayo Clinic Rochester, Minn., papers published 1998. Murad cited work conducted years worked University Virginia Charlottesville, Stanford University Palo Alto, Calif., Abbott Laboratories Illinois. Murad said felt fortunate heard Furchgott report early work EDRF 1980. Murad showed gas could regulate important cellular functions studied nitroglycerin related heart drugs led release nitric oxide. (OPTIONAL TRIM CAN BEGIN HERE) In early training Case Western Reserve University Cleveland, Murad worked laboratory Dr. Theodore Rall, also trained another Nobel prize winner, Dr. Alfred Gilman University Texas Southwestern Dallas. Gilman said interview believed Rall, retired living Charlottesville, Va., first scientist trained two Nobel Prize winners. In addition, Rall worked Dr. Earl Sutherland, also Nobel Prize. In early reseach years, Murad worked chemical known cyclic guanosine monophosphate, later turned critical nitric oxide story. Murad's trainees referred early work dumping experiments could laboratory time crudely add various hormones agents slices tissue, cell cultures. It took years develop refined techniques led understanding nitric oxide's many roles body. But many years, scientific community skeptical ability free radical like nitric oxide activate enzyme, Murad said 1996 Furchgott shared Albert Lasker basic medical research award. (OPTIONAL TRIM ENDS HERE) The Nobel Prizes created Alfred Nobel, whose invention dynamite involved use nitroglycerine. The award committee noted odd twist year's award. When Nobel developed chest pain heart disease, said, refused take nitroglycerine doctor prescribed knew caused headache. Nobel dismissed nitroglycerine's benefit relief chest pain. Nobel died 1896. The prize three scientists share worth $938,000. When Alfred Nobel wrote directions establishing literature prize name, chose unclear word scratched letters. Questions prize engaged piqued literary world ever since. A new chapter mystery written Thursday, Swedish Academy announces year's winner world's prestigious prize writers. The prize focuses intense media attention Swedish capital clamor journalists generally drowns question: Why world care much literary choices handful people quiet remote country? Does Nobel Prize really recognize best? When asked question, Swedish Academy permanent secretary Sture Allen smiled said Look list prizewinners! The answer obscures much clarifies. On one hand, Nobel Prize recognized world-renowned writers Isaac Bashevis Singer brought little-known wonders light, Wislawa Szymborska. But prize arguably also honored mediocre, heaping attention would fairly served obscurity. Among winner first prize 1901, Sully Prudhomme. That choice denounced Sweden's leading literary light, August Strindberg, group Swedes sent letter Leo Tolstoy apologizing Academy's slight choosing him. Arguments Academy's choices inevitable, considering instructions given. Nobel's says prize recognize literature works ideal direction. What, exactly, meant ideal** unclear Academy's choices reflected confusion. The Academy chosen interpret word apply works ranging good-hearted charm Szymborska's poetry crushing hopelessness Samuel Beckett's writings. When Nobel wrote word ideal  Swedish idealisk**  superimposed last couple letters previous one. Allen curious understand Nobel's thoughts engaged forensic expert try find earlier letters were. The expert succeeded  point. He found first word Nobel wrote idealirad, word exist. Despite inclarity around edges, Allen said confident Academy's choices bolster Nobel's core idea literature would basis kind progress. About year's choice, say that: Academy bound keep deliberations secret. But observers love speculate might win, even who's shortlist prize, year worth 7.6 million kronor (about dlrs 974,000). Names freuqently come guessing include V.S. Naipaul, China's Bei Dao Pa Kin, American poet John Ashbery, Jose Saramago Portugal. A day winning Nobel Prize literature, Portuguese novelist Jose Saramago insisted delighted win award, could easily gone many Portuguese writers. I'm one deserved it, said first Portuguese-language author obtain prestigious award. There Portuguse authors, like Fernando Pessoa, whose work would justify 1,000 Nobels Speaking packed press coference Madrid, Saramago joked heard prize German air hostess Frankfurt airport waited flight home Spain's Canary Islands. The news left 75-year-old writer choice leave airport return city's book fair meet press public. At moment I moon returning book fair thing I worried whole thing error, said Saramago. Dismissing Vatican paper's disapproval Thursday achievment, Saramago, known atheist, quipped aware Pope among jury, I prize. The Vatican easily upset, said Saramago, I think Vatican keep mind prayers leave people alone. Meanwhile Portugal, Saramago scheduled arrive Tuesday, delight Swedish Academy's award Saramago reflected daily papers, even country's three daily sports papers ample space event. The two leading dailies, Publico Diario de Noticias, gave entire front pages Saramago. Lisbon City Hall rushed posters saying Congratulations Jose Saramago hung around capital night. Saramago born poor, illiterate family Azinhaga, small town near Lisbon. He never finished university continued study part-time supporting metalworker. Nothing life would led one think I'd win Nobel Prize, said Saramago. I born win Nobel. I books I 18. His first novel, published 1947  Terra Pecado, Country Sin  tale peasants moral crisis. For next 18 years, Saramago, communist opposed 41-year conservative dictatorship Antonio Salazar, published travel poetry books worked journalist. He returned fiction Salazar's regime toppled military uprising 1974. Since 1980s, works translated 20 languages. Regarding future, Saramago said book currently working called The Cavern deals modern version myth Plato cave. Three American researchers Monday Nobel Medicine Prize discovering nitric oxide acts signal molecule cardiovascular system, breakthrough applications ranging hardening arteries impotence. The prestigious prize went Robert F. Furchgott, Louis J. Ignarro Ferid Murad. Furchgott pharmacologist State University New York Brooklyn, Ignarro University California-Los Angeles Murad University Texas Medical School Houston. The citation Karolinska Institute said senation simple, common air pollutant (nitric oxide), formed nitrogen burns ... could exert important functions organism.  Because research, know today nitric oxide acts signal molecule nervous system, weapon infections regulator blood pressure. Signal transmission gas produced one cell, penetrates membranes regulates function another cell represents entirely new principle, citation said. Understanding nitric oxide transmits signals sparked research wide range new drugs, including used treatment heart problems, artherosclerosis, shock impotence. The prize amount 7.6 million kronor (dlrs 978,000) divided equally among three. Last year, prize went Stanley B. Prusiner University California San Francisco discovery prions, rogue proteins identified causing Mad Cow Disease. Winners generally known outside medical community, although list laureates contains familiar names including Ivan Pavlov, tuberculosis pioneer Robert Koch, DNA researchers Francis Crick James Watson. Generally, researchers made discoveries sound small paper carry large consequences. Among well-known names receive prize David Baltimore, although shared prize 1975, long becoming one world's visible AIDS researchers. Alan Cormack United States Sir Godfrey Hounsfield may familiar names, prize 1979 term known patients: computer-assisted tomography  CAT scan. The medicine prize second six Nobels announced year.

Palestinians also expressing growing unease naming hawkish former Israeli general Ariel Sharon Netanyahu's foreign minister. Sharon, whose appointment last week widely seen bid keep far-right allies toppling Netanyahu's government, quoted saying would refuse shake hand Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat. It's worrisome, Erekat said. Previously, Palestinian leadership said appointment internal Israeli affair. Monday Jewish holiday immediate Israeli comment summit prospects. However, Israeli newspaper Yediot Aharonot said weekend Netanyahu's hard-line Cabinet, due meet Tuesday, balking agreeing American-authored plan Israeli pullback West Bank. Erekat said Palestinians hope four-day summit, set begin Thursday outside U.S. capital, would mark end long round meetings start implementation accords. It depends Mr. Netanyahu.

Netanyahu sent clear message deluding  betting Israel (to) change anti-peace stand  give illusions, paper said. Lebanon's peace talks Israel also suspended two years pending progress Syrian-Israeli negotiations. The independent An-Nahar newspaper quoted Lebanese Prime Minister Rafik Hariri asking, Does Israeli government really want peace trying delude world? In front page comment, Sahar Baasiri, said The mere announcement (Sharon) lead negotiations (with Arabs) tantamount disaster. Ariel Sharon, hawkish former general tipped Israel's next foreign minister, said interview published Sunday gets job, shake hand Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat. Sharon, opposes ceding West Bank land Palestinians, considered government's No. 2 post. In it, would pivotal figure reaching final peace settlement Palestinians. Even I appointed foreign minister run negotiations, I shake Yasser Arafat's hand, Sharon quoted saying Yediot Ahronot daily. The newspaper said Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu close making decision appointment. Netanyahu acting foreign minister since post vacated January David Levy, moderate opposed Netanyahu's hardline negotiating strategy Palestinians. Sharon's appointment would signal toughening Israel's positions could strain relations Arab neighbors. Sharon general led Israel's 1982 invasion Lebanon, former housing minister strengthened Jewish settlement territories Israel captured Syria, Jordan Egypt 1967 Mideast war. Sharon told Haaretz newspaper would accept foreign minister's job allowed act strengthen country. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu appointed Ariel Sharon, hawkish former defense minister, Israeli foreign minister Friday effort placate far right moves closer turning West Bank land Palestinians. With appointment, Sharon, 70, ardent advocate Jewish settlements West Bank, expected quell domestic opposition concessions Netanyahu supposedly prepared make peace summit conference Washington area next week. For months, Sharon, currently minister national infrastructures, maintained redeploying Israeli troops additional 9 percent West Bank would national disaster. In assuming role foreign minister, however, would forced abandon public opposition Netanyahu's decision withdraw another 13 percent Palestinian territory  even votes accord. Sharon drawn directly issue, since Netanyahu appointed direct final status talks Palestinians, would follow signing interim peace agreement. Last week Sharon told Israeli newspaper that, negotiations not, would never shake hand Yasser Arafat, Palestinian leader, long disdained. Palestinian leaders Israeli leftists divided reactions, similar ways. Some professed aghast, some, like Nabil Sha'ath, Palestinian transportation minister, said willing forget history Sharon's appointment provided Netanyahu political backbone sign deal. In Washington, White House State Department officials pledged work closely Sharon emphasized personnel Israeli government internal affair. Arik Sharon fitting person state Israel position foreign minister, Netanyahu said, using nickname. He brings rich experience, creativity, proven working ability I think well knows wounds damages war well fruits peace. Sharon never hidden beliefs, continued, words influenced way redeployment carried extent. In nod Sharon, Netanyahu decided new location nature reserve would constitute 3 percent West Bank land. It supposed Judean desert near Israel's eastern border, Sharon argued would pose strategic security risk. Instead, decided Thursday nature reserve would instead slopes Hebron hills, much closer existing Jewish settlements. Many Israeli political observers believe Netanyahu eviscerated right-wing opposition appointment, signaling genuinely intends bring home peace agreement. Who right wing Sharon foreign ministry negotiating Palestinians? asked Uzi Benziman, editorial board member newspaper Haaretz author critical biography Sharon. It settlers real hard-liners comprise 15 percent public opinion. So really quite intelligent move, suggesting Netanyahu means business trying get agreement. But Palestinians took news hard, read differently. I think clear-cut message Bibi, Saeb Erekat, lead negotiator Palestinians, said, using Netanyahu's nickname. I imagine people try explain Netanyahu's intentions trying get support right. What trying make peace right wing expense making peace us. It means wants continue path non-negotiations, wants continue prime minister cost. Sharon declined interviewed Friday appointment must still approved Cabinet Tuesday, approval expected. An aide, Raanan Gisin, said Sharon accepted position could stem tide dangerous developments contribute fighting risks facing Israel. A retired general fought every Israeli war, Sharon, 70, leading figure Likud Party done much battle Likud prime minister. At recent party convention, said Netanyahu know right hand left, prime minister dismissed Friday comment made height political arguments. And Netanyahu first formed Cabinet 1996, fact give Sharon senior position caused 11th-hour crisis swearing-in ceremony. Sharon retreated family farm Negev, David Levy, named foreign minister, said would serve unless Sharon given post. Netanyahu created Cabinet job, minister infrastructures, especially Sharon. Levy resigned January lengthy power struggle prime minister, since Netanyahu serving foreign minister. Sharon, member old guard, complicated political past, highlighted string military victories, checkered, many, indirect role, defense minister, Lebanese Christian Phalangist massacre unarmed civilians Sabra Shatila refugee camps Lebanon 1982. Many Israelis, even despise politics, see strong, experienced figure knows mind capable moderate power. Friday afternoon, right-wing political establishment nearly universally applauded appointment. Uzi Landau, Likud hard-liner, said relieved hear confirmed rumor weeks. I feel safe negotiations Minister Sharon directly involved, said Landau, heads Parliament's security foreign affairs committee. Undoubtedly facilitate situation prime minister show right Arik Sharon identified program, therefore live it. Right announcement made, leaders National Religious Party, threatened bring government, changed combative tone. They emerged mollified meetings Netanyahu late Thursday, saying would leave government intact. Still, would connect change heart nomination Sharon. Appointing Sharon political step like much, said Shaul Yahalom, minister transportation leader National Religious Party. But effect see peace agreement. Our concern whether 160 Jewish settlements endangered. The appointment Sharon comes backdrop violence erupted week. Friday, 19-year-old Israeli soldier, Michal Adato, stabbed death Palestinian man got bus hometown, settlement Tomer Jordan Valley. Netanyahu reported received sympathy note Arafat, condemned attack. Also Friday, continuing clashes Palestinian youths soldiers divided city Hebron, 32 Palestinians lightly injured rubber bullets funeral Palestinian protester shot dead Thursday. After Netanyahu made announcement Friday, Israeli reporter introduced question stating Netanyahu diminished political threat right wing appointing Sharon. Are willing sign that? Netanyahu said. I know that. I know one thing dependent vote one two people never know be. He referring razor-thin majority parliament  analysts perceive key motivator appointing Sharon. More anything else, reflects political weakness Netanyahu, said Yaron Ezrahi, leading intellectual critic prime minister. He recognized next redeployment inevitable want seen contributing wave political violence would follow failure. But domestic political power carry big decision own. The New York Times said editorial Saturday, Oct. 10: Just days heading United States critical negotiations Palestinian leaders, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu jolted Middle East peace effort appointment Ariel Sharon Israeli foreign minister. The optimistic reading Sharon, long implacable foe Palestinians, prepared make peace sell Israelis opposed. Unfortunately, also capable wrecking entire peace effort. Much depend whether Netanyahu control strong-willed aide, goal eluded Israeli leaders. Like political typhoon, Sharon roared across Israeli life better three decades brilliant military commander, reckless defense minister ardent conservative, often leaving destruction wake. He still bears burden role massacre hundreds Palestinians Christian militiamen Lebanon 1982. An Israeli inquiry found indirectly responsible killings Sabra Shatila refugee camps. As leader conservative wing Likud party, Sharon help Netanyahu hold together shaky Cabinet potentially decisive negotiations Yasser Arafat, Palestinian leader. That fine Sharon willing play constructive role peace talks himself. But behavior likely first impulse man famously said would never shake hands Arafat. Since Netanyahu designated Sharon chief negotiator, new foreign minister soon opportunity act responsibly. The first order business two sides get together next week outside Washington wrap negotiations withdrawal Israeli forces West Bank coupled security guarantees Palestinians. Sharon show statesmanship helping Netanyahu close deal, even though opposed Israeli settlers whose cause Sharon long championed. Success talks would clear way last difficult negotiations permanent settlement, including shape status Palestinian state future Jerusalem. If Sharon ever hopes overcome shame Sabra Shatila, must become force peace Middle East.

45,"Whether talks Exxon Mobil lead merger business combination, America's economic history already rewritten. In energy businesses like financial services, telecommunications automobiles, global competition technology made unthinkable combinations practical, even necessary. Oil companies like Exxon Corp. Mobil Corp. additional pressure, one unthinkable less two decades ago. Crude oil prices fallen sharply, plunging 40 percent year levels, adjusted inflation, seen since first oil embargo 25 years ago. As such, oil companies, spent years cutting costs, desperate savings order continue operating profitably low prices. Exxon Mobil two largest, strongest competitors emerge nation's famous antitrust case, 1911 breakup John D. Rockefeller's Standard Oil Trust. Now face Royal Dutch/Shell Group larger either them. They also confront British Petroleum PLC made far potent United States agreement summer buy Amoco Corp. $48.2 billion. Industry executives say deals scale inevitable. Executives companies return calls Thursday comment talks, unclear Thursday night outcome might be. But Exxon Mobil agree become one, antitrust regulators likely cautious putting back together much long ago broke apart. Even so, oil industry analysts contend improved efficiency combining giant energy companies would lower costs concentrated ownership gas stations refineries would raise them. The ultimate beneficiary consumer, said Daniel Yergin, chairman Cambridge Energy Research Associates. If Exxon Mobil ultimately combine, costs could prove heaviest energy industry employees. Analysts say 80,000 global employees Exxon, based Irving, Texas, 40,000 Mobil, Fairfax, Va., thousands would likely lose jobs. Exxon, Lee R. Raymond, Mobil, Lucio A. Noto, chief executives preoccupied humbling accommodations low oil prices made necessary. Oil companies everybody's favorite targets trust-busting era early century Arab oil embargoes 1970s. Now seem especially vulnerable demand weakens much world, especially economically troubled Asia, weighing already depressed prices. They're pitiful, helpless giants, said Ronald Chernow, author Titan, biography John D. Rockefeller, Standard Oil's founder. As such, giants compelled continue cutting costs spreading risks huge, expensive international projects needed develop oil reserves needed next century. Mobil, $58.4 billion sales last year, might seem large enough undertake anything. But competing rights develop huge natural gas fields Turkmenistan, former Soviet republic, Mobil unable match Shell's offer build pipeline $1 billion more. Oil companies decided cannot count rebound oil prices revive fortunes time soon. Earlier month, Energy Department predicted collapse Asian demand would continue depress oil prices nearly decade, much $5.50 barrel year 2000. And Thursday, Organization Petroleum Exporting Countries put March decision extending oil production cutbacks prop prices. Moreover, improving technology exploration production opening new regions development added already huge supply oil hand now. In response, many energy companies already begun new wave cutbacks staffs operations. To reduce costs, companies like Mobil forming partnerships stop short full mergers. Two years ago, Mobil agreed combine European refining marketing operations British Petroleum's, resulting annual savings $500 million. Shell Texaco formed refining partnership United States. In face partnerships, said Amy Jaffe, energy analysts James A. Baker III Institute Public Policy Houston, Exxon, compete? Though Mobil Exxon might high concentrations gas stations certain areas United States, analysts say far competition pump oil prices collapsed 1980s. Thousands convenience stores also sell gasoline produced variety refining companies, foreign national oil companies, like Venezuela's, sell supplies acquired companies like Citgo. Under Noto, Mobil hunting ways becoming large lean enough survive. He took lead deal British Petroleum considered buying smaller companies. And made clear corporate personal pride would never block deal. In European agreement British Petroleum, Mobil's red flying horses come fronts many gas stations, green yellow BP logos gone up. As major oil companies team up, said John Hervey, analyst Donaldson Lufkin &AMP; Jenrette, If price right, egos get way. In past, Mobil reportedly talks British Petroleum combinations, well talks Amoco forming American refining venture. The company also interested Conoco Inc. DuPont Co. began looking divest oil gas business. But deals reached. More recently, speculation Wall Street Mobil talking Chevron Corp. British Petroleum purchase Amoco put pressure Noto seek deal, Hervey said. I think whole thing would started British Petroleum pulled trigger, said. The British Petroleum-Amoco deal, progressing quickly since August announcement towards expected $2 billion annual savings, put even companies large Exxon spot. There, Raymond far concentrated making operations efficient finding allies. Though Royal Dutch/Shell's financial resources greater Exxon's, analysts say Exxon still size soundness absorb company Mobil's size. Only largest oil companies afford take advantage today's best opportunities. Finding new fields deep waters coast West Africa Gulf Mexico require platforms costing $1 billion more. Producing oil states former Soviet Union taken time money many investors anticipated. In September, Noto among American executives invited Saudi leader visiting Washington greatly step investments country, too. Noto spent 1977 1985 Saudi Arabia himself, building Mobil operations including huge refinery. But new partnerships Saudis might require Mobil's connections Exxon's capital. Back Standard Oil organized operations state, Exxon Standard Oil New Jersey, Mobil Standard Oil New York. Even Standard Oil monopoly broken up, remained several years building Manhattan. Chernow, Rockefeller biographer, noted two pieces Standard Oil trust already likely united. British Petroleum bought Standard Oil Ohio 1970s, Amoco Standard Oil Indiana. The break-up Standard Oil resulting competition often cited precedent current antitrust action Microsoft. Chernow sees reason allowing Exxon acquisition Mobil go suggest leniency Microsoft. Exxon would obviously larger leading competitors, way Microsoft is, said. In energy business today, added, large dinosaurs stalk particular jungle. The boards Exxon Corp. Mobil Corp. expected meet Tuesday consider possible merger agreement would form world's largest oil company, source close negotiations said Friday. The source, spoke condition anonymity, said prospects good completing agreement. Exxon Mobil confirmed Friday discussing ways combine. They cautioned, however, agreement reached assurance would reach one. The statement sent stock companies surging, suggesting investors believe companies combine. Shares Exxon, biggest U.S. oil company, rose $1.6875, 2.3 percent, $74.375. Shares Mobil, No. 2 U.S. oil company, rose $7.625, 9.7 percent, $86. Some analysts said two giants reached agreement, likely form takeover Exxon Mobil. Exxon far larger financially stronger. Analysts predicted would huge cuts duplicate staff companies, employ 122,700 people. Adam Sieminski, oil analyst BT Alex. Brown, said companies would probably make cuts save $3 billion $5 billion year. Sieminski analysts said Exxon would offer premium 15 20 percent price prior Monday, serious speculation Exxon takeover Mobil first circulated sent Mobil shares sharply. They said transaction would probably exchange Mobil shares Exxon shares. Based Mobil's $75.25 share price week ago, takeover company would worth $70 billion. The merger discussions come backdrop particularly severe pressure Lucio Noto, chairman, president chief executive Mobil, find new reserves oil natural gas keep big projects profitable time deep decline crude oil prices. This one intelligent chief executives business man considerable ability inherited serious structural problems company, said J. Robin West, chairman Petroleum Finance Co., consulting group energy industry based Washington. He said Mobil's prime assets include Arun natural gas field Indonesia, one largest world, contributed one-third Mobil's profits years beginning run down. The field, production since 1977, supplies liquefied natural gas Japan Korea. Although Mobil Noto moved quickly cut costs muscle way promising new areas Kazakhstan, partner joint venture develop huge Tengiz oil field, payoff ventures many years away. Other companies face similar strains. The challenge replace crown jewels grow increasingly competitive environment, West said. Noto shy sitting companies British Petroleum Amoco year see combination made sense. Although Exxon chairman Lee Raymond heads much stronger bigger company Mobil, immune strains global petroleum business. Those strains intensified year Russia's economic collapse raised risks Exxon's extensive exploration venture country. Exxon also follower leader huge projects deep offshore fields, major finds made near West Africa Gulf Mexico. News Exxon Mobil, two giants energy patch, merger talks last week biggest sign yet corporate marriages back vogue. Even combination came light, deal-making fast furious. On Monday alone, $40.4 billion corporate acquisitions either announced declared imminent. Driving resurgence mergers roaring stock market, recognition major corporations getting harder increase revenues internally growing confidence among market players economy plunge recession next year. There also industry-specific issues, like low crude-oil prices driving oil giants one another's arms. But investors, mega-marriages real money made. Rather, among smaller companies, whose still-depressed stock prices luring bigger acquirers stocks near peaks. If Exxon buys Mobil close current prices, deals month total value $140 billion  April's peak $244 billion three times volume September, stock market falling. Which industries likely witness mergers? Tom Burnett, director Merger Insight, institutional investment advisory firm New York, says deals certainty energy, suffering low crude-oil prices. Burnett also says health care executives finding tougher ever lift earnings. But smaller companies may better way play takeover game. Charles LaLoggia, editor Special Situation Investor newsletter Potomac, Md., said: Some premiums high-profile mergers great anymore. The values small-cap stocks. Another reason deals involving smaller-cap candidates less likely incur wrath antitrust regulators. LaLoggia reckons odds picking takeover winners increase investor focuses companies already partially owned another. In energy sector, Houston Exploration qualifies, says; oil gas driller 66 percent owned Keyspan Energy. He also believes deals imminent among drug chains supermarkets. Longs Drug Stores Drug Emporium, says, remain acquisition candidates, though neither controlled another concern. In supermarkets, LaLoggia likes Great Atlantic &AMP; Pacific Tea Co., 55 percent owned Tengelmann Group Germany. Another pick Smart Final, operator warehouse-style stores 55 percent owned U.S. subsidiary Groupe Casino, France's largest supermarket chain. Both A&AMP;P Smart Final trading book value, LaLoggia said. Takeovers typically occur book value. Finally, recommends National Presto Industries, maker housewares electrical appliances, trading near $39, close low year. The company $30 share cash balance sheet, debt dividend yield 5 percent. After last month's announced acquisition Rubbermaid Newell Co., LaLoggia thinks National Presto could find acquirer's cross-hairs.

It shortened trading session, New York Stock Exchange closing 1 p.m., trading volume, 257 million shares, made lightest day year. In bond market, also closed early Thanksgiving weekend, price 30-year Treasury bond rose 11/32, 101 12/32. The bond's yield, moves opposite direction price, fell 5.16 percent 5.18 percent Wednesday. Long-term short-term yields slipped lower week despite new economic data indicated economy stronger third quarter expected seems moving along good pace current quarter. This small recovery face stronger growth probably new inflation numbers show prices check analysts still forecasting economy begin slow next year. Many analysts noted eight-week stock market rally, Nasdaq composite index jumped 42 percent, investors buying even though major financial problems around world  including slumping Asia, weakening Latin America troubled Russia  resolved. Johnson said thought investors, inspired Federal Reserve's three interest rate cuts two months new stimulus package Japan, assume problems solved. Investors looking valley like see, said. But worries financial crisis, began Thailand July 1997 intensified effective default Russia August, go away quickly. It seems every financial crisis, everybody gets impression storm passed, Johnson said. But never easy. Exxon Corp. Mobil Corp. held discussions combining business operations, person involved talks said Wednesday. It unclear Wednesday whether talks continuing. If companies merge, would create largest U.S. company terms revenue. A possible merger reported separately The Financial Times London Bloomberg News. The reported talks Exxon, whose annual revenue exceeds Wal-Mart General Electric, Mobil, No. 2 U.S. oil company, come oil prices sunk lowest almost 12 years. A combined company would bigger Royal Dutch/Shell Group, world's largest oil company revenue. Financial terms discussions could determined Wednesday. Neither Exxon Mobil would comment. Any union would reunite two parts John D. Rockefeller's Standard Oil Trust, broken Supreme Court 1911. Exxon known Standard Oil New Jersey, Mobil consisted two companies: Standard Oil New York Vacuum Oil. Both Exxon, market value $176.7 billion, Mobil, market value $61.1 billion, history fiercely independence. Both already cut back staff made lean order survive long periods oil prices low. But particularly unsettling year oil industry, little prospect crude oil prices recover soon. Consequently, chief executives oil companies swallow pride look suitable partners. This summer, British Petroleum announced $48.2 billion agreement buy Amoco Corp., creating world's third-largest oil company prompting analysts predict even widespread consolidation. It showed megamergers doable, said Adam Sieminski, analyst BT Alex. Brown. He added, however, combination Exxon Mobil would easy match Mobil known proud company said past would want merge. Exxon, added, well run company likes grow businesses. He added heads companies, Lee Raymond, chairman Exxon, based Irving, Texas, Lucio Noto, chairman, president chief executive Mobil, based Fairfax, Va., different personalities. It easy, said combining two far-flung companies, vast networks refineries gas stations overlap United States Europe. If offer enough money make anything happen, added. Both companies pressure find new fields oil help survive long term. Like oil companies, hoped quickly tap vast reserves Russia. Even though prepared spend billions, held back political economic crisis Russia great reluctance Russian officials oil companies give control vast fields. Thus fall back exploration areas deep waters Gulf Mexico West Africa. Such exploration expensive, even large fields found often takes platforms costing $1 billion bring oil production. Oil prices pressure year, falling 40 percent $20-a-barrel level growing inventories petroleum declining Asian demand caused economic crisis there. On Wednesday, crude oil January delivery fell 29 cents, 2.6 percent, $11.86 barrel New York Mercantile Exchange, close 12-year low $11.42 reached June 15. Members Organization Petroleum Exporting Countries oil-producing nations, notably Mexico, tried stem price drops pledges cut back production. But pledges always honored, rallies oil market year proven short-lived. OPEC members Wednesday continued discussion extending production cutbacks, agreement expected early Thursday. In spring, OPEC agreed reduce production 2.6 million barrels day, 3 percent daily world supply 74 million barrels. The main result agreement appears keep oil prices falling $10 barrel. Washington regulators said Wednesday notified Exxon-Mobil discussions. The Federal Trade Commission still reviewing British Petroleum's pending purchase Amoco. An Exxon-Mobil deal would certain receive several months' worth scrutiny commission, would review much industry merger would control. Analysts investment bankers split logic possible merger. Some pointed difficulties companies could face combined. If asked Exxon needed bigger, answer probably no, said Garfield Miller, president Aegis Energy Advisors Corp., small independent investment bank based New York. It hard say anything particular gain. In particular, Miller said, two companies enormous similarities domestic refining marketing businesses. They really overlap quite bit, said. You really wonder benefit redundancy. Another investment banker energy business, speaking condition anonymity, also questioned rationale discussed merger. When look BP-Amoco deal, rationalize it, banker said. But none reasons apply Exxon-Mobil deal. But Amy Jaffe, energy research analyst James A. Baker III Institute Public Policy, said combination two companies would logical, part would give greater influence bidding projects Middle Eastern countries. This deal makes sense, Ms. Jaffe said. With combined company, project would big. In addition, Ms. Jaffe said, merger would provide company new oil gas assets areas world little influence. There lot complimentary assets redundant, said. She said Exxon, example, strong presence Angola, Mobil not. And Mobil significant assets Caspian Sea Nigeria, Exxon weak. Exxon Mobil, nation's two largest oil companies, confirmed Friday discussing possible merger, antitrust lawyers, industry analysts government officials predicted deal would require sale important large pieces new corporate behemoth. Those divestitures would reshape industry already undergoing broad transformation low price oil. But mergers corporate combinations also beginning create new regulatory climate among antitrust officials, one may prove particularly challenging Exxon Mobil. Although companies confirmed discussing possibility merger, person close discussions said boards Exxon Mobil expected meet Tuesday consider agreement. Shares surged New York Stock Exchange. Oil exploration drilling interests would necessarily present antitrust problems Exxon-Mobil merger competition areas brisk. But retailing marketing operations, Exxon-Mobil combination would like Ford merging General Motors, Macy's Gimbels, said Stephen Axinn, antitrust lawyer New York represented Texaco acquisition Getty decade ago. In United States, deal would come purview Federal Trade Commission, Clinton administration examined large corporate mergers vigor seen since 1970s. The agency blocked number proposed mergers, $4 billion combination Staples Office Depot, two largest office supply discounters, two deals involving four largest drug wholesalers. On hand approved big mergers, Boeing's $14 billion acquisition McDonnell Douglas. The agency's analysis Exxon-Mobil combination, senior official said Friday, turn might resemble John D. Rockefeller's Standard Oil trust dismantled Supreme Court 1911. The big antitrust issue whether, merger alliance, able get competition one another backs, particularly background BP-Amoco Shell-Texaco, said Eleanor M. Fox, professor New York University School Law antitrust expert. It may looking consolidation world level looked like consolidation national level 100 years ago. The Federal Trade Commission recently approved significant joint venture Shell Texaco venture agreed sell refinery divest retailing operations Hawaii California. It also considering proposed $54 billion merger British Petroleum Amoco re-examine combination light new talks Exxon Mobil. In past, two mergers involving industry, government considered together deciding deal them, said Terry Calvani, former commissioner Federal Trade Commission whose clients include Chevron. But coming aftermath Shell-Texaco BP-Amoco deals, combination Exxon Mobil, significantly overlapping retail refinery businesses United States Europe, poses questions antitrust officials confronted since 1980s. It's real test case, said Frederick Leuffer, senior energy analyst Bear Stearns. If FTC let one go without major divesting, everything would fair game. Why GM merge Ford? While 1911 breakup Standard Oil viewed Washington officials industry executives ancient history, Exxon Mobil become dominant rivals retailing refining markets, production lubricants petrochemicals. Leuffer said believed divestitures necessary case could large deal-breakers. Other analysts lawyers, disagreeing required divestitures could kill deal, said companies would nonetheless shed significant operations expected challenges raised broad spectrum constituents, including competitors, customers state officials. These absolute obstacles, said John Hervey, analyst Donaldson Lufkin &AMP; Jenrette. In past, two big oil companies merged, aggressive attorneys general states almost always become involved raising questions high visibility local gas station. When state attorney general drives sees four stations corner two Mobil Exxon, certain raise questions, Axinn said. Exxon Mobil significant concentrations retailing marketing concerns Northeast, Southwest West Coast, also big refining operations. Because two companies involved everything exploration shipping refining retailing, meaning deal consumers take months regulators sort out. The regulators examining transaction would dissect business, determine whether market global, national local, determine whether combined entity high concentration business areas. Experts agreed regulators likely permit Exxon Mobil keep exploratory oil production businesses areas already highly competitive merger would result higher prices. Hervey said markets already fragmented combined market share major American European oil companies 17 percent. They downsized, cut back re-engineered. So 900 remaining blue-collar workers Mobil's largest domestic refinery, 1,500 decade ago, heard last week company discussing possible merger Exxon, like siren warning already suspect valve might blow. I think terrible thing, said Dick Mabry, refinery operator, emerged plant's artificial twilight main gate 12-hour shift ended 4:30 Sunday morning. He stopped rub eyes rimmed red, topic bedtime could delayed. It's revival Standard Oil Company. It's going put 20 30 thousand people work. I think Justice Department step stop it. Ernest Lewis, whose overalls bore Big E patch appropriate scale, added uh-huh's. The latest evidence things heading hulked right nearby, said, glancing new power plant likely operated outside company without unions man refinery's generators. But Mobil Corp. sold, Lewis said, noting gains company stock holdings, buyer solid large Exxon Corp. might least evils. If merged Chevron, we'd Moron, added. A growing American economy make billionaire someone unproven idea Internet marketing still sloughing workers older industries, petroleum much any. Those point tote board Beaumont plant's brick headquarters, say shows already handled 171 million barrels 130 million planned full year. But numbers matter even ones like 89.9, 88.9, even 81.9, nearby gas stations  lowest prices, inflation, since Depression. Which Mobil Exxon considering combining world's largest oil company. Some people close talks cautioned deal would considered boards least Tuesday, maybe Wednesday. And why, beginning last Wednesday evening, phone home Jimmy Herrington, president Oil, Chemical Atomic Workers Local 4-243 rang without stop. No, know merger talk television, said Herrington, also works full-time producing lubricants. He asked Mobil managers, meeting earlier month, rumors, said heard nothing. Oil industry analysts say first targets combined company's efforts cut billions dollars annual costs would office staff professionals, like geologists engineers, field. One company's accountants could almost work two. But crews fully expect Exxon buyer would ask yet whether refinery could turn crude oil gasoline, motor oil products even fewer people. Union leaders raise prospect Exxon would sell refinery. Antitrust regulators, say, bound notice Exxon refineries hour's drive one direction three hours other, along Gulf Mexico crescent forms petrochemical industry's home. The Beaumont plant, steaming, humming chemistry set lining Neches River Gulf, become prime provider livelihoods since built almost spray nearby Spindletop gusher. With mounting overtime stretch shift 16 hours more, workers regularly make $55,000 $65,000 year. People go retire there, Herrington said, drove around plant's fenced periphery. Lewis, 17th year, third-generation employee. But nephew laboring exception. The workers streaming plant dawn mostly balding going gray, sign full generation refinery concerned get rid workers attract them. The cutbacks have, far, come attrition, retirements often encouraged incentives. But plywood sheets covering windows of fast food places gas stations around Herrington's union hall advertise best times long gone. His members chafe experts come Wall Street question justification every person's job. In tiring dangerous tasks, question elimination relief laborers favor covering vacations sickness overtime (although like extra pay, say plant become safer years). They complain growing numbers outside contractors taking formerly unionized tasks. But many workers choosing invest least retirement savings Mobil stock, 1990s ethos gaining. Some share credit plant's management efficiency measures agree necessary true job security. Some take attitude every company always sale. They concerned feel it, said Sam Salim, one electrical plant workers whose future uncertain. But fork $60 billion? I'd look over. With Mobil executives saying little possible now, calls Sunday local plant manager company spokesman elicit peep. Union leaders, however, already squawking. I believe creating new monopolies way prop industry, said Robert Wages, former refinery operator union's president, telephone Saturday. Nevertheless, admirable foresight union negotiated clause last November's three-year contract extension guaranteeing company buyer would keep terms. Many members, typically came work high school, already molding oil companies' latest exploits case studies fit rapacious MBA's. They're biggest, said Bobby Whisneant, assistant operator gasoline lubrication oil units, referring Exxon. He coming, early Sunday morning, plant gate whose white canopy seems borrowed self-service station. So go buy second biggest. That's one way get rid competition. I hope something like 80s  buying companies scrapping them. Or something like Robber Baron era century before, said Mabry, another operator. Didn't teachers teach us school Standard Oil Company would never come back? Remember that? said, looking friend, Lewis, Big E, agreement. But I better shut up. I still work Mobil. Used to, Lewis said. Exxon Corp. Mobil Corp. held discussions combining business operations, person involved talks said Wednesday. It unclear Wednesday whether talks continuing.

He added heads companies, Lee Raymond, chairman Exxon, based Irving, Texas, Lucio Noto, chairman, president chief executive Mobil, based Fairfax, Va., different personalities. It easy, said combining two far-flung companies, vast networks refineries gas stations overlap United States Europe. If offer enough money make anything happen, added. Both companies pressure find new fields oil help survive long term. Like oil companies, hoped quickly tap vast reserves Russia. Even though prepared spend billions, held back political economic crisis Russia great reluctance Russian officials oil companies give control vast fields. Thus fall back exploration areas deep waters Gulf Mexico well West Africa parts Asia. Such exploration expensive, even big field discovered, platforms costing $1 billion required bring production. Oil prices pressure year, falling 40 percent $20-a-barrel level growing inventories petroleum declining Asian demand caused economic crisis there. On Wednesday, crude oil January delivery fell 29 cents, 2.6 percent, $11.86 barrel New York Mercantile Exchange, close 12-year low $11.42 reached June 15. Members Organization Petroleum Exporting Countries oil-producing nations, notably Mexico, tried stem price drops pledges cut back production. But pledges always honored, rallies oil market year proven short-lived. OPEC members Wednesday continued discussion extending production cutbacks, agreement expected early Thursday. In spring, OPEC agreed reduce production 2.6 million barrels day, 3 percent daily world supply 74 million barrels. The main result agreement appears keep oil prices falling $10 barrel. Washington regulators said Wednesday notified Exxon-Mobil discussions. The Federal Trade Commission still reviewing British Petroleum's pending purchase Amoco. An Exxon-Mobil deal would certain receive several months' worth scrutiny commission, would review much industry combined company would control. Analysts investment bankers split logic potential deal. Some pointed difficulties companies could face combined. If asked Exxon needed bigger, answer probably no, said Garfield Miller, president Aegis Energy Advisors Corp., small independent investment bank based New York. It hard say anything particular gain. In particular, Miller said, two companies enormous similarities domestic refining marketing businesses. They really overlap quite bit, said. You really wonder benefit redundancy. Another investment banker energy business, speaking condition anonymity, also questioned rationale discussed merger. When look BP-Amoco deal, rationalize it, banker said. But none reasons apply Exxon-Mobil deal. But Amy Jaffe, energy research analyst James A. Baker III Institute Public Policy, said combination two companies would logical, part would give greater influence bidding development projects Middle East. This deal makes sense, Ms. Jaffe said. With combined company, project would big. Ms. Jaffe said proposed deal would provide company assets areas little influence. There lot complementary assets redundant, said. She said Exxon, example, strong presence Angola, Mobil not. And Mobil significant assets Caspian Sea Nigeria, Exxon weak. Times tough oil patch.

","Exxon and Mobil discuss combining business operations.A possible Exxon-Mobil merger would reunite 2 parts of Standard Oil broken up by the Supreme Court in 1911.Low crude oil prices and the high cost of exploration are motives for a merger that would create the world's largest oil company.As Exxon-Mobil merger talks continue, stocks of both companies surge.The merger talks show that corporate mergers are back in vogue.Antitrust lawyers, industry analysts, and government officials say a merger would require divestitures.A Mobil employee worries that a merger would put thousands out of work, but notes that his company's stock would go up.","In a move considered unthinkable a few years ago, Exxon Corp. and Mobile Corp, have entered into negotiations which could result in a merger of the two companies.Such a merger, should it occur, would form the world's largest oil company and the largest U.S. company, placing it above Wal-Mart.The merger, and talks like it among other oil companies, is being prompted By low petroleum prices and high production costs.Talks of a merger have sent the price of stocks of both companies soaring.The merger could prompt anti-trust action and the merging companies would have to divest themselves of some interests.Mobile workers fear a merger will cost them jobs.","Exxon Corp and Mobil Corp are reported to be discussing a business merger.Other oil companies have merged to compensate for low oil prices and increasing costs of oil exploration in more remote areas.The mergers are consistent with a trend in corporate marriages that is changing U.S. economic history.The mergers are pushing stocks up and the Exxon-Mobil merger could benefit consumers and lead to further savings.Some people believe the merger would require selling of large corporate pieces and put thousands out of work.If the companies merge, it would be the largest U.S. company and bigger than the world's largest oil company, Royal Dutch/Shell Group.","Exxon and Mobil consider merger.Partnerships already formed.Oil prices are lowest in 12 years and future exploration will be costly.The new company would be largest in the US and put back together pieces of Standard Oil, a monopoly broken up by courts.Experts mixed on merger's advantages.It would be an anti-trust test, since companies are involved in many facets of the business, require the sale of large units.Refinery workers, others would lose jobs.There is an upswing in corporate mergers, pushed by bull market and recognition that it's hard to increase revenue internally.Merger anticipation sent stocks higher in oil, internet and computers."
46,"The raw passions House Democrats hesitate bellow You resign! You resign! Speaker-elect Robert Livingston called House floor President Clinton quit White House face certain impeachment. Shockingly, stunningly, Livingston that. He quit one breathtaking utterance, flicking trump card onto heap impeachment angst festering eyes debating chamber. In one strategem leading fellow House Republicans, Livingston's decision struck Congress like verbal bomb. Stunned Democrats saw fury vaporized upon instant. They stand, almost staggering feet, join Republicans prolonged, emotional ovation Livingston undeniable self-sacrifice. As stood, Democrats sensed Livingston suddenly closed trap president defenders. For, impeachment issue set move Senate, Livingston, whose marital indiscretions public obvious misery, chose show question political leader's resignation much play tumult-tossed city. I must set example I hope President Clinton follow, Livingston declared, flabbergasting attending impeachment debate nation watching beyond. Livingston walked floor like sheriff bullet-pocked political High Noon, discarding leadership badge wrested earlier speaker-casualty, Newt Gingrich. In corridor beyond, doorman shouted police officer: Livingston resigned! What? What? came reply officer, obviously thought momentous announcement would Clinton's impeachment, Livingston's political self-immolation. Just so, Democrats, already deep bone-raw exhaustion long fight save president, grasped bearings. It surrender developing sexual McCarthyism! declared Rep. Jerrold Nadler, D-N.Y., leading presidential defender trying rally Democrats around argument Livingston resign President Clinton quit fire. But Republicans surging fore strength Livingston's announcement, fighting tears rose salute ultimate political role model grueling impeachment process roared final minutes debate. For longer good enough make mistake, confirm mistake take consequences mistake, said Tom DeLay, Republican whip, hands shaking, eyes tearing addressed House sought drive example Livingston way Pennsylvania Avenue. He understood debate  honor, duty, integrity truth, said DeLay arguing one swift blow, Livingston demonstrated far better speaker Clinton president. With something political elan president showed initiating Iraq attack impeachment loomed, House Republicans, battered public opinion polls, found rocket's red glare own. I hurt deeply beg forgiveness, Livingston told House, nation family announced retreat. Only moments before, Democrats openly hissed man Livingston firmly read judgment upon president: Sir, done great damage nation past year. Presidential resignation order, continued, came shouts You resign! You resign! And Livingston closed circle career, stunned place collective breath disbelief somehow almost threatened reduce dark historic issue House  impeachment president  matter anticlimax. They must succeed, David Bonior, Democratic whip said Republicans given task refocusing day misdeeds president, departure speaker. We debate impeachment distracted that, declared. The way stop vicious cycle, Bonior cried floor, refuse give it, whether Bill Clinton Bob Livingston. But House still reeling frenzied day fateful vote presidency approached notion resignation licked capital city like flame forest. Rejecting last-minute Democratic attempt soften action censure, House Representatives moved impeach President William Jefferson Clinton perjury Saturday call Senate try him, convict remove office. But even vote, Republicans pressed another line attack, demanding Clinton's resignation. Rep. Robert Livingston, nominated speaker last month party, startled House announced would run speaker would resign House 21 years service. He urged president heal wounds created. You, sir, may resign post. Angry Democrats booed shouted, You resign! Livingston continued, I challenge fashion I willing heed words. Apologizing extramarital affairs revealed two days ago, said, I believe I fine job. But I cannot job kind leader I would like current circumstances. Then bolted House chamber, nearly knocking reporters members down. (The House voted 228-206 approve first article impeachment, accusing Clinton committing perjury federal grand jury. The vote announced 1:24 p.m. EST, leaving 42nd president face trial Senate whether removed office.) Clinton rejected advice immediately. His spokesman, Joe Lockhart, said, The president intention resigning. By calling Livingston reconsider, president argued broadly resignation fire. Perhaps speaking cases, Lockhart said, It would wrong give insidious politics personal destruction. Unless Clinton changes course, would second impeachment president 209-year history Republic, first since Andrew Johnson acquitted 1868. Sen. Trent Lott Mississippi, majority leader, insisted bargaining censure prevent starting. But Senate could halt trial later part deal. Considering degree partisanship displayed Saturday, assembling two-thirds majority required Constitution conviction unlikely. Sixty-seven votes would required, 55 Republicans Senate, along 45 Democrats. Four articles impeachment House charged Clinton perjury lying affair Monica Lewinsky federal grand jury Aug. 17. He also charged perjury Paula Jones sexual harassment suit, obstruction justice abuse power. The Republican argument, over, Clinton lied denying sexual relations Ms. Lewinsky. Rep. Dick Armey Texas, majority leader, said, A nation laws cannot ruled person breaks law. Rep. Nancy Johnson Connecticut said: There justice without truth. That profoundly so, perjury matters. Rep. Gerald Kleczka Wisconsin began Democrats' arguments saying, What president wrong, personally morally, acts threaten democracy thus rise level impeachable offenses defined founding fathers Constitution. Rep. Charles Schumer, New York's senator-elect, said: The rule law requires punishment fit crime. Allow us vote censure. Saturday's votes penultimate step serious conflict Congress president since Richard M. Nixon resigned face impeachment certain conviction Aug. 9, 1974. But case spun 1972 break-in Democratic headquarters Watergate complex, one began murky land deal Arkansas 1978. Through efforts Kenneth Starr, independent counsel law enacted wake Watergate, investigation spread examine Clinton's affair White House intern. All year preoccupied capital despite immense disconnect public opinion; since scandal became public January, polls shown public opposed impeachment wanted inquiry brought end. Even Friday night, 13-hour debate, CBS News Poll 548 people showed 38 percent wanted representative vote impeachment; 58 percent wanted vote. The conflict enters uncharted seas, since Nixon resignation cut matter short Johnson trial occurred different America, nuclear weapons cable television public opinion polls. But capital still rife confident speculation. Some guessed, hoped, results recent poll, showed increases support resignation way spare nation trial Ms. Lewinsky Linda Tripp would star witnesses, would weaken Clinton's resolve. Others thought Republicans, seeing dismal numbers polls party's standing United States, would first blink. With majority Senate, power end trial time Senate receives notice impeachment day convenes, Jan. 6, next day. But Clinton focused polls, CBS News survey showed 64 percent still approve handling job president, resignation could almost immediately subject criminal prosecution. And Republicans steadfastly ignored polls year, confronted directly Saturday. Representative J.C. Watts Oklahoma, newly elected chairman Republican caucus, said: What's popular always right. You say polls this. Polls measure changing feelings, steadfast principle. Polls would rejected Ten Commandments. Polls would embraced slavery ridiculed women's rights. You say must draw close. I say must draw line right wrong, tiny fine line executive fountain pen, big fat lead No. 2 pencil. And must every kid America see it. The point whether president prevail, whether truth prevail. Last weekend, Judiciary Committee recommended four articles impeachment, Clinton's side still hoped prevail help 20 30 Republican moderates uncommitted. As week wore on, almost broke president. One not, Rep. Christopher Shays Connecticut, said Saturday: After Judge Starr's report Congress September, presentation Judiciary Committee November, I concluded impeachable offenses proven, proven offenses impeachable. But president's continued failure come grips actions, sincerity arguments members Judiciary Committee sides aisle, change heart conviction members side aisle originally opposed impeachment support it, strong powerful opinion many constituents oppose position wanted president impeached caused rethink position. He added: Yesterday morning, I visited president, I concluded original position correct one, me. I believe impeachable offenses proven, proven offenses impeachable. But Rep. Tom DeLay Texas, led Republican effort force Clinton office, dismissed arguments moral relativism. He began praising Livingston: There greater American mind, least today, Bob Livingston, understood debate about. It honor decency integrity truth; everything honor country. It also debate relativism vs. absolute truth. He continued, The president's defenders said president morally reprehensible, reckless, violated trust American people, lessened esteem office president dishonored office entrusted him,  rise level impeachment. Rep. Jose Serrano New York said, My constituents hate Bill Clinton; love they're praying right moment. You may votes today impeach him, American people. And let tell something, I grew public housing projects South Bronx. I see bunch bullies I see them. The bullies get theirs, going get yours, too. Rep. Henry Hyde Illinois, Judiciary Committee chairman brought charges House floor, said Congress American people needed distinguish private acts infidelity public acts public officials. In Clinton's case, said, House dealing serial violator oath chief law-enforcement officer. He said Senate could innovative creative deciding best punish Clinton, House bound Constitution move ahead articles impeachment. Justice important humble among us, Hyde said. Equal justice law  that's we're fighting for. Democrats, reading Constitution, voiced diametrically opposite conclusions, attacked fairness proceedings culminated Saturday. We're losing track distinction sins crimes, said Rep. Jerrold Nadler, D-N.Y. We're lowering standards impeachment. What president done great dangerous offense republic. Democrats also criticized Republicans impeaching Clinton moment U.S. troops waged war Iraq. Six days Christmas troops battle, lame-duck Congress rushing overthrow commander chief, said Rep. David Bonior Michigan, second-ranking House Democrat. The ghosts Watergate hung House chamber. One Republican cited parallels charges House Judiciary Committee brought Nixon 25 years ago, counts committee brought House floor affirmation Saturday. Nixon cheated. He cheated electoral system, said Rep. Lindsey Graham, South Carolina Republican Judiciary Committee. And now, Graham said, full House voting impeach Clinton believe committed crimes result cheating judicial system. But day's debate firmly rooted Clinton's effort conceal sexual affair Monica Lewinsky. Rep. Bob Barr, Georgia Republican Judiciary Committee one Clinton's fiercest critics, held copies U.S. Criminal Code, Judiciary Committee's report impeachment inquiry and, finally, Constitution, defending decision impeach president. Today, rely three pillars society: law itself, evidence Constitution, said Barr. There joy upholding law, Watts said. If cannot see lawlessness, children cannot recognize it. How tell children honesty best policy demand policy? But Democrats assailed premise Republican majority built impeachment case Clinton. Rep. John Conyers Jr. Michigan, ranking Democrat Judiciary Committee, assailed four articles impeachment, count count, unfounded evidence failing rise impeachment. He saved savage scorn final count, abuse power. The majority simply tried dress perjury counts Watergate abuse-of-power language, Conyers said. Rep. Bob Livingston, confessed colleagues Thursday night had adulterous affairs, stunned House chamber Saturday morning saying impeachment debate President Clinton would serve speaker would quit Congress six months. He urged president follow example quit, too. But White House, calls Clinton's resignation derided Republican strategy, president sent spokesman driveway urge Livingston reconsider resignation. Livingston stood well House served two decades called Clinton resign office rather force trial Senate, drawing boos colleagues cat-calls quit instead. He that. I must set example I hope President Clinton follow, Livingston announced shocked silent chamber act left Republican Party total chaos hours vote impeach Clinton. The decision also left party leaderless eve opening 106th Congress, Republicans must govern one narrowest majorities history. Several Republicans, including Rep. Tom DeLay Texas, majority whip, somberly welcomed news, suggesting relieved excruciating embarrassment. In lauding Livingston's move, DeLay said, He understood debate  honor decency integrity truth, everything honor country. But Democrats said aghast, many  including Clinton  called Livingston reconsider decision. Mr. Livingston's resignation wrong, declared Rep. Jerrold Nadler, D-N.Y. It surrender developing sexual McCarthyism. Are going new test someone wants run public office  ever adulterer? He called country distinguish sins crimes. White House press secretary Joe Lockhart said Clinton disappointed news Livingston's plans wished would reconsider. Lockhart said president firmly believes politics personal destruction town country come end. He reaffirmed Clinton would resign, saying: The president going what's best interest country. It would wrong give insidious politics personal destruction. Livingston's announced resignation stunning disclosure process could result president's removal office. The speaker second line presidency, vice president. Newt Gingrich, outgoing speaker, driven post Republicans lost five seats November election, technically remains speaker Jan. 6, Livingston's election ratified new Congress. But Gingrich removed daily operations House extraordinary session begun dismantle office. Livingston's decision said driven part anger group dozen conservatives party disillusioned withheld news affairs them. They threatened withhold votes election January would formally make speaker. He also concerned pain caused family disclosures, members said. They added that, lost many party, example would set president offering resign post now. DeLay, No. 3 House Republican leadership, expected fill power vacuum least temporarily, deed title, party regroups find new speaker. Many members quickly rallied around Rep. Dennis Hastert Illinois. Hastert, one DeLay's deputy whips well respected among colleagues, promoted candidate majority leader last month, never mounted campaign. Rep. Dick Armey Texas precariously held majority-leader post last month considered likely candidate speaker. He expected manage reorganization, Republican leaders set Jan. 4. Livingston met privately closest advisers Friday impeachment debate unfolded. Some colleagues believed made mistake disclosing Thursday night  House moving divisive debate impeachment  occasion strayed marriage. He told Republican leaders late Thursday afternoon Hustler magazine going expose affairs early next year. Some leaders urged keep quiet, wife, Bonnie, encouraged tell colleagues immediately, despite momentous vote nearing floor. At point Thursday night, Roll Call, newspaper Capitol Hill, reported Web site Livingston going admit affairs going offer resign. In closed-door meeting fellow Republicans, admit affairs made offer step down, receiving three standing ovations instead. Thursday night, Livingston stated would intimidated efforts exploit past. But Friday removed public action night drew closest advisers confidence. His aides said Saturday clue was contemplating, members aware plans. Asked advance word, Rep. J.C. Watts Oklahoma, newly elected member Republican leadership, said: I idea. Asked internal party pressure Livingston resign, Rep. Harold Rogers, R-Ky., said: I know was, added, There members critical it. As leaders tried Saturday hold party together House floor, Republicans stuck prepared scripts floor favor impeaching president. But began expressing anguish. Rep. Henry Hyde, R-Ill., admitted adulterous affair earlier year, said Livingston's resignation: Those us sinners must feel wretched today. Something going repeatedly stopped, confusion private acts infidelity public acts. To much applause, Hyde declared: Congress business intruding private acts. Republicans, indeed Livingston himself, made distinction Clinton's sexual indiscretions Livingston's, saying Clinton lied private acts therefore abused legal system powers. As Livingston said statement Thursday: These indiscretions employees staff I never asked testify oath them. Democrats hoped Livingston's seemingly drastic action would wake House poisoned atmosphere become might prompt Republicans reconsider impeachment Clinton. Rep. Paul Kanjorski, D-Pa., said, We starting offer sacrificial lambs whatever terrible disease is. In stirring speech applauded even Republicans, Rep. Dick Gephardt Missouri, Democratic leader, praised Livingston worthy, good honorable man said resignation grave mistake. It's terrible capitulation negative political forces consuming political system country, Gephardt said, adding events last days showed life imitates farce. We need stop destroying imperfect people unattainable altar public morality, said, urging colleagues step back abyss reject resignation, impeachment vicious self-righteousness. The New York Times said editorial Sunday, Dec. 20: The Republicans' drive partisan impeachment based soley party-line voting power rather sense proportion produced unexpected sideshow resignation Rep. Bob Livingston role future speaker House. Analysts sides struggle President Clinton's future point Livingston's downfall evidence generalized breakdown legislative civility Capitol Hill. Democrats see moral symmetry, depicting Livingston victim sexual puritanism wielding Clinton. But one thing one fall Livingston's invitation use resignation model resolving crisis White House. Livingston's statement rocked Congress, shake foundations somber constitutional process underway. By lying oath, Clinton made necessary House consider impeachment. The evidence convinced Americans president censured, removed office. Livingston allowed GOP partisans block censure House. The result Saturday's expected impeachment vote, Livingston's unexpected announcement, mission Senate remains same. It must resist Republicans want short-circuit constitutional process demands resignation, must use upcoming Senate trial forum finding censure commensurate president's personal dishonesty offenses law. These require stern punishment removal office. In undertaking work, Senate must also reassure American people decisive wisdom core messy-looking political system melted down. In distempered times, shining opportunity Senate. Its members pride Republic's fire wall presidential excess popular partisan passions sometimes seize House Representatives. No one predict whether Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott rise defining challenge career whether surrender mean streak acquired 16 grumpy years minority member House. We would like see Lott reach starring role history. Lott's growling response questions censure encouraging. He may right Constitution requires convene trial, nothing document prevents speedily guiding Senate toward censure negotiations. Indeed, simple majority vote  45 Democrats plus 6 cooperating Republicans  end Senate trial time, clearing way introduction kind censure resolution suggested former Sen. Bob Dole. In intriguing report NBC, Tim Russert described discussions among bipartisan group senators censure would involve form presidential confession, fine joint congressional request Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr prosecute Clinton courts. If Lott refuses allow bipartisan search censure, burden fall upon respected members like Joseph Lieberman Democratic side Orrin Hatch Republicans. Through cooperation, guide Senate toward punishment fixes Clinton history president lied oath, avoids taint partisan vengeance associated House impeachment vote. The Senate's historic reputation prudence requires find appropriate punishment personally weak president damaged rule law, threatened stability government. House Speaker-elect Robert L. Livingston presented fresh note shock impeachment debate President Clinton Thursday night Republican leader forced admit Republican colleagues carried adulterous affairs past. It suddenly come attention individuals working together media investigating personal background effort find indiscretions may exploitable party eve upcoming historic vote impeachment, Livingston declared statement appearing shocked House Republican conference head disclosure surfaced news reports. After hearing admissions closed session, Livingston's colleagues gave standing ovation support said question resigning never arisen. My fate hands, Livingston told Republicans, according lawmakers present. The debate president's fate would go forward, Republicans later insisted, drawing distinctions speaker-elect's revelations sex-and-mendacity scandal put Clinton brink impeachment. The president charged impeachment resolution perjury abuse power attempt hide sexual indiscretions. Democrats offered immediate comment, Republicans braced hear Livingston's admissions alluded debate Friday Democrats decried investigation president basically partisan unfair rummaging sex life. Livingston, saying sought spiritual counseling received forgiveness family, noted several times told reporters campaign become speaker I running speaker, sainthood. He added, There reason words. During 33-year marriage wife, Bonnie, I occasion strayed marriage, nearly cost marriage family, Livingston said brief prepared statement. But attempted draw contrast allegations president, asserting: I want assure everyone indiscretions employees staff I never asked testify oath them. The disclosure speaker-elect's marital infidelities, disclosed Rollcall, Capitol Hill newspaper, sent new jolt uncertainty among lawmakers prepared momentous debate president's admitted misbehavior office whether impeached tried Senate. Rep. Henry Hyde, Republican chairman House Judiciary Committee bring impeachment charges president, previously cited magazine extra-marital affair past. Then, Thursday night, Republicans voiced suspicions Democratic defenders president instigated media investigations effort embarrass Clinton's principal accusers. But proof offered Republicans left conference, facing uncertainties debate already promised bare-knuckled partisanship. Livingston left conference surrounded Capitol police, taking questions waiting reporters. His chief leadership aides immediately rallied support. Some would rather struggle constitutional question continue try twist debate unseemly investigation private lives, said Rep. Dick Armey, Republican majority leader. In report internet Thursday night, Rollcall disclose source made oblique reference Hustler, sex magazine. Larry Flint, publisher Hustler, earlier year advertised offer $1 million bounty information e members Congress guilty sexual indiscretions. It breaks heart we're subject human frailties, said Asa Hutchinson, R-Ark., left conference. This comfortable circumstance anyone, added, insisting president speaker-elect presented two separate issues. We've got duty Constitution. It gotten point drastic action may necessary. You know movies Ebola virus outbreaks, guys sterile suits come in, seal area completely irradiate it? They may Washington. Just eradicate us start scratch. In few, short days managed make terms surreal, bizarre, split-screen America, shocking, runaway train politics personal destruction useless cliches. We longer govern here. We roll around gutter wondering who's next sexual auto-de-fe. On Saturday morning, surreal, shocking, bizarre, split-screen image Bob Livingston, speaker-elect, stepping marital infidelities revealed. We pawns chessboard, Livingston said, asking president resign resigning himself. Livingston's rabid pursuit president, even hoped hide dirty laundry, made avatar hypocrisy capital rotting hypocrisy. On Thursday night, Livingston first confessed sins Republicans hopes keeping hold post, colleagues gave standing ovation. And made surprise announcement Saturday, Republicans gave another ovation stepped deliver encomiums lost speaker. One's self-esteem gets utterly crushed times like this, sighed Henry Hyde, another tormenter president also admit succumbed temptation. Tom DeLay, jagged-edge exterminator may next-up speaker roundelay, choked up, praising greatness Livingston understanding debate relativism versus absolute truth. What could relative Republican hidden lot affairs trying impeach president lying his? Spurred Larry Flynt's bounty sinnuendo, city braced craziness. The Ship Fools reached cruising speed Friday evening, frightening scene Republicans crazed hatred president railroading impeachment even though United States war Iraq, even though House chamber mostly empty, even though Republicans huddled glass house issue sex lies, even though White House still pitching tent planning sleigh rides Winter Wonderland press party Monday. (The White House keeping journalists quarantined outside year, encouraged bring kids. To soak cozy family atmosphere, doubt. Why Republicans obsessed, everyone right mind agrees impeachment outlandishly over-the-top punishment Clinton self-destructive course country? Because genuinely hate president. They think he's dishonest, immoral, issue-stealing, selfish child '60s. They think they're going pay political price this, do, care. It might great time see lot combovers, great time see lot stature. The House debate history. It hideous version The McLaughlin Group. While Republicans tried draw distinction Clinton perjured himself, ignored president lured Starr-Jones attorney team testifying Monica Lewinsky. Ordinarily one would feel sorry Livingston. But Republicans brought sexual doomsday machine focusing single-mindedly Clinton's sex life. The Republicans determined high-tech lynching engaged wacky role reversals. Many Republican hawks argued Bill Clinton bombing Saddam, claiming timing suspicious, even though hammered bombing five weeks ago. In incredibly unseemly display, Trent Lott, majority leader, former Bush national security adviser Brent Scowcroft Bush Secretary State Lawrence Eagleburger chimed attack. There's much hate here. And I hate it. We debate impeachment distracted that, minority whip, Rep. David Bonior, Democrat Michigan, said Saturday's House debate, leaped impossible goal. It would taken kaleidoscopic television screen capture constantly shifting images competing center stage: impeachment, Iraq, resignation Rep. Robert Livingston, response White House. The months leading impeachment President Clinton become series televised anticlimaxes, hours vote made lack drama. There hardly enough shorthand terms split screens cover activity. All networks cable channels carried moment unexpectedly set tone, Livingston, Louisiana Republican, announced debate would become House speaker. The commentators set carry congressional ratification inevitable vote, suddenly plugged-in reporters caught guard. As Tim Russert said Tom Brokaw NBC, Tom, knock us over. In echo chamber television news often becomes, shared mantra weightier early morning. For second time American history president would impeached, went standard line. Yet despite pundits speculating politicians telegraphing every move, one hinted Livingston resignation. The announcement was, Brokaw put it, least partly political ploy, repercussions immediate. Reporters began gathering word Capitol Hill candidates speaker's job, conversation moved next stage political tug war. The Republicans used Livingston's resignation say president resign, too; Democrats immediately countered idea president would stay Livingston well. That led one less-expected split screens day, bad choice. While Congress debating, CNN showed anti-aircraft fire Baghdad one box. In other, Joe Lockhart, Clinton's press secretary, stood White House driveway telling reporters president would like Livingston reconsider decision. There stateliness House television usually offers, one reason purely visual. Keep mind control picture, Dan Rather said CBS, explaining television cameras Congress provided House, individual networks. There way roam zoom reaction shots, political convention. But sense history decorum last long CBS. At noon, vote, CBS went football game, becoming network leave news coverage. CBS' corporate decision try ways meant Rather would break updates Washington. I'll see soon, said signed complete coverage, looking like trouper. But position news anchor day. He later announced impeachment votes split screen football game progress upper part screen. On networks cable channels, vote literally happened background. As TV screens toted numbers electronically-cast vote, members Congress milled around chatted floor. Even brief Democratic walkout motion consider censure defeated thoroughly forecast. As Democrats straggled steps Congress, looked curiously undramatic television, though probably made better still photograph place. And votes progress, jockeying speaker's job heated up. We already presumptive leader, Gwen Ifill NBC News said midafternoon, naming Rep. Dennis Hassert, R-Ill., also cited networks likely candidate. If political military action intruded, might obvious debate House floor sent message vast divisions politics morality, signaling deep cultural fissure crisis opened. The impeachment, said Rep. Tom DeLay, R-Texas, debate relativism vs. absolute truth. Rep. Jerrold Nadler, D-N.Y., contended Congress lost distinction sins crimes, argued sexual McCarthyism become prominent. And backdrop revelations adultery led Livingston's resignation, Rep. Dick Gephardt, minority leader, declared politics personal destruction end. But jabbering political posturing continued, reporters raced cover president's statement impeachment latest briefings Pentagon, little time focus profound cultural message beneath rhetorical flourishes. Bob Livingston, incoming speaker House, took public role Friday debate unfolded whether impeach President Clinton. His previous 24 hours visible month since party nominated speaker perhaps excruciating public career: He spent day chaotic procedural wrangle terms Friday's debate; ended telling Republican colleagues had extramarital affairs 20-year tenure Congress. His disclosure followed investigation Larry Flynt, publisher Hustler, sex magazine, said Friday news conference Beverly Hills, Calif., publication learned Livingston had adulterous affairs last 10 years. Flynt said earlier year wanted expose hypocrisy Washington investigating Clinton October offered $1 million anyone could prove had affairs members Congress. He said Friday larger investigation, published perhaps soon January, would reveal described indiscretions several Republicans. He said connection White House hired investigative firm based Washington made former employees FBI CIA. He would confirm whether firm Terry Lenzner's Investigative Group Inc., done work president's private lawyers. Livingston unavailable reporters Friday. He spent time Friday morning sprawled chair back House chamber, listening debate whether impeach Clinton lying sexual indiscretions. Several colleagues knelt Livingston's knee, whispered patted back. He spent day private office chamber, avoiding gauntlet reporters lay wait House regular office across street. The word aides Navy awarded contracts worth millions dollars ships built Louisiana district Avondale Shipyards. During Friday's debate, handful Democrats made oblique allusions human failures. For example, Rep. John Lewis, D-Ga., said: Let sin cast first stone. Who, among us sinned? But one said Livingston's disclosure mild Democratic attempts exploit would influence votes impeachment. Rather, House floor hallway chitchat, Livingston's conduct seemed last thing either Republicans Democrats wanted talk about. Bob Livingston first-rate human being, said Rep. David Obey, D-Wis., worked closely sparred Livingston Appropriations Committee, interview. I repeat nuns taught St. James long time ago: We would hell lot better looking souls rather trying evaluate somebody else's. None us business even opinion it. Even conservative Republicans seemed ready overlook disclosure. We're going say, `Bob, can't speaker violated vows wife,' said Rep. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C. Like many, including Livingston, Graham distinguished Livingston's conduct Clinton's saying president trampled legal system whereas Livingston's behavior strictly private. Despite Flynt's claims, many Republicans blamed Clinton administration smearing Livingston, although offered evidence. This happening own, said Rep. Dana Rohrabacher, R- Calif. The thing certain uncertainty. The smart money shouts President Clinton never resign, concurs. The smart money argues Senate could muster 67 votes would needed remove wounded president office, would require defection 12 Democrats Republicans stand him. The smart money insists someone cut deal end this. Maybe so. But smarter money whispers, Remember. Remember everyone Washington, including Rep. Henry Hyde, R-Ill., chairman Judiciary Committee, said House would never, ever, treat impeachment partisan issue. Wrong. Remember pundits predicted Democratic losses midterm elections, opposite happened, said impeachment dead. Twice wrong. And remember New Year nation may travel road never traveled before. One president, Andrew Johnson Tennessee, tried Senate, course. But happened different country one 37 states, primitive communications, simple economy based largely agriculture, minimal commitments abroad. In toxic politics century's end Washington, inconceivable become commonplace. The wholly unanticipated announcement Saturday morning Rep. Robert Livingston, R-La., would serve speaker would resign Congress, following equally unanticipated disclosure Thursday night several extramarital affairs, deepened capital's profound sense insecurity. The deadly sweep scythe neo-puritanism appears unstoppable, least moment, Livingston's forthcoming resignation increase pressure president likewise. You've set us example, leader House Republican majority, Rep. Dick Armey Texas, told Livingston Saturday. The example principle comes power. The Democrats made opposite point, arguing Livingston case showed wrong savage people personal pecaddillos. One transcendently important thing remains same: Although surrounded judicial trappings presided chief justice, trials presidents political processes, power residing hands elective politicians. In addition narrow legal issues guilt innocence, weigh considerations party, nation's future, individual political well-being almost anything else care weigh reaching verdict. The longer took, numerous call resignation would probably be. Even Saturday's epochal roll-calls, four ten Americans interviewed latest New York Times/CBS News Poll said thought president step indicted, despite fact large majority voiced disapproval impeachment proceedings. What lies behind seeming contradiction, course, fear Clinton, country him, would incapacitated. No one took Andrew Johnson seriously escaped conviction single vote. But Clinton, man powerful whose whole life series comebacks, already embarked effort show nation's business. Richard Nixon clawed way back respectability leaving White House one thought could; Clinton intends re-establish authority still office. He one great advantage: Two-thirds American public continues voice approval political stewardship, whatever thinks man. The president press hard, despite much-reduced leverage, deal censure. Indeed, fine piece political irony one could ask for, already sought enlist former Sen. Bob Dole, Republican defeated 1996, emissary Senate majority. The numbers unpromising: help six Republicans, 45 Democrats could end trial time pass censure resolution House would surely take up. There enough Republican moderates sometime party-buckers make plausible target. But Republican leader Senate, Trent Lott Mississippi, made unwillingness take president's word plainly evident recent days, determined fight trial-aborting arrangement. It clear Clinton's reputation stained forever, matter Senate does. The spot out. History remember man coveted glowing legacy impresario economic growth, Moses pointed way 21st century, second president ever impeached, first ousted. That harsh word, impeachment, cling name surely Teapot Dome clings Harding's Depression Hoover's. But alone suffered grievous injury political avalanche shaken loose disclosure Clinton's sexual relationship former White House intern, Monica Lewinsky. The Republicans' public support shriveled 40 percent new Times/CBS News poll, lowest level 14 years, could go lower fact impeachment sinks in. Journalists seen many jackals, indifferent whatever personal suffering national angst may cause long get story, none concerned accuracy. In fact, whole political culture 1990s, criminalization political conduct seeming indifference important national international issues, fallen disrepute ordinary Americans. The last week seemed crystallize long-term decline political civility. Republicans called Clinton liar, even committing American pilots skies Iraq, Democrats accused rivals conducting political lynching political coup d'etat. Bipartisanship may biggest victim all. Party lines Saturday's rolls calls held firm leg irons. Almost Republicans opposed impeachment exclusively legal principle least partly special political circumstances  Democratic majority Rep. Constance Morella's district Maryland suburbs Washington, example, gratitude Rep. Peter King, R-N.Y., Clinton's peacemaking Ireland. It hard see emerged reputation enhanced, except perhaps Hillary Rodham Clinton, staunch face deception. If threats dire predictions uttered House Democrats recent days taken face value, nation entering upon Era Bad Feelings, polar opposite second Era Good Feelings, similar 1820s, Clinton hoped preside over. Rep. Tom Sawyer, D-Ohio, compared Clinton Friday Sir Thomas More, executed treason 1535 religious beliefs. He quoted More's words admonition today: What hunted actions thoughts heart. It long road opened. God help statesmen walk road. But amidst loose talk permanent damage institution that, remember: Things change startling speed modern American politics, institutions American government proved extraordinarily resilient. President Nixon, almost universally agreed 1974, weakened American presidency many decades come. Nobody said eight years Ronald Reagan, 15 years later. In end, people meant nothing. Bob Livingston clearer that. His mind minds followers closed. Even bombing continued Iraq Americans coast coast clamoring alternative impeachment, even adulterous past flushed grotesque invasions privacy inevitably followed relentlessly prurient pursuit president, even country began contemplate destructive effects lengthy bitter Senate trial, speaker-designate arrogantly stupidly proclaimed: Let us disregard outside influences. The radicals Hill would hear nothing echoes fanaticism. Impeach! Impeach! And continued even stunning announcement Saturday morning Livingston would quit House. Dismayed partisan stampede, Dick Gephardt, Democratic leader, warned impeachment debate Friday: In effort uphold Constitution, trampling Constitution. David Bonior, Democratic whip, said: This wrong. It unfair. It unjust. At time events world challenges home demand stand united, censure one solution bring us together. To colleagues across aisle, I say let go obsession. Listen American people. But voices reason would heard. Livingston right-wing colleagues, Tom DeLays, Henry Hydes, Bob Barrs, mission destruction would denied. Ordinary Americans could cry wanted. They could protest demonstrate, send faxes E-mails. It matter. The right march democracy run. Rep. Thomas Barrett, Democrat Wisconsin, tried remind Republican colleagues Constitution allow remove president office can't stand him. He was, course, ignored. The Republicans pay huge price brazen, utterly partisan attempt drag president White House defiance of people. The party's contempt voters arrogantly quite adequately summed Alan Simpson, former senator Wyoming, said: The attention span Americans movie coming next month whether quarterly report stock change. If voters dopes Mr. Simpson thinks are, come 2000 everyone forgotten impeachment crisis. But Rep. Robert Menendez, D-N.J., probably closer truth said, I warn colleagues reap bitter harvest unfair partisan seeds sow today. One many strange events past couple weeks way virtually previously undecided Republicans, so-called moderates, surrendered independence lined like lackeys follow right wing's lead. All proclaimed loudly voting principle, fact exercise mass cowardice, exemplified Rep. John McHugh upstate New York. McHugh announced Tuesday would vote impeachment. But decision based principle, odd way expressing it. The Washington Post said McHugh appeared stomach Senate conviction removal president office. Of colleagues Senate, McHugh said, I, one, would accept, even welcome, mercy. In words, let Senate heavy constitutional lifting. McHugh may wished loud mercy, clearly frightened right-wingers House cast compassionate vote himself. The GOP longer conceal party extremists, right-wing absolutists, party step political cultural orientation Americans. Bob Livingston may leaving, arrogant comment still serve party's slogan. Let us disregard outside influences. Let us disregard people. ","During the Clinton impeachment debate in the House, Speaker-elect Bob Livingston declared that he would set an example for the president and resign from Congress over revelations of his marital infidelities.Republican demands that the president also resign were rejected by Democrats who also said that Livingston should not quit and that the Speaker-elect's resignation was, in the words of Jerrold Nadler (D-N.Y), ""a surrender to sexual McCarthyism"".With the House vote to impeach, the president will face a Senate trial, but it is unlikely that 67 members will vote for conviction.The trial could be mercifully shortened, however, by a vote of censure.","As impeachment proceedings in the House approached a climax, House members were stunned by an admission from House Speaker elect Livingston that he was guilty of an adulterous affair.The admission follows disclosures by Hustler published Larry Flynn, who had offered one million dollars to anyone who could provide such information on a House or Senate member.Livingston's admission was met with a standing ovation by House members, as was his subsequent resignation.In resigning, Livingston called on President Clinton to do the same.Political pundits see the whole process as driven by partisan politics.","House Speaker-elect Robert L.

Russian space officials gave first module international space station routine tweak Saturday push higher orbit, convened meeting Earth map future. Flight controllers fired one module's two maneuvering engines raise orbit 230 kilometers (157 miles) space, station's public affairs office said. Russian Space Agency general director Yuri Koptev told reporters maneuver carried great accuracy, 24-ton core module cruising space without problems. The module, called Zarya, Sunrise, lifted Friday Baikonur launchpad Kazakstan initial orbit 200 kilometers (125 miles) Earth. Zarya serve space tugboat early stages international project, providing propulsion, power communications. It fly alone two weeks rendezvous American space shuttle Endeavour, launched Dec. 3 carrying Unity connecting module. The international space station U.S.-led successor Russia's Mir space station, heralded space officials vehicle unprecedented international cooperation space 21st century. The heads space agencies United States, Russia, Japan Canada, along European Space Agency, met Moscow Saturday discuss project, Interfax news agency reported. The space agency heads agreed schedule future meetings holding scientific conference project somewhere Europe, unspecified date. Also Saturday, head Russia's Mission Control, Vladimir Lobachev, quoted saying Russia would take lead role managing international space station first five years. Previously, space officials said station would jointly controlled Moscow Houston, U.S. space agency NASA taking lead role. According Interfax, Lobachev said made sense Russia control project Russian-built Zarya Russian-built service module would perform life support navigational functions station's first five years. Furthermore, Russian engineers experienced job NASA officials aware this, said. The space station expected cost least dlrs 40 billion, United States expected pay dlrs 24 billion. Russia's financing problems delayed initial launch year, critics said station amounts expensive way NASA keep Russia's beleaguered space program alive. The station serve orbital home visiting astronauts cosmonauts least 15 years.

Russian space experts making final preparations Thursday Baikonur rocket base launch first component multibillion dollar international space station year delay. Built Russian company launched atop Russian booster rocket, 24-ton Zarya (Sunrise) control cargo module U.S.-funded component station. It serve space tugboat early stages project, providing propulsion, power communications. The unmanned launch, set 9:40 Moscow time (0640 GMT) Friday Baikonur Kazakhstan, delayed one year mainly cash-strapped Russian space agency's failure complete another part station. After years discussing, planning replanning, launch hardware, Gretchen McClain, deputy associate administrator new station, said news conference earlier week. We ready begin project bring us millennium women men living working space permanently. Russian officials added traditional note superstition. It Russian tradition preface launch ... advance statements. I would like knock wood, rather common Russian tradition, said Alexander Krasnov, deputy chief Russian Space Agency's manned flight department. The station, involving 16 nations United States Russia playing biggest roles, consist 100 elements take 45 assembly flights complete. It due completed 2004. The station weigh 500 tons (more million pounds) expected cost least dlrs 40 billion, United States planning pay dlrs 21 billion. It serve orbital home visiting astronauts cosmonauts 20 years. Zarya fly alone two weeks rendezvous American space shuttle Endeavor, launched Dec. 3 carrying Unity connecting module. The shuttle crew attach two modules together three space walks, using Endeavors robot arm. The 12.4-meter (41.2-feet) Zarya holds 6 tons fuel 16 tanks capable flying independently 430 days. Its control system consists 36 thrusters two large engines major orbital changes. It launched three-stage heavy-lift Proton booster rocket would put Zarya orbit less 10 minutes blastoff. In ensuing days, ground controllers gradually adjust orbit preparation meeting Endeavor. The space station inhabitable early 2000, following launch Russian crew module set blast next July August. Russia repeatedly failed meet deadlines constructing crew module, putting whole project behind schedule. Having lost hope getting promised government funds, Russian space agency sold early research time station NASA dlrs 60 million complete segment. Agency chief Yuri Koptev said taking part new station hope beleaguered Russian space industry, whose funding collapsed since Soviet collapse. The project would allow Russia keep 80,000 jobs next 15 years. Koptev assailed Russian space engineers continue insist money put Russia's battered 12-year old Mir space station extend lifetime instead committing funds new space outpost. The choice determined emotions. Some people glued one thing (Mir) care rest, Koptev said recent news conference. We must proceed understanding would take us future, allow us preserve industry. The Russian Khrunichev company earned dlrs 200 million building Zarya, whose design based earlier Soviet spacecraft, including Mir's six modules. WASHINGTON  NASA Russian Space Agency agreed set aside last-minute Russian request launch international space station orbit closer Mir, officials announced Friday. While putting new station closer Russia's 12-year-old Mir station would make easier transfer equipment supplies old outpost new one, request came late acted on, said Randy Brinkley, NASA's space station program manager. NASA surprised last week Russia's prime station contractor proposed orbital position change two-and-a-half weeks launch first part new station. Delaying Nov. 20 flight 10 hours match orbits would forced similar shifts subsequent assembly flights, resulted potentially unfavorable sun angles solar-powered station, engineers said. We mutually concluded would prudent make changes, Brinkley said news conference held Johnson Space Center Houston. It added technical complexity risks mission justified. The decision, followed frank candid discussions two partners, imposed United States, said. The conclusions mutual, Brinkley said. Both sides concluded make sense. The Russians, struggling find money space program nation economic collapse, said wanted transfer thousands pounds newer equipment scientific instruments Mir economy move. However, critics questioned Russians' motives, wondering requested orbital change part plan delay decommissioning destruction Mir, Russians agreed next summer. The Russians little money United States partners international station fear money spent Mir prevent Russia meeting obligations new project. The Mir competes international space station critical resources funding, Brinkley said. NASA consider ideas salvaging Mir's research equipment use international space station, said, interfere assembling new station. The United States 15 nations plan begin building new station orbit next week Russians launch module supply power propulsion early stages five-year construction period. The space shuttle Endeavor follow Dec. 3 second station part, U.S.-built connecting passageway attaches first module. The first piece international space station orbiting Earth Friday, sprouting antennae unfolding solar power panels awaited segments, eventually grow largest orbital laboratory history. The module, called Zarya Russian term meaning sunrise dawn, took flawless ride space atop three-stage Russian Proton booster rocket lifted 1:40 a.m. Eastern time Baikonur cosmodrome Kazakhstan. The launching witnessed heads space agencies 16 nations sponsoring station, cost least $40 billion build next five years. Zarya, built Russia $240 million United States, joined two weeks first American module, docking hub called Unity. The space shuttle Endeavour take Dec. 3 rendezvous Zarya attach two units. This followed 43 flights American Russian rockets carrying 100 parts assembled space form 900,000-pound research station housing seven astronauts. Daniel Goldin, administrator NASA, said news conference following launching, Now 44 launches go, 1,000 hours space walks countless problems. But partner nations trusting working together, said, international space station going reality. Even new space station coming together, questions continue fate Russia's existing space laboratory, 12-year-old Mir. Because collapse Russian economy, doubts Russia produce enough rockets equipment support projects led Russia promise would abandon Mir destroy station next summer. However, recent weeks Russian officials lobbying find ways extend Mir's life. According report news agency Reuters, President Boris Yeltsin's space adviser, Yevgeny Shaposhnikov, said Friday preparing number proposals extending Mir's life past year 2000. Support options growing recent weeks among Russian space officials, astronauts nationalists, see Mir symbol Russian achievements space. James Van Laak, NASA's deputy manager operations space station, said Friday agency received formal proposals extending Mir's life. NASA would find proposal unacceptable measurable impact international space station, Van Laak said telephone interview Johnson Space Center Houston, No one objection Mir keeping operational Russians find way support projects, demonstrate can. Yuri Koptev, head Russian Space Agency, said launching Zarya, 42,000-pound space tugboat supply power propulsion early stages station construction, needed vindication troubled Russian space program. The Russian space industry alive well perfectly able fulfill commitments international space station, Koptev said. A Russian Proton booster rocket carried first part international space station orbit Friday, heralding start new era international space colonization. Russian space officials others cheered ground control announced capsule separated booster rocket reached first orbit 200 kilometers (125 miles) Earth. Success, shouted one exultant official 10 minutes giant rocket blasted entered orbit. The heads space agencies 16 nations participating project watched lift-off distance 5 kilometers (3 miles). Strategic Rocket Forces troops prepared launch underground bunkers avoid poisoning highly toxic rocket fuel. Russian U.S. officials said launch flawless module performed well initial tests. They cautioned much work remains done get ambitious space station project working. Now 44 launches go, 1,000 hours space walks countless problems, trust mutual respect ... international space station going reality, NASA chief Daniel Goldin told press conference launch. His Russian counterpart, Yuri Koptev, said launch vital vindication troubled Russian space industry, proving could play major role space operations. Today made truly epoch-making step carry project. The Russian space industry alive well perfectly able fulfill commitments international space station, said. The launch went smoothly, rocket soaring cloudy sky central Asian steppes. The huge roar rocket reverberated dozens kilometers (miles) across empty plain around base. The mood launch pad tense launch, space officials workers anxiously making last-minute checks ensure problems. Solar power panels module successfully deployed shortly reached first orbit systems working normally, officials said. The launch Russian cargo module, delayed year, ushers new era cooperation among former space-race rivals. Space officials expressed optimism cooperation would promote world stability following end Cold War. We still contradictions, still combat missiles aimed other, predominant trend state cooperation things together, said Yuri Semyonov Russia's Energia space company. The 12.4-meter (41.2-feet) Zarya, Sunrise, launched three-stage Proton booster rocket. Zarya designed serve space tugboat early stages project, providing propulsion, power communications. Engineers finished final preparations early Friday liftoff 24-ton module. The rocket blasted cloudy skies strong winds, disappeared behind clouds 40 seconds later. The international space station, U.S.-led successor Russia's beleaguered Mir, involves 16 nations due completed 2004. It consist 100 elements take 45 assembly flights complete. Russia's crucial participation hampered country's financial problems. The launch first segment postponed repeatedly, mainly chronically broke Russian space agency afford complete another part station go later. Zarya fly alone two weeks rendezvous American space shuttle Endeavor, launched Dec. 3 carrying Unity connecting module. The space station inhabitable least early 2000, following launch Russian crew module set blast next July August.

Endeavour astronauts closed Sunday capture first piece international space station, Russian-made Zarya control module connected Unity chamber aboard shuttle. Stacking two giant cylinders 240 miles Earth considered difficult part mission. The job fell Nancy Currie, shuttle crane operator deftly hoisted repositioned Unity cargo bay Saturday. The two station pieces big  77 feet tip one tip combined mass 70,000 pounds  Currie crewmates going rely computerized vision system camera views, rather direct line sight. Such blind docking never attempted before. Mission Control gave astronauts plenty time tasks. The main thing I've tried last two years working flight make sure time. We margin everything, said flight director Bob Castle. Before beginning final approach Zarya  Russian Sunrise  shuttle's six astronauts steer clear chunk rocket launched last month California. Mission Control ordered pilots fire shuttle thrusters put extra three miles Endeavour space junk, putting Endeavour total five miles orbiting debris. The smaller gap would probably little close comfort, Mission Control said. The bigger worry, far, Endeavour's pursuit capture Zarya, coupling Unity. The shuttle's 50-foot robot arm never assigned handle object massive 44,000-pound Zarya, power propulsion module launched Kazakhstan Nov. 20. It provide necessary electricity steering fledgling space station permanent control module launched next summer. The 36-foot, 25,000-pound Unity serve connecting passageway, vestibule, future modules. In case Zarya Unity could connected robot arm, two spacewalking astronauts would manually fit together. The astronauts would going anyway Monday attach electrical connectors cables two components. In all, three spacewalks planned Endeavour's 12-day flight. NASA estimates 43 launches 159 spacewalks needed mission assemble entire orbiting complex. Once completed, 16-nation space station mass 1 million pounds, longer football field, house seven astronauts cosmonauts. Two astronauts ventured back another spacewalk Wednesday attach antennas international space station construction nearly 250 miles Earth. For second time week, Jerry Ross James Newman floated hatch shuttle Endeavour work seven-story, 35-ton station taking shape open cargo bay. Their No. 1 priority attach two 100-pound antennas Unity, American-made side space station. Their job, time permitting, trickier: trying open stuck antenna Zarya, Russian-built control module. The planned seven-hour spacewalk nearly difficult crucial Monday night's outing, Ross Newman hooked 40 electrical connections Zarya Unity. The plan called men lug two suitcase-size antennas halfway Unity install opposite sides 36-foot cylinder. Once activated, antennas provide direct, virtually uninterrupted communication link Unity NASA's Mission Control. Otherwise, U.S. flight controllers would rely sporadic coverage provided Russian ground stations. The electronic computer hookups antennas made inside Unity Thursday, entire crew enters orbiting station first time. Other spacewalking chores Ross Newman Wednesday evening included erecting sunshade computer mounted outside Unity. Mission Control decided spacewalk let Newman take crack unjamming Zarya antenna. Flight controllers urged caution. The antenna rolled spool, engineers worried 3-foot strip might pop open enough force hurt got close. Newman 10-foot grappling hook job. The antenna one two failed open properly following Zarya's Nov. 20 launch Kazakstan.

Latin American leaders flew Friday Portugal weekend summit figure shield economies global financial crisis. Not since early 1980s many countries recession, crisis threatens cripple Latin America's developing economies. An early arrival, Cuban President Fidel Castro, described turmoil world financial markets important issue facing world moment. I know coming end world economic order. It interesting know, Cuban leader said hotel press conference shortly arrival annual Ibero-American summit. Emphasizing scale threat, Castro said President Clinton aware South America falls crisis, extended inevitably also United States, heavily involved investments loans region. Jittery investors abruptly pulled cash Latin America devastating effects stock markets currency reserves. The heads state government Latin America, Spain Portugal explore measures ward financial turmoil already devastated Asia Russia. Stock markets also fell Portugal Spain, heavy investors Latin America. The Latin American leaders must gauge need unpopular reforms public finances, including austerity packages risk social unrest political upheaval. A joint declaration signed Sunday ancient port city Douro River northern Portugal. Diplomats said consensus form final statement. The declaration calls international community, Group Seven countries particular, take necessary measures promote stability international financial markets, necessary condition sustained economic growth, said Luis Augusto Castro Neves, Brazilian Foreign Ministry. Latin America's leaders favor creating kind regulatory system global financial transactions would place controls speculators, like measures slow internatioal flow money. They also want reforms allow international financial institutions head crises rather react rescue packages. International institutions must active tackling crises like recent one ... contribute stability, Portuguese Foreign Minister Jaime Gama said. Countries progressive policies penalized, given incentives, Gama added reference Latin American nations' efforts modernize economies. Brazil, continent's largest economy potential bulwark creeping recession, waiting news dlrs 30 billion bailout package International Monetary Fund. The presidents World Bank InterAmerican Development Bank also expected talks. The move U.S. Federal Reserve cut interest rates Thursday revived Latin America's financial markets, analysts expected reprieve short-lived deep concerns continent's economic health. The recent economic troubles stemmed part structural weaknesses Latin American economies. A strike waged state employees Colombia government austerity package offers glimpse trouble could arise tough reforms introduced. Brazil drafting austerity package hit public spending, especially social security. Brazilian officials ended four days meetings representatives International Monetary Fund Tuesday without living public pledge announce concrete measures reduce government deficits. In Washington, Pedro Parente, executive secretary Brazilian Finance Ministry, offered details Brazil's plans raising primary account surplus next three years. With five days go gubernatorial runoffs Sunday, neither President Fernando Henrique Cardoso, Brasilia, said government planned achieve savings. Important allies Cardoso lagging behind three key states, despite government promises, market analysts expect announcement elections. Instead, strategy Brasilia Washington appeared focus reassuring markets work cutting deficit going forward, without providing fodder opponents domestic elections. The discussions continue objective reaching agreement soon detailed program, said joint statement IMF Brazilian Finance Ministry. Because Brazil's enormous deficits, collapse emerging markets hit nation particularly hard, draining foreign currency reserves pushing economy toward recession. Finance officials Washington around world fear collapse Brazil, size links economies, would worsen financial instability throughout hemisphere. With 160 million people, Brazil represents world's ninth-largest economy financial engine Latin America. Throughout day, government officials met Cardoso Brasilia expected fine-tune three-year austerity package Cardoso discuss congressional party leaders Wednesday morning. In Brasilia, officials said among measures considered tax increase financial transactions, three-tenths percent two-tenths percent, extending Fiscal Stabilization Fund, sets aside 20 percent taxes collected presidential discretionary spending. The fund expired 1999. Speaking Washington, Parente said Brazil would aim toward surplus 2.6 percent 1999, 2.8 percent 2000 3 percent 2001. It already announced, end IMF's annual meeting Washington two weeks ago Brazil would reach primary account surplus 2.5 percent 3 percent qualify IMF aid. The primary account covers government expenses, without interest payments debt. Ernest Brown, senior economist Latin America Morgan Stanley Dean Witter, said signs Brazilian government IMF moving closer aid package reassuring, expect much reassurance next week. I call `We pope' scenario, Brown said. You're going hear pope, maybe see white smoke rising, said, figure pope elections. The United States preparing commit U.S. taxpayer funds part lending program least $30 billion try insulate Brazil, rest Latin America, worst effects financial turmoil circling globe, according U.S. foreign officials assembling program. Details U.S. contribution, expected total several billion dollars direct aid loan guarantees, yet negotiated. But several congressional leaders alerted likelihood administration would act Congress recess. This early warning administration reflects memories Congress erupted objections hearings 1995 President Clinton committed $20 billion U.S. funds bailout Mexico. But administration officials said last week early soundings indicate members Congress deeply concerned preventing economic collapse Latin America would resound United States, thus expect objections. The timing aid package Brazil  originally expected within next days  complicated unexpected delays cropped dealing Brazilian government. The government President Fernando Henrique Cardoso faces politically risky gubernatorial elections Sunday, may well determine whether Brazil execute austerity program key condition loans concurrently negotiating International Monetary Fund. The biggest role rescue program Brazil taken International Monetary Fund, said last week would contribute least $15 billion  appears pressure United States even more. Another $9 billion come World Bank Inter-American Development Bank, remainder United States major industrial nations. Germany Japan, though, reluctant take part, one U.S. official noted, suggesting Latin America chiefly Washington's problem, own. So far, U.S. officials working behind scenes organize aid package said nothing public details plans direct contribution Brazil. Brazil important economic well-being region, United States international community, us much focused seeing helpful, Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin said Friday. But wide-ranging interview global economic turmoil, Rubin declined say strategy would pursue dealing Brazil's problems insisted decisions made United States might contribute. But discussed Brazil opportunity engage kind preventive financial diplomacy President Clinton advocated speeches IMF World Bank three weeks ago. At time, Clinton argued monetary fund provide contingent finance help countries ward global financial contagion rather wait disaster strike. Direct U.S. aid Brazil would clearly send symbolic message: year trying manage financial crisis monetary fund, United States ready put limited amount capital risk prevent havoc  Brazil stop chaos spreading Argentina, Mexico countries major U.S. trading partners. That would change strategy. So far, United States operated almost entirely international financial institutions, chiefly IMF But would also risky move President Clinton, economically politically. Even though Congress objected $20 billion U.S. funds committed bailout Mexico, turned $12 billion ultimately needed, since paid back, interest. But Rubin noted Friday different environment now. Other administration officials say believe would objections Congress direct U.S. participation Brazil bailout. I think lot people Congress scared death what's happening markets, could happen districts, White House official said last week, say much long vote it. By acting soon stabilize Latin America, administration hoping capitalize two weeks relative calm late-summer panic engulfed Russia and, height, led outflow billion dollars day Brazil, fear would next country forced devalue currency. Whether calm marks beginning turnaround another pause wildfires erupted since Thailand's currency crisis July 1997 matter considerable debate. But many experts cite confluence several events reassured jittery investors around world: two successive interest-rate cuts United States, Japan's long-delayed move prop banking system $500 billion taxpayer funds, steady strengthening currencies Thailand, Indonesia South Korea, first signs investors may preparing return. Always circumspect comes commenting publicly markets, Rubin acknowledged last several weeks number significant, positive developments. But former trader, burned 26-year career many false market rallies, warned serious issues remain take time world work way repeatedly called serious international financial disruption last 50 years. In fact, Rubin's aides clearly nervous possibility another outbreak could set new round panic, made virtually impossible many emerging-market countries borrow money world markets. Brazil Japan two obvious tinderboxes, said Jeffrey Garten, dean Yale School Management, served undersecretary commerce international affairs Clinton's first term. In Brazil, issue whether package coming together really big enough deal exploding debt problem. And Japan question whether real reform goes along money. But spending 18 months negotiations Japanese, Rubin clearly senses United States little leverage Tokyo; problems chiefly rooted political gridlock, lack resources. In Brazil, though, United States better chance buying time influencing economic reform program, long appear dictating terms publicly Cardoso team. But demonstrating economic support probably require tapping Exchange Stabilization Fund, created Roosevelt administration help stabilize dollar. The money Rubin's control, presidential approval, reached circumvent congressional objections aiding Mexico 1995. But reaction strong  time Congress restricted tapping fund international bailouts  Rubin extraordinarily cautious ever since. He committed $3 billion second line defense emergency aid programs Indonesia South Korea last year, money ultimately dispersed either country. U.S. officials said South Korea need extra help, collapse Suharto government Indonesia changed political scene would risky offer direct U.S. aid. In bailout Russia  whose economy collapsed President Boris Yeltsin abandoned agreement reform economy dismissed leading reformers  United States offered direct help. Those events set panicked exit investors emerging markets, greatly worsened Brazil's troubles. So far, Brazilian officials successfully calmed market constantly talking forthcoming aid program IMF, convincing speculators would dangerous bet country. But time, Brazilian officials maintained pose really need cash  certainly hurry get it. U.S. officials top officials IMF clearly nervous, worried longer negotiations drag on, greater risk Brazil caught another round market turmoil. The Brazilians want everyone think control, said investment banker involved talks. But fact there's still real risk sometime next 18 months government going forced devalue currency, pegged dollar, adjusts 7.5 percent year carefully controlled fall. To prevent sudden devaluation, Brazilian government raise interest rates 50 percent, choking credit companies. Meanwhile, country slipping recession. The aid would buy time Brazilians, contingent Cardoso's success persuading legislature end huge deficits, chiefly unpopular cuts social spending. The first deputy managing director International Monetary Fund, Stanley Fischer, spent Friday Brazil review country's austerity plan, expected announced Sunday's elections international package, avoid appearance global lender dictating conditions Brazil. Brazil lot, Fischer said last week leaving trip. In return, I expect international community make large contribution. Leaders 19 Latin American nations, Spain Portugal put finishing touches Saturday Ibero-American summit declaration warning global recession unless action taken stabilize international financial system. The draft declaration said recent financial market turmoil shows adjustments must made quickly keep difficulties affecting becoming crisis all. The declaration addresses world's seven richest nations. The Group Seven composed United States, Japan, Britain, Germany, France, Italy Canada.

One senior administration official deals economic issues, speaking condition anonymity, said Tuesday internal projections suggest trade deficit 1999 could reach $300 billion, figure said certainly cut growth, could well become major political problem. Trade deficits carry good troubling signals economy. The current flood imports helping contain inflation lowest levels decades.

But said North risks closing door cooperation refuses U.S. inspection site. It raises strong suspicion, Clinton said joint news conference Kim Blue House, presidential mansion overlooking capital. We need access it. The foundation U.S. efforts ease North Korea's decades-long hostility toward South 1994 agreed framework North halted nuclear weapons program exchange Western commitment build modern nuclear energy sources there. That deal would shattered suspect site turned clandestine nuclear project. And that, turn, would jeopardize preliminary North-South peace talks could produce treaty replace shaky armistice ended Korean War 1953. Kim, moved South Korea sunshine policy engaging North Korea cultural economic fronts, firmly said government supports Clinton nuclear issue. We must require full access ways ascertain nature purposes construction site, Kim said. If is, fact, proven nuclear related, demand immediate close down. He also said North must limit missile development, citing great shock Japan North Koreans test-fired missile way Aug. 31. In dinner toast, Kim said despite tensions, North Korea cautiously noticeably taking measures increase interaction cooperation South North. And Clinton saluted Seoul's battle Asia's economic woes. I believe Asia emerge present crisis prosperous, stable, democratic  thanks small measure Korea's example. After state dinner, Clinton made surprise late-night stop concert Sejong Culture Center younger brother, Roger, band performing. The president listened songs stage brother introduced president special person. The audience 2,000 people stood applauded.

Last week Clinton named former Defense Secretary William Perry review U.S. policy toward North Korea. Administration officials say Perry asked study ways salvage 1994 nuclear agreement North Korea, among administration's proudest achievements foreign policy. North Korean news media Thursday said communist nation's military full alert war United States dispute nuclear inspections comes blows. The North's official Korean Central News Agency reported North Korean soldiers people walks life full alert war. North Korea typically sends belligerent rhetoric, especially enters high-stake talks Washington. The United States North Korea set resume talks Friday inspections underground North Korean site suspected used produce nuclear weapons. KCNA broadcasts brimmed anti-American saber-rattling. Our People's Army blow U.S. territory whole United States starts war divided Korean Peninsula, Vice Defense Minister Jong Chang Ryol quoted saying Thursday. The general staff North Korean military accused Washington Wednesday pushing situation Korea brink war demanding inspections talks aimed preventing Pyongyang developing nuclear weapons long-range missiles. Under prevailing touch-and-go situation, Korean People's Army bracing fight U.S. imperialist aggressors, KCNA quoted Jong saying. The agency also quoted various party officials, plant managers, even museum curators pledging thousandfold revenge vowing arm spirit human bombs suicidal attack. Washington demands unconditional inspections North's underground project. But North Korea asked Washington pay dlrs 300 million right inspect site. Concerns North Korea developing long-range missiles capable striking Japan parts United States escalated North Korea fired rocket Aug. 31. Believed test Taepo Dong missile, rocket flew Japan landed Pacific Ocean. The North's 1.1 million-strong military world's fifth largest. It forms backbone North Korean government, leader Kim Jong Il ruling country head military. A congressman visited remote parts North Korea last week said Saturday food health situation desperate deteriorating, millions North Koreans might starved death last years. The congressman, Tony Hall, D-Ohio, longtime interest world hunger, passed Tokyo return United States showed photographs taken North Korean children patchy hair, protruding bones, open sores signs severe malnutrition. Hall also brought back bag officials called substitute food distributed government food station: dried leaves straw, coarse even cattle would normally turn away. They grind powder make noodles, Hall said. The noodles nutrition indigestible, leaving people holding aching stomachs, said. North Korea admitted facing serious economic difficulties, sharply diverging assessments serious are. Some visitors United Nations organizations said food situation seems bit better year two ago. Hall said divergence might arisen North Korean capital, Pyongyang, life seem slightly better three previous trips North Korea. But rural areas foreigners often allowed visit, added, overall situation worse ever. Based visits four hospitals, Hall also emphasized public health care declined sharply. In one hospital, assistants holding patient surgeons conducted stomach operation without electric lights anesthesia. Ordinary North Koreans suffering, part, government's hard-line policies alienated would-be donors aid agencies. The United Nations repeatedly appealed relief aid North Korea, latest appeal raised less one-third target. In September, Doctors Without Borders announced pulling staff 13 North Korea feared aid going politically connected rather needy. North Korea release mortality figures health statistics, Hall said United Nations gathered would soon release data indicating 30 percent North Korean children age 2 acutely malnourished 67 percent children physically stunted. Hall said thought overall least 1 million people died total probably closer 3 million. In indication seriousness professional demographers view situation, U.S. Bureau Census recently published estimates suggesting North Korea's population peaked 1995 21.55 million since fallen 21.23 million year. That would decline 320,000 three years, period North Korea's population would expected grow 925,000 people, based population growth rate early 1990s. Nicholas Eberstadt, American specialist North Korean population figures, says simply enough hard information estimate death toll famine. But notes one political tidbit: North Korea's constitution stipulates one delegate country's people's assembly every 30,000 citizens. This year's assembly expand previous ones did, rather 687 delegates, previous assembly held 1990. While Eberstadt counsels caution, could mean North Korea's population, eight years expected add several million people, back 20.6 million people fewer. The United States supplying grain North Korea, strains growing secret underground complex North experts worry may heart new nuclear weapons program. The United States warned last week agreed framework basis relations North Korea jeopardy unless North lets American experts visit underground complex resolve doubts. North Korea said show complex Washington promises complex nuclear one, pay vilifying us impairing prestige. Washington refuses pay, North Korea warning standoff could lead agreement fall apart. Their shameless wicked demand open infringement upon sovereignty wanton interference internal affairs, declared North Korea's leading newspaper, Rodong Sinmun. A South Korean lawmaker said Friday communist North Korea could producing plutonium could secret underground nuclear facilities already feared. Without naming source, Rep. Kim Deog-ryong Parliament's Foreign Affairs Committee said information two underground facilities captured U.S. spy satellite photos may nuclear plants. He said Parliament session one believed already producing plutonium would able produce enough 10 nuclear bombs starting around 2004. If true, assertion paints worse picture suspected North Korean nuclear activity already made public. Kim said asked government's Unification Ministry issue earlier week suspicious answer. It sufficient sincere, I came suspect government trying hide truth, Kim said seven-page press release. U.S. South Korean officials said August detected huge underground construction site mountainside 40 kilometers (25 miles) northeast Yongbyon, country's main nuclear complex. The United States said suspects construction nuclear-related, though evidence. North Korea denied it. Kim, lawmaker main opposition Grand National Party, said may actually two underground facilities far Yongbyon complex. It activity Yongbyon prompted United States negotiate 1994 accord promising development two light-water reactors fuel-oil shipments North Korea would halt nuclear weapons development. At time, North Korea believed made enough plutonium one two atomic bombs. The Yongbyon complex, houses 500-megawatt laboratory nuclear reactor, frozen 1994 accord. Kim said Friday one new facility already operating construction operational four six years. We estimate reactor go on-line 2002 2003, enabling production enough plutonium build one nuclear weapon within six 12 months, Kim said. North Korea would able make sufficient plutonium make eight 10 nuclear weapons every year that. North Korea said underground construction civilian use nuclear-related. It offered open facility U.S. inspectors, says Washington must pay compensation facility proven civilian use. President Clinton made unusual, direct appeal North Korea Saturday set aside nuclear ambitions favor strengthening ties South Korea United States. The appeal came meeting reporters also counseled patience Iraq's refusal comply request weapons inspectors. I think important overreact first day, Clinton said response reports Iraq balked request U.N. inspectors documents weapons program. But, speaking joint appearance South Korean President Kim Dae Jung, Clinton called requested documents quite important said Iraq affirmative obligations help weapons inspectors. Aides Clinton denied comments represented softening toward Iraq. They said situation still developing president preparing meetings Kim briefed detail Iraq's resistance appeared reporters Saturday. National Security Adviser Sandy Berger said administration consulting members U.N. Security Council matter. If Iraq fails meet obligations U.N. resolutions, said, We obviously prepared act. Last weekend, Clinton called strike Iraq minutes begin, delayed departure Asia monitor crisis said U.S. forces remained poised strike Iraq reneged agreement let U.N. weapons inspectors work. In appearance Kim, president addressed handful questions ranged North Korea Indonesia whether Congress punish Lewinsky scandal. Before leaving Washington five-day trip Japan, Korea Guam, drew parallel governments Iraq North Korea, saying, We must less concerned North Korea's weapons activities. The Clinton administration urgently seeking inspect vast construction site North Korea believes may beginnings nuclear weapons plant. Saturday, Clinton called site, together North Korea's test firing August missile Japan, cause deep concern. But Clinton administration trying different approach toward North Korea toward Iraq, partly urging Kim, pursuing sunshine policy engagement North. As Clinton Kim delivered prepared statements answered questions Saturday, Clinton became animated describing called beautiful picture happened spot turning hotel television arriving Seoul Friday night: film cruise ship recently permitted carry South Koreans tour North. I ask North Koreans think this, said, arguing Kim's policy engagement North presented great opportunity. Nothing could ever put hole ground would give North Koreans much advantage, much power, much wealth, much happiness ships going full people here. The Clinton administration fears construction site may evidence North Korea abandoned 1994 pledge United States give nuclear weapons program exchange billions dollars aid. The North Koreans denied complex intended help build nuclear weapons. But demanded United States pay $300 million inspect it, request rejected week U.S. delegation Pyongyang, North Korean capital. The new complex built mountainside 25 miles northeast Yongbyon, former North Korean nuclear research center. Kim continued Saturday emphasize hopes new opening toward North Korea. But said, We tolerate possible attempt North Korea proliferate nuclear weapons, missiles weapons mass destruction. The Clinton administration plans resume negotiating North Korea inspecting site December. In addition strategies easing Asian financial crisis, Clinton discussed North Korea visit Tokyo Thursday Friday. The subject North Korea consumed two hours meetings Kim Saturday Blue House, contains Korean president's office home. The administration criticized Congress region letting policy North Korea drift, Clinton called policy clear-eyed mix diplomacy deterrence. He said far 1994 agreement worked, without North Korea already would produced sizable amount weapons-grade plutonium. Under pressure congressional critics, Clinton last week appointed William Perry, former defense secretary, review policy North Korea. On matters, Clinton declined criticize government Indonesia using force crack protesters there, saying enough facts moment give right answer. But said hoped would backsliding Indonesia. Clinton followed appearance Kim visit National Folk Museum here, conducted hourlong conversation six Korean academics, businessmen union leaders troubled state Korea's economy impact society. He attended state dinner Saturday night, stopping concert brother, Roger, musician, happened performing. Clinton repeatedly congratulated Kim efforts economic reform, noting interest rates fallen currency stabilized. But also pressed Kim private meetings restructure five huge conglomerates, chaebols, account 40 percent Korean economy. In describing leaders' conversation, Berger called restructuring chaebols perhaps serious remaining problem South Korean economy. Clinton said economic forum Saturday afternoon felt impatient South Korea's failure act chaebols. It may necessary proceed slowly restructuring, said, begin. On Sunday, Clinton plans visit 37,000 American troops stationed here. In green aviator jacket black cap, President Clinton spent Sunday visiting American troops stationed South Korea. He promoted private, sang birthday greetings sergeant major described threats hopes peaceful engagement North Korea. Lately, signs danger intensified, Clinton said address airmen here, standing gunmetal gray F-16 A-10 parked nose-to-nose. So must remain vigilant. And thanks you, are. For eagerness talk information-age economic dangers like quicksilver currency flows, Clinton returned five-day trip Japan South Korea old-style regional military threat posed North Korea. The subject consumed meetings President Kim Dae-jung South Korea Saturday formed backdrop visits troops Sunday. It's kind tense around here, said John Kelley, 26-year-old airman Wisconsin, describing life base. You know four minutes away missile. In speech, Clinton pointed recent North Korean missile tests, incursions south mysterious underground site may nuclear weapons installation signs potential threat. And compared North Korea Iraq, saying North Korea also major concern chemical biological weapons. Until North Korea fully commits constructive role peninsula, said, must remain ready. Clinton restated support Kim's policy engagement North Korea, though, saying hopeful signs justify it. He pointed talks began summer American military command Korea North Korean military prevent problems along demilitarized zone south north. Clinton planned leave South Korea early Monday return Washington Monday night, paying visit Guam. On bright icy afternoon, Clinton warmly received soldiers camouflage black boots, waited almost three hours, shifting foot foot rubbing hands. The official crowd estimate 3,500, turnout seemed even smaller. The base, 30 miles south Seoul, one two major American airfields Korea, housing 7,500 airmen. Others wanted see president bused sites hours away. Before flying helicopter, Clinton attended church Army base Seoul, visited firing range 12 miles demilitarized zone. In brief ceremony there, promoted Matt Prickett West Liberty, Ohio, private first class specialist. And led troops round Happy Birthday Sgt. Maj. Charles Thomas Wilson, N.C., turned 45 Sunday. It definitely caught guard, Thomas said. SEOUL, South Korea (AP)  U.S. President Bill Clinton South Korea's support Saturday confronting North Korea suspected nuclear site, warned North's communist leaders squander chance achieve lasting peace peninsula. President Kim Dae-jung, appearing Clinton news conference, pledged spare effort supporting U.S. endeavor resolve nuclear question. He called full access U.S. inspectors North Korean underground facility said North must develop missiles. On first two days South Korea, Clinton also held roundtable discussion business leaders hear prescriptions putting nation's economy back track. Economics security Clinton's twin themes five-day Asia trip began Japan. Clinton acknowledged U.S. intelligence officials yet certain suspicious underground construction project North Korea nuclear related. But said North risks closing door cooperation refuses U.S. inspection site. On first two days South Korea, Clinton also held roundtable discussion business leaders hear prescriptions putting nation's economy back track. Economics security Clinton's twin themes five-day Asia trip began Japan. Clinton acknowledged U.S. intelligence officials yet certain underground construction project North Korea nuclear related. But said North risks closing door cooperation refuses U.S. inspection site. It raises strong suspicion, Clinton said joint news conference Kim Blue House, presidential mansion overlooking capital. We need access it. The foundation U.S. efforts ease North Korea's decades-long hostility toward South 1994 agreed framework North halted nuclear weapons program exchange Western commitment build modern nuclear energy sources there. That deal would shattered suspect site turned clandestine nuclear project. Kim, moved South Korea sunshine policy engaging North Korea cultural economic fronts, firm saying government supports Clinton nuclear issue. In meetings week Pyongyang, North Korean capital, U.S. officials rebuffed request see suspicious site, American intelligence officials fear could secret effort revive North's nuclear weapons program. We must require full access ways ascertain nature purposes construction site, Kim said. If is, fact, proven nuclear related, demand immediate close down. He also said North must limit missile development, citing great shock Japan North Koreans test-fired missile way Aug. 31. U.S. spy satellite photos show thousands workers digging massive complex. U.S. special envoy Charles Kartman Friday retracted assessment made Thursday compelling evidence North Korea building underground nuclear facility. In statement distributed U.S. embassy today, Kartman said instead, There strong information makes us suspicious, lack conclusive evidence intended purpose underground site nuclear related and, so, type nuclear facility might be. Kim said government would support U.S. efforts resolve nuclear question. The North Koreans denied underground construction site nuclear purpose, proposed dlrs 300 million payment allowing inspections. Clinton rejected idea compensation. Directing remarks North Korea, Clinton noted significance new tourism deal bringing South Koreans North cruise ships  arrangement touted Kim sign North may opening 1950s Korean War enemy. Nothing could ever put hole ground, given defense partnership here, would give North Koreans much advantage, much power, much wealth, much happiness, ships going full people here, Clinton said. In meeting Korean community business leaders Seoul's National Folklore Museum, Clinton praised South Korea's progress recovering financial crisis. On darker note, mentioned recent tensions Asian steel exports United States, skyrocketed year great cost domestic U.S. steelmakers. Japanese steel biggest problem, South Korean steel exports also rise. Clinton said U.S. economy could tolerate increased imports  concentrated industries, result Asian economies begin recover. We sensitive price basically erase entire sector U.S. economy, Clinton said. North Korea agreed receive U.S. delegation next month discuss American concerns construction vast underground complex widely feared house nuclear weapons program, State Department said Wednesday. The delegation, led Charles Kartman, press access site, American intelligence agencies believe could centerpiece effort revive frozen nuclear arms program. We've made clear North Koreans attempt North Korea pursue nuclear weapons development program would unacceptable, State Department spokesman, James Rubin, said. The talks Pyongyang, capital, added, aimed completely satisfying U.S. concerns suspect construction. American intelligence agencies fear building complex could effort break four-year-old pact North Korea pledged give nuclear-weapons program exchange billions dollars aid United States, South Korea Japan. American officials said spy satellites recently photographed thousands North Koreans around huge site 25 miles northeast Yongbyon, nuclear center North Korea believed stockpiled enough plutonium 1994 accords build six bombs. Although explained exactly government building complex, North Korean officials denied would used develop nuclear weapons. The official North Korean press agency said last week government building civilian underground structures `doubt' cannot cast suggested American officials would allowed inspect complex pressed access. If U.S. side persists inspecting underground structures, press agency said, show them. Rubin said United States received formal assurances Kartman, American special envoy Korean nuclear issues, delegation would allowed inspect site trip, begin Nov. 16. We beginning discussion demand access, Rubin said. The history U.S.-North Korea discussions involves usually lengthy discussion process agreement requirements. So expecting walk one day able access next. The trip announced signs grow relative warming relations United States North Korea. Representatives United States, China two Koreas met recently Geneva agreed steps reduce tension Korean Peninsula. In September United States pledged provide additional 300,000 tons grain North Korea, years crippled severe food shortages. In addition White House disclosed United States would provide heavy fuel oil promised North Korea 1994 agreement, despite concerns North Korea may intend revive nuclear program. American officials said activity near Yongbyon may yet technically violated accord, evidence North Korea begun pouring cement new reactor reprocessing plant convert nuclear waste bomb-grade plutonium. This city always kept unwritten list foreign leaders  dictators, unfriendly authoritarians consistently annoying allies  thinks make enormous contribution peace, security America's agenda taking early retirement, minimum. In 1950s, leftist leaders Iran Guatamala made Top 10, '60s populated Diem Sukarno Southeast Asians. President Richard M. Nixon advisers infamously agreed secret meeting '70s best way deal government Salvador Allende Gossens Chile make economy scream. Diplomatic etiquette, though, usually discouraged shouting America's enemies list White House rooftop. After all, foreign policy personalities, right? But last week, driven frustration, anxiety, perhaps lure sounding tough cameras, Clinton administration piped up, twice. In different situations, opposite corners world, United States spoke loudly can't find stick. Sunday, hours called attack Iraq, Clinton finally volunteered obvious, focus U.S. policy toward Iraq removal President Saddam Hussein  Clinton called supporting forces change Iraq. No matter covert efforts failed miserably. The bigger surprise came Monday, polite-to-a-fault Al Gore used visit Malaysia Asian economic summit meeting throw U.S. support behind protesters calling reformasi, code word streets Kuala Lumpur dumping Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamed. He long burr Washington's side, denouncing America, currency traders Jews. He recently imprisoned Western-thinking finance minister, Anwar Ibrahim, suddenly become Asia's visible jailed dissident. But Mahathir Saddam, long shot. Gore's aides insist speech call reform, demand Mahathir step down. But interpreted way. The New Zealanders called megaphone diplomacy. The Malaysian government called disgusting interference internal affairs. Predictably, executives several U.S. companies flocked Kuala Lumpur told Malaysians Gore rude, assuring Washington uttered words needed said. Whatever wisdom Gore's words, raised question takes days world's powerful nation begin publicly suggesting time nettlesome leader go. Because official list, real criteria getting it. Some leaders mysteriously escape mention, like Kim Jong Il North Korea. President Clinton spending weekend Korean Peninsula, staring across demilitarized zone dangerous state everyone suspects attempting break 1994 agreement freeze nuclear weapons projects, return billions Western energy aid. Yet Washington never called starving North Koreans revolt Kim's repressive regime. His government, taking page Saddam playbook, suggested last week United States really wants look mountain tunnel Pentagon believes nuclear installation making, write check another $300 million. No one even called Kim's removal when, months ago, lobbed three-stage missile Japan show knew how. The rules calling end regime pretty murky, said Richard Feinberg, professor University California San Diego served Clinton administration's first term. When really want push someone out, country part larger strategic concern time. But country usually great strategic weight  another matter call change leadership Beijing Moscow  helps kind domestic opposition point to. Clinton's call Saddam's ouster last weekend created barely ripple because, all, proven murderer avid stockpiler anthrax plutonium (even Brent Scowcroft, President George Bush's national security adviser, insisted last week Saddam nowadays simply irritant, annoyance, pest problem, threat region moment). Mahathir, however, far complex case. He's prime example opposing Washington's political economic agenda interconnected world move leader list authoritarians Washington tolerates list authoritarians outlived usefulness. Like Asian strongmen  Ferdinand Marcos Philippines Suharto Indonesia come mind  useful fear Malaysia would become communist domino. But also seemed eminently tolerable long Cold War over. He never accused enormous corruption. He turned country model competitiveness, Malaysia became exemplar big emerging markets Clinton's Commerce Department touted things went sour last year. Sure, always prickly. But terrorist killer  U.S. companies flocked country, say want stay  iron control political discourse stronger neighboring Singapore. Just summer, U.S. Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin paid ostensibly friendly, strained, visit made reference human rights. That changed Ibrahim arrested beaten jail. He long advocate Western-style solutions economic turmoil  openness, freedom  protest movement Mahathir surfaced jail. Gore leapt opportunity  particularly striking because, case Indonesia earlier year, took administration months come conclusion President Suharto go. He went.

50,"It surprising scene three months ago Dennis Rivera, one New York City's left-leaning labor leaders, singing praises Sen. Alfonse M. D'Amato. Rivera, president largest union New York City, praised D'Amato persuading Trent Lott, Senate majority leader, support legislation financed health coverage hundreds thousands uninsured children. It looked Rivera's politically potent union might endorse D'Amato  minimum stay neutral year's U.S. Senate race New York. But Monday, Rivera's 150,000-member union, 1199, National Health Human Service Employees union, endorsed Rep. Charles E. Schumer, D-N.Y., thereby risked D'Amato's wrath. The endorsement risky, labor leaders acknowledge, angering powerful senator could make far less responsive labor's needs unions turn help future re-elected. Although may seem illogical, two words go far explain Rivera's union backed Schumer: Monica Lewinsky. Largely result Lewinsky scandal, Democrats say suddenly fear Republicans gain filibuster-proof, 60-seat majority Senate, Republicans 55 seats Democrats' 45. For labor leaders like Rivera, notion strong Republican majority nightmare. That fear helped push New York unions Schumer's column, even though D'Amato long courted them. Those unions include teamsters' joint council New York City District Council 37, umbrella group representing 120,000 municipal employees. Labor leaders say fear filibuster-proof Republican majority, Senate would push anti-union legislation, like recently defeated Republican proposals curb labor's political spending cut financing National Labor Relations Board. We worried legislation allow labor movement survive next century, Rivera said. Alarmed Democrats lose Senate seats California, Illinois, Wisconsin, Nevada South Carolina, Rivera's union concluded worth backing Schumer. The decision, Rivera emphasized repeatedly, personal based national considerations. Unfortunately, leadership Republican Party national level person Newt Gingrich Trent Lott necessarily culture Republicans Northeast, said. They're far conservative, far anti-labor, far anti-worker, far pro-business. We fear Democratic Party faces irrelevance United States Senate go 41 seats. Trying avoid rupture D'Amato, Rivera praised effective senator. The endorsement could boon Schumer. Rivera's union teachers' union labor's strongest political operations New York. In addition, Schumer get thousands dollars local well use renowned phone banks, make 50,000 political calls day. A spokesman D'Amato said, Al D'Amato's proud he's endorsed 100 union federations locals, representing 400,000 working men women, he'll continue efforts behalf working middle class families. His labor endorsements include New York City Patrolmen's Benevolent Association New York State Building Construction Trades Council. Besides backing 1199, Schumer also received endorsement 1199's parent union, Service Employees International Union, 350,000 members New York State. Rivera  support D'Amato last time ran either  announced endorsements founding convention New York State Council service employees union. The convention packed Town Hall, new group aims make service employees power reckoned bringing together dozen union locals forge common political legislative strategy. Earlier year, 1199 merged service employees, part agreement, Rivera became head service employees New York State. Nearly 60 years behind times, House voted Friday condemn Nazi-Soviet nonaggression pact 1939. The measure, nonbinding resolution, brought floor Rep. John Shimkus, R-Ill. He Lithuanian descent, pocket Lithuanians hometown Collinsville wants try highlight support Baltic states' past efforts Soviet repression. Shimkus' measure example members Congress spending time stand idle wait Republican leaders reach agreement spending bills White House, thus avoiding government shutdown allowing go home campaign November elections. With time hands, many Republicans using House floor personal stage elicit votes topics boast folks back home. Most matters little chance finding way law, members hope turn advantage Election Day. There plenty items whose sponsors hope attract attention. These tend special-interest matters members hope escape scrutiny rush leave town. The sponsors measures added advantage impeachment inquiry, preoccupying Congress, news media public giving cover move pet causes quietly gigantic omnibus package Congress eventually present Clinton signing. These quieter measures include one proposed Mississippi's two senators, Trent Lott Thad Cochran, Republicans. They want agriculture export credits buy chickens Russia, bought chickens cannot pay them. The chickens Mississippi. Democrats little influence Republican-controlled Congress. But Democrats close enough Republican leaders, Republican goals, measures taken seriously. These include Rep. John Murtha, D-Pa., ranking Democrat national security subcommittee Appropriations Committee, pushing measure increase military pensions. Perhaps best example attempt force vote political advantage measure would require minors notify parents seeking contraceptives federally funded family planning clinics. House leaders allowed measure brought floor way appease conservative members, believe shortchanged budget process. It passed House vote 224-200 almost chance becoming law. The Senate plan take up, Clinton would almost certainly veto it. But Rep. Tom Coburn, R-Okla., said votes like important put sponsors' ideological foes record opposing something sounds reasonable, opposition used Nov. 3 election. It voice mail message Dr. Marilyn Rymer, neurologist Kansas City, Mo., would routinely delete, even registered Democrat. Speaker Newt Gingrich's office, said, calling discuss national leadership award. Dr. Rymer acclaim director prominent stroke-treatment center, proposition seemed particularly grand. When returned call, said told would also named honorary chairman elite committee advise Gingrich legislation. Too good true? Well, Dr. Rymer would pay way committee actually meet, honorary committee chairman, discovered, would member committee composed entirely honorary chairmen. And oh, speaker wanted donation $500 $1,000 help efforts, according transcript similar chat another doctor, elect bigger Republican majority House Representatives. With approach midterm elections next month, turns National Republican Congressional Committee, supports candidates House, sponsoring similar calls tens thousands small-business owners, including doctors. With fund-raising programs, committee says amassed $62 million elections. But campaign finance watchdogs say solicitations mark new departure political fund raising, one call akin practices marketing companies like Publishers' Clearing House hook consumers visions million-dollar windfalls induce subscribe magazines. By citing speaker promising celebrity influence, say, calls bait-and-switch scheme seize attention people might otherwise hang up. Dr. Rymer says incensed. So Dr. Stanley Turecki, child family psychiatrist New York votes independent also called. I absolutely outraged, said. Anybody else would would fall category consumer fraud. Kenneth Gross, Washington lawyer specializes election law represents Democratic Republican clients, said, I never heard particular device. But appear illegal, said, adding, It's fund-raising gimmick get attention. Fred Wertheimer, president Democracy 21, nonprofit, nonpartisan advocate campaign finance reform, said, This new version caveat emptor  buyer damned instead buyer beware. When businesses it, added, Congress orders investigations. But going investigated members Congress it. Todd Harris, spokesman National Republican Congressional Committee, said heard complaints intent deceive. The national leadership award part call donor member fulfillment, Harris said. It's part bringing process. It's important recognized support give party. There's quid pro quo people solicited could receive awards past contributions, added. What peeves Drs. Rymer Turecki message left secretaries answering machines invoking Gingrich's office proposing award. They say envisioned senior aide telephone speaker's chambers Capitol Dome. The calls, however, placed aides Gingrich, offices anyone Washington. They made people headsets computers home InfoCision Management Corp., telemarketing firm Congressional committee client Akron, Ohio. On Web page, InfoCision says 1,400 employees operate 1,584 telephone lines 9 phone centers. Every word script approved clients, company says Web site. Every conceivable objection scripted powerful rebuttal. Besides telemarketing businesses, said Jamie Blair, supervisor center, specialize helping Republican Party conservative political groups. However far Gingrich, telemarketers instructed answer return calls with: Republican Congressional Committee, Newt Gingrich's office. May I help you? A doctor Kansas City, Mo., registered Republican declined named, dialed Gingrich number (888-484-1644) left answering machines secretly recorded ensuing discussion, legal Missouri. We asked contact behalf speaker, says woman picked call identified Nancy. He right aggressively pushing legislation cut taxes much half, he's also interested legislation cut capital gains single rate 15 percent. To assure passage legislation, speaker wants increase Republican majority, says, adding, To help us that, speaker pulling together group individuals inviting honorary chairman advisory council. Nancy continues: There correspondence speaker, conference calls. It's great way get input thoughts legislation concern you. Or maybe surveys questionnaires. Later, Nancy says: As member committee, would receiving speaker national leadership award, really quite honor. And honest, asking chairmen could help efforts increase majority one-time contribution $500 $1,000. Now would used nationwide media campaign Newt undertaken target seats really need. And someone I'm sure would also benefit this, could I tell speaker could count help? The doctor demurs. I registered, know, Republican Kansas, tells Nancy. Probably I something would go representative. Then doctor tries ascertain Nancy located. Is congressman Gingrich's office I'm talking to? doctor asks. The speaker's office, says Nancy. This speaker's office. That I'm talking to, says doctor, double-checking. Uh-huh, Nancy replies. The law prohibits political fund-raising calls federal offices. Vice President Al Gore Justice Department investigation fund-raising calls allegedly made office 1996 presidential campaign. But calls made anywhere else, including campaign offices. Harris said calls way related speaker's OFFICIAL office. He added: What important calls get routed. People interested award speaker's good name whether call gets routed Washington Ohio. Turecki disagrees. I see basic sleaze, said. The last time George Voinovich ran office, re-election Ohio's governor 72 percent vote, stunning even optimistic supporters setting 20th-century record victory margins Ohio politics. This year, Voinovich, Republican barred seeking third term, running again, time Senate seat held John Glenn, Democrat retiring. And expect Voinovich repeat electoral benchmark four years ago, politicians parties generally acknowledge well positioned increase Republican majority Senate. That prevented Voinovich's Democratic opponent, Mary Boyle, undertaking vigorous campaign. Ms. Boyle, former commissioner Cuyahoga County, encompasses Cleveland, crisscrossing nation's seventh-most populous state describes grass-roots campaign that, operating comparative shoestring, nonetheless attracted side nationally known Democrats  President Clinton foremost among  campaign trail. Glenn, former astronaut preparing return space month age 77, made endorsement Senate race. Like many candidates year, Ms. Boyle, 55, campaigning hard issue education, seeking portray Voinovich, 61, lackluster steward allowed state's schools decline. He promised education governor, said Ms. Boyle. But seven half years failed students state. Her role campaign, said, remind people state Ohio George Voinovich made promise deliver it. Specifically, discusses decision last year Ohio Supreme Court cited wide disparities quality state's schools ruled unconstitutional formula funding them. She also attacked Republican opponent supporting proposal raise state's sales tax one percent. Under plan, half additional funds would used school improvement remainder earmarked reducing property taxes. That statewide ballot initiative last May proved wildly unpopular, 80 percent voters opposing it. While topics taxes education hot ones political season Ohio, clear Ms. Boyle's emphasis helped campaign. Despite narrowing opinion polls, still trailing Voinovich 15 percentage points polls much 20 points others. There also sharp fund-raising disparity. Ms. Boyle, running first statewide race widespread union support, raised nearly $2 million far, far less nearly $7 million Voinovich taken in. Also, Voinovich, former lieutenant governor, statewide ballots five times last 20 years thus better-known candidate. The electoral dynamics Ohio also aiding Voinovich. The northern half state, history industrial, unionized cities, tradition voting largely Democratic candidates, southern tier state considered conservative typically leans Republican. But Voinovich Ms. Boyle share home terrain, depriving Ms. Boyle geographic advantage often accompanies Democratic candidates. Indeed, boy, Voinovich delivered newspapers Boyle home working-class Collinwood section Cleveland.

Then flew Philadelphia raise half million dollars Democratic Party. By midsummer, president's aides delighted persuaded condense fund-raising remarks 10 minutes policy points partisan jabbing. But troubles grown mid-term elections approached, free-form remarks become longer. In Cleveland Friday, spoke 26 minutes Friday evening spoke almost 20 minutes. These fund-raising visits fallen pattern since Clinton's videotaped grand jury testimony Aug. 17. He lauded, applauded embraced hosts donors.

But Cleveland elsewhere, protesters scattered along president's motorcade route reminders calls resignation impeachment, mockery heaping upon presidency. At rally president outside city hall Friday night group Teamsters chanted, two years. Clinton's motorcade route lined downtown hundreds people, carrying supportive condemnatory signs. After impromptu shopping trip, greeted shouts We love you, Clinton told donors beginning impassioned reprise Cleveland speech: I even mind protesters, that's American way. But, added, preferred minority, seemed case. As rode Cleveland, Clinton passed billboard local radio station, WNCX.

The president left aides Friday respond directly latest gusher grand jury disclosures Washington. Instead, remarks, Clinton spoke pride record urgency addressing international economic crisis needs struggling farmers schoolchildren. As typically partisan audiences, also walked political calculation mid-term elections. Clinton said Cleveland Republicans bragged privately prospects. They tell me, `Oh, we're going well, Mr. President, mid-terms much money do,' Democrats turned re-elect Clinton would return polls off-year. That argument, course, would also insulate Clinton blame depressing Democratic vote. But often goes that, saying predicament could actually help Democrats. Lower-income Democratic voters, said, might bother vote typical election. The people good enough serve event today, they've got lot hassles life, said. But, said, adversity friend, overcome apathy focus us issue here. What issue, Clinton said, achievements agenda Republicans' record, described harshly. What done? asked Cleveland.

In election years, Reps. David Price Julia Carson would little common Democrats relatively safe seats. Price centrist represented high-tech district North Carolina 2 last 12 years, political scientist taught Duke Yale. Mrs. Carson, fairly liberal, House freshman worked way politics grass roots, reared poverty. But party officials opened election year high hopes recapturing House beginning worry Democratic incumbents like Price Mrs. Carson share something else: greater-than-expected peril Election Day. As many congressional races, biggest variable White House scandal, injected fear uncertainty campaigns around country. Other Democratic incumbents Republican officials cite locked contests competitive expected include Reps. Corrine Brown Florida, Vic Snyder Arkansas, Lois Capps Ellen Tauscher California, Martin Frost Texas, Melvin Watt North Carolina, John LaFalce New York Sander Levin Michigan. Here North Carolina's 4th Congressional District, Price, acknowledging polls showed tight race, said: This swing district sensitive tide trend. It's something think lot connection president's troubles. The efforts Price Mrs. Carson contain Lewinsky debacle  opponents' attempts capitalize  offer important clues suggesting Clinton's problems influencing conduct races around country. Many Democrats straddling line seems shift bit every new scandal-related disclosure: want appear close president whose conduct embarrasses them, yet, sensing possibility public backlash Republicans, weighing words carefully wary hopping impeachment bandwagon. And publicly Democrats express confidence scandal little impact them, campaigns preparing worst placing greater emphasis ever behind-the-efforts prod core constituencies vote. In reflection uncertainty Clinton scandal cast even among Republicans, challengers Price Carson districts  political novices seeking office first time  differing strategies: Tom Roberg, computer executive Raleigh taking Price, broadcast television commercial exploiting scandal. Tom Roberg called Bill Clinton's resignation, narrator says. This time silent, Price. Where stand? But Indianapolis, Gary Hofmeister, conservative jeweler challenging Mrs. Carson Indiana's 10th Congressional District, taking subtle approach: rather mention scandal directly, notes often Julia votes Clinton almost 100 percent time. Asked much raising scandal directly, Hofmeister said: Don't murder somebody they're process committing suicide. There would danger went overboard. The best evidence discomfort Price Mrs. Carson asked separate interviews whether would want Clinton campaign districts, said would impossible late date White House schedule visit. What sudden schedule change? Both paused, squirmed bit mustered answers hardly affirmative. Given president's popularity, I doubt hurt me, Mrs. Carson said. And Price? I think would good idea, said. I've never president campaign here, I want start time although eagerly welcoming Erskine Bowles, president's chief staff popular native son North Carolina, stump Sunday.) Making strategy stump complicated anecdotal evidence runs counter Democratic fears Republican hopes. In three days campaign stops North Carolina Indianapolis, scandal rarely raised voter courted candidates either party. When reporter asked it, many voters said appalled Clinton's behavior, hard time relating decision way vote congressional elections five weeks. As Hofmeister walked parking lot outside gun knife show Indiana National Guard Armory Indianapolis last Sunday, Billy Derringer, 57-year-old machinist retired disability, called express outrage millions dollars spent investigate Clinton. It's pathetic spend money, said Derringer, identified independent. It gotten far. Hofmeister tried best make Republicans' case. There rule law, said. Mrs. Carson said hoped Democrats swing voters alike would become fed Lewinsky inquiry issue might even help her. To end, proudly informs audiences voted making public report delivered House Kenneth Starr, Whitewater independent counsel. I one 63 members Congress voted putting filth Internet, said, adding Starr's inquiry cruel hoax terms fiscal responsibility accountability. The Carson campaign counting voters like Timothy Daly, 38-year-old real estate executive voted Republican two years ago favors Mrs. Carson. I'm pulling Democratic ticket I'm tired it: right side Republican Party playing politics, Daly said. We'd like see go people's business. Back 4th District, Price reasons worried. He first elected House 1986 but, four-term incumbent, ousted Republican sweep 1994 (only win seat back two years later). In addition, district redrawn last year include large Durham section voters know well. Determined midterm casualty Clinton again, Price says waging vigorous get-out-the-vote ground campaign career. Rather engage Roberg Clinton scandal, Price begun broadcasting television commercial emphasizes central issue: education. The congressman's advisers say intentionally produced advertisement appears decidedly nonpolitical  features school children play  effort break television clutter scandal. But Price campaign also weapon holding reserve, event Roberg appears riding Clinton scandal advantage: incumbent's advisers say would timid running commercials underscoring earned divinity degree getting doctorate political science. At coffee voters wealthy enclave Raleigh night, Roberg opened remarks asserting Clinton lost moral authority lead. Yet none assembled asked scandal; concerned state's plans build highway near neighborhood. The last time George Voinovich ran office, re-election Ohio's governor 72 percent vote, stunning even optimistic supporters setting 20th-century record victory margins Ohio politics. This year, Voinovich, Republican barred seeking third term, running again, time Senate seat held John Glenn, Democrat retiring. And expect Voinovich repeat electoral benchmark four years ago, politicians parties generally acknowledge well positioned increase Republican majority Senate. That prevented Voinovich's Democratic opponent, Mary Boyle, undertaking vigorous campaign. Ms. Boyle, former commissioner Cuyahoga County, encompasses Cleveland, crisscrossing nation's seventh-most populous state describes grass-roots campaign that, operating comparative shoestring, nonetheless attracted side nationally known Democrats  President Clinton foremost among  campaign trail. Glenn, former astronaut preparing return space month age 77, made endorsement Senate race. Like many candidates year, Ms. Boyle, 55, campaigning hard issue education, seeking portray Voinovich, 61, lackluster steward allowed state's schools decline. He promised education governor, said Ms. Boyle. But seven half years failed students state. Her role campaign, said, remind people state Ohio George Voinovich made promise deliver it. Specifically, discusses decision last year Ohio Supreme Court cited wide disparities quality state's schools ruled unconstitutional formula funding them. She also attacked Republican opponent supporting proposal raise state's sales tax one percent. Under plan, half additional funds would used school improvement remainder earmarked reducing property taxes. That statewide ballot initiative last May proved wildly unpopular, 80 percent voters opposing it. While topics taxes education hot ones political season Ohio, clear Ms. Boyle's emphasis helped campaign. Despite narrowing opinion polls, still trailing Voinovich 10 percentage points polls much 18 points others. There also sharp fund-raising disparity. Ms. Boyle, running first statewide race widespread union support, raised nearly $2 million far, far less nearly $7 million Voinovich taken in. Also, Voinovich, former lieutenant governor, statewide ballots five times last 20 years thus better-known candidate. The electoral dynamics Ohio also aiding Voinovich. The northern half state, history industrial, unionized cities, tradition voting largely Democratic candidates, southern tier state considered conservative typically leans Republican. But Voinovich Ms. Boyle share home terrain, depriving Ms. Boyle geographic advantage often accompanies Democratic candidates. Indeed, boy, Voinovich delivered newspapers Boyle home working-class Collinwood section Cleveland. And Voinovich, former mayor Cleveland, developed reputation moderate Republican works well Democrats. Voinovich, campaigning vigorously himself, keeping full schedule official duties, assuming role experienced, elected official. If I get Senate, I probably know domestic policy member Senate, said interview Wednesday Canton, sandwiched ribbon-cutting ceremony fund-raising reception vacuum cleaner museum. As mayor, I nose rubbed problems urban America fairly successful dealing them. And, governor, I dealt problems Medicaid, welfare education. I'm person United States president National League Cities chairman National Governors Association. To opponent's charges record education, Voinovich dismissive. I'm probably Republican United States endorsed Ohio Education Association National Education Association, said, adding Ms. Boyle member state Legislature period cited Supreme Court ruling. Mary Boyle vice chairman Ways Means Committee member Democratic leadership years, Voinovich said. They nothing fix buildings, nothing technology urban school districts. Ms. Boyle, yet begun run campaign commercials television, said status underdog allowed focused, intense. Pausing campaign fund-raising breakfast former Democratic Sen. Bill Bradley New Jersey Wednesday, Ms. Boyle said: This marathon pretty much uphill. But now, we're last three miles. It's tough race. Sen. Alfonse D'Amato, New York Republican running re-election, went Manhattan's Grand Central Terminal morning accept award mass-transit advocates. But reporters gathered showed little interest shiny train car senator's back. Instead, repeatedly asked would vote impeachment President Clinton. Look, I'm going make comment respect subject matter, D'Amato responded. I citizen. I citizen-senator may called upon make decision. But D'Amato something else well: candidate may tightest Senate race nation. And variations elliptical response heard Senate races around country, Republicans Democrats encountering similar questions. All suggests House voted Thursday authorize impeachment inquiry, year's 34 races U.S. Senate become, beyond already were, electoral equivalent jury selection. If House votes impeach Clinton, matter goes Senate, must decide two-thirds majority whether convict and, thus, remove office. As result, Monica Lewinsky matter suddenly injected new disruptive force Senate contests. Voters, even support Clinton, expect political leaders, Republican Democratic, renounce Clinton's behavior, candidates that. But impeachment another matter; polls show nation it. The danger Senate candidates impeachment real possibility, debate may move beyond president's behavior  little disagreement  problematic issue whether removed office. For strategists involved races, little guidance handle impeachment issue. Advisers candidates parties said interviews last week perplexed worried, unsure issue gain advantage  guard harm. I can't tell one going go, said Mike Russell, spokesman Republican Senatorial Campaign Committee. This surreal environment. Of 34 Senate seats play, 18 held Democrats 16 Republicans, hold 55 seats all. Republicans would win 28 34 races produce 67 votes necessary conviction, assuming vote go along party lines. Only electoral catastrophe Democrats, seems almost unthinkable, could produce huge loss. Jennifer Duffy, follows Senate races Cook Political Report, nonpartisan newsletter, said far, least, none Senate candidates made explicit appeal votes based would vote presidential jury. But others wondering may change. This difficult ground measure. One central questions political year Clinton's dealings Ms. Lewinsky might affect turnout. For long time, politicians assumed dispirited Democrats would stay home rebuke Clinton, many Republicans November 1974, three months President Richard M. Nixon resigned. But analysts wonder partisan fight Congress last week might opposite effect among Democrats. That's problem, said Stuart Rothenberg, editor independent political newsletter Washington. It's know, politicians know, general public stands impeachment. The problem know electorate stands impeachment. And asking voters think ahead impeachment proceeding cast ballots Senate race is, words Stuart Stevens, Republican consultant, double bank-shot. Such strategies, said, tend work small number single-minded sophisticated voters. Against complicated backdrop, prevailing thinking use impeachment issue vary race race, state state week week, depending circumstances candidates composition electorate. If Democrats try turn image Clinton dock advantage, would states Democratic edge sizable numbers black voters, overwhelmingly support president. In contests like those, might well prove interest Democratic candidate to, one consultant put it, sit front camera tape advertisement candidate denounces president's behavior solemnly pledges vote impeachment. Strategists parties believe kind approach could prove effective. This issue huge disconnect elites public, said Fred Yang, Democratic consultant clients Wisconsin Carolinas. That kind Democratic strategy might emerge California, New York, Illinois, Wisconsin, Washington perhaps Arkansas. By contrast, Democrats South Carolina, Georgia Nevada would less likely oppose Clinton's impeachment. On side, Republican consultants telling candidates stress Clinton's misdeeds stay away talk impeachment. The last thing party wants turn Senate elections referendum whether Clinton forced office. The White House might think overall public numbers maybe would like make referendum election, said Ed Goeas, Republican pollster working Senate races year. Republicans certainly going let happen. D'Amato responded questions Clinton language Republican consultants suggesting candidates. When matter comes Senate, I decide facts presented time, D'Amato said. It would premature suggest course action without referred. Because, indeed, may called upon act jury kind. But Schumer, member House Judiciary Committee, conducting impeachment investigation, virtually embraced issue. In live telecast hearings, said president deserved lesser punishment, censure reprimand. And Schumer plans campaign New York Monday Clinton side. Schumer's media adviser, Hank Morris, seemed suggest last week impeachment grow issue. Senator D'Amato claims want share opinion people New York, Morris said. And opinion, he's New Yorker opinion. Asked Schumer would raise issue television commercial, Morris responded: We talk we're going do. I rule I rule out. ","Acknowledging his mistakes, Clinton supports Democrat candidates and speaks at fundraisers.He backs Mary Boyle of Ohio in her bid for U.S. Senate.Democrat candidates try to limit the effect of the Lewinsky debacle on their campaigns.A N.Y. labor union backs Democrat Schumer to keep Republicans from gaining a 60-seat majority.Sen. D'Amato sidesteps queries about Clinton's impeachment on the campaign trail.A gay group may back D'Amato, the prospect of which is upsetting Democrats.House Republicans are using idle time to get votes on issues to help their campaigns.The National Republican Congressional Committee sponsors deceptive fundraising calls.","In addition to the usual factors that prevail in Congressional elections, this year's is complicated by the uncertain effect of the impending impeachment of President Clinton.The president has admitted mistakes, but remains a popular campaigner for House Democrats.In the New York race between D'Amato and Schumer, both are seeking union and gay/lesbian endorsement.Republican Voinovich hopes to take the seat of retiring John Glenn in Ohio.A budget agreement between Republican congressional leaders and the White House is needed soon to avoid a government shutdown.A leadership award from Speaker Gingrich's office is merely a pitch for contributions.","President Clinton's impeachment woes are causing problems for the approaching mid-term elections.The President stopped apologizing, saying he must ""live with the consequences"" of his mistakes, and urging democrats to take pride in his achievements.Democratic candidates hope to contain the Lewinsky debacle while trying to prevent a Republican majority in the Senate.In New York, the Human Rights Campaign may endorse both candidates.In Ohio, Republican Voinovich is in a crucial face-off with Democrat Mary Boyles.Republicans are using a bait-and-switch routine to earn funds from small business.Their House votes are on topics to boast about back home.","In tight congressional and Senate races leading up to the Nov. 1998 elections, strategists and candidates were unsure how to deal with the Clinton/Lewinsky scandal.Though the President pointed to his record while stumping, many Democrats, embarrassed by his behavior, distanced themselves from him.With impeachment a possibility, the Senate races assumed even greater importance.While it was unlikely the Republicans would win enough Senate seats to remove the President, Democrats feared their opponents could gain a filibuster-proof, 60-seat majority.The NY senate race between Republican D'Amato and Schumer was one of the tightest in the nation."

Yugoslavia must cooperate U.N. war crimes tribunal investigating alleged atrocities wars Croatia Bosnia, international legal experts meeting Belgrade said Sunday. The meeting first international debate Yugoslavia U.N. tribunal's work government's cooperation it. The tribunal, established U.N. Security Council 1993, sits The Hague, Netherlands. Despite objections tribunal, Yugoslav authorities allowed two-day discussions  organized Belgrade-based, non-governmental Humanitarian Law Center  take place without problems. State-run media largely ignored event. Though disagreements, participants discussions generally agreed crimes humanity cannot go unpunished. The indicted The Hague at-large refusal Croatian Yugoslav authorities arrest extradite them, said Mark Ellis, lawyer representative American Bar Association. Present-day Yugoslavia, consisting Serbia Montenegro, cooperates tribunal cases Serbs victims Bosnia Croatia, two former republics fought wars secession. But Yugoslavia questioned tribunal's jurisdiction refuses indict three army officers wanted alleged war crimes Croatia. Last week, also refused allow U.N. investigators probe alleged atrocities Serbia's southern Kosovo province ethnic Albanian separatists fighting government forces. The tribunal founded satanize Serbs, said Miodrag Mitic, former legal adviser Yugoslavia's foreign ministry. He said U.N. court influenced powerful countries dominate international body. On Saturday, David Scheffer, U.S. State Department's ambassador at-large war crimes, demanded Yugoslavia's full cooperation. Some closest combat half year Kosovo conflict, point fighting room room floor floor, occurred near village six weeks ago, days 21 women, children elderly members Delijaj clan massacred Serbian forces, mutilated bodies left strewn forest floor. Piecing together happened, surviving family members, ethnic Albanian separatist forces official Serbian information, story emerges fierce guerrilla resistance onslaught Serbian tanks, artillery infantry. The Serbian forces fighting appear suffered unusually heavy losses and, guerrillas finally fled, took revenge civilians, shooting women children close range tried run away pursuers. According relatives found bodies, Pajazit Delijaj, 65, decapitated, brain left display ground. Hava Delijaj, 65, shot one feet cut knife hung thread skin. Young women children run hundred yards rocky path mowed down. Miraculously, 6-week-old baby, Diturie, found father alive clasp dead mother, Lumnije, 30, 24 hours killings. Blood mouth mother's hand baby, said Imer Delijaj, father, avowed member Kosovo Liberation Army, ethnic Albanian guerrilla force, returned uniform discover bodies. I moved hand moment opened eyes. I realized alive. I tried clean blood mouth put tongue out. Several members Delijaj clan survived. Zejnije Delijaj, 39, cooked guerrillas family compound returned fighting days massacre, recalled fled, crawling, falling, running hiding woods Serbs shot her. I could feel dirt hitting impact bullets, said interview, nose still bloodied said heavy fall flight. First machine guns, grenades, cannon, said. Every time I moved heard leaves rustling, shot. The massacre Delijajs, whose forebears settled Drenica Valley 150 years ago, first conflict ravaged Serbian province March October lulled uneasy truce. Indeed, conflict Serbian forces bent keeping Kosovo Serbia guerrillas fighting independence heavily ethnic Albanian population first drew international attention massacre Jasari clan early March Serbian units Prekaz, central Kosovo. But killing Delijajs, ranging paralyzed patriarch, Fazli, 94, burned bed, slaughter Valmir, 18 months, found shot, thoroughly documented far. Human Rights Watch, New York-based group, believes knowledge gathered far increases possibility prosecutions U.N. war crimes tribunal The Hague, Netherlands. The Hague's prosecutors could also draw observations diplomats, human rights monitors reporters saw bodies scattered ravine victims killed buried shallow graves clan's nearby compound. In Kosovo massacres, bodies moved sites seen independent observers. Further, family members survived assault described saw circumstances hills valleys around Obrinje Serbs pushed forward early Saturday morning, Sept. 26, headquarters Likovac, north here. By then, Albanian guerrillas fled area around Delijaj compound, dispersing senior commander Kosovo Liberation Army, Naim Maloku, termed particularly fierce combat Serbs. In days Sept. 26, said, guerrillas  caught Serbian pincer movement  decided fight rather surrender. The fighting  sometimes house house, even room room  took unusually heavy toll among Serbs, said Maloku, former officer Yugoslav army. He said believed deaths Serbs avenged massacre Delijajs. In major attacks conflict, guerrillas generally found escape hatch. In Obrinje, led another former officer Yugoslav army Maloku declined name, guerrillas fought, using land mines rocket-propelled grenades. Maloku said knew report made rebel headquarters least 47 Serbian soldiers police officers killed fighting Bajince, three miles east. We took weapons 47 Serbs, said. The state-controlled Serbian media center Kosovo's capital, Pristina, said 10 Serbian police officers killed fighting, including five reservists died vehicle hit antitank mine Sept. 25. The announcement 10 Serbs killed one action unusually high. The practice taking violent revenge time-honored tradition Balkans. From 1991 1995, wars Croatia Bosnia, Serbs, Croats and, far lesser extent, main victims, Muslims, avenged World War II massacres new blood feuds, driven killing leaders exploited old conflicts carve new fiefs old, Communist Yugoslavia collapsed. In case, appears, Serbian vengeance visited upon Delijajs. Survivors clan said feared assault collection mud brick homes lining rocky dirt track directly opposite village Likovac, Serbs' base mile away. The Serbs pushed rebels Likovac August guerrillas established new headquarters around Bajince, six miles east Obrinje. As Serbs swept nearby Cicavica Mountains, road runs Pristina Klina, clear Obrinje would target. Most women children area moved Apple Valley, 10,000 refugees gathered outdoors, seeking safety numbers. But Imer Delijaj, 38, said decided ravine family compound would better hiding place. He said believed women, children elderly would spared Serbs found them. As Serbs approached foot Saturday morning massacre, last person flee compound Bashkim Delijaj, 21, youngest son 94-year-old Fazli. Bashkim Delijaj said stayed behind look bedridden father. The shelling started 7 a.m. Saturday I saw tank convoy approaching, infantry behind tanks, Bashkim Delijaj recalled interview. I smoking cigarette grenade fell roof hole gate I saw soldiers coming 30 meters away. They brown army uniforms, huge knives small axes. Many beards. Bashkim Delijaj said unable carry father safety, courage tell happening. I told I getting animals barn, said. He said ran, hid, ran more, eventually received shelter farmer, time hearing shooting shelling. When firing died Monday morning, returned compound ran Imer, still wearing guerrilla uniform. They went one houses found Imer Delijaj's brother, Adem, 33, shot dead, body sprawled ground rain, burned torso Fazli. I looked window house saw bones father, looked like learned biology class, said. Together, two men went find happened ravine. There found bodies. First, Ali, 65, who, Imer Delijaj said, cut neck tobacco cutting knife. Then Pajazit, decapitated makeshift tent, brain placed two foam mattresses. Then Hava, 65, sprawled near tent. They moved find Jeton, Imer's 10-year-old son, Imer's mother, Hamide, 60, far away. Imer's sister-in-law, Luljeta, seven months pregnant, mutilated, said. A little ravine, Imer said saw wife, Lumnije, 30. He opened wife's coat found 6-week-old baby girl, 3 months old recovering relative's home Likovac. He said tried clean baby put jacket walked feet find bodies 4-year-old daughter, Menduhije, two young children, Donieta, 5, Gentiana, 7. The corpses family members found woods two older men, Habib, 51, Hysen, 53, found next morning, Imer said. On Oct. 3, bodies two missing teen-age girls, Mehane, 16, Antigua, 13, found bushes side road near abandoned Serbian police compound. Later month, body Hajriz found pushed well, close ravine. One uncle, Sharif, ravine, still missing, presumed dead. Human Rights Watch, documenting Delijaj massacre, described vicious pattern attacks civilians Serbs Kosovo conflict. (To lesser extent, Albanian guerrillas also attacked Serbian civilians, forcing homes, allegedly carried least two massacres.) The evidence strongly indicates Gornje Obrinje killings followed conscious mutilations carried victims killed, coming report Human Rights Watch says. Delijaj family members told Human Rights Watch monitors others saw ethnic Albanian police officer accompanying Serbian police officers fighting. They believe police officer, posted nearby Glogovac police station, used Serbian special police officers guide Obrinje area. This police officer, apparently one small group ethnic Albanians officers remained loyal Serbs, could important witness criminal investigators war-crimes tribunal The Hague, according human rights experts. The ethnic Albanian policeman could important witness identifying police army units responsible atrocities, said Peter Boueckhart, researcher Human Rights Watch. It vital carried atrocities prosecuted Hague tribunal. At burned Delijaj compound last week, Imer Delijaj acting host wake which, following Albanian tradition, last several weeks began family members returned hiding places woods.

His lawyer, Bajram Krasniqi, said eager helpful investigators Hague tribunal, said Pristina believed Imer Delijaj felt guilty faulty decision. Whether tribunal closely examine case remains unclear. Slobodan Milosevic, Yugoslav president, issued handful visas investigators tribunal. Two investigators Kosovo time massacre left six days later without visiting site contacting Krasniqi killings. Would Imer Delijaj seek revenge? As sat floor living room group male visitors, replied: It's easy answer. If I see eye eye men I fight them. But men uniform fair fight.

Politicians said Prodi four votes short 316 votes needed majority Chamber Deputies, lower house. The government majority Senate even without Refoundation's support. After meetings French leaders, Prodi warned political difficulties threaten progress country making cleaning public finances. Prodi's government held together long large part widely shared desire see Italy qualify 1999 debut Europe's common currency, euro. It qualified earlier year  leaving disparate allies without clear reason stay together. As is, Prodi outlasted Bettino Craxi, served 3{ years two back-to-back stints 1983 1987. Prodi's Italy's 55th government since World War II. Three days collapse Premier Romano Prodi's center-left government, Italy's president began calling political leaders Monday try reach consensus new government. Following talks, expected last several days, President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro could ask Prodi try new majority. He could also name new premier, appoint government technocrats. If Scalfaro feels candidate capable mustering majority, could call early elections. Because president cannot dissolve Parliament last six weeks term, elections would scheduled December. Scalfaro named Prodi caretaker premier interim. Prodi's far-left ally, Communist Refoundation, provoked crisis withdrew support government 1999 deficit-cutting budget, said enough stimulate job creation. Despite help breakaway faction Communists, Sunday formed new party, Prodi lost Friday's vote confidence single vote. Prodi said take job back unless new government could stick policies old one, unlikely scenario given divided Parliament. An alternative Prodi could Massimo D'Alema, leader Democrats Left, largest party Prodi's coalition. In case so-called technical government, names Treasury Minister Carlo Azeglio Ciampi Foreign Minister Lamberto Dini circulated. A government technicians would get Italy volatile period approving 1999 budget launch common European currency, euro, January 1999. Prodi presided cost cuts got Italy debut European Monetary Union, outlasting one post-World War II Italian government process. By one vote, Premier Romano Prodi's center-left coalition lost confidence vote Chamber Deputies Friday, went presidential palace resign. President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro must decide whether call early elections ask Prodi someone else try forge new majority. The vote lower chamber Parliament 313 confidence motion brought government 312 favor. I'm bitter, Prodi said immediately government went down. The swing vote came Prodi's coalition, defecting deputy Foreign Minister Lamberto Dini's tiny Italian Renewal party. The Communist, 6th graf prv By one vote, defector ranks, Premier Romano Prodi's center-left coalition, Italy's second-longest serving government since World War II, lost confidence vote Friday Chamber Deputies.

The vote, 3rd graf prv Italy's Communists Sunday voted withdraw support Premier Romano Prodi's 2 1-2-year-old coalition, move expected trigger collapse one country's longest-lived postwar governments. Prodi said would call confidence vote Communists yanked support. The coalition majority without Communists Senate, depended passage key legislation Chamber. MORE Italian politics long enlivened baroque feuds shifting alliances. And time-honored tradition may embattled government Prime Minister Romano Prodi momentary reprieve. A leader Italy's hard-line Marxist faction, known Communist Refounding Party, resigned Monday protest party's decision reject government's 1999 budget imperil Prodi's slender majority Parliament. Prodi must realize majority longer exists, said Armando Cossuta, chairman Communist Refounding Party, fringe group broke mainstream Communists overhauled party following collapse Soviet Union 1991. Nevertheless everything possible, last minute, save government avoid crisis. Cossuta clearly unwilling join hard-line wing party withdrawing support Prodi risk branded torpedoed first leftist Italian government 50 years. But leader Communist Refounding Party Parliament, Fausto Bertinotti, seems compunctions. On Friday, told journalists worried forcing new elections could return right power. Sometimes take one step back order take two steps forward, said shrug. Until now, however, communist rank file disagreed view. When Bertinotti forced Prodi offer resignation last year proposed budget cuts, rank file protested, forced backpedal. Prodi met Monday President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro coalition leaders devise strategy. He expected go Parliament Wednesday open debate crisis seek enough votes budget. Without it, Italian central bank unlikely cut key lending rates, something Italy must get line Germany bigger European neighbors introduction Jan. 1 single European currency, euro. But even gathers enough votes pass budget, Prodi could still left without majority. After two half years office, government second-longest postwar era. But fragile center-left coalition held together mostly Italians united last two years effort reduce spending, inflation government borrowing meet requirements membership euro plan. Once goal achieved last spring, dissension quickly revived. Prodi's backers hoping enough members Communist Refounding Party break ranks follow Cossutta save coalition. If not, Prodi faced two unappetizing choices. He resign seek new elections, carry risk bringing opposition power. Or could seek form new majority without Communists seeking alliance small center-right party Francesco Cossiga. Cossiga's party came Prodi's rescue June, hard-line leftists refused back Prodi NATO expansion. But Prodi repeatedly said govern center-left majority elected 1996. Cossiga also suggested reporters Monday would welcome invitations join coalition led Prodi. We want majority get stained like Monica Lewinsky's dress, said. By one vote, center-left prime minister Italy, Romano Prodi, lost confidence vote Parliament Friday toppled power. The collapse government two half years, second-longest tenure since World War II, suggested chronic political instability marked Italy decades sprung back life. Though obliged tender resignation, Prodi remain charge caretaker prime minister new government formed. He may get second chance form new majority, even does, negotiations end could take days even weeks, clouding decisions urgent issues crisis Kosovo. NATO military planners preparing possible air strikes Yugoslavia expected use key air bases Italy. In weakened position, Prodi difficulty persuading Parliament approve NATO strikes. He similar problems passing 1999 budget, necessary Italy cut lending rates, requirement joining single European monetary unit, euro, Jan. 1. Immediately Friday's vote 313-312, tense times raucous session, Prodi met President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro submit resignation discuss options. In coming days Scalfaro consult dozens leaders ascertain whether Prodi enough lingering support try form new government. If not, president expected turn another political leader. If compromise found, Italy could plunged early elections. But parties political stripes may reluctant push things far, opinion polls suggest voters enamored center-right opposition parties governing majority. Prodi, economist, admired Western allies down-to-earth leader vowed tame Italy's bloated economy reckless government borrowing actually lived pledge. By raising taxes, lowering interest rates reducing deficit, Italy met requirements membership euro last spring, feat year considered impossible German French economists. Prodi helped healthy global economy rare consensus among industrialists, labor unions taxpayers, feared exclusion euro would condemn Italy Third World status. But fiscal discipline followed reform political system inherently fragile. There 40 parties Italy, government's efforts amend constitution introduce two-party system failed. Unless Italian political system changes, Italy condemned political instability, said Sergio Romano, former diplomat political science professor. The country needs stability credibility, never happen long government hanging thread. In 1996 Prodi patchwork quilt center-left factions mostly made Catholic moderates leftists. He relied fringe Marxist group, Communist Refounding Party, majority lower house. And alliance, fragile beginning, finally frayed breaking point week. The hard-line leader Communist Refounding, Fausto Bertinotti, said party would vote 1999 budget would also end 28-month-old pact center-left coalition. That position drove moderate wing Communist Refounding, worried vote Prodi would open doors center-right government, split away. But 20-odd deputies defied Bertinotti enough squeeze Prodi through. I bitter, Prodi said moments defeat. Even today I received lot support. In end coup de grace delivered one own, member coalition. They treachery one single person, Sergio Mattarella, deputy Prodi's coalition, angrily told reporters, referring Silvio Liotta, member Italian Renewal Party. Foreign Minister Lamberto Dini, heads party, said Liotta would expelled. Prodi often said would govern majority center-left one elected 1996. But throughout tenure, forced seek temporary alliances push major policy decisions. He struggled last try keep original majority intact. On Thursday, effort woo moderate Communists side, prime minister, staunch ally United States, warned would oppose NATO strike aimed stopping Serbian violence Kosovo unless U.N. Security Council approved attack. Washington maintains NATO need new U.N. resolution order strike. Premier Romano Prodi said Monday would appeal directly Parliament save Italy's second-longest government since World War II, threatened collapse defection Communist ally. The address Parliament expected Wednesday, followed perhaps Friday vote confidence determine whether Prodi's 2 1/2-year-old, center-left alliance stands falls. Prodi's far-left ally, Communist Refoundation Party, provoked crisis withdrawing support weekend saying would vote deficit-cutting 1999 budget, key Italy's participation European common currency. Prodi said would call confidence vote lost Communists' support. I've always acted coherence, Prodi said morning meeting President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro crisis. I've never changed strategy I want political gymnastics. The break Prodi's government divided Refoundation. Armando Cossutta, leader moderate wing, resigned party president Monday. He said party's desertion Prodi wrong dangerous, time promised follow party line. We complicated political crisis could lead early elections, Cossutta told reporters Monday. And divisions left, would mean victory right. If crisis comes confidence vote Prodi loses, would offer resignation. Once that, Scalfaro decide do. He could ask Prodi someone else form new government could call elections 2 1/2 years early, something analysts think unlikely. Working Prodi's favor fact parties think would stand gain early elections, including Communist Refoundation. There speculation Prodi would reopen negotiations would win back communists' grudging support, managed past. Prodi's government held together long large part widely shared desire see Italy qualify participation 1999 debut Europe's common currency, euro. That happened earlier year  leaving disparate allies without clear reason stay together. Prodi leads Italy's 55th government since World War II.

1001,"The institution exploring apartheid's horrors issue report finds African National Congress shares blame human rights violations struggled overcome white rule. The 3,500-page report Truth Reconciliation Commission culminates two years nationwide hearings. South African media released preliminary findings Monday, three days official release Thursday Pretoria, capital. The release document milestone South Africa's transformation white minority rule democracy. The commission, power grant amnesty, tasked promoting reconciliation laying bare apartheid-era atrocities. With ANC power facing election mid-1999, condemnation commission could prove damaging electoral chances moral standing. There doubt report's overwhelming blame would laid white governments security forces years scrutiny, 1960-1994. Indeed, news reports Monday said Truth Commission would declare apartheid crime humanity acknowledge ANC radical Pan Africanist Congress conducting legitimate struggle former apartheid state. But preliminary findings sent parties last month, commission also said two movements morally politically accountable gross rights violations, South African Press Association South African Broadcasting Corp. said. The preliminary finding said despite ANC policy killing civilians, line military civilian targets blurred, SAPA said. It condemned planting landmines rural areas, execution enemy agents, torture mistreatment ANC members exile camps killing political opponents. It said party must accept responsibility activities ANC Women's League president Winnie Madikizela-Mandela, Nelson Mandela's former wife, Mandela United Football Club, accused killings, torture kidnappings. The commission also said PAC guilty deaths civilians strategy 1993 drive white farmers land could reclaimed blacks. Justice Minister Dullah Omar, meeting journalists Pretoria, would comment news reports condemnation ANC. I expect various responses (to report). I expect everyone agree. It lead healthy debate, said. He said commissioners recommends prosecutions anyone abuses, national director prosecutions decide whether proceed. The director appointed government. The commission's work designed help us establish rule law South Africa, establish principle accountability, Omar said. The ANC already prepared ground negative finding, saying weeks ago commission warned harsh judgments offing. The ANC nervous enough report request meeting commissioners earlier month. The panel refused, avoid appearing biased. On Monday, rejected contempt suggestions ANC officials leaked findings. Constand Viljoen, leader tiny right-wing Freedom Front, said ANC done give commission credibility making even-handed. Publicly, party long defended actions committed war. F.W. de Klerk, last apartheid-era president, meanwhile, planned ask court prevent Truth Commission report implicating covering state-sponsored terror. Obviously comply ruling court, Omar said, added would regret court-ordered delay. Facing court challenge, Truth Reconciliation Commission said Wednesday would withhold, least temporarily, parts final report implicate South Africa's last apartheid-era president, F.W. de Klerk, illegal acts. De Klerk, 62, helped negotiate end South Africa's white supremacist government shared 1993 Nobel Peace Prize President Nelson Mandela work, objected finding commission accessory fact bombings headquarters church group labor federation 1980s. The chairman 17-member panel, Archbishop Desmond Tutu, said although took action great reluctance, commission needed time prepare fight legal challenge. He said would take de Klerk's name 3,500-page report avoid delaying release Thursday. It upsets deeply, said statement. We scrupulously fair de Klerk, reject contention engaged vendetta him. De Klerk's challenge part storm criticism prompted leaks report last days. Within hours commission decision withdraw findings de Klerk, facing possibility new suit  time ruling African National Congress. The ANC also wants block commission findings conduct liberation struggle. A spokesman party, Thabo Masebe, said party would seek injunction morning report officially handed Mandela. While commission's report expected lay overwhelming blame former white government atrocities, also found ANC responsible human-rights violations, including torture killing spying suspects, bombings civilian areas killing political enemies, including members rival Zulu-based Inkhata Freedom Party. The decision de Klerk seems certain damage commission's credibility. The panel, created way putting South Africa's brutal past rest without expense political divisiveness trials, caused controversy start. It held 160 hearings throughout country, listening victims perpetrators seeking amnesty. But many whites say commission witch hunt aiming humiliate former government officials Afrikaners general. De Klerk forced commission officials court apology calling liar. Some political analysts said Wednesday's events would belief panel lacks impartiality. The withdrawal findings can't help seen lack certainty side, said Sampie Terreblanche, economist political analyst University Stellenbosch, supported commission. Whether like not, whole report gets knock this. De Klerk's spokesman, David Steward, said former president confident would win case goes trial March. He happy courts rather dealing Truth Commission, Steward said. The fact agreed withdraw creates definite impression specifically concocted case involve Mr. de Klerk negative finding. The ANC accused commission trying criminalize liberation struggle. Whatever efforts besmirch struggle denouncing gross violation human rights, congress said statement. The ANC millions people part struggle always proud insure that, process destruction vile system, resort vile methods struggle basis means justified end. There probably subjects get South Africans excited issue Truth Commission whether worthy cause waste money. The events last days added debate. For some, like Pal Martins, 34, former member ANC's armed wing, fact sides political spectrum uproar good thing. The mere fact everyone complaining means Truth Commission done work, said. But others say many questions raised panel's competence. The whole affair beyond pale, mockery justice, said Roboy Vonholdt, 56-year-old sheep ostrich farmer believes commission theatrical act. We turn backs past move forward. We need need us. Let's make money let good economic conditions prevail. The commission's report supposed broad detailed summary South Africa's human rights history, 1960 1994, elections open races ended white minority rule. It parcel moral condemnations recommend individual prosecutions. While de Klerk alone court Wednesday challenging commission, Tutu said Wednesday threatened legal challenges led fewer individuals named rights violators originally planned. Tutu said 400 people notified would implicated give chance respond. Some 15 successfully argued report could reached therefore deleted report, said. The commission required law give advance notification anyone intends implicate report. The commission expected say although de Klerk order bombings, subsequently came know former Law Order Minister Adriaan Vlok Police Commissioner Johan van der Merwe involved, failed report knowledge police. This could open criminal prosecution. De Klerk applied amnesty matter other. de Klerk said learned bombings, Vlok Van der Merwe already process applying amnesty, think necessary report matter. A panel investigating apartheid-era atrocities said Wednesday implicate last apartheid president, F.W. de Klerk, human rights abuses threatened court challenge. De Klerk said would sue block long-awaited final report Truth Reconciliation Commission, due release Thursday. The man helped negotiate end apartheid objected finding commission accessory fact bombings 1980s headquarters church group labor federation. Former Archbishop Desmond Tutu, truth panel's chairman, said commission needed time prepare fight legal challenge, would excise de Klerk's name report avoid delaying release. It upsets deeply, Tutu said. We scrupulously fair Mr. de Klerk reject contention engaged vendetta him. But must respect courts rights constitution. We fought hard rights proud South Africa Mr. de Klerk shares them, said statement. All postponing dealing matter, Tutu later told The Associated Press. The name eventually appear hoo-ha died down. De Klerk, reached London, said could comment speaking lawyers matter courts. The commission charged promoting reconciliation laying bare apartheid's horrors. It held hearings around country two years, listening victims perpetrators seeking amnesty. The release 3,500-page report represents milestone South Africa's transformation white minority rule democracy. De Klerk's challenge part storm criticism prompted leaks report. The African National Congress, liberation movement helped defeat apartheid runs country, Tuesday angrily rejected finding guilty human rights violations armed struggle.

Other threatened legal challenges led fewer individuals named rights violators planned, The Star Johannesburg reported Wednesday. In commenting newspaper report, Tutu said 400 people notified would implicated give chance respond. Only 15 successfully argued report, said. Criminal prosecutions atrocities committed war white rule could drag least six years, top prosecutor said Monday. Key figures implicated human rights abuses Truth Reconciliation Commission already investigation, official, Jan d'Oliveira, told reporters. They include two unnamed generals apartheid state's security apparatus, President Nelson Mandela's ex-wife Winnie Madikizela-Mandela officials African National Congress, said. The remarks d'Oliveira, recently appointed deputy national director prosecutions, clearest signal yet criminal cases would brought figures accused commission gross human rights violations. The commission released report Oct. 30. It chronicles human rights abuses committed apartheid governments operatives well African National Congress others fighting racist system. The issue continuing prosecutions significant. Many feel dragging criminal reckonings horrors apartheid era prolong bitterness delay reconciliation. But supporters prosecution feel denying justice victims worse evil. On practical level, highly public prosecutions ANC figures could impact national elections next year, party seek consolidate hold power. The panel's chairman, Archbishop Desmond Tutu, called two-year time limit prosecutions; d'Oliveira called period wholly impractical. The prosecutor name targets. We always worked principle prosecute highest rank, said. The commission ability grant amnesty admit misdeeds found acted political motives. The report said individuals sought amnesty prosecuted. Madikizela-Mandela sought amnesty. The commission found accountable human rights violations committed bodyguards, report said killed tortured suspected opponents. Madikizela-Mandela convicted 1991 kidnapping accessory assault four young men. She sentenced six years jail, paid dlrs 3,200 fine appeal. The ANC official among prominent anti-apartheid activists. The two generals implicated Truth Commission testimony. Prosecutors ready move forward pending amnesty application one. Torturers bombers carried atrocities defending fighting apartheid need counseling ensure repeat crimes, expert South Africa's reconciliation body said Thursday. Addressing local international experts, Charles Villa-Vicencio, research head Truth Reconciliation Commission, said ignoring psychological needs carried human rights abuses could alienate potentially dangerous sector society. We must give attention healing perpetrators, sake perpetrators, sake nation whole, said. The conference, organized Medical Research Council, examining mental health issues raised Truth Commission, charged probing crimes committed sides anti-apartheid struggle. As commission prepares hand final report end month, South Africans examining painful traumatic exploration bloody past. With power grant amnesty many tortured, bombed maimed innocent civilians, process stage angered people nearly walks life. Many whites see panel favoring black liberation movements, many blacks accuse soft former state officials, especially top ranking ministers. However, Villa-Vicencio appealed tolerance dealing committed crimes, saying potential wrongdoing existed everyone. We all, entire human race, carry us capacity evil, said. Many Thursday's speakers touched figure police death squad leader Eugene de Kock, given jail terms totaling 200 years killing spree costs dozens lives. De Kock applied amnesty crimes. Dan Stein, specialist neurobiology stress disorders, said de Kock typified many killers sides conflict sheer banality evil. Many people found interviews ordinary, even likeable person, said man subordinates dubbed Prime Evil. Ginn Fourie, physiotherapist whose student daughter gunned black activists 1993 attack Cape Town bar, said necessary help whose circumstances compelled wrong. Struggling control tears, Fourie told delegates attended amnesty hearings daughter's killers supported successful bid freed long jail sentences. After describing hugged three members black nationalist Pan-Africanist Congress urged seek counseling together victims, Fourie earned standing ovation 50-strong audience. We must take initiative understanding others start process reconciliation healing broken land, said, voice shaking emotion. The New York Times said editorial Sunday, Nov. 1: The 3,500-page report South African Truth Reconciliation Commission, released Thursday, comprehensive unsparing examination nation's ugly past commission yet produced. Drawing commission's investigations testimony hundreds applicants amnesty 20,000 victims, report detailed look crimes apartheid era, blames successive white governments vast majority. It fulfilled mandate telling fullest truth possible, one reason every political party South Africa denounced it. Besides accusing government assassinations bombings, report criticizes Inkatha Freedom Party massacres collaboration security forces, blames African National Congress murder civilians crimes. It singles former President P.W. Botha, Chief Mangosuthu Buthelezi, Inkatha leader, Winnie Mandela, among others, detailed treatment roles political crimes. One major flaw report absence section accusing F.W. de Klerk, last apartheid president, knowing several bombings fact keeping silent. It excised de Klerk suing commission. The ANC also sued, unsuccessfully, stop publication. The lawsuits disappointing sign South Africa's political parties interested honest look past, free flow information. The controversy added widespread complaints commission helped process reconciliation. This wrong. True reconciliation  occurs society longer paralyzed past people work live together  cannot based silence. No society restored health papering much pain South Africans suffered. A noisy informed debate complicity crimes apartheid era necessary, uncomfortable. The report part Truth Commission's contribution healing process. The hearings themselves, allowed victims human rights violations tell stories public, helped country heal opened eyes many whites unpleasant truth apartheid. The amnesty process, permitting many important criminals escape justice, allowing families know exactly happened loved ones dozens cases would likely never gone trial South Africa's fragile judicial system. The process helping victims scholarships necessary aid goes on, although enough. No commission transform society twisted South Africa's was. But Truth Commission best effort world seen, South Africa better it. The deal South Africa's Truth Reconciliation Commission offered simple enough: Confess crimes, apply amnesty go free. If come forward, prosecuted. After two years hearings apartheid-era atrocities, commission last week unveiled 3,500-page report naming dozens people believes elbows gore never applied amnesty. So prosecutions begin soon, right? Not fast. The study barely hands President Nelson Mandela talk new amnesty deals begun. It seems nearly South Africa's political parties  including ruling African National Congress  key officials could end dock report. Suddenly, lots talk country can't withstand round politically divisive trials, many political analysts betting agreement mutual benefit offing. Already, three major political parties calling kind new amnesty, ANC closing door. ANC spokesman Thabo Masebe said premature talk general amnesty, acknowledged party discussing amnesty specifically tailored violence black South Africans blacks littered KwaZulu/Natal province bodies late '80s '90s. In choosing truth commission rather Nuremberg-style trial close brutal past, South Africa hoped idealistic reconciliation. People would come clean receive true forgiveness. Society would able move on, wounds cleansed healed. It model watched closely around world societies wondering disentangle grudges brutal past. But given chance, hundreds South Africa's perpetrators come forward. Commission officials say frustrated lack cooperation, however exhaustive report may seem. It perhaps late, however, press more. Today's South Africa urgent new problems deal  unemployment, crime, white flight, schools hospitals. So may wind settling pragmatic reconciliation  one gives amnesty unrepentant simply practical concerned move on. In recent years, truth commissions gained popularity many places, notably Chile, Argentina El Salvador. But South Africa's  biggest powerful, able grant amnesty subpoena witnesses  supposed real test. Certainly commission forced nation see gruesome details past, sobbing survivors stone-faced torturers told smashed genitals near suffocations. And commission's work added much knowledge happened South Africa 1960 1994. But years effect commission truly judged. Has anyone really forgiven anyone else? Will vendettas persist? No one answer. One thing seems clear, however: Four years South Africa held first non-racial elections, growing number South Africans want done past. Raymond Louw, publisher respected weekly newsletter, Southern Africa Report, says new amnesty proposal could come February session Parliament, time remove issue next year's election campaigns. You simply can't country torn apart prosecutions, says. Everybody going howling amnesty. They already are. Even Archbishop Desmond Tutu, commission's chairman, delivered report, seemed anticipating push new amnesty arguing it. He said move would highly unfair came forward. He suggested instead two-year time limit, anyone indicted would effect get amnesty. To sure, opposition proposals limit prosecutions. More dozen human rights victims advocacy groups already banded together condemn proposals unconscionable. The idea Truth Commission emerged compromise long negotiations brought South Africa's peaceful transition white supremacist state non-racial democracy. During talks, white National Party government pushed blanket amnesty, ANC refused. In end, 250 former police officers came forward, foot soldiers. And two high National Party officials, former Law Order Minister Adriaan Vlok Police Commissioner Johan van der Merwe, confessed  roles ordering bombings. In report, commission called apartheid state primary perpetrator gross human rights violations held high ranking former officials former President P.W. Botha, former army chief, Georg Meiring, former intelligence chief, Niel Barnard, responsible. These men, others lower rank, applied amnesty For ANC, embarrassing prospect possible prosecution Mandela's former wife, Winnie Madikizela-Mandela, accused report taking part number assaults abductions. Lesser-known officials could face charges too. The ANC held responsible least 76 deaths KwaZulu/Natal. The ANC's problems complicated efforts make peace largely Zulu-based Inkatha Freedom Party. Virtually one party came forward ask amnesty. Yet report found Inkatha, working white government, responsible widespread slaughter KwaZulu/Natal townships around Johannesburg. Inkatha's leader, Chief Mangosuthu Buthelezi, many key party officials stand accused fomenting wide range abuses. But prosecuting Chief Buthelezi could lead new warfare KwaZulu. Part reluctance go forward prosecutions may result still another factor: The judicial system already overwhelmed rising crime evidence apartheid era old. So spend time money? At moment, one political party opposed form new amnesty  tiny influential Democratic Party, liberal group involved violence. Its head, Tony Leon, says new amnesty would prove thuglike behavior, get away with. But concedes lonely voice. At point, says, little enthusiasm anything closing book past. A panel probing apartheid-era abuses accused African National Congress human rights violations, including torture bomb attacks, state broadcaster said Monday. The ANC, led struggle white rule power, previously acknowledged told expect implication right violations. The Truth Reconciliation Commission release final report 2 1-2 years investigation Thursday. The report expected place overwhelming blame era's abuses white governments brutal security services. President Nelson Mandela's office received advance copy Monday ahead handover ceremony, retired Archbishop Desmond Tutu, chaired comission, present Mandela report. South African Broadcasting Corp. radio said leaked preliminary document condemns ANC politically morally responsible gross human rights violations fall apartheid. An ANC spokesman, Thabo Masebe, said believed news report referred commission letter sent advance informing us intention implicate ANC gross human rights violations. Commission officials could immediately reached comment. Justice Minister Dullah Omar told journalists Pretoria heard news report, would comment. Former President F.W. de Klerk, meanwhile, plans ask court prevent Truth Commission report implicating covering state-sponsored terror. Obviously comply ruling court, Omar said, added would regret court-ordered delay. The ANC nervous enough report request meeting commissioners earlier month. The panel refused, avoid appearing embarrassed. The party says accusations likely would center planting land mines border farms, abuses military camps Angola bombings. Omar said expected report's conclusions set debate added would lay basis reconciliation. President Nelson Mandela acknowledged Saturday African National Congress violated human rights apartheid, setting odds deputy president report divided much South Africa. The disagreement stems Thursday's release report Truth Reconciliation Commission horrors committed apartheid. Rather act salve aid reconciliation, report caused divisiveness, even among former comrades-in-arms fought apartheid. As expected, report called apartheid crime humanity. But also blamed ANC gross human rights violations anti-apartheid struggle, saying group tortured suspected spies dissidents killed innocent civilians land mines bombs. Some suspected traitors killed ANC's camps abroad. Mbeki  became ANC president last year likely elected South Africa's next president 1999 Mandela retires  took hard line Saturday report, indicated ANC members must same.

These percentages five times greater percentages heterosexual respondents. The survey conducted 58 high schools Massachusetts Department Education. In separate study nearly 500 community college students San Francisco area, 32 percent male respondents said verbally threatened gay people 18 percent said physically threatened assaulted gay people. The study conducted year Karen Franklin, forensic psychologist researcher University Washington.

On Monday, hours Shepard's death, two gay organizations, Rainbow Chorus Lambda Community Center, received identical messages applauding Shepard's murder. The messages closed words: I hope happens often. Matthew Shepard, gay college student kidnapped severely beaten, died Monday, five days found unconscious Wyoming ranch left tied fence 18 hours near-freezing temperatures. His death, announced Poudre Valley Hospital here, fanned outrage followed word last week's attack, spawning nationwide vigils, producing call federal hate-crimes legislation President Clinton fueling debates laws host Western states, including Wyoming, resisted them. From Denver University Maryland, people turned honor The slight, soft-spoken 21-year-old Shepard, freshman University Wyoming, became overnight symbol anti-gay violence found dangling fence passerby. Two men two women charged case. The men charged attempted murder expected face first-degree murder charges could bring death penalty. There incredible symbolism tied fence, said Rebecca Isaacs, political director National Gay Lesbian Task Force Washington. People likened scarecrow. But sounded like crucifixion. Gay leaders hope  Christian conservatives fear  Shepard's death galvanize Congress state legislatures pass hate-crime legislation broaden existing laws. Conservatives generally oppose laws favor one group's rights another. In last two decades, 21 states District Columbia passed laws increase penalties crimes committed person's race, religion, color, national origin, sexual orientation. Another 19 states, including Colorado, include sexual orientation hate-crime laws. Ten states, including Wyoming, hate-crime laws all. In Washington, Clinton responded news Shepard's death urging Congress pass federal Hate Crimes Protection Act, would make federal offenses crimes based sex, disability sexual orientation. Wyoming one nation's holdouts, rejecting three hate crimes bills since 1994, recently February. But Monday, Shepard's death, Gov. Jim Geringer appealed lawmakers reconsider opposition. I ask collective suggestion anti-bias, anti-hate legislation presented Wyoming Legislature consideration January, Geringer said. The governor met Monday morning Dennis Shepard, slain student's father, said elder Shepard want son's death become media circus use Matt agenda. Geringer said Shepard's father also said: Don't rush passing kinds new hate-crimes laws. Be careful changes sure taking away rights others process race this. Leaders gay rights groups interviewed Monday said would respect family's privacy attending burial Casper, Wyo., Saturday. But added hoped death would impact legislators around nation. Matthew's death, I hope, bring better deeper understanding hate crime laws, said Elizabeth Birch, executive director Human Rights Campaign, lesbian gay rights group 250,000 members. Matthew's death may lead awakening Wyoming United States Congress need legislation. In 1996, 21 men women killed United States sexual orientation, according Southern Poverty Law Center, Alabama group tracks violence minorities. According FBI, sexual orientation factor 11.6 percent 8,759 hate crimes recorded 1996. But Christian conservatives warn gay leaders want use Shepard's death expand hate rights laws curtail freedom speech. Hate crimes laws nothing perpetrators violent crime everything silencing political opposition, said Steven Schwalm, analyst Family Research Council, Washington group dedicated defending faith, family freedom. It would criminalize pro-family beliefs, Schwalm said. This basically sends message can't disagree political message homosexual activists. Agreement came John Paulk, featured summer series advertisements wife, Anne, overcame homosexuality religious conversion. We every right speak agenda contrary Biblical norms, said Paulk, describes homosexuality specialist Focus Family, Christian group Colorado Springs, Colo. Because standing opposing homosexual agenda, looked upon advocating violence homosexuals, categorically reject violence homosexuals. Last Thursday, Family Research Council unveiled series television advertisements preach healing homosexuality religious conversion. Gay leaders charge advertisements help create hostile climate homosexuals, climate lead violence. Hate crime laws books 40 states impinged freedom speech, said Brian Levin, criminal justice professor directs Center Hate Extremism Stockton College, Pomona, N.J. Instead, said, hate crime laws send clear message society tolerate attacks minorities. We want deter broken windows simple assaults escalate, said. Referring murders homosexuals, added: These crimes preventable. Offenders get emboldened punished first time. Levin said research indicated homosexuals suffered higher rates violent crime population large. He also said roughly half people attack homosexuals male, aged 22 younger. The two men charged killing Shephard white, Russell Henderson, 21, Aaron McKinney, 22. With crimes, violence means end. With hate crimes, violence becomes unstoppable goal, Levin said. Shepard suffered dozen cuts around head, face neck, well massive blow back skull. Because social stature society, gays often viewed appropriate targets, Levin added. Citing need hate crime laws send clear message gay bashers, Levin said: The discourse society leaves many people believe socially acceptable. While gay leaders saw crucifixion imagery Shepard's death, others saw different symbolism: Old West practice nailing dead coyote ranch fence warning future intruders. This University Wyoming student beaten left die, tied fence like animal honest open gay, Beatrice Dorhn, legal director Lambda Legal Defense Education Fund, said Monday, Matthew Shepard's horrible suffering death cannot dismissed simply fault deranged, isolated individuals. His attackers among millions Americans constantly hear message gay people worthy basic equal treatment, Ms. Dorhn said. On day Americans learned last week Matthew Shepard, 5-foot-2, 105-pound gay college student, tortured, strung like animal left die fence outside Laramie, Wyo., Family Research Council co-hosting press conference Washington. It latest salvo six-month campaign religious right, tacit, even explicit, approval Republican leaders, demonize gay people political gain election year. This particular press conference announce new barrage ads  TV follow-up summer print campaign  alleged former homosexuals changed implore others likewise power Jesus Christ. The commercials, gooey style, end slogan: It's hate ... It's hope. But really stirring fear produces hate. If ads truly aimed gay people, broadcast extravagant cost wide general audience reached TV, trumpeted Washington, insuring free national exposure, three weeks Election Day. The ads themselves, despite sugar-coating hope, ooze malice. In one them, homosexuality linked drug addiction certain death AIDS; implicitly posit homosexuality disease need cure. Matthew Shepard cured, that's sure. As uncle, R.W. Eaton, told The Denver Post, 21-year-old Matt, aspired career diplomacy human rights, small person big heart, mind soul someone tried beat him. Of nephew's shattered body Eaton said, It's like something might see war. And war is. Go Family Research Council's Web site find proud description readiness wage war homosexual agenda fight maintain traditional meaning `family.' The head Family Research Council Gary Bauer, GOP power broker putative presidential candidate, disingenuously goes talk shows say organization hates one deplores violence. But wage well-financed media air war people innate difference sexual orientation ceaselessly branded sinful diseased un-American seekers special rights, ground war follow. It's story old history. Once group successfully scapegoated subhuman threat normal values propaganda machine, emboldened thugs take over. Two weeks James Byrd savagely dragged death pickup truck Texas June, I wrote column ugly incident outside GOP state convention Fort Worth, mob threatened group gay Log Cabin Republicans protesting discriminatory treatment party. The gay-bashers directly preceded steady saber-rattling Republican politicians: Sen. James Inhofe Oklahoma likened James Hormel, gay nominee ambassadorship, David Duke; Pat Robertson wondered TV God might wreak havoc Disney World Gay Days; Texas GOP spokesman likened Log Cabin Ku Klux Klan. Just two days near-brush violence Fort Worth, Trent Lott TV seconding religious right's condemnation gay people sinful sick.

Gay leaders hope  Christian conservatives fear  Shepard's death galvanize Congress state legislatures pass hate-crime legislation broaden existing laws. Conservatives generally oppose laws favor one group's rights another. In last two decades, 21 states District Columbia passed laws increase penalties crimes committed person's race, religion, color, national origin, sexual orientation. Another 19 states, including Colorado, include sexual orientation hate-crime laws. Ten states, including Wyoming, hate-crime laws all. In Washington, Clinton responded news Shepard's death urging Congress pass federal Hate Crimes Protection Act, would make federal offenses crimes based sex, disability sexual orientation. Wyoming one nation's holdouts, rejecting three hate crimes bills since 1994, recently February. But Monday, Shepard's death, Gov. Jim Geringer appealed lawmakers reconsider opposition. I ask collective suggestion anti-bias, anti-hate legislation presented Wyoming Legislature consideration January, Geringer said. The governor met Monday morning Dennis Shepard, slain student's father, said elder Shepard want son's death become media circus use Matt agenda. Geringer said Shepard's father also said: Don't rush passing kinds new hate-crimes laws. Be careful changes sure taking away rights others process race this. Leaders gay rights groups interviewed Monday said would respect family's privacy attending burial Casper, Wyo., Saturday. But added hoped death would impact legislators around nation. Matthew's death, I hope, bring better deeper understanding hate crime laws, said Elizabeth Birch, executive director Human Rights Campaign, lesbian gay rights group 250,000 members. Matthew's death may lead awakening Wyoming United States Congress need legislation. In 1996, 21 men women killed United States sexual orientation, according Southern Poverty Law Center, Alabama group tracks violence minorities. According FBI, sexual orientation factor 11.6 percent 8,759 hate crimes recorded 1996. But Christian conservatives warn gay leaders want use Shepard's death expand hate rights laws curtail freedom speech. Hate crimes laws nothing perpetrators violent crime everything silencing political opposition, said Steven Schwalm, analyst Family Research Council, Washington group dedicated defending faith, family freedom. It would criminalize pro-family beliefs, Schwalm said. This basically sends message can't disagree political message homosexual activists. Agreement came John Paulk, featured summer series advertisements wife, Anne, overcame homosexuality religious conversion. We every right speak agenda contrary Biblical norms, said Paulk, describes homosexuality specialist Focus Family, Christian group Colorado Springs, Colo. Because standing opposing homosexual agenda, looked upon advocating violence homosexuals, categorically reject violence homosexuals. Last Thursday, Family Research Council unveiled series television advertisements preach healing homosexuality religious conversion. Gay leaders charge advertisements help create hostile climate homosexuals, climate lead violence. Hate crime laws books 40 states impinged freedom speech, said Brian Levin, criminal justice professor directs Center Hate Extremism Stockton College, Pomona, N.J. Instead, said, hate crime laws send clear message society tolerate attacks minorities. We want deter broken windows simple assaults escalate, said. Referring murders homosexuals, added: These crimes preventable. Offenders get emboldened punished first time. Levin said research indicated homosexuals suffered higher rates violent crime population large. He also said roughly half people attack homosexuals male, aged 22 younger. With crimes, violence means end. With hate crimes, violence becomes unstoppable goal, Levin said. Shepard suffered dozen cuts around head, face neck, well massive blow back skull. Because social stature society, gays often viewed appropriate targets, Levin added. Citing need hate crime laws send clear message gay bashers, Levin said: The discourse society leaves many people believe socially acceptable.

Erez took efforts form government last week veteran leftist Bulent Ecevit gave up, unable convince Turkey's bickering center-left center-right parties join coalition excluded Islamic-oriented party. Erez opened talks various party leaders Monday. He got support center-right leader Mesut Yilmaz, said party supported Erez long Ecevit's backing. As long sensitivity toward secular, democratic regime taken account, best help form new government ensure gets vote confidence, Ecevit said talks Erez. Turkey's strongly secular military opposed deal would bring Virtue power. It pressured Virtue's predecessor, Welfare Party, power last year. Erez supposed talk Tuesday center-right Tansu Ciller Deniz Baykal, leads center-left party. I optimistic every meeting, Erez told reporters meeting party leaders. Turkey trying form new government since coalition government led Yilmaz collapsed last month allegations rigged sale bank. Yilmaz acting premier. A week Turkish government fell corruption scandal, President Suleyman Demirel Wednesday asked veteran left-wing politician known personal honesty, Bulent Ecevit, form new government. Ecevit, served prime minister three times 1970s, said would immediately begin working fashion government could command majority faction-ridden Parliament. He also suggested although Parliament set April 18 date new election, might seek remain power longer period. It wrong see government simply election government, said. There problems wait election. Military commanders, hold ultimate power Turkey, quietly told senior political figures, including Demirel, want quick election. They fear produce Parliament divided present one, perhaps Islamic-oriented Virtue Party largest bloc. The commanders also hoping exclude two country's leading politicians, outgoing Prime Minister Mesut Yilmaz former Prime Minister Tansu Ciller, neither trust, posts new government. Ecevit must try build government includes center-right parties individuals. In meeting week country's senior policy-making body, National Security Council, military officers strong say, set three priorities coming months. It said whatever government emerges forthcoming negotiations dedicate fighting religious fundamentalism, Kurdish nationalism criminal gangs infiltrated state apparatus. Among Ecevit's immediate challenges resolve political crisis Italy broke last month Kurdish rebel leader Abdullah Ocalan arrested Rome asked political asylum there. Turkey wants Ocalan sent trial, Italy says cannot extradite long Turkey retains death penalty. Ecevit (pronounced EH-che-vit) among senior Turkish politicians favors abolition capital punishment. Together Demirel, Ecevit often cited Turks complain continued dominance geriatric political elite here. He 73 politics adult life. Early career Ecevit emerged spokesman Turkey's downtrodden masses. Perhaps figure, legitimized social democratic ideology climate leftist sympathies often considered subversive. At time, however, shown fierce nationalist. He prime minister Turkey sent troops occupy northern Cyprus 1974 still considered hard-liner Cyprus. He also uncompromising opposition Kurdish nationalism. During terms prime minister 1970s, Ecevit successfully undermined efforts move Turkey toward membership European Union, called European Economic Community. He considered instrument capitalist exploitation. Ecevit also disturbed United States flirting anti-Western ideologies. In early 1990s, interval worked journalist, traveled Iraq wrote series articles favorable Saddam Hussein. He recently called better relations Turkey Iraq, maintains anti-imperialist positions suspicion capitalism developed 1960s. The Democratic Socialist Party, Ecevit heads, closely held family fiefdom. He wife carefully screen applicants membership veto whose personal loyalty Ecevit suspect. During terms prime minister '70s, Ecevit appear consensus builder, said Ilter Turan, professor political science Bilgi University Istanbul. It seems nowadays accommodating, perspective may bad choice. On many issues Turkish society encountering now, represents orientation seem totally tune times, Turan said. That would include position issues like privatization, integrating Turkey fully international system, devolution central authority. He failed grasp world heading. He looks analyzes world categories longer useful appropriate. Almost alone among Turkish politicians, Ecevit lives modestly avoided hint personal financial scandal. He speaks fluent English, reading tastes run poetry intellectual journals The New York Review Books. He translated works T.S. Eliot Turkish published several volumes poems. Opposition parties lodged no-confidence motions Wednesday Prime Minister Mesut Yilmaz allegations interfered privatization bank helped businessman linked mobster. Yilmaz' minority government could go the small, center-left Republican Party, usually gives majority needs parliament, votes him. The leader Republicans, Deniz Baykal, urged Yilmaz resign. But premier vowed Wednesday stay on, saying victim conspiracy. This plot can't reason resignation, Yilmaz said, adding intended continue struggle organized crime. Afterward, Baykal said Republicans would support no-confidence motion. The leader Democratic Turkey Party, Husamettin Cindoruk, said party might withdraw governing coalition. He said party would announce decision Thursday. The political turmoil sent Istanbul stock market plunging 14.9 percent. Premier-designate Bulent Ecevit said Thursday would persist difficult task convincing key party leader join forces secular coalition. Ecevit, asked form new government Wednesday, desperately needs support 99 deputies ex-premier Tansu Ciller's center-right party. Ecevit, veteran leftist, already support another center-right party led Mesut Yilmaz, whose government collapsed last week weight mafia scandal. Mrs. Ciller said would back Ecevit-led government long-standing rivalry Yilmaz makes Ecevit's job coalition-building difficult. I give easily, neither I lose hope easily, Ecevit told parliamentary group Thursday. Mrs. Ciller could lose grassroot support stands way new government, political columnist Ertugrul Ozkok wrote Thursday daily Hurriyet. This could put odds classic support base. Ecevit expected meet Yilmaz Thursday, party leaders Friday. Turkey's secular parties pressure join forces keep Islamic Virtue Party power.

It's difficult here; I depend God, said, praying several moments decide whether talk reporter. The bombings, fiery rhetoric abortion opponents posters bloody fetuses may capture attention news media, people like Mrs. Lotempio foot soldiers abortion battle. They call street counselors come clinic whenever believe abortions performed. They pray talk women, hoping change minds. Some scream profanities. Others, like Mrs. Lotempio, denounce violence doctors clinics, also blocking doors shouting ugly epithets clinic workers patients. For approximately 80 abortion opponents here, protest like job political activity. There schedule. People count show up. Mrs. Lotempio, mother three grandmother six, connects involvement conversation 1970s helped friend decide abort unwanted pregnancy. Two decades later, haunted question: whether fetus male female.

Most protesters, including Mrs. Lotempio, among thousands people arrested 1992, height anti-abortion activity Buffalo. But Operation Rescue returns, planned, Spring Life reunion April, Mrs. Lotempio said, there. Instead, plans stay church pray, avoid militancy says finds uncomfortable. Glenn Murray, lawyer Womenservices clinic, said: When people town show up, feel danger. The local people known quantity. We know local people name. Buffalo among handful hot spots abortion protesters last decade. It heavily Catholic city thousands protesters around country demonstrated two weeks 1992. They failed close abortion clinics, 500 people arrested rallies snarled traffic drew national headlines. Those rallies, well earlier protests continuing sidewalk vigils, impact, people sides abortion issue say. The number clinics performing abortions Buffalo area dropped one three. And Slepian's death retirement week another doctor, two doctors area abortions form significant part practices. The daily demonstrators count progress. But perch outside clinic means witness far believe murders call rescues. About 30 women day might go clinic. After eight years, Mrs. Lotempio count eight women changed minds get abortions clinic. Inside clinic, protests make hard job harder, many clinic workers say. While demonstrators simply repeat rosary, protesters call patients drive parking lot behind building, walk fortresslike front.

While veterans civic leaders devote Wednesday's national holiday honoring fallen soldiers, Remembrance Day become chilling vigil Canadians front lines abortion-rights movement. There immediate fear, anti-abortion gunman believed large. And long-term anxiety, even country abortions legal publicly funded, women may find access diminishing. There speculation sniper's timing linked Remembrance Day anti-abortion activists use day commemorate aborted fetuses. Three times since 1994, sniper used time year fire home Canadian doctor performs abortion, time wounding target. The attacks spread across Canada  Ontario, Manitoba British Columbia. U.S. Canadian investigators believe attacks linked two shootings abortion-providing doctors upstate New York, including Oct. 23 slaying Dr. Barnett Slepian home near Buffalo. An American anti-abortion activist, James Kopp, wanted questioning shootings. Police say know side border on, fueling uneasiness clinics hospitals throughout Canada. You must realize Canada largest undefended border world, said Keith McCaskill, police inspector Winnipeg, Manitoba, spokesman investigation. Many women's clinics tightened security, doctors provide abortions urged take precautions. I would suggest extremely aware day-to-day goings on, whether business day hours, said Toronto Detective Rick Stubbings. Across Canada, reports obstetrician-gynecologists modifying practices deciding stop performing abortions. Some wear bulletproof vests hang sheets windows homes. Abortion-rights groups say doctors backing down. There's great deal sadness, said Susan Fox, director clinic Edmonton, Alberta, provides abortions. But there's also feeling determination deterred scared actions. Marilyn Wilson, executive director Canadian Abortion Rights Action League, sees long-term threat fear violence may intimidate young doctors entering field. There almost doctors stopped performing procedures, even current reign terror, said. But young doctors families necessarily want this. They may willing put lives risk. The abortion debate one several factors contributing shortage obstetrician-gynecologists Canada. The national society oversees speciality says 1,400 doctors field, shortfall 600, 50s 60s. The society says long hours limits fees paid public health-care system causing burnout deterring medical school graduates choose specialty. Another problem Canadian medical schools offer training abortion. Women Canada's big cities generally adequate access abortions. Those rural areas often face long journeys, province Prince Edward Island prohibits abortions six hospitals, forcing women travel New Brunswick Nova Scotia. Abortion-rights groups say situation would improve RU-486 abortion pill available Canada. No drug company applied permission market pill, either fearing boycotts doubting profitability. The government urged make public appeal drug companies, health department says can't done. It would conflict interest, said Bonnie Fox-McIntyre, department spokeswoman. As regulator stay arm's length, judge application impartially. Abortion illegal Canada 1988. Now abortion law sort, 100,000 abortions performed annually, polls indicate roughly three-quarters Canadians favor pro-choice policies. Yet public support spare doctors fear. Dr. Henry Morgentaler, led efforts overturn old abortion law whose Toronto clinic bombed 1993, says colleagues sacrificing personal freedom reluctantly increase security measures. Unfortunately, doctors committed providing services accept certain diminishment enjoyment life, said. In aftermath last month's deadly sniper attack obstetrician upstate New York, Attorney General Janet Reno announced last week setting new investigative unit examine possibility doctor victim broader anti-abortion plot. The unit, National Clinic Violence Task Force, include dozen Justice Department lawyers involve several law-enforcement agencies. But main work looking shooting Dr. Barnett Slepian suburban Buffalo home fits larger pattern organized violence done FBI, jurisdiction domestic terrorism. For many FBI, that's problem. In contrast old image gung-ho FBI agents turning surveillance machinery political groups, number senior FBI agents privately expressed misgivings attorney general's latest task force, second ordered begin broad investigation conspiracy involving anti-abortion violence. FBI officials fear expanding investigation could drive agency ill-defined boundary separates inquiries criminal activity political causes unpopular ideas. Today's agents eager disassociate old J. Edgar Hoover days trampling civil rights political dissidents guise serious investigations. They want agency drawn middle bitter ideological war anti-abortion groups abortion rights advocates, long asserted existence organized campaign clinics doctors. Many calling government help subjects FBI interest anti-war civil rights activists. Senior agency officials, including Director Louis Freeh, starting careers early 1970s watched dismay FBI shaken revelations Cointelpro, counterintelligence program allowed agents spy on, burgle, wiretap infiltrate anti-war civil rights groups like Students Democratic Society Student Nonviolence Coordinating Committee. Some officials dubious conspiracy exists kill doctors perform abortions. They came empty handed Reno ordered first federal inquiry 1994 killing Florida doctor bodyguard. The Justice Department conducted two-year grand jury investigation; agents pursued anti-abortion activists using surveillance teams. But investigators never found specific plot abortion clinics staff members. Violence abortion clinics part problem. The FBI recent years found thrown minefield politically tinged cases involving volatile worlds anti-government militias, environmental Christian extremists, white separatists, animal rights activists Islamic fundamentalists. The FBI quick jump investigating crime investigating political association, said David Cole, law professor Georgetown University. When move investigating crimes investigating groups, all-important nexus criminal conduct gets lost, focus gets broader broader start sweeping kinds lawful political activity. In response terrorist attacks like bombings World Trade Center 1993, Oklahoma City federal building 1995 Olympic park Atlanta 1996, agency increased efforts deter incidents major prevention program. In cases, Justice Department, FBI law enforcement agencies said operate domestic security guidelines require investigators find reasonable indication group planning break law open inquiry organization. Before authorities use intrusive tactics wiretapping property searches, must specific evidence. Yet FBI agents throughout country quietly evaluated threat posed variety extremist groups links local authorities informal interviews leaders groups. Their conclusion groups pose little real danger. Much difficult investigate lone terrorists inflamed oratory extremist ideology belong group, drifting along society's frayed margins, grid, agents describe it, without usual ties family, friends work. The profile fits Eric Robert Rudolph, fugitive wanted bombings Atlanta Olympics, gay nightclub two abortion clinics. He kept beliefs mostly himself, although acquaintances hint familiar religious extremism hate groups. In contrast, James Charles Kopp, sought material witness killing Slepian, left trail clues motives. He early follower Randall Terry, leader Operation Rescue. Later, Kopp associated Lambs Christ, another militant anti-abortion group. One law-enforcement official said government best. We investigate violations, said. We investigate groups. Everyone knew Dr. Barnett Slepian knew slight, graying physician endured measure stress would exhaust, even break, people. There strangers pawed garbage cans home growled murderer passed grocery store aisle. Demonstrators assailed pregnant patients arrived office checkups, calling baby killer. Outside clinic performed abortions two days week, pickets shouted epithets like pig face. Slepian, obstetrician gynecologist training abortion doctor principle, rarely acknowledged strain. He might crack occasional joke expense protesters shadowed work weekends. Then would something unexpected, like invite anti-abortion leader breakfast stop chat familiar demonstrator outside clinic. So killed Oct. 23 sniper's bullet fired kitchen window home Buffalo, N.Y., suburbs, furtive execution fit pattern four earlier attacks abortion providers western New York state Canada, friends relatives wondered much Slepian's work could arouse murderous violence. He predicted much himself. Instead, wondered, again, persisted work, long Buffalo doctors surrendered pressure abortion opponents. He incredibly fatalistic person thought number's up, up, nothing it, said H. Amanda Robb, doctor's 32-year-old niece. And incredibly stubborn. He said women right comprehensive health care since women's doctor, going provide them. Slepian third doctor killed last five years bombings shootings killed 7 people wounded 17 abortion clinics around nation. To tormentors, simply abortion doctor. To members abortion rights movement, martyr cause. But Slepian far either. In interviews friends family members, emerges one-dimensional abstract  conservative advocated old-fashioned values like self-reliance, shy man rare flashes anger, doctor performed abortions patience women multiple abortions women multiple children want could support. He killed performed medical procedure become emotional politicized. Yet nothing life suggest crusader either politics medicine. Rather, obstinate, unassuming man remarkable thing. Out contrariness conscience, say knew him, refused allow anyone dictate kind doctor be, that, paid life. The clues Slepian's flinty brand commitment lie, part, upbringing. His family took success granted even teetered edge poverty. To earn money medical school, shoveled muck ranch drove taxi. He made friends, friends life. When wives sick, called repeatedly. When lonely, flew side. Slepian, known Bart, used tell people chose obstetrics specialty exposes doctor least suffering, performed abortions legal alternatives much worse. Slepian often expressed exasperation women came abortion abortion. Don't get it? clinic staff recall saying once. He impatience women like remembered residency inner-city Buffalo, child child means support. He contempt somebody pulled bootstraps made world, Ms. Robb said. He believed ban abortions or, shameful view, stop teaching young doctors perform them, would correct human imperfections found irritating. There 1.5 million abortions performed country, niece said, felt we're equipped handle 1.5 million unwanted children. When killed, age 52, Bart Slepian owned imposing red brick home quiet suburb Amherst, complete swimming pool piped-in music assortment time-saving gadgets adored. Slepian's trajectory comfortable doctor's life unconventional. His grandfather, Russian Jewish immigrant started selling shoelaces pushcart Boston, propelled five sons Harvard time Jews met university's blue-blood standards. His father, turn, decreed three sons would doctors earn Ph.D's. We grew home tremendous, tremendous, tremendous respect education, said Serena Robb, Slepian's sister, four years older him. If got A, OK If got B, got yelled at. The family's means match expectations. Slepian's father, Philip, joined father's business manufacturing leather soles shoes. Soon Bart born 1946 Boston, company failed, save money, father moved family six in-laws' apartment McKeesport, Pa., Rochester, N.Y. Once settled, Slepian's father set freelance writer, crisscrossing country old Studebaker, researching origins prominent citizens Library Congress writing stories small-town newspapers. He sold articles hundreds, still writing death nine years ago age 93. The success expected Bart Slepian come easily. As child, shy cried anyone looked him, sister recalled. An unexceptional student, went local community college transferring University Denver, majored zoology. Rejected medical schools United States  fate two three applicants late 1960s  studied one year Belgium enrolled Autonomous University Medicine Guadalajara, Mexico. His friends remember funny obstinate, thin young man glasses receding hairline beat comers arm-wrestling pool. Bart certain beliefs, strongly held, said Richard Schwarz, old classmate internist Long Island. He always said sit around whining things, Schwarz said. He would say, `Go what's what's right.' Bart Slepian's determination surfaced quirky ways. He insisted going top World Trade Center, despite crippling fear heights. To get window, crawled, inch inch. I said, `You this,'  recalled Schwarz, time. And said, `I want it.' Bart made count. He felt alive. Forced drop school every semesters work, lived Reno sister Serena, widow struggling take care two young daughters. She worked waitress blackjack dealer, sharing tips drove cab, cleaned barns ranch worked laboratory assistant local Veterans Administration hospital. After graduation, moved Buffalo medical residency. There married Lynne Breitbart, registered nurse 10 years junior, scraped together money buy obstetrics practice doctor retire. He soothing, unhurried manner. When patient his, Patti Durlak, diagnosed diabetes, Slepian referred specialist called every days months help overcome fear needles use insulin injections. The doctor said, `Just deal it,' Mrs. Durlak recalled. Not Dr. Slepian. In ways, typical suburban family man, working six days week spending free time Little League games county fairs four sons. But late 1980s, abortion doctors Buffalo siege. In one notorious 1991 incident recorded videotape, Rev. Paul Schenck, one fieriest Buffalo's anti-abortion leaders, threw front doctor's car pulled clinic driveway. Slepian parked street. As pushed way crowd chanting demonstrators, Schenck cupped hands around mouth lunged, shouting, Slepian, pig! Slepian's attempts separate abortion conflict private life futile. The protests followed home man bashful boy found himself, uncomfortably, center controversy attention. Once, showed anger. In 1988, demonstrators jeered sidewalk front home opened Hanukkah presents children, doctor came brandishing baseball bat. He denied hurt anyone, town judge ordered repair one protester's smashed van window pay portion another's medical bills. The outburst surprised family friends. It Slepian's style make public fuss, much less acknowledge stress taunted protesters. Stress? oldest brother Paul responded gruffly asked doctor's mood. I never heard word used family, except engineering term. He said nuisance. Mrs. Slepian respond requests interview. She expressed rage The Buffalo News shortly shooting. She said whoever killed husband deserved death penalty would happy administer lethal injection herself. She also spoke Schenck's brother, Robert, another anti-abortion leader frequently confronted Slepian, sent bouquet flowers. Mrs. Slepian denounced hypocrite. After confrontation 1988, Slepian turned civil harassment lawsuits, letters levity deal protesters. In 1993, man active anti-abortion effort arrested rifling doctor's garbage cans home, Slepian tried treat incident lightly. They hopefully got bags full dirty diapers, joked. He tried engage critics local newspaper. He told The Buffalo News abortion protesters turn energies helping women avoid unwanted pregnancies birth control counseling. In letter editor warned repeatedly calling murderer, critics inciting violence. Slepian accepted opponents abortion acted moral conviction, friends said, resented personal attacks. He thought tended demonize dehumanize increased danger, said lawyer, Glenn Edward Murray. So Slepian took step nation's beleaguered abortion clinic doctors dared. He insisted tried hard enough, might cut venom. To dismay staff members feared safety, Slepian began year ago stop chat protesters recognized outside Womenservices abortion clinic Buffalo, worked two days week. He surprised gathering protesters preparing euphemistically called house call, demonstration doctor's home, invited protest's organizer, Rev. Robert Behn, breakfast. Their hourlong conversation next morning inconclusive, Behn said, dismissing Slepian's gesture attempt get people like him. He asked Slepian performing abortions affected spiritually. In response, recalled, doctor said, I'm fine spiritually. Slepian, meanwhile, focused time away home family. He planned take cruise next spring. He bought time-share apartment near Disney World Florida. He many plans, said Ellen Fink, close friend couple 15 years. He done. He done living yet. Still, sometimes casual conversations, shadow would appear. When wife gave gray African parrot birthday gift, Slepian joked bird would probably outlive would teach eulogy. He would talk funeral wanted, Mrs. Fink said. He said lot friends wanted come separate cars, one car, he'd long procession. In week death, Slepian reasons preoccupied thoughts mortality. A medical checkup revealed blockage heart, Mrs. Fink said, recounting conversation Mrs. Slepian day slaying. A blockage sign probable coronary artery disease. He tests following week. I said, `Lynne, relax, going OK,' Mrs. Fink recalled. That day, National Abortion Federation sent fax Womenservices clinic warning pattern sniper attacks abortion doctors occurred early November. Marilynne Buckham, clinic director, sent Slepian. He definitely took seriously, recalled. Typically, doctor share concerns might felt. It normal day, said Tammi Latini, office assistant. We horsing around.' That evening, Slepians went synagogue mark ninth anniversary death Slepian's father. Shortly returned home, sniper's bullet smashed kitchen window, killing Slepian chatted wife sons. The protesters returned clinic five days later, first day reopened. Mrs. Buckham, director, said Slepian would surprised. They routine. So he. He never wanted day end bad note, said. At end day, I would always say, `Thank coming.' And would always turn stupid grin say, `Thanks me.' The slaying Dr. Barnett Slepian home last week eliminated mainstay abortion clinic here, eliminated women's access abortion. That availability abortion Buffalo area, much United States, complex reality, one affected class education, medical training personal convictions individual doctors. Knowledgeable middle-class affluent women find unwanted pregnancy usually obtain abortion private gynecologists, gynecologist personal objection procedure, referral colleague. Women poor, young uneducated regular relationships doctors rely specialized clinics like one Slepian worked in, hospitals. It group  unplanned pregnancies far common prosperous women  faces shrinking universe possibilities result fear set Slepian's killing slayings five doctors clinic workers since 1993, medical experts said. If well well connected, get abortion, said Dr. Stephen Wear, co-director center clinical ethics University Buffalo, trains doctors Buffalo area's hospitals. For everybody else, less less available. The number abortions United States declining steadily since first years Supreme Court's Roe vs. Wade decision legalized abortion 1973, according Alan Guttmacher Institute, studies reproductive issues. They number roughly 1.5 million year, according reports Guttmacher, 1.4 million, according National Right Life Committee, nation's largest anti-abortion group, calculates estimate partly Guttmacher figures. The number providers identify performing abortions part practice diminishing well. A 1994 Guttmacher study, last one published, found number decreased 18 percent 1982 1992, 2,380 2,908. Moreover, study said, 12 percent nation's residency programs routinely offer training abortions first trimester, though many offer elective courses. Laura Echevarria, director media relations National Right Life Committee, contends, however, teaching hospitals train gynecologists procedures treating miscarriages similar used performing abortions. Only cosmopolitan comparatively liberal cities like New York availability abortions continue steady level, experts say, though even locales concern decreasing number young doctors emerge residencies fully trained performing abortions. The Guttmacher Institute, keeps nation's precise statistics, said 1992, last year figures, 142,410 abortions New York done 151 providers, including 61 hospitals 44 clinics. Still, provider figure greatly understates number private doctors perform offices, medical experts say. Many obstetricians gynecologists Manhattan provide abortions part palette services, many years, said Dr. Richard Hausknecht, medical director Planned Parenthood. Rich middle-class women always access abortions, always will. The major threat availability city less result anti-abortion violence medical training. The bottom line we're facing impending shortage physicians adequately trained willing procedures, said Dr. John Choate, chairman New York State division American College Obstetricians Gynecologists. But lack training programs also result political pressures hospitals universities antagonists abortion climate fear. Physicians tend lie low, Choate said. They publicize fact them. If them, quietly fear practice lives. One development horizon expected change outlook abortions substantially final federal approval, expected next year, RU-486 pill, drug ends early pregnancy without need surgery. When pill introduced France Edinburgh, Scotland, Hausknecht said, number surgical abortions plummeted. In July 1988, Randall Terry drove night home Binghamton, N.Y., Atlanta start series anti-abortion protests would finally put new hard-line group, Operation Rescue, onto America's front pages, James Charles Kopp van riding alongside him, according former leaders Operation Rescue spoke condition anonymity. And, people say, Terry arrested first day Operation Rescue's Siege Atlanta, Kopp followed jail. Along one hundred Operation Rescue members, according people there, Kopp remained jail 40 days adhered Terry's orders give real name police courts. After release, Kopp returned Operation Rescue's Binghamton headquarters, working alongside Terry group's power influence anti-abortion movement surged late 1988 1989, according former leaders Operation Rescue. Now, Kopp sought federal local law enforcement authorities questioning material witness murder obstetrician performed abortions Buffalo region. The authorities also say may information help solve four sniper attacks doctors performed abortions Canada upstate New York. Some abortion-rights groups seizing Kopp's role Operation Rescue raise new questions connections recent anti-abortion violence hard-line anti-abortion protest groups burst onto national scene late 1980s. For years, Federal Bureau Investigation Justice Department looked vain evidence determine whether national conspiracy might behind series clinic bombings shootings doctors clinic staff members began early 1990s. A federal grand jury Alexandria, Va., looked conspiracy allegations ultimately disbanded without finding national underground. But federal law enforcement officials say hope Kopp may help provide link. In fact, announcement law enforcement officials looking made Attorney General Janet Reno prepared revive interagency task force look possible conspiracies behind anti-abortion crimes. Federal law enforcement officials authorities say Kopp suspect sniper attack Oct. 23 killed Dr. Barnett A. Slepian near Buffalo. But say Kopp's car seen near Slepian's home Amherst, N.Y. weeks doctor shot. One day issuing warrant Kopp's arrest material witness, law enforcement officials least 10 agencies spanning United States Canadian border still located Kopp Thursday. But law enforcement officials said pursuing many tips, including 400 poured FBI's information line: (800) 281-1184. The police gone photographs abortion protesters clinic workers Buffalo around country, also reviewing hundreds hours videotapes demonstrations search Kopp's face. At point, officials consider shooting Slepian connected three attacks Canada one Rochester doctors provide abortions. The five attacks, since 1994, occurred weeks leading Nov. 11, Veterans Day  called Remembrance Day Canada  holiday become important anti-abortion activists. But attacks spread four years 3,000 miles, Vancouver, British Columbia, Buffalo. As case many early veterans Operation Rescue, Kopp transformed hard-core anti-abortion militant jail Atlanta 1988, according many people jail insisted anonymity. By outward appearances, Dorothy Hayes' life seems ordinary. She family live rambling old home shore Lake Ontario, every morning, gives husband, John, peck cheek goes work. She runs errands, like suburban moms, spends much day taking care children. But one thing sets Mrs. Hayes apart neighbors. As devoted opponent abortion, 43-year-old mother nine regularly plays host series traveling speakers, priests protesters  many come Rochester intent upon spreading word abortion shutting clinics provide it. She one thousands people across country loosely associated anti-abortion groups like Lambs Christ opened homes Lambs' founder, Rev. Norman Weslin, itinerant demonstrators. While many  including Mrs. Hayes  disavow violent tactics, supporters abortion rights say people like bear responsibility protesters help blockade clinics threaten doctors. These people provide Father Weslin food shelter comes town close clinics innocent, said Ann Glazier, director clinic defense Planned Parenthood Federation. It's credible say part extremist activity taking place clinics. They still guilty interfering women's access. But Mary Quinn, local organizer Lambs Christ also offers home protesters, sees matters differing light. Taking people like act Christian charity, Mrs. Quinn said. `People travel around country work taken us want lose stupid houses. We take people willing make sacrifice. Members Lambs Christ persistent figures protests Buffalo women's clinic Dr. Barnett Slepian worked shot death last month. Although suspect identified shooting several similar attacks New York Canada past several years, officials looking question Vermont man whose car seen near Dr. Slepian's home. That man, James Charles Kopp, participated abortion protests decade, often house guest members Lambs Christ. While Mrs. Hayes says would never much obstruct clinic's door, given refuge qualms so. Weslin, leader Lambs Christ, one benefited Mrs. Hayes' hospitality, modern version generosity Christ Apostles knew well. He prides arrested 60 times protests front medical clinics. And throughout 1980s early '90s, active clinic rescues, protesters tried physically restrain patients trying enter clinics. Weslin stayed Mrs. Hayes' home once, beginning May 1996 first came speak local churches anti-abortion movement. But stay lasted several months, arrested Federal charges blocking access Rochester health clinic abortions performed. He later convicted served two half months prison. During protest outside clinic, several protesters locked homemade contraption called oven, made cement iron. It took police officers several hours lug device horse trailer carted off. At protest, one man glued head lock gate surrounding clinic, move protesters later said accident. Abortion opponents like Mrs. Hayes Mrs. Quinn speak attending peaceful observances abortion clinics offering prayers unborn. They talk counseling women alternatives abortion Roman Catholic pregnancy centers, support anti-abortion candidates. But also say saw nothing wrong Weslin trying block access clinics. They describe activity peaceful resistance meant stop see murders. Weslin house guests Mrs. Hayes Mrs. Quinn come recommended friends members local Catholic churches, said, adding speakers local churches anti-abortion events. And although say would never take homes stranger wanted FBI, like Kopp, concede sometimes know little guests. But Mrs. Hayes Mrs. Quinn say know lot Weslin. An Army veteran, leader anti-abortion movement 25 years, say, founded home unwed mothers. Mrs. Hayes said met him, obvious man peace tremendous devotion Blessed Mother basically recognized helpless lambs. Barbara Fredericks, another local abortion opponent developed ties Lambs Weslin came town, added priest epitomized man God. I knew I looked holy shoes simple coat mended 50 times, said. He humble, man higher purpose, trying save people sacrifice prayer. opp also robust defenders among people housed rode country protest protest. E. Kenny, 20, said parents housed Kopp St. Albans, Vt., home two years spoke local church 1988. During Kopp's stay, pleasure, Kenny said, always helping around house. He nice guy, kind like uncle us, Kenny said. He'd sit around play video games us make us model planes wood. Like Weslin, Kopp consumed need fight abortion often talked evils, Kenny said, adding Kopp gentle man wanted become Catholic priest. He always good mood, Kenny said. He never anything violent all. Both Kopp Weslin arrested repeatedly abortion protests. The men moved circles times found arrested events. Mrs. Quinn said Weslin told recent telephone conversation knew Kopp. Weslin could reached comment, clear two men encountered other. Both faced misdemeanor charges blocking Burlington, Vt., health clinic 1990 Kopp called mill. And spent time jail Atlanta 1988 clinic protest. Slepian's death abortion opponents like Mrs. Hayes Mrs. Quinn worried, killing portrayed media membership groups like Lambs Christ. For long time, felt like voice desert heard, Mrs. Hayes said. And horrible tragedy doctor's death becoming face movement. We're saving lives, said. The FBI talked Mrs. Hayes, Kenny said agents spoken him. The Justice Department says Federal task force set week investigate killing Slepian looking evidence connecting anti-abortion violence various clinics. It's fair say investigating events, look connection individuals engaged criminal conduct, Myron Marlin, spokesman department, said. Many local Catholics associated Lambs Christ tried distance killing Slepian. They mailing literature saying killer represent movement. In addition, people associated Lambs offering possible explanations killing. Some say believe killer might someone overcome grief personal experience abortion. Others wondered whether shooter tried wound doctor scare prevent performing abortions. The Lambs also wonder whether abortionist opponents blamed shooting committed disgruntled patient. One idea gaining currency among Lambs, prominently displayed Web site, suggests killing result plot abortion supporters discredit abortion opponents last week's elections. Mrs. Hayes says know truth. There wackos travel around may front clinic drawn place, said. But know everyone shows turn person next tell belong there. Mrs. Fredericks said anyone would shoot doctor provides abortions someone snapped, perhaps importance situation. Members Lambs Christ opponents abortion Rochester wonder whether killing Slepian hinder efforts. When Weslin first arrived two years ago, brought new focus group often done little counsel pregnant women set booths college campuses, said. In many cities, priest life coordinating leading rosary marches abortion, Mrs. Quinn said. But Father Weslin coming here, could finally come together feel like something sacrificial group. Mrs. Hayes said felt first pull movement early 1980s, heard women speak choice regard abortion. Then saw Silent Scream, well-known anti-abortion film purports show footage abortion. What I saw end life, said. She began volunteer Catholic pregnancy center encouraged women kill child. She also began house unwed mothers went stand vigil outside local clinics abortions performed. Mrs. Hayes looked 3-month-old daughter, Bernadette, pointed prenatal image infant, sonogram taken 13 weeks keeps refrigerator door. She described could baby's fate, someone else's child. Two pounds two inches ago, could partial-birth abortion, Mrs. Hayes said, referring controversial late-term abortion procedure. They hardest time getting shoulders out, get head puncture it. It's brutal, expect purpose dead baby? There's question doctors trying murder child. ","Dr. Barnett Slepian, the mainstay of Buffalo's only abortion clinic, was slain as he stood at his kitchen window.Slepian has been described as a fatalist who stubbornly adhered to doing what he thought right.The FBI is looking for James Kopp for questioning as a material witness in the slaying.Kopp has long been identified as a major voice in the anti-abortion movement.Attorney General Reno will investigate if the slaying is part of a nation-wide plot.In Canada, authorities are worried that new violence could erupt as Remembrance Day approaches.Anti-abortion pamphlets have been delivered to a Canadian newspaper, possibly by Kopp.","On Oct. 23, 1998, a sniper killed Dr. Barnet Slepian, a mainstay in the last abortion clinic in the Buffalo area and one of only a few doctors performing the procedure in the face of protesters and threats.Many of the protesters are itinerants like Rev. Norman Weslin, founder of the anti-abortion group Lambs of Christ, who travel about spreading their message and shutting down clinics.Another itinerant demonstrator, James Charles Kopp, is wanted by the FBI as a material witness in the Slepian murder.In addition to anti-abortion violence, a shortage of doctors who are trained and willing to do the procedures imperil their widespread availability.","The primary doctor at the last abortion clinic in Buffalo, NY, was shot and killed.Dr. Slepian, a stubborn man, dedicated to women's care, and an unlikely martyr.It's the 7th such death, and the 4th similar attack.James Kopp is sought as a material witness.The anti-abortion movement has local and itinerate members.Their activities go from prayers and talking to confrontations, threats and violence.After this killing, the FBI resumed a search for an anti-abortion conspiracy.Since the first few years after Roe v Wade, the number of abortions has declined, as has the number of clinics and doctors providing the procedure, especially for poorer women.","Abortion clinics continue to be targeted by anti-abortion groups such as Operation Rescue, Lambs of Christ, and Army of God.Opposition ranges from silent vigils to vocal and physical intimidation, and even murder.Dr. Bart Shepian of Buffalo's only abortion clinic was murdered in his home.Police in the US and Canada are looking for James Kopp, a known abortion opponent, as a material witness in that murder.The clinics serve poor, young, and uneducated women since the well-to-do use their established providers.AG Janet Reno has named a task force to find out if the Slepian murder, the third in five years, is part of an organized campaign of violence."

It's going easy, I think they're ready. The best thing making World Series know go anywhere else that. You've made point go best do. That's about. As Bernie Williams starts could final series Yankees Game 1 World Series Yankee Stadium Saturday night, wants free mind. Free worrying extremely uncertain future undisclosed personal matter made post-season perplexing pleasing. But easy keep mind uncluttered. Williams know sign Yankees return center field next season, wants test free agency. There good chance Yankees offer lavish contract, Williams might forced decide fattest paycheck new situation baseball city choice pretty fat paycheck familiar situation Bronx. Scott Boras, Williams' agent, compared client players $10 million-a-year bracket last season, price tag surely escalated Williams American League batting title .339 average drilling 26 homers knocking 97 runs. Williams asked agreed theory teams outbid Yankees. I know, said Williams, aloof post-season, declined discuss why. And I'm thinking little I would like to. I would like keep focus series. It issue Williams Yankees wants study Saturday coming days, team four victories away championship. Still, issue hovers Yankees ominously owner George Steinbrenner hovers general manager Brian Cashman. It's tough thing, Cashman said balancing excitement World Series reality trying re-sign Williams. You know ugliness future right front you. Although Williams adamant discussing future, relented slightly Friday. When reporter asked reasons would staying Yankees, Williams' answer included escape clause. Just fact I've whole career, Williams said. That lot it. The relationships I've come know years, I think would hard, impossible, start scratch somewhere else. Williams continued: But I think reality game day age things happen. You can't really write things stone they're going happen. People get traded. People become free agents go teams. I make decision really thinking people I'm accountable for. When Williams asked better situation could player center fielder Yankees, winning batting crown World Series, 30-year-old stumped. Wow, that's pretty good right there, Williams said. It's funny mention that, I really thought that. I think, point season, I going sit think, wow, bad year all. While Cashman would discuss financial matters, another Yankee official said team offer Williams much $12 million year  unless Steinbrenner gets generous possible championship. It likely Yanks would offer Williams $10 million-a-year range. I'd hate speculate something point, Cashman said. We'll give best effort sign level we're comfortable with. Hopefully, enough. Then we'll marriage. If not, we'll divorce. While Williams earned right become free agent pursue contract wants city wants, interesting choices make. When reporter asked Williams would respond someone suggested accept less Yankees remain city popular, likes teammates manager, team post-season four straight years, hesitate answer. My response would time right start thinking that, Williams said. If I start thinking that, it'll distract I need World Series. Williams talked Yankees end remarkable season want situation disrupt that. But, Williams' status uncertain, asked next four seven games would bittersweet, since could ending 13-year association Yankees. I want talk that, Williams said. I'm going lot fun there. I'm going go out. Then Williams walked away interview. The New York Times said editorial Saturday, Oct. 17: It fitting memorable baseball seasons conclude World Series opens Saturday night Yankee Stadium, aging still grand cathedral sport. Bedecked bunting banners, revered ballpark always elevates game aura history accomplishment. That makes perfect venue part championship series determine whether 1998 Yankees one greatest teams modern era, talented squad owned regular season folded World Series. New Yorkers boisterous, boastful bunch, patter city week loud arrogant, must seem anyone venturing San Diego root Padres. The word sidewalks subways Padres measure Yankees. Sure, lethal starting pitchers Kevin Brown Andy Ashby, one game's best closers Trevor Hoffman, mention prolific hitters like Tony Gwynn Greg Vaughn, hobbling still dangerous. But match Yankees' World Series starting rotation David Wells, Orlando Hernandez, David Cone Andy Pettitte, bullpen flamethrower Mariano Rivera, plus deepest batting order baseball? Yet truth Yankees fans terrified team crumple. Baseball fans, even Yankee fans, spend lifetime waiting see home team historic caliber, Yankee team reach sanctified status unless ends record-setting season winning World Series. The doubts keep creeping up. The team pitiful plate playoffs. Tino Martinez, top run producer, numbing slump. Bernie Williams, American League batting champ, hit well pennant series Cleveland Indians, seemed distracted personal matters. Shane Spencer, rookie slugging sensation September, turned new Mr. October. Pettitte struggling since August. The curious thing team, games regular season team American League history, quiet unobtrusive be. It sports dominant superstar, swaggering clubhouse leader, one seems belong New York. So Yankees start drift field, fans tend fear team might simply fade away. Until Indians surged temporarily ahead playoffs, Yankees faced serious test resiliency season. New Yorkers already taste ticker-tape parade Broadway. But behind every mighty cheer stadium Saturday night lurk fear curtain falls season, unheralded unlegendary team San Diego one remembered. The last time seen field Yankee Stadium, inadvertently influencing outcome game sent Cleveland Indians home Yankees World Series. That's say umpires mess World Series, shown eminently capable interfering natural progression postseason games. All right, Ted Hendry World Series; umpires' collective bargaining agreement leagues allow umpire work league championship series World Series. Joe Brinkman either, even though agreement allow umpire work division series World Series. The three American League umpires six-man World Series crew work first round playoffs. One them, Richie Garcia, crew chief behind plate Saturday night's opener Yankee Stadium. Gene Budig, AL president, Friday called Garcia, 24-year veteran, one league's respected umpires. But Saturday night, Garcia move right field Sunday night Game 2. Now combination sound familiar, Richie Garcia right field? Ah yes, last time Garcia worked post-season series Yankee Stadium, umpire Game 1 league championship series two years ago young fan New Jersey  name, please; over-glorified enough  reached fence caught Derek Jeter's fly ball Tony Tarasco, Baltimore's right fielder, prepared catch it. Garcia ruled interference, home run, said oops watching television replay clearly showing interference. Too late. The call helped Yankees win first game set tone series. Even though made mistake, know best there, baseball official, speaking condition anonymity, said. That knowledge comes small consolation Orioles. Budig, too, acknowledged umpires, like players managers, perfect. Major league umpires skilled do, human, said telephone interview. Day day good job Major League Baseball. Rounds one two difficult, happens time time. The umpires human American League playoffs happened time time time time. The Cleveland Indians suffered brunt fallibility umpires. We highlight reel umpires getting knocked baseballs, general manager John Hart said Indians' final game Yankees. The umpires lose game us, share controversies two playoff series umpires. In division series Boston, Brinkman, plate umpire, bad calls pitches plays plate immediately provoked disputes led ejecting Mike Hargrove, Indians' manager, three pitches Game 2, Dwight Gooden, starting pitcher, 19 pitches later. Hendry right wrong, depending one's point view, noncall interference Travis Fryman 12th inning Game 2 ALCS. That ruling went favor Indians. Little else did. In Game 4, Jeter stealing second fifth inning on-target throw Sandy Alomar Jr. hit Jim McKean, jumped try get way instead kicked ball right field. A batted ball, Omar Vizquel's line drive, struck Hendry Game 6. But worst call Game 6 Hendry's force play second base. Hendry called Bernie Williams safe, ruling Vizquel's foot came base caught ball. Members Yankees indicated Friday they, too, thought call wrong. I know, Williams said asked thought, I'll take it. It big play. But think out? I'd rather comment that, said. It stir lot controversy. I want get that. When player believes safe, says worry subsequent controversy. If Williams implying thought out, another member Yankees said doubt Williams out. I sure first, uniformed member team said, I saw Hendry, I said uh-oh. I also thought Omar smooth think come bag. Then I saw replay. He out. The game today faster used be, observer said. The umpires sharper. Maybe Garcia, Dale Scott Tim Tschida American League, Jerry Crawford, Dana DeMuth Mark Hirschbeck National League, sharp 18th century French guillotine four seven games. Leonard Coleman, NL president, said thought umpires first-rate division league series added three splendid umpires working World Series. Budig said: The World Series crew proven first-rate. We total confidence them. The umpires let players make errors managers bad decisions. Then everyone talk players managers umpires. A strong sign city going bonkers Padres came Friday morning 680 fans agreed shave heads radio promotion raffle return 1-in-680 chance skybox tickets post-season play. This show support team one ticket, said Tommy Sablan, producer Jeff Jer show. It symbolic efforts bald Padres  Tony Gwynn, Wally Joyner, Greg Vaughn, Jim Leyritz. About thousand people showed  men, women children. We 10 barbers 20 hairdressers took six hours lines either get buzzed straight-razored. We shocked turnout. But bandwagon town. `Buy ticket day concert' type public. You'll see even bigger bandwagon Monday they've hopefully play Yankees real World Series. After Padres beat Braves, 3-0, Game 2 National League Championship Series Thursday night Atlanta take two-game lead four-of-seven-game series, San Diego fans began gearing shot World Series traditional ways. It would team's first World Series appearance since 1984, downtown business district Friday, marquees banners read Go Padres lunch-hour rally attended several hundred fans. The Padres set attendance record 2,555,901 season, half-million last year nearly million half three years ago. It stemmed part effort John Moores, Padres owner, Larry Lucchino, team's president, put family entertainment park bought team December 1994. This diversified group fans I saw Atlanta, Lucchino said. Their crowd seemed yuppified. We're proud three generations families come games. Donna McMahon, 63-year-old homemaker La Jolla, fan since 10 Pacific Coast League Padres played Lane Field near harbor. She would take streetcar school meet father, would buy bleacher seats. Later, brought four children Jack Murphy Stadium National League Padres 2,500 people crowd. Now, brings grandchildren sold-out Qualcomm Stadium. There different groups stands, said, upper class, middle class, business person, beer-drinking fan, children, Mexican fans across border. We true fans  us. San Diego Mayor Susan Golding agrees, also giving credit balmy weather. Padre fans cross-section county, said. Downtown, suburban, rural, east, north, ranchers farmers high-tech engineers, yuppies new kids  X generation. A lot across border. The Padres extremely popular Tijuana. We perfect weather long baseball season. Playing World Series October got better New York. Carlos Carrion, born San Diego baseball fan 25 years, brings 10- 8-year-old sons stadium. This great chance let children see players work, Carrion said. They look guys understand character work ethic. The Padres ticket office estimates average, 15,000 fans 65,000-seat stadium Latin Americans San Diego, Baja California state Sonora. The Padres first major league baseball souvenir store Tijuana. A new shipment bats arrived Tino Martinez Friday, massaged handles make sure thin enough, knocked barrels listened certain sound swung slowly again. Martinez excited fresh bats, reacted like Little Leaguer wielding aluminum bat first time. You saving World Series trees now, right? Martinez said representative bat company. These World Series trees, they? Martinez could joke bats specially designed World Series Yankees began quest second title past three years play host San Diego Padres Game 1 Yankee Stadium Saturday night. Major leaguer players watching television could imitate David Letterman joke World Series wood. Even though Martinez struggled numerous bats post-season, could joke Yankees still alive title. Martinez still alive. For now, Martinez, power hitter mostly missing action, could joke around. For now. You always get fresh start post-season game game, said Martinez. If win, got another game next day forget bad at-bats. It's easier post-season next at-bat could biggest at-bat season. Normally, Martinez plate biggest at-bat season would pleasing sight Yankees. But calendar flips October. Martinez experienced another frustrating post-season. He 5 30 10 strikeouts, homers 1 run batted hitting-starved team batted .229 still winning 7 9 post-season games superior pitching. Can Yankees continue win Martinez, valuable run producer, sometime singles hitter? We've gotten two good series, said Paul O'Neill. The Yankees series. You focus one guy. You focus winning. The whole team won. As much Joe Torre talked Martinez needing one line-drive hit get groove, 30-year-old first baseman career drought post-season. Since joining Yankees, Martinez 20 107 (.187) one homer 4 RBI 29 post-season games. Those puny statistics, especially player driven 381 runs 455 regular season games last three years. I would guess Tino would great series, O'Neill said. Baseball way evening things out. You bad series, come back great series. In season, that's easier do. In post-season, gets tougher. It cannot get much tougher Martinez, dropped fifth sixth order American League Championship Series Cleveland Indians remain spot notice. Martinez blamed paucity production impatience trying much. He sometimes flailed poor pitches hitter's counts 3-1 2-0, instead working count, admitted previous failures post-season caused pursue obviously unattainable five-run homer. Actually, Martinez already made alterations, reached base 7 times last 10 plates appearances double, single, hit-by-pitch 4 walks. It enough pacify George Steinbrenner, something cling to. Until last night, anyway, Martinez face Kevin Brown, nasty right-hander retired 30 34 career at-bats. If I getting good pitches missing them, I'd say I bad swing working, said Martinez. But I've swinging bad pitches. Right now, I've got patient wait. The Yankees wait him. They to. In 1996 World Series, Torre started Cecil Fielder Martinez first Games 3, 4 5. It difficult decision Martinez paced team RBI Fielder join Yankees July 31. But Yankees grabbed three games worked. Torre attractive replacement season Luis Sojo. So Yankees stay Martinez, better worse, tries stay positive finally produce. It's World Series, said Martinez. You got go fun it. Big games big games. You want go enjoy game try best win game. You think might lose day. Chuck Knoblauch Tino Martinez popular squeegee men week ago, speculation rampant one might exiled Yankees' historic year crumbled post-season. Two big hits midst big inning changed Saturday night Game 1 World Series. The Yankees trailed San Diego, 5-2, seventh inning, Knoblauch hit three-run home run tie score, five batters later, Martinez smashed grand slam. The seven-run explosion rocketed Yankees 9-6 victory opener four-of-seven-game series, 56,712 Yankee Stadium. Orlando Hernandez pitch Andy Ashby Game 2 Sunday night Stadium. Beyond seizing advantage series, Yankees able neutralize Padres' ace, Kevin Brown, driving mound seventh. Brown, seen many San Diego's best hope World Series upset, pitch Game 4, earliest. Brown pitching three-run lead top fifth, Tony Gwynn Greg Vaughn banged back-to-back homers. One seventh, however, Jorge Posada hit single, Brown walked Ricky Ledee. Brown, thrown whopping 64 pitches first three innings, went out, reliever Donne Wall came face Knoblauch. This Yankees done season, force starter game middle innings, exploiting middle reliever. Knoblauch, course, earned notoriety gaffe Game 2 American League Championship Series Cleveland, standing waiting interference call ball rolled stop behind decisive run scored. The Yankees came back win series, however; Knoblauch got reprieve talked much experience helped him. Facing Wall one-ball, no-strike count, Knoblauch duck runaway fastball. Two balls, strikes. Wall throw strike, Knoblauch swung hard lifted high fly left-field line. Off bat, look like much. But kept carrying, Vaughn drifting back left looking up, see ball disappear stands. Tie game. Yankee Stadium shook. Knoblauch rounded bases, crossed home plate thrust arms air, yelling crowd, like hyped Olympic weightlifter successfully hoisted half-ton. He stomped around dugout, helmet on, teammates banging happily. When Derek Jeter singled, nobody really noticed. Wall left game, Mark Langston took over. Paul O'Neill flied out, Jeter advanced wild pitch, Bernie Williams intentionally walked. Chili Davis drew walk. Bases loaded, more, Martinez coming plate, exactly one run batted in first 76 career at-bats league championship World Series games. With count two balls two strikes, Langston threw pitch near outside corner thought strike. Instead, Garcia called ball. Langston glared, snapping return throw. Langston Martinez everyone field understood bases loaded 3-2 count, Langston would throw players refer cookie  tasty pitch middle. Martinez ate cookie. The ball soared upper deck right field, lifting three years post-season misery back Yankees' first baseman, grand slam. The crowd called Martinez dugout again. Like Knoblauch, Martinez pumped arms, later crowd would chant name, Martinez would wave cap. San Diego's lead long gone. The Yankees taken 2-0 lead Brown second inning, forcing throw 32 pitches second. They loaded bases single two walks, Ledee, rookie left fielder playing none Torre's left fielders hitting, pulled sinking fastball right field line two outs. The fans along foul line stood, waving push ball fair body English, ball landed line, skipping wall two runners scored. The Yankees early edge, jumped Brown, best pitcher mound. San Diego's Chris Gomez led second inning blooper shortstop, ball falling single. Quilvio Veras flied right, Gwynn grounded Gomez took second, bringing Vaughn plate. David Wells got ahead count, balls two strikes, change-up fastball, trying run fastball inside Vaughn, hit 50 home runs regular season. Vaughn attacked pitch: line drive landed second deck, foul way, frightening mistake. Jorge Posada, Yankees' catcher, jogged mound re-think strategy, perhaps remind Wells conventional wisdom: must pitch Vaughn outer edge plate. Posada returned plate, called outside fastball, Wells threw. Vaughn's swing short quick, ball making click sound bat, like well-struck golf ball, carrying wall right-center field. Tie game. Wells retired first two batters fifth inning, jamming Veras inside fastball. Veras' bat snapped contact, enough send looper short center field, single. Gwynn stepped in, hit single first two at-bats, looked sign third base coach Tim Flannery. With runner first, likes try pull ball right side infield. Wells fired fastball, Gwynn turned pitch ripped it, line drive crashed facing upper deck right field. The Padres jumped dugout, celebrating, Wells turned away, disgusted, asking new baseball. He got one, delivered another fastball, Vaughn slugged deep left field stands. Two pitches, two home runs, first back-to-back home runs allowed Wells since April 30. San Diego led, 5-2, Yankee Stadium silent. It would stay way. The moment truth Chuck Knoblauch came bottom first inning name announced Yankee Stadium first time since neglected chase memorable loose ball last Wednesday. There boos. It warm ovation. They liked him. They really liked him. Knoblauch exhaled. Knoblauch emphasized game concerned winning rumbling World Series, fans. But surely made Knoblauch feel home realized fans forgiven him. Victories, time, healed malice toward Knoblauch could play second base without earplugs. When Yankees defeated Indians, 9-5, Game 6 Tuesday night advance second World Series three years, Knoblauch easily relieved player field. The awful mistake made Game 2 would forgotten. The Yankees pennant, Knoblauch celebrating much anyone. To act like toward tremendous, said Knoblauch, response received. It great feeling, really helped out. Knoblauch wearing cap declared Yankees champions American League 1998; Champagne dripped brim spoke. He look up, continued talk learned lot vilified making mistake Little Leaguers expected make. Just face things take like man answer questions, although they're tough, Knoblauch said. You see made bounce back something like that. That's basically I learned. If Yankees lost ALCS, even Knoblauch's teammates said would branded villain failing pursue ball glanced Travis Fryman's back running outside baseline. Knoblauch argued umpire go ahead run scored first Indians won, 4-1. Now Knoblauch watch television read newspapers without getting queasy. That's huge him, David Cone said. That's huge me. I let back game, would tough one would come back beat us. And Knobbie, I'm sure he's feeling lot better now. Knoblauch, two hits five at-bats, working second bottle Champagne five minutes reporters allowed clubhouse. He flashed sort smile shown much recently and, Yankees World Series, Knoblauch expect teased often mistake. Maybe go way, we'll that, Derek Jeter said. I know I'll say, I'll think something good. YANKEES Pitching The starting pitching enabled Yankees advance past Cleveland American League Championship Series. David Wells 7-1 career postseason additional edge Padres' lineup generally less effective left-handed pitching. Orlando Hernandez four terrific pitches, pitched seven shutout innings pivotal Game 4 ALCS earned start Game 2 series. David Cone benefit six days' worth rest starts Game 3, well able pitch warm Southern California. Mariano Rivera's stuff might good year, Mike Stanton continues dominant postseason pitcher. Reasons concern: erratic Andy Pettitte, needs home-plate umpire call strikes pitches low away, Jeff Nelson, lost command last brief outing. Offense There signs ALCS offense coming collective slump  Chuck Knoblauch getting base consistently, Derek Jeter back driving ball right field middle, Bernie Williams three hits Game 6, Scott Brosius consistent force bottom lineup. But Yankees holes: Chili Davis hard-pressed catch fastballs Kevin Brown Andy Ashby, Tino Martinez's postseason funk problem. The Yankees could use contribution Jorge Posada, start Games 1 2 may get chance drive pitches low strike zone, hit power. Defense The Yankees best defense baseball, excellent middle Jeter Knoblauch, third Brosius. Nobody's really taken advantage fact Williams poor arm center field, rest assured Ken Caminiti, Steve Finley Greg Vaughn try. The Indians expose fact Yankees' pitchers trouble preventing baserunners stealing second third base. Baserunning The Yankees run well take extra bases, particularly Paul O'Neill, Brosius, Jeter Knoblauch going first-to-third; Williams make mistakes. The Yankees probably able steal Kevin Brown, effective slide step, could aggressive Andy Ashby, combination Sterling Hitchcock Jim Leyritz. PADRES Hitting Except Jim Leyritz, one San Diego lineup particularly hot particularly frightening moment. Tony Gwynn consistent usually is, Ken Caminiti Greg Vaughn streaky. But Padres veteran team capable putting ball play, getting runners base moving along, long getting exceptional pitching, that's really need. Quilvio Veras, leadoff hitter, adept drawing walks Steve Finley, become pull conscious last two years, could try take aim right field stands Yankee Stadium. Vaughn's power could factor Yankees' pitchers jam enough keep leaning plate. Pitching Kevin Brown best pitcher series, capable winning three games necessary, Padres manager Bruce Bochy choose start Games 1, 4 7. But point, San Diego need big outing either Andy Ashby Sterling Hitchcock. When Ashby's right, he's hitting corners sinking fastball slider, command suspect, gets pounded. Hitchcock used split-fingered fastball great effectiveness right-handed batters first two rounds playoffs, Yankees' left-handed hitters may cause concern. San Diego's middle relief weakest aspect team, Randy Myers Mark Langston left side (the stuff waned). But lead delivered hands closer Trevor Hoffman, he'll keep it. Defense They mostly catch ball avoid mistakes, though unspectacular. Shortstop Chris Gomez second baseman Veras adept turning double plays, Caminiti Gold Glove third base last year; Wally Joyner good hands first; center fielder Steve Finley extremely quick tracking base hits returning ball infield. Tony Gwynn's range better toward right field line, nearly good balls hit gaps. The Yankees able run arm Vaughn left field. Baserunning Veras steal bases (24) year, Finley tight spot, well. In general, however, Padres slow, plodding team, though Caminiti Vaughn good going first-to-third, Gwynn make mistakes bases. PITCHING TO THE PADRES Quilvio Veras: A switch-hitter power right-handed; try pitch down-and-in breaking balls he's hitting right-handed, jam fastballs he's batting left-handed. Steve Finley: A left-handed hitter likes pull ball. Left-handers like David Wells beat breaking balls low outside. Tony Gwynn: When he's hot, he's impossible. When he's hitting well, anxious early count, fed breaking balls strike zone. Greg Vaughn: Big-time power anything high plate. Because likes pull ball, must pitch outer edge, occasionally jamming keep honest. Ken Caminiti: More power right-handed, better hitter left-handed. These days, he's good lowball hitter beat fastballs zone. Wally Joyner: With runners base, he'll try jump fastball early count. Is strong hitter jammed. Chris Gomez: Like Derek Jeter, likes hit pitches inside out, right field middle. He hit power make mistake breaking ball. Ruben Rivera: An impatient hitter chase pitches strike zone. Carlos Hernandez: Looks first-pitch fastball upper half strike zone. Can struggle breaking balls. Jim Leyritz: No apparent holes right now, hit fastballs away. Best bet get ahead count try get chase breaking balls. PITCHING TO THE YANKEES Chuck Knoblauch: Hard throwers like jam fastballs stands top plate, gets hit often. Derek Jeter: Sometimes tendency chase pitches feet, get ball far enough, hammer ball wall right. Paul O'Neill: The Yankees' best pure hitter, sometimes chase fastballs away, particularly one strike. Bernie Williams: A switch-hitter trouble resisting chest-high fastballs. When lays them, much better hitter, last game Cleveland series. Chili Davis: Has great eye work pitcher deep count, overpowered fastballs belt. Cheats get bat started, making vulnerable off-speed pitches. Tino Martinez: Nothing seems right moment. Is anxious chases pitches strike zone falls behind count, taking advantage mistakes they're made. Scott Brosius: A great breaking ball hitter, also drive fastball long way anticipates, Cleveland's Charles Nagy knows. Jorge Posada: When batting left-handed, fares poorly splitters, curveballs sliders. Ricky Ledee: Like young hitters, tendency expand strike zone chase pitches strike zone falling behind count. Kevin Brown likely attack aggressively. SATURDAY'S PITCHERS Kevin Brown: Best sinking fastball game (91-93) mph, four-seam fastball 95-97 mph throw high strike zone, slider breaks away right-handed batters, forkball dives 88-89 mph. Holds runners well. David Wells: Aggressive, aggressive, aggressive, challenging hitters fastballs. His curveball exceptional, changeup improved. Throw strikes: Allowed many home runs (29) walks (29), allowed three-run homer grand slam year. Talk high expectations. It's man Tampa anymore.

1031,"Top-level budget negotiators congressional Republicans White House concluded yet another bargaining session late Sunday afternoon plans resume talks Monday morning probably extend midnight Monday deadline another day two. Both sides amiable emerged two-hour session, little report indicated relatively early departure, compared last three nights, interpreted sign crisis imminent peace budget talks. Sunday's discussions focused education President Clinton's request $1.1 billion hire 100,000 teachers, aides said bargainers delve much detail nothing resolved. I think made real progress today, still significant difference area education, said Erskine Bowles, Clinton's chief staff top negotiator, Sunday's meeting. We're going try plow next two days. Asked far apart two sides education, Rep. Dick Armey Texas, Republican majority leader, replied: I know. We're together. He said two sides made progress, enough. The talks came another day escalated political confrontation congressional Democrats Republicans, painfully aware three weeks Election Day, tried take advantage static budget situation. Congress passed six 13 required spending bills negotiating White House final omnibus package contain remaining seven bills major issues including conduct census year 2000, much money provide International Monetary Fund conditions provided, much emergency money provide items like increased security U.S. embassies around world American farmers. Also resolved host issues little financing ideology, including environmental matters, contraception national student testing. Republicans said president disengaged process, irked said swooping 11th hour pushing education agenda apparently successful portrayal guardian popular topic. Democrats countered Republican-led Congress done nothing year, cast Republicans extremists blocking president's plea money hire teachers modernize schools. In fact, Republican bargainers said Saturday night would provide money local governments, Washington, could decide money would used. Armey one many castigated president apparent disengagement, indirect reminder Clinton steeped sex scandal facing impeachment inquiry House. The scant number congressional Republicans leave town weekend used House floor press message. What president? asked Rep. Tom DeLay Texas, majority whip. Maybe Martha's Vineyard? Aspen? Camp David? Where president? I bet American people know spent 152 days 283 days year fund raising, traveling vacation. Republicans said Clinton participated 98 fund-raising events far year two events Monday New York, supporting Senate campaign Rep. Charles Schumer, would bring 100. Clinton said White House prepared whatever takes reach resolution spending bills, dispatched aides Capitol Hill. He also said would postpone Monday morning Monday afternoon departure fund-raising tour New York, canceled fund-raising appearance Florida. But high-level budget bargaining concluded Sunday afternoon, sides agreed would need extend deadline beyond midnight Monday, temporary financing government expires third time since Oct. 1 start fiscal year. Congressional Democrats struck back Republicans, saying held slack schedule themselves. Rep. George Miller, D-Calif., said Congress session 108 days far year, unusually abbreviated period one consumed month drive hold impeachment hearings president. Most Americans, Miller said, worked 225 days. They say, `Where president?' Miller said. The president waiting budget. This first Congress since 1974 budget, said, referring broad blueprint supposed guide spending. This Congress can't pass seven appropriations bills, said, largely divisive splits among conservative moderate Republicans. Struggling meet fourth deadline federal budget, congressional Republicans White House officials wrestled Tuesday differences education, politically high-stakes element budget battle. Negotiators ended late-night session without resolving disagreements education, census contraceptives. These among biggest issues still separated two sides tried formulate message take home voters Nov. 3 elections. On education, issue President Clinton propelled forefront Republicans want appear recalcitrant, sides agreed spend $1 billion spend it. The president insists money spent hire 100,000 teachers across country average class reduced 18 students. Republicans, railing Beltway bureaucrats, say local school districts decide money spent, whether teachers computers. As two sides broke Tuesday night, White House chief staff Erskine Bowles, president's top negotiator, emerged session saying: We deal. We made good progress. The biggest issue, still, 100,000 teachers. He added: There still open issues upon agreement reached, sounded optimistic session scheduled Wednesday morning. I think we've got chance wrapping tomorrow, said. The two sides remained apart several ideological matters, including whether allow federal health plans cover contraceptives whether allow plans religious affiliations refuse cover contraceptives religious grounds moral grounds well. They also split conduct census 2000, one thorniest issues. It one moves voters, vital parties helps determine relative strength Congress. House Speaker Newt Gingrich Bowles met much day speaker's office, shuttling ante-rooms lieutenants giving clues nitty-gritty details talks. They given another deadline midnight Wednesday wrap $500 billion worth spending items, could easily extend deadline another day two. They missed spending bills place Oct. 1 start fiscal year, providing temporary financing federal government Oct. 9, Oct. 12, Wednesday. Some central issues, like financing International Monetary Fund, nailed down, neither side ready declare final deal elements budget package place. We're splitting infinitives, House Majority Leader Dick Armey said approving money IMF. As worked several issues, Republican leaders appeared calculating differences party might sour final deal arrives House floor  concern Senate floor Senate fewer differences among Republicans White House. Some conservative Republicans said concerned emerging shape final package, particularly elements dealing family planning emergency spending. They say president's proposals emergency spending, items peacekeeping mission Bosnia, fixing year 2000 computer bug providing relief American farmers, break limits last year's balanced-budget agreement. The administration said money would come corresponding cuts elsewhere budget, conservatives say comes raiding surplus. If Republican leaders cannot count conservatives, need support Democrats pass final package. And Democrats Tuesday expressed concern White House positions, issues like census apparent compromise Republicans aid farmers. Rep. David McIntosh, R-Ind., leader House conservatives, said believed Republican leaders ceding quickly White House. He said president appeared getting way issues really seemed winning war public relations. The president getting wants; he's controlling situation, McIntosh lamented. When Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott appears television, McIntosh said, reaction president. Nonetheless, McIntosh suggested could vote final accord. Most conservatives holding better deal we're hearing, said, we'll probably give vote see much better alternative happening goes down. Others distressed, particularly two contraceptive issues. One would require federal health plans cover contraceptives. The would bar overseas family-planning organizations lobbying change abortion laws countries. Rep. Tom Coburn, R-Okla., said wanted see final language health plan measure. As passed House Senate, allowed health plans religious affiliation decline offer contraceptive coverage; Coburn wants plans able refuse coverage moral grounds well. The plan covers five specific types contraception. Coburn said wanted two  Depo-Provera intrauterine devices  eliminated coverage said interfered fertilization therefore considered cause abortions. Democrats like Rep. Nita Lowey, D-N.Y., introduced contraceptive plan House, said strongly objected Coburn's position. She said health plans based decisions offer profits, morals. The question whether White House insist keeping contraceptive coverage final package oppose moral exception. If administration allows moral exception, could alienate House Democrats. House Democrats also worried direction talks taking census. This always loomed one biggest issues separating Democrats Republicans. The results census help determine future power two political parties. But fact two sides finally talking indicates covering full range budget matters need resolved. The White House proposed buying time matter financing Commerce, State Justice departments five months. The Commerce Department contains Census Bureau. White House officials said would put nettlesome issue allowing resolution entire spending package, House Democrats worry would prelude giving Republicans road. Republican leaders like idea postponing decision say financing restricted Census Bureau. On several touchy environmental issues prompted repeated veto threats White House, two sides appeared opting compromise confrontation, several disputes resolved. But particularly difficult issues remained negotiation. A compromise struck White House Alaskan lawmakers logging Tongass National Forest. But compromise still eluded question building road wilderness refuge connect two communities Alaska. A sticking point White House congressional budget negotiators issue 2000 census conducted, White House finding negotiating issue much House Democrats House Republican leaders. On Monday, White House negotiators, led chief staff Erskine Bowles, tried determine whether Democrats would accept deal finance six months departments State, Justice Commerce, oversees Census Bureau. The deal would put next March contentious issue whether next census would use statistical sampling supplement traditional methods counting people. Bowles told group Democrats House Republicans willing give number outstanding issues stalling final agreement budget, digging heels came financing census six months. The Democrats met office Minority Leader Dick Gephardt. The rationale half-year financing next March Supreme Court expected rule whether using sampling legal constitutional. The Supreme Court already agreed review two lower court rulings said sampling would violate federal law. Oral arguments cases set November. But House Democrats balked idea six months' financing census, arguing even Supreme Court allowed sampling, Republicans would obligation approve money census included sampling. The general feeling among many Democrats even case, would lot less leverage March, especially issue left debated, said House Democratic official insisted anonymity. Democrats contend time press Republicans, want complete work budget go home campaign. Rep. Lucille Roybal-Allard, D-Calif., attended meeting Monday, said, It was, sort of, are. We've able accomplish great things, think? We made clear unless census included, along issues, like school construction, deal acceptable. Statistical sampling would allow Census Bureau estimate populations difficult count, would largest effect counting African-Americans cities blacks Hispanics rural areas, groups traditionally undercounted standard means. Republicans fear, Democrats hope, method would raise count people living traditionally Democratic areas, giving party advantage new boundaries election districts drawn following 2000 census. At Monday's meeting, Democrats reminded administration officials Clinton promised would veto legislation restricted Census Bureau's ability conduct accurate census. I can't think way restricts census fully fund it, said Rep. Carolyn Maloney, D-N.Y. The willingness House Democrats, including Gephardt, press president issue represents realization leverage Clinton, need support coming impeachment inquiry. Gephardt major player now, irony helped make that, said Rep. Christopher Shays, R-Conn., supports use sampling census. The Democrats' position also indicates little trust many White House issue. The proposal finance departments Commerce, Justice State six months similar one reached last November Bowles House Speaker Newt Gingrich. The idea holding three departments hostage census fight would place maximum pressure sides work differences sampling. But House Democrats consulted agreement struck later grumbled it. At meeting Democratic caucus Tuesday, Ms. Maloney briefed lawmakers dealings White House declared Clinton promised would hold firm census believed him, participant said. The statement greeted laughter. There certain level suspicion times cut out,said House Democratic official. But I say, much evidence that, time. Struggling meet fourth deadline federal budget, congressional Republicans White House officials wrestled Tuesday differences education, politically high-stakes element budget battle.

But compromise still eluded question building road wilderness refuge connect two communities Alaska. House Senate negotiators agreed Thursday require federal health plans cover prescription contraceptives women, giving unusual victory Capitol Hill advocates abortion rights. But future measure doubt attached spending bill includes controversial provision regarding Federal Election Commission. That provision could scuttle spending bill, would finance Treasury Department Postal Service still must approved House Senate. The contraceptive measure would require federal health plans, affect 1.2 million female federal employees child-bearing age, cover five methods contraception approved Food Drug Administration use country  birth control pills, diaphragms, inter-uterine devices, Norplant Depo-Provera. Currently, 19 percent federal health plans cover methods. The House Senate approved contraceptive measure earlier year. But opponents abortion furious approval persuaded Republican leaders negotiators reopen discussion matter. The cost contraceptives driven out-of-pocket cost health care women. And many male members Congress seemed persuaded support coverage contraceptives women, since almost 285 federal health plans cover Viagra, male impotency drug. Thursday, pressure building resolve spending bills Oct. 9, temporary financing government expires, negotiators agreed include contraceptive measure conference report $13.4 billion bill Treasury Department Postal service. Rep. Nita Lowey, D-N.Y., pushed contraceptive measure House, hailed Thursday's agreement first major accomplishment abortion rights advocates since Republicans took control Congress 1994. She said negotiators agreed include measure election year want perceived opposing contraception seen rejecting measure passed House Senate. But many Democrats said upset bill contains provision seen interfering independence Federal Election Commission. That provision would require four-vote majority among seven federal election commissioners every four years retain general counsel staff director. The provision aimed getting rid Lawrence Noble, current general counsel, investigated campaign finance practices groups like Christian Coalition. The contraceptive measure one four related matters helped stall four spending bills. The three bills stalled part abortion-related matters include agriculture bill, dispute whether federal Food Drug Administration use taxpayer money approve drugs like RU-486, induce abortions. The foreign operations bill also stalled whether finance international family planning programs may also promote abortion, labor health bill delayed provision would block access minors contraception. Addressing measure insurance coverage contraceptives, Helen Alvarez, spokeswoman National Conference Catholic Bishops, said bill bad policy. She said contraception failed stem number abortions, teen-age pregnancies out-of-wedlock births. Public-relations-wise, good tactic them, conceded, terms social policy, failure. For first time decades, Congress White House negotiated tax spending legislation year budget surplus. The result chaos. The lawmakers never able agree budget resolution  framework tax spending bills supposed fit. This happened since congressional budget procedures established 1974. Then, without discipline overall plan, Senate House could pass eight 13 spending bills needed keep government running. So lawmakers stay session week longer hoped. Finally, lumped eight bills together week announced agreement. But way could get far resort gimmicks. One designate $20 billion emergency expenditures programs cut elsewhere offset new spending. This use one-quarter anticipated budget surplus current fiscal year. Another gimmick extended tax break Individual Retirement Accounts couples incomes $100,000 $150,000. This actually raise small amount revenue next five years  period covered budget accounting  make picture considerably worse later years. As hard negotiate budget bad old days budget deficits, say politicians involved, exponentially difficult year. At least years past, common goal. As much disagreed policy principle, aiming reduction deficit. This year, members Congress wanted use surplus big tax cut. Others wanted pay national debt. Others wanted spend part medical research, schools weapons Pentagon. Others wanted spend large sums highways. Still others wanted continue cutting government spending. And among Republicans. The Democrats ideas budget, President Clinton laid marker saving surplus way found shore Social Security system. In budget terms, said Robert Reischauer, former director congressional budget office, like end Cold War. There differences well way things negotiated budget surplus. In 1990, 1993 1995, politicians staked careers striking budget deal lower deficit, fundamental question divide bitter medicine taxes less spending. Republicans, part, opposed tax increases favored cutting spending social programs. Democrats wanted raise taxes, especially rich, protect social spending. In end, balances carefully drawn. But plenty politicians  President George Bush, name one  lost jobs process. This year, Democrats Republicans alike claiming victory, burning issue parcel candy. Democrats got money education farm assistance. Republicans got money military extension popular tax breaks businesses. Some $20 billion eat surplus really go emergencies, like relief victims Hurricane Georges. But much money, like $90 million pay six new helicopters national police Colombia use drug interdiction, designated emergency spending simply way get budget. For politicians, new way fun. It hard imagine anyone voted office year's budget. But make easier reach agreement. The big difference principal fights year money all. They involved delicate policy issues like needle exchanges, contraception, global warming, immigration census. In Congress, consensus matters. So way policy could set wrap giant spending bill. It may pleasant debate policy money. But probably harder find way split difference. As long surplus lasts, lack discipline characterized budget-writing year likely continue. This distressing devoted controlling government spending. The temptation, said L. Ari Fleischer, spokesman House Ways Means Committee, grab loot spend it. Some conservatives sounded notes discord Friday federal spending agreement, also said would probably vote $500 billion package boosted defense spending provided aid farmers. However, one vote package yet, finished. The deal President Clinton Republican leaders hailed Thursday broad outline areas agreement final portion $1.7 trillion budget, written document. That crafted chairmen spending committees aides, said Friday still disputes needed resolved final document could run 3,000 pages. For example, still unresolved dispute whether airlines create peanut-free zone protect passengers allergic peanuts. House Speaker Newt Gingrich members Georgia, major peanut-producing state, fighting proposal, would force airlines ban peanuts within three rows someone allergy. Congress gave midnight Tuesday vote final bill, agreeing President Clinton fifth extension temporary financing keep government open. The budget due Oct. 1, start new fiscal year. The vote initially expected Friday, bill nowhere near written. Only handful top-level bargainers  including Gingrich, Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott White House chief staff Erskine Bowles  room final deal. Excluded committee chairmen heads appropriation committees, must write language put deal law. Almost everyone Capitol Hill expects budget pass eventually, biggest defections coming conservatives object $20 billion taken surplus address so-called emergencies package's failure offer voters serious tax cut. The lag time bill officially closed making conservatives nervous members try add provisions expand bill already consider overly bloated. And worry hometown pork stuffed bill publicly revealed, voters could put pressure members support it. The elections Nov. 3. But several conservatives said despite problems, expected support bill anyway. Rep. Mark Souder, R-Ind., said: `Most friends, predominantly activist conservatives, split 50-50. If tax cuts primary thing, unhappy, many conservatives mixed agenda. My position is, hold nose vote yes. We tax cuts far much spending I oppose, that's nature compromise. Every member little different focus. Souder said liked extra money defense spending, liked price supports farmers. Hog farmers district, whose biggest customers Japan China, hit hard collapse Asian markets. Several Republicans said bill seemed skewed favor Democrats. They cited two reasons: Clinton needed curry favor Democrats shore support House votes impeach him, Republican leaders feared stood Clinton, might forced government shutdown Republicans would blamed. Clinton buying votes, said Rep. David Hobson, R-Ohio. He sucking liberal Democrats would support impeachment. Rep. W.J. (Billy) Tauzin, R-La., said leaders seemed motivated desire avoid political damage incurred partial government shutdowns 1995 1996. He also cited president's need placate left adding costly domestic programs. The combination lessons learned three years ago scandal president's side yielded inevitable result, budget leans way left, Tauzin said. Still, said would probably support bill. It enthusiastically, said. It holding nose either. I would preferred spend money tax cut. I think would gotten tax cut, scandal. If president caught scandal, probably would followed Dick Morris strategy moved towards center. Gingrich said recognized conservatives wary agreement. But sought reassure package served interests. He cited $9 billion increase defense spending. And noted Republicans blocked several items, including needle-exchange programs District Columbia, national education testing U.S. contributions United Nations program pays family planning China, many Congress object China policy coercing abortions forcing sterilization. Gingrich said agreement best could achieved conservative Republican Congress liberal Democratic president. Some conservatives especially critical understanding Thursday. Rep. David McIntosh, R-Ind., leader conservatives House, denounced bill earlier Great Society type big-spending program. Friday, meeting Republicans, said, Our leadership found bad situation good job. A remained outright hostile bill, much hasty way cobbled together contained. Rep. Joe Barton, R-Texas, said: `I'm voting `no' unless something revolutionary happens Tuesday. I think process gives president ability stonewall end hold us ransom. The Republican leadership House Senate good job limiting highway robbery, still gone far beyond spending caps. Also angry rushed endgame Rep. Gene Taylor, D-Miss., took House floor said could support final bill. I'm going urge colleagues vote `no,'  Taylor said. We stayed long. We stay little bit longer. And I going encourage colleagues continue vote given adequate time study measure brought us. Voting mainly party lines question become touchstone debate development preservation wilderness, Senate Thursday approved gravel road remote wildlife habitat Alaska. The road, barely 30 miles long, would slice across edge wildlife refuge wilderness area Aleutian Peninsula, would connect isolated village called King Cove long-range air strip town Cold Bay. Without road, backers say, 700 residents King Cove must continue use unreliable air boat service emergencies, often risking dangerous winds seas seek medical evacuation Anchorage. Opponents road call project unjustifiable precedent threatens seasonal breeding grounds protected migratory birds, say improved air sea service would better alternative. The vote Thursday, 59-38, victory state's congressional delegation. But President Clinton likely veto measure, final outcome may depend whether sponsors insert road proposal huge spending bill likely emerge Congress heads home Nov. 3 elections. Three Republicans voted bill, six Democrats voted it. The Clinton administration repeatedly warned veto big spending bill contains array anti-environmental provisions consideration. Indeed, White House seems itching partisan fight environmental priorities. But many Republicans Congress still appear reluctant engage broad fight, willing Thursday cast lot Senate's two powerful Alaskans, Ted Stevens Frank Murkowski, Republicans. A companion bill House, sponsored Rep. Don Young Alaska, also Republican, come floor. Even Sen. John Chafee Rhode Island, leader Republican environmentalists, voted road. Last February Chafee's staff assembled score environmental lobbyists office plan strategy opposing road, environmental advocates said Thursday. They speculated senator changed position deference power Stevens, chairman Appropriations Committee exerts tremendous influence time dozen spending bills final stages. A Chafee aide said Chafee voted reluctantly road Alaska's senators convinced merits. Stevens said angry tones Thursday two-thirds Alaska's land limits development vital health services denied state's residents.

Negotiators met night hash disagreements aid schools, census contraceptives. These among biggest issues still separated two sides tried formulate message take home voters Nov. 3 elections. On education, issue President Clinton propelled forefront talks Republicans want appear recalcitrant, sides agreed spend $1 billion disagree spend it. The president insists money spent hiring 100,000 teachers across country average class reduced 18 students. Republicans, railing Beltway bureaucrats, say local school districts decide money spent, whether teachers computers. The two sides remained apart several ideological matters, including whether allow federal health plans cover contraceptives whether allow plans religious affiliations refuse cover contraceptives religious grounds moral grounds well. And also split conduct census year 2000. This one thorniest issues. It one moves voters, vital parties helps determine relative strength Congress. House Speaker Newt Gingrich Erskine Bowles, president's chief staff top negotiator, met much day speaker's office, shuttling ante-rooms lieutenants giving clues nitty gritty details talks. They given another deadline midnight Wednesday wrap $500 billion-worth spending items, could easily extend deadline another day two. They missed Oct. 1 start fiscal year, providing temporary funding federal government Oct. 9, Oct. 12, Wednesday. Some central issues, financing International Monetary Fund, nailed down, neither side ready declare final deal elements budget package place. We're splitting infinitives, Rep. Dick Armey Texas, Republican majority leader, said approving funds international fund. As worked several issues, Republican leaders appeared calculating differences party might sour final deal arrives House floor  concern Senate floor Senate fewer differences among Republicans White House. Some conservatives sounded notes discord Friday federal spending agreement, also said would probably vote $500 billion package boosted defense spending provided aid farmers. However, one vote package yet, finished. The deal President Clinton Republican leaders hailed Thursday broad outline areas agreement final portion $1.7 trillion budget, written document. That crafted chairmen spending committees aides, said Friday still disputes needed resolved final document could run 3,000 pages. For example, still unresolved dispute whether airlines create peanut-free zone protect passengers allergic peanuts.

Congress gave midnight Tuesday vote final bill, agreeing President Clinton fifth extension temporary financing keep government open. The budget due Oct. 1, start new fiscal year. The vote initially expected Friday, bill nowhere near written. Only handful top-level bargainers  including Gingrich, Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott White House chief staff Erskine Bowles  room final deal. Excluded committee chairmen heads appropriation committees, must write language put deal law. Almost everyone Capitol Hill expects budget pass eventually, biggest defections coming conservatives object $20 billion taken surplus address so-called emergencies package's failure offer voters serious tax cut. The lag time bill officially closed making conservatives nervous members try add provisions expand bill already consider overly bloated. And worry hometown pork stuffed bill publicly revealed, voters could put pressure members support it. The elections Nov. 3. But several conservatives said despite problems, expected support bill anyway. Rep. Mark Souder, R-Ind., said: `Most friends, predominantly activist conservatives, split 50-50. If tax cuts primary thing, unhappy, many conservatives mixed agenda. My position is, hold nose vote yes. We tax cuts far much spending I oppose, that's nature compromise. Every member little different focus. Souder said liked extra money defense spending, liked price supports farmers. Hog farmers district, whose biggest customers Japan China, hit hard collapse Asian markets. ","Whether to use the 1st surplus in decades for a tax cut, to pay off the national debt, or for new initiatives made the 1998 federal budget negotiations chaotic.The Oct 1 start of the fiscal year was extended 5 times.Major issues were census statistical sampling, federal health plan coverage of contraceptives regardless of religious affiliation, and school aid decisions by the federal gov't or local jurisdictions.Other issues included a Federal Election Commission provision, a road through an Alaskan wildlife refuge, and an airline peanut ban.Committees crafted the budget document after broad agreement was reached when 8 bills were lumped together.","In 1998, for the first time in decades, the US budget negotiators faced a surplus.Both sides said this was harder than a deficit situation, but they finally spent $1.7 trillion.The last seven spending bills were the most difficult and finally were merged into one package.Controversial issues included health insurance paying for contraception, control of new education allocations, an Alaskan wilderness road, whether the 2000 census would include statistical sampling, and establishing an emergency fund.Conservatives felt the results favored the liberals, but both sides were satisfied and glad to finish before Election Day and avoid a government shutdown.","Budget negotiations between the White House and House Republicans were delayed on several issues.At issue were provisions that included requiring Federal Health Insurance providers to provide contraceptives to women as Well as a provision to build a road across a wildlife preserve in Alaska.The contraceptive issue faced an uncertain future while Clinton likely will veto the road.There is disagreement also on how to spend the funding on education.This year's budget discussions also have been hampered because it is the first time since budget procedures were established in 1974 that there has been a surplus, preventing agreement on a budget resolution.","After several deadline extensions, Congressional leaders and the White House agreed on an omnibus spending package, the final portion of the $1.7 trillion budget.It includes more money for education and defense, business tax breaks, and farm aid, as well as funds for Colombia to use in drug interdiction.To offset the new spending, the surplus will be tapped for $20 billion, to the ire of conservatives.This year, without the common goal of reducing the deficit, reaching agreement was very difficult.Policy provisions involving the 2000 census, contraception, and the Alaskan wilderness were also tied to the spending package and were hotly debated."

1033,"Microsoft Corp. said material unpublished book two business school professors crucial part defense antitrust trial scheduled begin next week. But judging advance copy manuscript, Justice Department 20 states suing software giant find support arguments book well. To cite one example, Microsoft contends industry-standard Windows operating system Internet Explorer browser single integrated product. In suit, government asserts two separate products Microsoft bundled together get unfair edge rival, Netscape Communications Corp., market software used browse Internet's World Wide Web. In Competing Internet Time: Lessons Netscape Its Battle Microsoft, authors, Michael A. Cusumano Massachusetts Institute Technology's Sloan School Management David B. Yoffie Harvard business school, quote Microsoft executive saying third version Microsoft's browser integrated Windows. Microsoft hurried first browser offerings market, book says, race catch Netscape, took ambitious approach Internet Explorer 3.0, introduced August 1996. In version changed software design use programming modules, components, could put together rearragned like building blocks. In book, Ben Slivka, Microsoft general manager, quoted saying, IE 3.0 key thing componentized browser, He added, We really made Internet Explorer part Windows platform. The timing could legally significant suit government cites evidence requests August 1996 personal computer makers wanted load Netscape's browser machines instead Microsoft's browser. Microsoft denied requests, insisting browers Windows single, integrated product. Microsoft's legal team obtained early manuscript new book last month, issuing subpoena Netscape executive given confidential copy authors review. Microsoft also sought transcripts 44 current former Netscape employees interviewed authors. A federal judge Boston last week denied Microsoft access research materials, company may appeal ruling. The new book, published Free Press imprint Simon &AMP; Schuster, hurried print shipped within days start Microsoft trial Oct. 19. But already, quotes Netscape executives leaked out. The authors decided send complete manuscript The New York Times three news organizations Monday, material could read context. Microsoft intends use material book evidence Netscape's troubles resulted largely missteps rather alleged predatory practices Microsoft. The book detail Netscape stumbled, shifting strategy often running obstacles software development efforts. In private antitrust suits, argument competitor worst enemy established defense. But legal experts say defense may well far less effective federal case government seeking court-mandated changes Microsoft's business practices rather monetary damages goal plaintiffs private cases. It seems debate Netscape's mistakes total sideshow, said Robert Litan, former senior official Justice Department's antitrust division, Brookings Institution. But Microsoft big legal team, seems working every defense find. The book quotes former Netscape executive, Ram Shriram, saying company bungled chance win sizable share browser business America Online Inc. But second-chance deal America Online, leading online service. The government's case focuses earlier deal March 1996, America Online chose Internet Explorer preferred browser; bargain Microsoft agreed place startup icon online service main Windows desktop screen  prime real estate computing. For book entitled Competing Internet Time, intriguing one central themes Netcape got wedded notion Internet revolution would change everything quickly. Microsoft, contrast, stuck three-year planning horizon enabled company, authors write, mesh short-run tactical plans broader strategic view win war. The book quotes Steve Ballmer, Microsoft's president, saying, The fact matter customers can't take cataclysmic change every three months. The organization also can't. You ship products quickly. But can't say, `Oh, radically new strategy' every three months. The government's antitrust scrutiny Microsoft, world's largest independent software company, spanned Republican Democratic administrations involved hundreds government lawyers investigators. But means example consistent, coordinated public policy. Nor, accounts, politics. Instead, like software industry itself, government's pursuit Microsoft taken leaps, hit dead ends evolved ways one could controlled predicted back started 1989. It November year, hot afternoon computer-industry convention Las Vegas, Nev., Bill Gates, Microsoft's chairman, looked like he'd dragged news conference senior executive IBM  time dominated Microsoft entire computer industry. The two companies  IBM, leading maker personal computers Microsoft, leader PC operating system software  collaborating design marketing new operating system called OS/2. But Microsoft also beginning sell competing product, Windows. The industry trade press full worried articles: system going become new standard? With Gates standing uncomfortably side, James Cannavino, IBM divisional president, said two companies wanted clear air. OS/2 future, said. As Windows, added, would remain niche product under-equipped computers. Windows, asserted, would never receive advanced features OS/2. Gates certainly look happy. But disagree. The news conference got little attention, articles deep inside newspapers trade publications. But weeks later, Norris Washington, senior antitrust lawyer Federal Trade Commission, happened read one articles, Byte magazine. IBM Microsoft defined unified vision graphical operating environments, article said, looks sort like U.S. economic model, divided lower-, middle- upper-class products. As Washington saw it, IBM Microsoft colluding divide operating-system market  potential violation antitrust law. Soon FTC staff opened investigation Microsoft IBM And since small first step, Microsoft unrelenting scrutiny federal antitrust investigators constantly evolving series allegations charges, month month, year year, last nine years. Now comes antitrust trial scheduled begin Monday, multiplicity charges woven threads drawn dozen different investigative inquiries nine-year span. Microsoft, today feared company software business carrying stock-market value nearly $234 billion, presents huge highly visible antitrust target. Yet, company's allies ask, What Clinton administration's political agenda going Microsoft? answer seems none. In interviews, dozen current former senior antitrust officials  whether friends government Microsoft  say Justice Department's antitrust suit natural outgrowth previous investigations. As politics, officials agreed antitrust division operates independent administration's political considerations. Charles Rule assistant attorney general headed antitrust division Bush administration, Washington lawyer serves adviser advocate Microsoft. When I there, Rule said Justice days, White House punctilious terms never getting involved whatever decided do. There communication antitrust branches government. Asked believed policy changed Clinton administration, said: Not really. I've seen nothing suggest it. Joel Klein heads antitrust division now, interview dealing division's role Clinton administration's technology policy, specifically relating Microsoft case, said: There statutory restriction, practical matter, civil criminal prosecutions invariably carried without political contact. Klein said, way examples, might discuss merger cases involving military aviation industries Defense Department Transportation Department. But never White House, said. For significant case, might call White House say `An hour going hold press conference.'  The last time interference, added, Dita Beard-ITT case. Mrs. Beard, lobbyist ITT Corp., accused 1972 written memo saying $400,000 donation Republican National Convention gone long way toward settling antitrust suits brought company Nixon administration's Justice Department. The authenticity memo never proved, Mrs. Beard always denied writing it. In case, Klein says, since Watergate, immaculate. In case Microsoft, neither President Clinton Vice President Al Gore ever volunteered comment. In answer question news conference May, suit filed, Clinton said: I taken view I comment matters within Justice Department. At time, I think I depart policy case, even though obviously big impact important sector economy. But I say, based I know date, I confidence way antitrust division Justice Department handled matter. Since then, Clinton said nothing else case, publicly least. And Gore, generally represents administration technology issues, never commented all. In Rule's opinion, administration would foolish involve itself, even politically acceptable so. It would little odd administration push Justice Department suit, said. It would policy mistake political mistake. I would hard pressed explain would that. Taking sides highly charged technology world dangerous, particularly since Democrats rely Silicon Valley companies political donations support. In fact, present former government officials said suit simply natural extension inquiries conducted last nine years. They began FTC. Soon Washington read article Byte, FTC staff opened investigation Windows-OS/2 question. But happened often following years, turns market made initial inquiry irrelevant. Microsoft abandoned agreement IBM, Windows quickly grew industry standard, OS/2 remained cipher. But issue faded, government investigators began looking Microsoft found things troubled them. In 1991 Washington, still works FTC, informed Microsoft investigation expanded. The agency, letter said, trying determine whether Microsoft using dominant position operating-systems software stifle competition areas. That general idea lies heart present suit. One former senior FTC official said commission staff confidence case realized Reagan-era commissioners, approve suit, might different view. We knew commission might difficulty monopolization case, former official said. They brought case years. And fact, 1993 commission voted 2-2 question whether file formal charges. The deadlock served dismissal. Then, months later, Justice Department decided pick case. It farther along cases got, recalled Robert Litan, former senior official Justice Department's antitrust division Brookings Institution. Usually case would two three people complaining documents, said. But fully researched record. They gave us files briefed us done. The Justice Department lawyers picked thread. The general idea behind inquiry, Litan said, allowed use monopoly operating systems cement monopoly areas. In 1995, Microsoft government reached consent agreement company promised stop forcing PC makers buy one copy Microsoft operating system every computer sold  instead one every computer operating system, MS-DOS Windows, installed. The company also agreed stop tying sale one software product sale another. The charges present suit similar many ways. Even agreement, government investigations continued. That year, Justice Department investigators showed offices Netscape Communications Corp. first time ask questions next line inquiry. America Online complaining, senior Netscape executive recalled, Microsoft bundling Microsoft Network, competing online service, Windows. Once more, market forces overtook investigation. The Microsoft Network never grew particularly popular America Online prospered grew. But, surprisingly, new complaints filled void. In May 1995, Anne Bingaman, assistant attorney general headed antitrust division, remarked: We get complaints Microsoft time. We become kind Microsoft complaints center. And take seriously. In 1996, Netscape's first complaint arrived. In letter Justice Department, Netscape said Microsoft using dominance personal-computer operating systems force persuade computer makers favor Microsoft's browser, used explore World Wide Web, one marketed Netscape. The next year Justice Department formally charged Microsoft violating consent agreement tying sales Windows installation company's Web browser new computers. It seemed like slam-dunk violation consent decree, natural extension case, recalled Litan, left department then. A Federal District Court judge agreed, Appeals Court panel overturned ruling summer. In meantime, last May Justice Department 20 state attorneys general filed new suit Microsoft, scheduled trial Monday. It contends Microsoft engaged bundling, tying predatory behavior similar many ways numerous previous allegations investigations last nine years. A good part case Round II case dealt Round I, early 1990s, Litan said. Or, former senior FTC official put it, there's certainly common thread runs way here. But years thread twisted, pulled spun hundreds different hands. The case United States vs. Microsoft Corp., government's aggressive move monopolist almost 25 years, playing century antitrust laws broadly worded court rulings ambiguous sides citing rulings support opposing arguments. Whatever outcome trial, scheduled begin Monday U.S. District Court Washington, almost certain appeal leave Supreme Court task bringing legal order 100 years clashing antitrust doctrines. The case focuses Microsoft's Windows, operating system controls 90 percent personal computers sold today. The government says objective curb illegal monopolistic business practices threaten render large parts economy vulnerable vicissitudes single company. Microsoft asserts case intended give government control features added Windows. However grand economic stakes, legal dispute narrow. The government says Microsoft's contracts computer manufacturers companies provide access Internet illegally stifle competition. The contracts prohibit manufacturers substituting Netscape Communications Corp.'s Navigator browser Microsoft's Internet Explorer. They also prohibit removing Windows main screen, desktop, links sites World Wide Web run Microsoft partners. Microsoft's contracts companies connect people Internet businesses sell goods services Web require favored treatment Internet Explorer Navigator exchange links Windows desktop. In wake lawsuit, Microsoft voluntarily dropped requirements, though could reinstate will. Microsoft says contracts legal produce tangible benefits customers, including easier Internet access. The Justice Department says bundling Explorer Windows 95 inclusion browser part Windows 98 amount tying, illegal practice forces customers one product purchase another. The contracts manufacturers Internet services illegal, government says, intended create monopoly browser market protect Microsoft's existing monopoly operating systems. The latter threat key, according Justice Department. Browsers potential, like operating system, act software platform programs run. So contracts intended drive browsers market would also insulate Windows monopoly. Many antitrust experts say problem facing Justice Department courts provided clear definition tying clear guidelines determining contracts illegally exclusionary. Professor Lawrence White New York University, chief economist Justice Department's antitrust division early 1980s, says courts treat tying unusual practice fact ubiquitous. No one, said, would challenge right manufacturers tie erasers tip pencils, tires automobile buttons shirts. His point, shared widely among economists, tying benefits consumers if, example, results products easier use enables company recover development costs. But tying bad locks monopoly power. The courts, White says, offered enough guidance distinguishing good tying bad, nub legal dispute. Microsoft says needs show bundling Windows Explorer passes might called gross consumer benefits test  offers immediate benefit, whether causes long-term damage competition and, therefore, ultimately consumers. The Justice Department says Microsoft's practices must clear higher hurdle: yielding net consumer benefits immediate large enough balance possible long-term harm competition. So test consumer benefits satisfies antitrust laws? The simple answer one knows sure, sides reasonably cite cases without fear embarrassment. Consider 1985 case, Aspen Skiing Co. vs. Aspen Highlands Skiing Corp., 1951 case, Lorain Journal Co. vs. United States. In first, Aspen Skiing, owner three major ski runs Aspen, Colo.  monopolist  years sold ticket cooperation Aspen Highlands, competitor, gave skiers access companies' runs. When Aspen Skiing unilaterally canceled agreement, rival's revenues shriveled rival sued. The Supreme Court ruled Aspen Skiing violated antitrust laws evidence action helped consumers. In Lorain Journal case, local newspaper Lorain, Ohio, refused sell advertising companies advertised new radio station. Here, too, Supreme Court ruled exclusionary practice nothing benefit consumers. Indeed, Aspen Skiing, court even forced monopolist business rival, precedent augurs well Justice Department, seeks force Microsoft install Netscape's browser alongside own. But Charles Rule, legal consultant Microsoft, says cases courts threw exclusionary practices offered consumer benefit. The courts, argues, never pounced practices resulted lower prices better products service. Nor courts either case call balancing immediate benefits hypothetical long-term harm. Rule argues Microsoft's practices produce demonstrable consumer benefits. Besides, says, unlike actions taken The Lorain Journal Aspen Skiing, Microsoft's contracts prevent consumers installing Netscape's browser using Web sites Microsoft's rivals. In truth, though, neither case answered consumer benefit test apply product design. In Jefferson Parish Hospital District No. 2 et al. vs. Hyde, another case cited sides, Supreme Court 1984 recognized surgeons anesthesiologists provide integrated service. Yet, court said, hospital monopoly power would still allowed force surgical patients use panel anesthesiologists consumers wanted purchase two services separately. That principle could undercut Microsoft's defense functional interdependence Windows Explorer requires bundling. But Microsoft point strong concurring opinion called tougher standard government meet alleges tying. Microsoft also draw support several court rulings allowed IBM change design computers ways made hard vendors attach peripheral equipment. But perhaps Microsoft's best argument nowhere government identified single case courts explicitly called throwing tied product basis balancing test. The courts, Microsoft emphasize, steer clear redesigning technically sophisticated products. The Justice Department's rejoinder note sole purpose antitrust law protect consumers, makes sense bless practices provide dollar's worth benefits today but, stamping competition, drive prices $1,000 tomorrow. The Justice Department ask court least insist monopolists use least exclusionary means possible achieve whatever services provide customers. Experts agree courts subject Microsoft's restrictive contracts Internet companies balancing test. But exactly court decide whether consumers helped hurt grabs. A balancing test would courts weigh immediate benefits consumers one-click access Internet sites features bundled Windows-Explorer package versus harm time diminished competition markets browsers operating systems. But test makes good sense theory prove fiendishly difficult use practice. Balancing tests impossibly difficult arbitrary, said Rep. Thomas Campbell, R-Calif., former law professor Stanford University. The practical effect balancing hand defendants like Microsoft almost certain victory. Microsoft argues  many antitrust experts agree  courts fact gravitated away balancing test toward simpler predation test exclusionary contracts. Under standard, contract illegal intended drive competition thus pave way monopolist raise prices later. Microsoft easier time defending charge predation, amounts victimizing customers, would defending charge bundled product consumers slightly harm good. The antitrust record, says William Baxter, headed antitrust division President Reagan, littered contradictory, ambiguous sometimes nonsensical verdicts. He legal experts agree nothing else, record leaves plenty legal leeway Supreme Court, hear Microsoft case, stiffen spine antitrust law. The legal tool government using assault Microsoft Corp.  Sherman Antitrust Act 1890  brief, vague malleable. The combination meant bedrock statute antitrust policy turns toothless powerful years, depending politics economics day interpreted courts. Sponsored Sen. John Sherman, Ohio Republican younger brother Civil War general William Tecumseh Sherman, act passed nod popular backlash rise industrial trusts oil, steel railroads. Farmers, laborers small-business owners  sizable voting groups  resented trusts vehicles concentrated power. But trusts, large national holding corporations, viewed many others engines modernization industrialization. Economists time opposed Sherman Act, law Congress passed vaguely worded compromise. No one knew impact would have, one senator, quoted Matthew Josephson's The Robber Barons, explained nearly everyone agreed something must flung appease restive masses. The act's two key provisions, Sections 1 2, mention conspiracy, restraint trade attempt monopolize. Yet Sherman Act interpreted Magna Carta competition, never uses term. After passed, critics trusts derided impenetrable language Sherman Act called Swiss Cheese Act. But early 1900s, political climate changed. The growing antagonism trusts, especially income gaps widened, tapped avowed trustbuster, Theodore Roosevelt, became president 1901. The Sherman Act always elastic piece social legislation, used attack perceived exploitation aggregation power, said Eleanor Fox, professor New York University Law School. The model trust  principal target trustbusters  Standard Oil. Shrewdly, Roosevelt made distinction good trusts, thrived superior efficiency, bad trusts, grew result inevitable economic forces unfair business practices. Throughout 1880s '90s, Standard Oil's rivals complained company business practices founder, John D. Rockefeller. But years, price kerosene  burned light nation's homes declined steadily. So Standard Oil, could could reasonably argued, enterprising monopoly. In early 1900s, though, Standard Oil raised prices United States prop profits time engaged price war Royal Dutch/Shell Europe, Standard Oil face genuine competition. When consumers hurt Standard Oil monopoly, popular support antitrust action company swelled, encouraged Roosevelt successor, William Howard Taft. The federal suit Standard Oil filed 1906, Supreme Court approved breakup company 1911. Standard Oil Microsoft case, historians observe, common themes. Both dominant companies day, Bill Gates, Microsoft chairman, called modern Rockefeller. But presidential involvement real consumer dissatisfaction Microsoft case, said Ron Chernow, author Titan, best-selling biography Rockefeller. And Rockefeller, Chernow added, never went kind honeymoon period widespread public adulation favorable press coverage Bill Gates had. In summer 1995, whiff revolution air Silicon Valley. The Internet offered new deal computing, fresh opportunity entrepreneurs try break Microsoft Corp.'s firm grip personal computer software business. Leading challenge Netscape Communications Corp., whose software browsing World Wide Web ignited Internet boom. Netscape chairman James Clark spoke boldly attacking Microsoft head-on. He borrowed imagery movie Star Wars, referring Microsoft Death Star Netscape leader rebel alliance. Microsoft answered vengeance. It dispatched hundreds programmers work competing browser poured many millions dollars marketing it. It prodded computer makers others distribute browser, folded browser industry-dominant Windows operating system gave browser away free  campaign intended cut air supply, senior Microsoft executive described it. But competitors like Netscape encountered Microsoft's force. Microsoft's partners, corporate customers professional investors finance new ventures collided it. A close look Microsoft's no-holds-barred push Internet software business offers window ways company uses market muscle influence behavior virtually every player industry. Some cases recounted figure prominently suit brought Justice Department 20 states, scheduled go trial month, charging Microsoft times went far  violated antitrust laws. Regardless legal outcome, previously unreported details incidents suit examples provide complete picture Microsoft action.  When Compaq Computer Corp. considered loading Netscape's browser instead Microsoft's personal computers, Microsoft threatened stop selling Windows operating system Compaq. The company quickly changed mind.  After Spyglass Inc. began supplying Microsoft early browser technology, Microsoft announced would give away browser free. The timing came rude surprise partner Spyglass. The company lost revenues almost overnight, technology, also licensing companies besides Microsoft, suddenly became available free.  When America Online Inc., competes fiercely Microsoft's online service electronic commerce divisions, went shopping browser technology, Microsoft made offer good pass up: If America Online used Microsoft's browser main one millions subscribers, Microsoft would give America Online prime placement desktop screen personal computers using Windows.  When Intel Corp. began developing Internet software, Microsoft complained. Intel, leading maker microprocessors serve electronic brains personal computers running Windows, pulled back. The chip maker decided lucrative hand-in-glove partnership Microsoft took priority.  Microsoft's reach computing become pervasive nearly every year now, Silicon Valley's top venture capitalists meet privately team top Microsoft executives learn company's plans. The goal, one venture investor observed, stay way steamroller. Microsoft adamantly denies broken laws similar situations. The company plays game business hard, executives acknowledge without apology. Yes, Microsoft says, rivals may suffer partners may irritated occasionally. But company insists actions guided main corporate goal bringing new technology inexpensively conveniently millions people use software. Most people computer industry say living Microsoft's world means routinely making accommodations it. Microsoft's power emanates near-monopoly market personal computer operating systems, master control programs run computers. Because owns operating system, Microsoft essential utility information age, said James Moore, president Geopartners Research Inc., technology consulting firm. It acts kind gatekeeper pipeline computing innovation, sitting deciding whether help innovation slow down. For months, Microsoft Netscape talked off, circling warily. But event would define unflinching rivals meeting June 21, 1995, second-floor conference room Netscape's headquarters Mountain View, Calif. That meeting, according Justice Department 20 states suing Microsoft, high-tech equivalent storied gatherings smoke-filled railroad cars inspired passage nation's antitrust laws century ago. On day, say, Microsoft made Netscape illegal offer divvy market Internet browsing software, collusion pact Netscape rejected. Microsoft replies prosecutors misinterpreting routine meeting software business company never tried divide browser market. Bill Gates, Microsoft's chairman principal strategist, attend Mountain View gathering, consulted telephone Microsoft team. Two people attend June meeting named witnesses trial scheduled begin next week: Netscape president James Barksdale Daniel Rosen, Microsoft's general manager new technology. In trial, government contend Microsoft presented Netscape all-or-nothing offer, according people questioned federal investigation. Relying heavily notes taken meeting Netscape executive vice president Marc Andreessen testimony Barksdale, prosecutors expected assert Microsoft proposal several elements, incentives requirements. Microsoft, according people questioned government, would invest Netscape, taking 15 20 percent stake, give Netscape technical information fine-tune Microsoft's operating systems Netscape's software would run better Windows. In return, people say, Netscape would give Microsoft seat board, license technology Microsoft, give Microsoft advance knowledge product-development efforts make browser next generation Microsoft operating system, Windows 95, shipped two months June 1995 meeting. And Microsoft, people added, always denied  used access technology powerful lever business negotiations, offering Netscape preferential access Windows application program interfaces, APIs, links enable companies' programs run smoothly Windows operating system. By turning deal, Netscape, say, would preferred access Microsoft technology  threat Microsoft fiercely denies making. Barksdale, Netscape's 55-year-old chief executive, told colleague encounter Microsoft June 1995 damnedest meeting I've ever attended 35 years business. Had Netscape accepted Microsoft's offer, would Microsoft's money endorsement. Netscape would also free sell browser use earlier versions Windows use operating systems like Apple's Macintosh Unix, powerful system used mainly corporations research labs. But licensed technology Microsoft stepped aside, best could hoped becoming company sales $100 million hoping bought Microsoft, said Clark, former computer scientist Stanford University founded Silicon Graphics Inc., computer graphics pioneer, starting Netscape. We start Netscape that. For company, meeting Microsoft often charged affair. Every computing device keyboards disk drives, every software program games browsers, must mesh smoothly Microsoft's Windows operating system. This necessary make computers reliable easier use, also gives Microsoft role industry's gatekeeper. And since Microsoft makes manner software products beyond operating system, companies put uneasy position requiring Microsoft's cooperation able compete it. And software industry, every program rendered digital code 1's 0's, lines divide competition cooperation often blurred. The talk line Microsoft-Netscape meeting focused division operating system  platform, computer terms  application programs, sometimes called solutions, run top operating system. The government suit states sworn testimony, Chris Jones, Microsoft manager attended meeting, admitted Microsoft `absolutely' intended persuade Netscape compete. Microsoft reads Jones' testimony differently, evidence mainly company's clarifying position. If Netscape stayed applications solutions side operating system, two companies could partners, Microsoft said. But Netscape tried become player platform space, would compete. Microsoft released portions Jones deposition September evidence government quoted Microsoft manager context. Q. Do recall discussion desire anybody part Microsoft participating able persuade influence Netscape compete? A. Absolutely. But again, persuade sense force persuade sense of, hey, think great business relationship together. Later deposition, Justice Department lawyer asked Jones whether Microsoft executives intended suggest would consequences Netscape business Netscape chose go platform direction described earlier opposed solutions direction. Jones replied: The conversation something like following: `We're platform business. We're going invest heavily part platform feel critical technologies. That's done deal.' And we're asking them: `What business? Is business platforms solutions? If platforms, we're platforms business. We're competing.' Microsoft portrays comments innocuous statements fact. But Netscape, remarks could taken warning, threat. This Internet browsing software potential become alternative platform Windows operating system. The browser, sitting top operating system, could supplant Windows main desktop screen users' machines main layer programming starting software applications. In addition, Netscape's browser could serve powerful platform distributing running Java, Internet programming language developed Sun Microsystems Inc., Microsoft rival. In technical terms, Netscape's upstart platform could replace Microsoft's APIs essential utility computing. Indeed, Andreessen boasted public Netscape's ambition relegate Microsoft's Windows much software plumbing underneath browser. By June meeting, Microsoft certainly viewed Netscape serious potential challenger Windows, corporate crown jewel. On May 26, 1995, internal memo, The Internet Tidal Wave, Gates wrote: A new competitor `born' Internet Netscape. Their browser dominant 70 percent usage share, allowing determine network extensions catch on. Netscape's strategy, Gates wrote, move key API browser commoditize underlying operating system. THE BROADER INQUIRY: GOVERNMENT SEES ARM-TWISTING The federal government states recently broadened allegations Microsoft adding evidence tried bully Intel, Apple Computer Inc. companies squelch competition. They say like Netscape meeting new evidence fits pattern behavior Microsoft, repeatedly tried limit competition strong-arming competitors partners. One episode fits pattern, prosecutors contend, effort Microsoft pressure Intel shelve development multimedia Internet software limit cooperation Netscape. Intel's main business making microprocessor chips act electronic brains of computers run Windows operating system. Indeed, fortunes Intel Microsoft closely aligned two companies sometimes referred single, powerful entity, Wintel. But Intel also employs hundreds software engineers, mainly Intel Architecture Labs Hillsboro, Ore. And Intel Microsoft partners, also conflicts, typically direction pace certain innovations introduced personal computer industry, dominate together. Federal state investigators focused Microsoft's strong reaction work done Intel's software engineers  sentiment expressed uncertain terms meeting Intel's Santa Clara, Calif., headquarters Aug. 2, 1995. The contentious session attended several executives Intel Microsoft, including Gates Intel chairman Andrew Grove. An internal Intel memo stated Gates made vague threats supporting Intel's competitors livid Intel's investments Internet wanted stopped. Later, Intel pull back multimedia Internet software development. Steven McGeady, Intel vice president attended August 1995 meeting, scheduled appear witness government. Microsoft replies government's accounts meetings like Netscape Intel fanciful distortions, created using biased selection documents witnesses. The government's case, Microsoft asserts, betrays utter failure accept computer-industry reality Microsoft routinely meets companies make sure software equipment work well Windows. Sometimes talks, Microsoft says, go include levels cooperation like licensing technology Microsoft investment, company discussed Netscape. In trial, Microsoft expected argue advance browser market result business acumen Netscape's missteps. To document Netscape's errors, Microsoft issued subpoena last month obtained unpublished manuscript new book, Competing Internet Time: Lessons From Netscape Its Battle With Microsoft, based hundreds interviews current former Netscape executives. The book chronicle mistakes made Netscape. But authors, Michael Cusumano Massachusetts Institute Technology's Sloan School Management David Yoffie Harvard Business School, think Microsoft hardly blameless. Microsoft's take-no-prisoners strategy backfired, inviting retaliation competitors, government even customers, Yoffie said. Emphasizing offering legal judgment, Yoffie added, I think Microsoft could achieved 90 percent without crossing line much did. THE SPYGLASS LINK: REWARDS AND PERILS OF A PARTNERSHIP On April 6, 1994, Gates 20 Microsoft executives gathered daylong retreat far company's headquarters Redmond, Wash. The subject Internet might revolutionize computer software business. Few concrete plans made day, Microsoft executives insist direction set. Our vision outset unite two worlds Windows desktop Internet, said Steven Sinofsky, Microsoft executive attended meeting. Yet Microsoft badly trailed Netscape browser field. To hasten entry, Microsoft licensed early browsing software Spyglass Inc. Naperville, Ill. The first meeting two companies initiated Spyglass April 1994. At time, tiny company eager deal Microsoft. Spyglass selected commercial licensee browser technology developed National Center Supercomputing University Illinois. In summer 1994, Douglas Colbeth, president Spyglass, met Clark Netscape O'Hare International Airport Chicago. The two men talked United Airlines Red Carpet Room, reserved business-class passengers, Colbeth recalled Clark telling him, We're going take Microsoft head-on. At time, Colbeth recalled thinking himself, Great, Microsoft really want license me. Today, noted: Remember, company couple dozen people almost money bank. Netscape Jim Clark, money reputation, big-time venture capital backing Silicon Valley. Netscape different agenda. By July 1994, Microsoft become quite interested Spyglass technology, Colbeth says, two companies signed first licensing agreement following December. Microsoft, Colbeth recalls, always told would eventually fold browser technology operating system, timing accelerated Netscape's rapid rise. Microsoft initially hoping charge browser, Colbeth said. But Dec. 7, 1995, Gates declared Microsoft would deeply integrate browser Windows would give away. The announcement caught industry, even Colbeth, surprise. At time, Spyglass licensed technology 82 companies, including IBM Digital Equipment, use software products  licensing revenue stream $20 million year. As result Microsoft's move, Spyglass saw revenues vanish within year, smaller Internet software companies went business big customers shifted Microsoft's free browser. Spyglass slashed payroll scrambled new niches software industry replace lost sales, succeeded eventually. Whenever license technology Microsoft, understand someday build itself, drop operating system put business, Colbeth said. THE NONOPTION COMPAQ: SUDDENLY SEES THE LIGHT Well 1996, Netscape's share browser market continued rise, Microsoft made little headway, even though browser free. Industry analysts trade magazines agreed Netscape's browser clear technical leader. In April 1996, Netscape's Navigator used 87 percent people browsing Web, compared 4 percent using Microsoft's Internet Explorer, according Zona Research. So biggest personal computer maker, Compaq, thought made sense give customers Netscape's browser instead Microsoft's. But Microsoft would stand  Compaq choice give in. In June 1996, Compaq wanted load popular Netscape browser machines also remove icon Microsoft's Internet Explorer, delivered computer maker Windows 95. Microsoft informed Compaq removed Internet Explorer, computer maker would lose license Windows, said Stephen Decker, Compaq's director software procurement, testimony federal investigators. The ultimatum Microsoft delivered bluntly letter headed, Notice Intent Terminate License Agreement. Faced denied essential operating system, Compaq quickly reversed course kept Internet Explorer icon. Microsoft asserts Windows Internet Explorer single product Microsoft alone defines product. Nothing contracts, Microsoft adds, prohibits computer makers including competing technologies. While cutoff letter Microsoft sent Compaq seems unnecessarily hardball tactic dealing largest corporate customer, Microsoft chief operating officer Bob Herbold insists take one letter one snippet e-mail try portray Microsoft arrogant company unfair. Noting Compaq executive witness Microsoft, Herbold said, We totally dependent tremendous relationships key companies like Compaq. At Netscape, however, Compaq episode watershed. That singular act got going Justice Department, Barksdale recalled. Barksdale said regarded Microsoft's tactic forcing Compaq buy browser condition obtaining essential product, Windows operating system, illegal act absolute proof Microsoft monopolist. After investigating incident, Justice Department states agreed Barksdale Microsoft illegally tying sale one product another. Microsoft replies long history adding new features operating system. And outset, Microsoft says, intended Windows Internet Explorer browser would seamlessly integrated, Windows 98. Thus, Microsoft insists, product-tying violation antitrust laws. In separate case, federal appeals court sided Microsoft, upholding principle company could put whatever wanted operating system declare single product. But June 1996, Compaq wanted offer Netscape product instead Microsoft's browser, industry experts viewed browser operating system two different software programs. It took long time integration strategy play out, said former senior Microsoft researcher. Back then, integration basically bolting browser onto Windows. THE `BALANCING ACT': AMERICA ONLINE TOSSES IN TOWEL America Online chairman Stephen Case refers dealing Microsoft delicate balancing act. That balance swung sharply fall 1995 spring 1996, Microsoft used lure giving America Online featured place Windows desktop ultimate bargaining chip. To gain access computing's coveted real estate, America Online agreed make Microsoft's Internet Explorer main browser online subscribers, number 13 million. Yet throughout 1995, Microsoft prepared introduce Windows 95, significant improvement ever operating system, Case knocking door Justice Department. His complaint Microsoft going place new online service, Microsoft Network, direct competitor America Online, prominently desktop screen Windows 95, introduced August. This bundling tactic using industry-dominant operating system market Microsoft Network, MSN, Case argued, gave Microsoft unfair advantage young fast-growing online business. The Justice Department listened investigated. But ultimately, government decided taking action. At America Online's headquarters Vienna, Va., Microsoft feared loathed time. America Online designated Microsoft watcher, young M.B.A. tracked adversary's every move. Above desk small, windowless office picture Gates. Beneath picture, large block letters, words THE ENEMY. Though America Online clear leader online services business, ample reason worry all-out assault rival rich aggressive Microsoft. When visited Microsoft headquarters couple years earlier, Case recalled, Gates bluntly assessed Microsoft's options saying could buy 20 percent America Online, enter online business bury you. A threat merely statement facts? A bit both, Case said recently. But mainly articulating everybody meeting kind intuitively understood. Yet 1996, Microsoft America Online found reason cooperate. With exploding popularity Internet's World Wide Web, conventional online companies, like America Online Compuserve, provide customers Internet access well services. America Online browser, keep pace rapidly advancing technology made sense deal Netscape Microsoft. For software companies, deal America Online, 5 million subscribers time, could mean big surge browser use market share. Netscape seemed natural partner America Online, since companies Microsoft rivals. On March 11, America Online announce would buy Netscape technology, standard licensing deal based payment-for-use formula. The next day, America Online announced significant deal Microsoft making browser default technology  browser America Online subscribers would use unless specifically asked Netscape's Navigator. To win deal, Microsoft offered give America Online start-up icon Windows desktop  precisely kind equal treatment main Windows screen Case asked Justice Department require Microsoft. After agreed Internet Explorer browser, Microsoft allowed us bundled Windows desktop, Case said. It example Microsoft's pragmatic side. The pragmatic decision paramount corporate goal increase browser market share protect mainstay software business. As result, new online service, MSN, would sacrifice important marketing advantage main rival, America Online. It Bill's decision, said former MSN general manager Russell Siegelman, referring Gates. He sent e-mail it. He said think would hurt MSN much. I disagreed him. To Microsoft executives, Gates expressed different view likely impact MSN. He told senior vice president Brad Silverberg putting America Online Windows desktop would amount putting bullet MSN's head, according deposition taken Justice Department. In antitrust suit, government asserts America Online deal shows Microsoft used power Windows monopoly give edge browser war Netscape. David Colburn, senior vice president America Online took part browser negotiations Microsoft, witness government. Today, Microsoft overhauled Internet strategy focus mainly building popular special-interest Web sites fields like travel, personal finance, automobile retailing news. And putting sites, along e-mail search features, all-in-one site uses name MSN.com. I still regard Microsoft primary threat, Case observed. Microsoft history getting right long run, there's reason think business well. We always Microsoft's cross hairs. THE LESSON: DON'T CONFRONT A STEAMROLLER At Netscape's headquarters Silicon Valley, strategy today one avoiding head-to-head competition Microsoft whenever possible. Don't something Microsoft's path  that's lesson learned, observed Clark, Netscape chairman. Silicon Valley's venture capitalists, investors finance many nation's high-tech startups, generally follow Netscape formula days. Yet still leaves ample room prosper. For competing directly Microsoft dangerous, software industry whole engine wealth creation, job generation technical innovation. And ambivalent side venture community's relationship Microsoft. For start-up cannot steer clear Microsoft entirely, favored option bought Microsoft, scooped many fledgling companies way acquiring promising technology people. Microsoft understands start-up innovation co-opt start-up innovation better high-tech company, said James Breyer, managing partner Accel Partners, venture capital firm. As Microsoft grown, come seen merely competitor force nature shapes business environment, like weather front. Microsoft incredibly pervasive, said Stewart Alsop, partner New Enterprise Associates, venture capital firm Menlo Park, Calif. At board meetings companies firm invested, two issues always come up, said: One price company's stock, Microsoft going do. In last years, Microsoft offered guidance almost yearly meetings senior Microsoft executives leading venture capitalists. The meetings part Microsoft's effort improve sometimes prickly relations Silicon Valley. We work hard provide clarity we're going we're going, said Greg Maffei, Microsoft's chief financial officer. Last year's conference took place October Quadrus office building Sand Hill Road Menlo Park, Wall Street high-tech venture investing. Maffei led team five Microsoft executives appeared group 40 venture capitalists, one stood asked question seemed minds many peers: How I invest company stays way steamroller? Maffei, recalled one person attended meeting, stood delivered brief lecture businesses Microsoft likely avoid. His list included specialized software manufacturing, human resources management, computer-aided design others. But, person noted, broad swaths industry appeared designated limits  including new software platforms might compete Microsoft's personal computer operating system. At one point, Ruthann Quindlen, partner Institutional Venture Partners, leaned Vinod Khosla, co-founder Sun Microsystems partner venture capital firm Kleiner Perkins Caufield &AMP; Byers, said quietly, I guess leaves us washing machines toasters. Following text first two sections Sherman Act, passed Congress 1890. As foundation federal antitrust law built, act amended several times  elevating crime felony, increasing fines prison terms individuals setting fines corporations convicted violating it. In case Microsoft, government invoked Sherman Act file civil suit seeks change company's business practices, criminal suit seeks financial penalties. An Act Protect Trade And Commerce Against Unlawful Restraints Monopolies: Section 1. Every contract, combination form trust otherwise, conspiracy, restraint trade commerce among several States, foreign nations, hereby declared illegal. Every person shall make contract engage combination conspiracy, shall deemed guilty misdemeanor, and, conviction thereof, shall punished fine exceeding five thousand dollars, imprisonment exceeding one year, said punishments, discretion court. Section 2. Every person shall monopolize, attempt monopolize, combine conspire person persons, monopolize part trade commerce among several States, foreign nations, shall deemed guilty misdemeanor, and, conviction thereof, shall punished fine exceeding five thousand dollars, imprisonment exceeding one year, said punishments, discretion court. Will matter consumers Bill Gates nice guy? Until last week, Americans thought Gates, chairman Microsoft Corp., genius innovator. A nerd perhaps  also self-styled visionary almost single-handedly unlocked power personal computer. Monday, however, Washington courtroom, Justice Department began painting different, darker portrait Gates. In antitrust suit brought department 20 states, man whose company commands 97 percent share market personal computer operating systems depicted Nixonian schemer go almost length crush competition. Product innovation, suit argues, sufficient weapon Gates. Flashing back forth snippets Gates' videotaped deposition e-mail messages sent contradicted testimony, government sought establish pattern threats offers payments Microsoft chairman. It also sought cast Gates obsessed man feared tiny Netscape Communications Corp. potential threat domination market Internet browsers, software used navigate World Wide Web. Gates portrayed Justice Department litigator David Boies schoolyard bully rides roughshod computer industry crudeness stark contrast popular image benevolent dictator high-technology guru. According document presented Boies, example, Gates asked America Online executives 1996: How much need pay damage Netscape? This lucky day. The implication, Boies said, amount irrelevant, Microsoft, deep pockets market dominance, makes many offers can't refuse needed achieve goals. Microsoft officials closely watching market surveys hint new image bare-knuckled Gates might detracting company's world-famous brand name, insist public continue draw distinction allegations anticompetitive business tactics company's software. Despite reading press, people judge us products, said Mich Matthews, head Microsoft's corporate public-relations office. Our experience people vote pocketbooks. So far, consumers casting positive votes. Last week Microsoft reported quarterly profits $1.52 billion, stunning 58 percent increase level year earlier. Despite record profits, marketing experts say public comes view Gates Rockefeller-style robber baron, company brand name may suffer. When company visible chief executive, CEO really driver brand, said David Aaker, brand marketing expert Haas School Business University California Berkeley. There question going affect Microsoft's brand recognition. Already early warning signals, political cartoons newspapers across country bashed Gates last week. One showed holding globe saying, If play way, I'll take ball go home; another portrayed Microsoft chairman standing next henchman dangling someone window Microsoft secretary says caller, I'm sorry, Mr. Gates busy teaching competitor Windows. But industry analysts believe new view Bill Gates knows play hardball may bad thing company. The he-said, she-said round e-mail messages dragged court cases Washington Silicon Valley, Microsoft locked legal battle archrival, Sun Microsystems Inc., viewed little different exaggerated trash talking goes professional sports. It's like taking Charles Barkley Michael Jordan say ball court turning something sinister really is, said Paul Andrews, co-author Stephen Manes Gates (Doubleday, 1993). Indeed, evidence darker view Gates company far taken root District Columbia Silicon Valley, computer industry long felt impact Gates' tactics, bitterness distrust Microsoft deep. In rest country, Gates continues enjoy great popularity. Two weeks ago, speaking crowd almost 7,000 students Indiana University, questioner asked Justice Department's suit roundly booed. BILL GATES, WHIPPING BOY c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service Is Bill Gates high-tech Machiavelli, Public Enemy No. 1 threat known universe? All three, judging numerous political cartoons popped newspapers across country last week. From Chattanooga Boston, cartoonists took delight demonizing Gates, facing unexpected public relations challenge Microsoft's antitrust trial unfolds Washington. Other cartoons ran gamut predictable (a worker, pointing aquarium large fish gobbling smaller ones, saying visitors, Welcome Microsoft's research development department) weird (a dweebish man hunched front computer screen staring words: Our beloved leader, Mr. Gates, attack. Leave possessions. Go desert. Await spaceship). And Week One trial. Stay tuned. A federal judge Friday pushed back starting date antitrust trial Microsoft Corp. four days, Oct. 19, also ordering company comply Justice Department's request examine Microsoft's financial records. Microsoft argued allowing army government attorneys come make demands make difficult us remain business. But winning assurances government lawyers would make narrow, targeted searches records, Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson U.S. District Court District Columbia ordered Microsoft open database perusal. Microsoft asked trial delayed several months prepare defense said last minute broadening case Justice Department, added new evidence. Last month, government said process preparing trial discovered Microsoft tried persuade Apple Computer market Quicktime multimedia software Windows customers. On Thursday, Justice Department 20 states added two new people witness list testify Microsoft dealings Apple Sun Microsystems. Avi Tevanian, former Apple executive, added witness list part describe Microsoft's proposal, Microsoft denies ever made. The new witness James Gosling, Sun executive led development Java, Internet programming language Microsoft sees potential threat company's dominance software market. The government charging Microsoft took illegal steps prevent Java gaining wide acceptance. To counter that, Microsoft named two new witnesses Friday, Robert Muglia, senior Microsoft executive worked Sun, Chris Engstrom, executive handled Microsoft's dealings Apple. At time, John Warden, Microsoft's lawyer, argued new allegations place case. The Justice Department, Warden told judge, trying turn something approximating plenary monopoly case like IBM case. It becomes clearer clearer clearer new filing trying turn broader case, said. You can't bait-and-switch file complaint alleging A, B, C, talk whole alphabet three times over. As result, Warden said, Microsoft wanted, minimum, another two-week delay, even though normal schedule would trial start next year. The judge respond. Instead entered order setting Oct. 19 trial date. Late Friday, Microsoft entered formal motion asking another two-week delay. A response expected next week. The case United States vs. Microsoft Corp., government's aggressive move monopolist almost 25 years, playing century antitrust laws broadly worded court rulings ambiguous sides citing rulings support opposing arguments. Whatever outcome trial, scheduled begin Monday U.S. District Court Washington, almost certain appeal leave Supreme Court task bringing legal order 100 years clashing antitrust doctrines. The case focuses Microsoft's Windows, operating system controls 90 percent personal computers sold today. The government says objective curb illegal monopolistic business practices threaten render large parts economy vulnerable vicissitudes single company. Microsoft asserts case intended give government control features added Windows. However grand economic stakes, legal dispute narrow. The government says Microsoft's contracts computer manufacturers companies provide access Internet illegally stifle competition. The contracts prohibit manufacturers substituting Netscape Communications Corp.'s Navigator browser Microsoft's Internet Explorer. They also prohibit removing Windows main screen, desktop, links sites World Wide Web run Microsoft partners. Microsoft's contracts companies connect people Internet businesses sell goods services Web require favored treatment Internet Explorer Navigator exchange links Windows desktop. In wake lawsuit, Microsoft voluntarily dropped requirements, though could reinstate will. Microsoft says contracts legal produce tangible benefits customers, including easier Internet access. The Justice Department says bundling Explorer Windows 95 inclusion browser part Windows 98 amount tying, illegal practice forces customers one product purchase another. The contracts manufacturers Internet services illegal, government says, intended create monopoly browser market protect Microsoft's existing monopoly operating systems. The latter threat key, according Justice Department. Browsers potential, like operating system, act software platform programs run. So contracts intended drive browsers market would also insulate Windows monopoly. Many antitrust experts say problem facing Justice Department courts provided clear definition tying clear guidelines determining contracts illegally exclusionary. Professor Lawrence White New York University, chief economist Justice Department's antitrust division early 1980s, says courts treat tying unusual practice fact ubiquitous. No one, said, would challenge right manufacturers tie erasers tip pencils, tires automobile buttons shirts. His point, shared widely among economists, tying benefits consumers if, example, results products easier use enables company recover development costs. But tying bad locks monopoly power. The courts, White says, offered enough guidance distinguishing good tying bad, nub legal dispute. Microsoft says needs show bundling Windows Explorer passes might called gross consumer benefits test  offers immediate benefit, whether causes long-term damage competition and, therefore, ultimately consumers. The Justice Department says Microsoft's practices must clear higher hurdle: yielding net consumer benefits immediate large enough balance possible long-term harm competition. So test consumer benefits satisfies antitrust laws? The simple answer one knows sure, sides reasonably cite cases without fear embarrassment. Consider 1985 case, Aspen Skiing Co. vs. Aspen Highlands Skiing Corp., 1951 case, Lorain Journal Co. vs. United States. In first, Aspen Skiing, owner three major ski runs Aspen, Colo.  monopolist  years sold ticket cooperation Aspen Highlands, competitor, gave skiers access companies' runs. When Aspen Skiing unilaterally canceled agreement, rival's revenues shriveled rival sued. The Supreme Court ruled Aspen Skiing violated antitrust laws evidence action helped consumers. In Lorain Journal case, local newspaper Lorain, Ohio, refused sell advertising companies advertised new radio station. Here, too, Supreme Court ruled exclusionary practice nothing benefit consumers. Indeed, Aspen Skiing, court even forced monopolist business rival, precedent augurs well Justice Department, seeks force Microsoft install Netscape's browser alongside own. But Charles Rule, legal consultant Microsoft, says cases courts threw exclusionary practices offered consumer benefit. The courts, argues, never pounced practices resulted lower prices better products service. Nor courts either case call balancing immediate benefits hypothetical long-term harm. Rule argues Microsoft's practices produce demonstrable consumer benefits. Besides, says, unlike actions taken The Lorain Journal Aspen Skiing, Microsoft's contracts prevent consumers installing Netscape's browser using Web sites Microsoft's rivals. In truth, though, neither case answered consumer benefit test apply product design. In Jefferson Parish Hospital District No. 2 et al. vs. Hyde, another case cited sides, Supreme Court 1984 recognized surgeons anesthesiologists provide integrated service. Yet, court said, hospital monopoly power would still allowed force surgical patients use panel anesthesiologists consumers wanted purchase two services separately. That principle could undercut Microsoft's defense functional interdependence Windows Explorer requires bundling. But Microsoft point strong concurring opinion called tougher standard government meet alleges tying. Microsoft also draw support several court rulings allowed IBM change design computers ways made hard vendors attach peripheral equipment. But perhaps Microsoft's best argument nowhere government identified single case courts explicitly called throwing tied product basis balancing test. The courts, Microsoft emphasize, steer clear redesigning technically sophisticated products. The Justice Department's rejoinder note sole purpose antitrust law protect consumers, makes sense bless practices provide dollar's worth benefits today but, stamping competition, drive prices $1,000 tomorrow. The Justice Department ask court least insist monopolists use least exclusionary means possible achieve whatever services provide customers. Experts agree courts subject Microsoft's restrictive contracts Internet companies balancing test. But exactly court decide whether consumers helped hurt grabs. A balancing test would courts weigh immediate benefits consumers one-click access Internet sites features bundled Windows-Explorer package versus harm time diminished competition markets browsers operating systems. But test makes good sense theory prove fiendishly difficult use practice. Balancing tests impossibly difficult arbitrary, said Rep. Thomas Campbell, R-Calif., former law professor Stanford University. The practical effect balancing hand defendants like Microsoft almost certain victory. Microsoft argues  many antitrust experts agree  courts fact gravitated away balancing test toward simpler predation test exclusionary contracts. Under standard, contract illegal intended drive competition thus pave way monopolist raise prices later. Microsoft easier time defending charge predation, amounts victimizing customers, would defending charge bundled product consumers slightly harm good. The antitrust record, says William Baxter, headed antitrust division President Reagan, littered contradictory, ambiguous sometimes nonsensical verdicts. He legal experts agree nothing else, record leaves plenty legal leeway Supreme Court, hear Microsoft case, stiffen spine antitrust law. Shortly government filed antitrust suit Microsoft Corp. May, Joel Klein, assistant attorney general charge Justice Department's antitrust division, met Silicon Valley executive. The executive recalls telling Klein unless case went beyond Internet browser market, would little effect Microsoft's power stifle competition across computer industry. Klein replied understood computer executive's concerns. But said time running short strongest evidence hand involved Microsoft's battle Netscape Communications Corp. market so-called browser software used navigating Internet. This Netscape case, executive recalls Klein saying. But five months later, case government bringing trial Monday extends well beyond Netscape browser war embrace described recent court filing broad pattern anti-competitive conduct Microsoft. Netscape, government insists, still prime example pattern  one several examples. The 12-person witness list Justice Department 20 states suing Microsoft reflects new evidence added case since May. James Barksdale, Netscape's president chief executive, appear first, followed executives representing cross section nation's high-technology companies including Intel, IBM, Sun Microsystems, Apple Computer, America Online Intuit. In bringing ambitious, complicated case trial one filed May, government chosen high-risk strategy. The law states new evidence added suit filed, new charges. And so, federal courtroom Washington, U.S.District Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson could decide rule new evidence ranging far afield original suit. But government wins broadened case, court-ordered remedies would doubt far tougher Microsoft. In May, government's suggested steps amounted equal treatment Netscape's browser Microsoft's browser. But government recently asked judge hold separate hearing remedies, wins case. The remedies consideration include basic changes Microsoft's business practices  perhaps even breakup company  intended loosen Microsoft's grip computing. That would precisely kind sweeping reform Microsoft's foes would applaud. The government doubled bet doubled stakes, said David Yoffie, professor Harvard business school co-author book, Competing Internet Time: Lessons From Netscape Its Battle With Microsoft. Meanwhile, Microsoft camp, government's strategy dismissed desperate act  taken court ruling June threatened undermine antitrust suit. That ruling came separate case, involving interpretation consent decree Microsoft signed Justice Department 1995. In June ruling, federal appeals court said Microsoft could bundle browser industry-standard Windows operating system call one product. The appeals-court ruling would seem undercut assertion government's current antitrust case browser operating system two separate products, bundled together given away effort thwart competition browser market. With appeals-court ruling June, government lost heart case, said Charles Rule, former senior official Justice Department, consultant Microsoft. So taken blunderbuss approach scrambling throw everything find  even evidence Justice Department years  gun barrel see hits. The June appellate ruling shake prosecution team. But mostly strengthened hand within Justice Department urging case broadened, according people worked investigation. At time, say, new evidence coming investigation moved ahead prosecutors raced meet accelerated trial schedule approved court. Speed priority outset, say. The Justice Department states filed suit May move Microsoft's new operating system, Windows 98, introduced June. While seeking block release Windows 98, government lawyers wanted get the courtroom early possible PC makers computer users adopt latest version Microsoft's Windows operating system, functions central nervous system 90 percent personal computers sold. The key allegations, government lawyers note, changed since May  namely, Microsoft illegally used market power operating systems defend monopoly position try extend new markets. But thing wrapped bow time May filing browser, said one person worked case. The real game plan always get broader case. What more, one person noted, prosecution team full strength shortly suit filed. David Boies, renowned courtroom litigator former partner Cravath, Swaine &AMP; Moore successfully defended IBM 13-year confrontation government, named special counsel Justice Department last December. But Boies, left Cravath last year, start working full-time Justice Department mid-April, still finishing private cases firm, Boies &AMP; Schiller. The antitrust suit filed May leaned heavily Netscape story, mentioning Microsoft's main rival browser market 130 times complaint supporting memorandum. But also prominently mentioned Microsoft's tactics Sun Microsystems, creator Java, Internet programming language, cited example Microsoft's behavior. It crafted template could added without much stretching, one person involved case said. And so, new evidence piled seemed fit pattern, Klein step step approved widening case, person said. And explains, person continued, evidence hands Justice Department years added case since May; gathering new evidence become apparent older material fit pattern current case. For example, government added contention Microsoft pressured Intel Corp., big microchip maker close partner Microsoft, curb development efforts multimedia Internet software might conflict Microsoft's plans. The government contends arm-twisting occurred meetings two companies three years ago, especially one Aug. 2, 1995, attended Andrew Grove, Intel chairman, Bill Gates, Microsoft chairman. Part government's evidence Intel-Microsoft episode copies handwritten notes taken Steven McGeady, Intel vice president attended meetings, memo written Aug. 28, 1995. The memo, still court seal, said Gates made vague threats livid Intel's investments Internet wanted stopped. A handwritten note, also court seal, quotes Paul Maritz, Microsoft executive, saying Netscape common enemy Intel's role fill stuff around Microsoft's strategy. These documents sent Intel Justice Department's office San Francisco November 1995, response Civil Investigative Demand  civil subpoena  served Intel Nov. 10, 1995. On own, Intel material intriguing, became part antitrust suit evidence surfaced, one person close case said. The government contending Microsoft also tried urge Apple stop selling Quicktime multimedia software Windows market tried convince Real Networks Inc. pull back market so-called streaming software. The government case also broadened, people involved case say, witnesses industry increasingly willing testify. In beginning, people industry believed government would lose Microsoft would retaliate came forward, one person said. But strength case perceived improve, people willing come forward, things snowballed. You get Intel, easier get Apple on. ","Business rivals are seeking to break Microsoft Corp.'s monopoly on computer operating systems.The Government and 20 states have filed an anti-trust suit against Microsoft, invoking the Sherman Anti-trust Act of 1890.The suit began with a Microsoft vs Netscape battle over browser software but now extends far beyond that aiming at Microsoft's overall aggressive anti-competitive conduct.The effort is extensive but inconsistent because of the ambiguity of anti-trust laws, especially the Sherman Act.The Government is examining Microsoft's financial records and painting a dark image of its Chairman Bill Gates.An unpublished book may be crucial to the trial.","In 1998 the Justice Department filed a civil suit against Microsoft to change its 9-year pattern of anti-competitive conduct.Bill Gates appears a schemer ready to crush competitors by any means.He uses Microsoft's clout to squelch internet competition.A 1996 Netscape complaint over browsers was central to the case, which grew to include Intel, IBM, Sun, Apple, AOL, and Intuit.Microsoft was ordered to let Justice examine its records and sought a trial delay.An unpublished book provided evidence.The 1890 Sherman Anti-Trust Act centered on Standard Oil and was intended to protect consumers, but its wording is broad and rulings have been ambiguous.","The Justice Department and 20 states filed a suit against Microsoft for violation of the Sherman Act, charging it illegally tried to use its dominance as the provider of Windows, the industry standard operating system, to stifle competition in other areas.At the heart of the case are Microsoft's contracts with computer manufacturers that prohibit them from substituting Netscape's Navigator browser for Microsoft's Internet Explorer, but Justice also alleges Microsoft exhibited a broad pattern of anti-competitive conduct with numerous other software companies.Microsoft says that Windows and its browser is one tool that offers immediate consumer benefit.","The government suit against Microsoft is the most aggressive antitrust case in a quarter century.The heart of the case is the Internet browser battle between Microsoft and Netscape.Microsoft says that its Internet Explorer is an integral part of its Windows system, the industry dominant operating system.Microsoft, it is argued, has told computer manufacturers that if they want Windows, they must forgo Netscape.The Justice Department and 20 states are joined in the action brought under the Sherman Antitrust Act.Microsoft's chairman, Bill Gates, usually seen as a visionary is portrayed in much darker tones in the trial."

1043,"Lebanon's Parliament Tuesday ratified constitutional amendment clear way election army's commander, Gen. Emile Lahoud, president. Lahoud received backing Syria, main power broker country, making election Lebanon's pro-Syrian Parliament later week formality. A total 113 deputies voted amendment four deputies against, including general's cousin, Nassib Lahoud, presidential aspirant. Eleven deputies absent. Among absent Walid Jumblatt, Cabinet minister said would boycott session protest choice military man even though Lahoud wide public political support. The 128-member legislature expected meet Thursday elect Lahoud outgoing President Elias Hrawi signs constitutional amendment. The amendment Article 49 constitution revokes ban senior civil servants running presidency. The new president sworn Nov. 24, day Hrawi leaves office. Hrawi served nine years, including three-year extension 1995 six-year term. Lahoud, Maronite Catholic, keep alive 55-year-old tradition president Maronite, prime minister Sunni Muslim Parliament speaker Shiite Muslim. Lahoud, appointed army commander 1989 amid rebellion fractured military 1975-90 civil war, credited rebuilding 55,000-strong Lebanese army ending reign militias. Many hope copy success military government, plagued nepotism waste public funds. But fear military dominance public life. Prime Minister Rafik Hariri declined informal invitation Lebanon's new president form next government, sparking political crisis country rebuilds devastating civil war. Sources close prime minister, whose Cabinet care-taker capacity since last Tuesday's swearing Emile Lahoud president, said Hariri turned invitation Lahoud select new Cabinet. There formal announcement Lahoud reappointing Hariri prime minister. Although Hariri's move could bargaining tactic, since remains front-runner premiership, apparent tension two powerful men could affect Lebanon's economic stability recovers 1975-90 civil war. Hariri, 53, architect Lebanon's multibillion dollar postwar reconstruction program, power since 1992. A billionaire businessman made fortune Saudi Arabia, Hariri credited restoring economic confidence stabilizing national currency. Lahoud, 62, commander Lebanon's army propelled power widespread popular backing, pledged tough inauguration speech clean graft-riddled administration. The British-trained general made name rebuilding army disintegrated civil war. Previous disputes among government leaders cost Central Bank hundreds millions dollars efforts stabilize Lebanese pound. Such political disputes Lebanon past solved intervention Syria, main power broker country. Damascus supports Lahoud Hariri. Lahoud expected issue presidential decree last week asking Hariri form next government. The decree issued president polled members 128-seat Parliament choice prime minister. But many legislators, past gave overwhelming support Hariri, name and, instead, left president select prime minister. The two leaders met Friday, presidential decree followed. The sources close Hariri, speaking condition anonymity, said prime minister's decision bow came feel Lahoud following constitutional procedures selecting premier. The Hariri camp argues president poll Parliament members choice prime minister cannot accept mandate name person choice. The dispute, fact, appears opening salvo struggle Lebanon governed Lahoud's six-year term. Toward end former President Elias Hrawi's nine years office, Hariri virtually free hand running country. Parliament Thursday formally elected Gen. Emile Lahoud, popular army commander backing powerful neighbor Syria, Lebanon's next president. All 118 legislators present session cast votes favor. Lahoud sworn six-year term Nov. 24, day President Elias Hrawi leaves office. Prime Minister Rafik Hariri's efforts win fourth term office hit snag failed receive expected speedy appointment new President Emile Lahoud. Hariri still front-runner form next government Saturday's Daily Star newspaper quoted sources saying Hariri outraged 62 128 members Parliament declared support meeting Lahoud Friday. According constitution, president must begin term appointing prime minister Cabinet decree issued consulting Parliament members. A presidential decree expected Friday nothing came meeting Lahoud Hariri. Hariri even scheduled Friday traditional meeting prime minister-designate former prime ministers, canceled. The state-run National News Agency said 62 deputies told Lahoud supported Hariri, rest refused divulge choice left president decide. A TV station owned Hariri said backing least 100 deputies. The delay reflects tug-of-war among power brokers country. Under formula aimed preventing recurrence 1975-90 civil war, power Lebanon shared equally Maronite Christian president, Sunni Muslim prime minister Shiite Parliament speaker. While Christian Lahoud may objection appointing Sunni Hariri, possible Parliament Speaker Nabih Berri's 19 Shiite supporters legislature holding emphasize value. The leading An-Nahar newspapers said delay could last days. But end, Hariri likely renamed strength record office. Hariri, Lebanon's top businessman, almost single-handedly created multibillion dollar program rebuild country destroyed civil war. He also credited stabilizing currency restoring confidence postwar economy. But government former president Elias Hrawi dogged accusations corruption. Hariri, prime minister since 1992, appointed three times extended term former President Elias Hrawi. He remained office caretaker prime minister since Lahoud succeeded Hrawi Tuesday. Lahoud, general army commander rebuilt military 1989 election Parliament October, pledged inauguration speech Tuesday clean corruption-plagued administration. The commander Lebanon's army become country's next president winning crucial backing Syria, powerbroker Lebanon. Congratulations, excellency general, Lebanese Prime Minister Rafik Hariri told army commander Emile Lahoud telephone conversation Monday headlined front-page leftist newspaper As-Safir. Lebanese media said matter settled Monday meeting Damascus outgoing President Elias Hrawi Syrian President Hafez Assad, whose country dominates weaker, smaller neighbor. Agriculture Minister Shawki Fakhoury, Hrawi confidant, said Tuesday Lahoud expected elected 128-member Parliament extraordinary session Oct. 15. The election formality since candidates little chance Syria thrown weight behind Gen. Lahoud. In another formality election, Parliament amend constitution, forbids senior public servants running president. The new president must sworn Nov. 24, day Hrawi leaves office end six-year term. The choice Lahoud, Maronite Catholic, continue 55-year-old tradition president Maronite, prime minister Sunni Muslim Parliament speaker Shiite Muslim. Agreement among three officials essential smooth running government. Since Lahoud good relationship Hariri Speaker Nabih Berri, little change expected government policy. Lahoud's nomination ends weeks suspense identity next head state. Lahoud, 62-year-old naval officer trained Britain United States, enjoys wide public political support home good relations Syria. But choice could sealed final say Assad, keeps 30,000 troops country. His word referred Beirut media password. Lahoud, elevated rear admiral general appointed army commander 1988 amid rebellion fractured military 1975-90 civil war, credited rebuilding 55,000-strong Lebanese army ending reign militias.

Although boycott Jumblatt's Progressive Socialist Party hardly spoil chances Gen. Emile Lahoud, could embolden others express discontent choice process election. Lahoud virtually assured job: prime minister parliament speaker first approved Lahoud, all-important backing Syria, main power broker Lebanon. Historically, approve military man takes control country, Jumblatt told reporters meeting outgoing President Elias Hrawi. Although opposition Syria's hold Lebanon's politics common among anti-Syrian politicians, rare somebody like Jumblatt openly speak decision personally cleared Syrian President Hafez Assad keeps 30,000 troops Lebanon. Like Jumblatt, Lebanon fear military man president could mean intelligence agents track civilian life 1958 1964 presidency Fouad Chehab, army commander become head state. In nominating Lahoud, rules respected, Jumblatt said. Things supposed run democratic way, said Jumblatt, whose Druse militia fought Christian forces 1975-90 civil war. The new president must sworn Nov. 24, day Hrawi leaves office six-year term. Jumblatt said adequate political diversity competition country, implying choosing military man president unnecessary.

Lahoud, 62-year-old naval officer, enjoys wide public political support home good relations Syria. He gained public admiration reuniting army fractured civil war ending reign militias. Many hope cleanse government nepotism wastage public funds. Lahoud's nomination complies tradition president Maronite Christian, prime minister Sunni Muslim Parliament speaker Shiite Muslim.

Hariri, 53, architect Lebanon's multibillion dollar postwar reconstruction program, power since 1992. A billionaire businessman made fortune Saudi Arabia, Hariri credited restoring economic confidence stabilizing national currency. The dispute appears opening salvo struggle Lebanon governed Lahoud's six-year term. Toward end former President Elias Hrawi's nine years office, Hariri virtually free hand running country. Lahoud, 62, former commander Lebanon's army, propelled power widespread popular backing. He pledged tough inauguration speech clean graft-riddled administration. The British-trained general made name rebuilding army disintegrated civil war. Similar political disputes Lebanon past solved intervention Syria, main power broker country. Damascus supports Lahoud Hariri. Lahoud expected issue presidential decree last week asking Hariri form next government president polled members 128-seat Parliament choice prime minister. But many legislators, past gave overwhelming support Hariri, name and, instead, left president select prime minister. The two leaders met Friday, presidential decree followed. The sources close Hariri, speaking condition anonymity, said prime minister's decision bow came feel Lahoud following constitutional procedures selecting premier. ","Lebanon's leadership changed in Nov 1998.Army commander Emile Lahoud was elected to a 6-year term as President by the Parliament and took office on Nov 24.He had the backing of Syrian President Assad, the powerbroker in Lebanon, and a special constitutional amendment in Oct cleared his way.He did not immediately ask Prime Minister Rafik Hariri to form a new government.Hariri, the nation's top businessman, had served three terms and rebuilt the nation, but some accused him of corruption.His support in the Parliament had also slipped, but many believed Lahoud was trying to assert his authority.When finally asked to form a government, Hariri refused.","Power in Lebanon is shared equally by a Maronite Christian president, a Sunni Muslim prime minister, and a Shiite Parliament speaker, an arrangement made to prevent a recurrence of the 1975-90 civil war.Syria, with 30,000 troops in Lebanon is the main power broker there.The Lebanese parliament amended the constitution to permit popular army general Emile Lahoud to become president.Prime minister Rafik Hariri, the architect of Lebanon's postwar reconstruction, expected to get a fourth term but a conflict with the new president led him to bow out as premier.Lebanon's economic stability has been threatened by the conflict.","Lebanon's Parliament voted the country's top military man, Gen. Emile Lahoud, president.Lahoud, who promises to clean up a graft-riddled government, is popular and is backed by powerful Syria.It is unclear, though, whether Prime Minister Hariri, in office since 1992 and credited with the country's economic recovery, will continue to head the cabinet.31 of 128 legislators chose not to support him, leaving it to the president to name the next prime minister.Consequently, Hariri withdrew his candidacy, claiming the president acted unconstitutionally when he accepted the mandate to name a prime minister.Hariri's administration was plagued by nepotism.","Army Commander and Maronite Catholic Emile Lahoud was named Lebanon's president for the next 6 years, chosen by outgoing President Hrawi and Syria's Hafez Assad.Traditionally the president is a Maronite, the PM a Sunni, and Speaker of Parliament a Shiite.Election by Parliament is a formality.The constitution was amended to permit senior public servants to be president.Lahoud rebuilt the army and ended militia reign.Walid Jumblatt opposed a military president, fearing a return of surveillance on civilians.PM Rafik Hariri, a businessman who rebuilt the country and economy, refused his delayed re-appointment by Lahoud, who vowed to fight corruption."

But last month authorities grant comprehensive exam. Doctors found tumors, perhaps cancerous, 50-year-old's mouth, stomach bowels, Liu Qing said. The timing Liu's exile Xu's trial brazen string high-profile dissident releases calculated influence Western governments. Human rights groups immediately denounced Liu's release cynical manipulative. The Chinese government continues play hostage politics true commitment international human rights standards, said Xiao Qiang Human Rights China, New York-based lobbying group Liu Qing heads. Over past two years, China tried woo West, Beijing signed two key U.N. rights treaties praise bringing spotty legal system closer international standards. The ruling Communist Party relaxed controls dissenting views among academics. Xu Wenli dissidents saw opportunity open atmosphere. Over past six months, dissidents 14 provinces cities tried use Chinese laws set register China Democracy Party. In sign opposition party's appeal, 205 dissidents across China issued petition Sunday calling immediate release Xu two leaders, Hong Kong-based Information Center Human Rights Democratic Movement China reported. To wipe opposition movement, authorities violated recently revised laws supposed protect rights criminal suspects. They rushed Xu fellow leader Qin Yongmin trial less four days notice given families, instead 10 required law. Qin third principal organizer, Wang Youcai, also denied legal counsel. Police detained scared prospective lawyers, forcing two argue defenses separate trials Thursday. No verdicts announced.

The trials three outspoken dissidents over, Communist Party leader Jiang Zemin signaled Wednesday China sustain crackdown dissent throughout next year. In second hard-line speech six days, Jiang vowed crush challenges Communist Party rule preserve social stability. He demanded officials talk politics  euphemism following party orders. The speech, senior law enforcement officials, used uncompromising language heard less frequently past 18 months Chinese leaders sought improve relations abroad. Jiang's harsh tone punctuated summary trials convictions subversion week three political critics tried form opposition party. To underscore party's intolerant mood, national newspapers ran brief accounts Tuesday Wednesday 13-, 12- 11-year prison terms given Xu Wenli, Qin Yongmin Wang Youcai. Dissidents rarely mentioned official media, reports served warning China's 1.2 billion people. In speech, reported state television, Jiang said stability crucial next year. He noted two key events political calendar: 50th anniversary Communist Party rule Oct. 1 China's recovery Portuguese colony Macau Dec. 20. We must strengthen ideological political education officials raise awareness resistance sabotaging acts hostile domestic foreign forces, China Central Television quoted Jiang saying. Whenever element undermines stability raises head, must resolutely nipped bud. Jiang exclusively target political enemies. He likened threat white-collar ordinary criminals ticked list potentially volatile problems  inefficient state industries, legions laid-off workers, stagnating farmers' incomes corrupt officials. The emphasis stability warnings would disrupt reminiscent party pronouncements waning years Jiang's mentor, Deng Xiaoping. After Deng died 1997 Jiang emerged victorious major party conclave, projected confident image. Reform, stability, bywords past year. Academic debates past year boldest 10 years China's relatively controlled standards. Party leaders touted efforts build comprehensive, predictable legal system praise Western governments signing U.N. rights treaties. Our active developments foreign affairs reached new achievements, Jiang said. Our country's stature risen step higher. By arresting convicting Xu, Qin Wang less three weeks, China trampled legal safeguards criminal suspects raised questions commitments U.N. rights treaties signed past 15 months. Despite swift punishments given three, dissidents continued campaign justice. Four elder members dissident community sent letter U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan U.N. human rights commissioner Mary Robinson calling China stop persecuting political critics release political prisoners. We experienced extreme disappointment, worry shock long sentences given Xu, Qin Wang recent detentions several Chinese, four wrote letter dated Tuesday released New York-based Human Rights China Wednesday.

German Foreign Minister Joschka Fischer, drew China's anger recently meeting exiled dissident Wei Jingsheng, said China's sentencing two dissidents Monday unacceptable flouted international treaty country recently signed.

Chinese courts sentenced dissidents Xu Wenli Wang Youcai 13 11 years trying organize opposition political party. Hours China expected sign key U.N. human rights treaty host British Prime Minister Tony Blair, police hauled prominent human rights campaigner questioning Monday. Qin Yongmin's latest run-in authorities came tried second time week legally register human rights monitoring group. Qin said civil affairs official Hubei provincial capital Wuhan accused engaging illegal activities. The police came soon returned home.

By sentencing two country's prominent democracy campaigners long prison terms, China Monday took harshest steps yet current crackdown organized political opposition. After trial lasted three half hours, Xu Wenli  55 dean dissident movement, man already spent 12 years prison advocating democracy  sentenced 13 years subversion state power. Xu's alleged crimes included helping organize new political party, calling end Communist rule interviews foreign journalists, calling independent labor unions and, prosecutors said, accepting $500 dissident abroad.

Wang tried subversion charges Thursday brief court session, defense lawyer, eastern city Hangzhou. The punishment third veteran democracy campaigner, Qin Yongmin, 44, announced. His trial began central city Wuhan Thursday may reconvene Tuesday, relatives said. A similarly long sentence expected. Monday's sentences, came six months President Clinton's visit Beijing, publicly challenged China's leaders move quickly toward political reform, harshly criticized State Department. They also appeared spell effective end China Democracy Party, three men, along hundreds lesser-known individuals, tried organize recent months. The long sentences also crushed hopes many liberal intellectuals China's warming relations United States recent years signing global treaties human rights might bring significant easing political controls. Xu tried Monday morning Beijing Intermediate Court. When brief recess three-judge panel announced 13-year sentence, Xu stood shouted, I protest! said wife 28 years, He Xintong. Then, said Ms. He lawyers present, shouted judges unfair would appeal case proceedings illegitimate. With sentencing Xu, China's Communist government silenced one energetic persistent critics, one given adult life cause democracy. Xu first came prominence Democracy Wall movement late 1970s, served 12 years prison, much solitary confinement. In last several months, sensing new opportunity speak making constant use fax machines e-mail, Qin tried draw attention China's obligations two international covenants signed  one economic cultural rights, one civil political rights. In face several temporary detentions stiff warnings, continued activities. Wang, contrast, first became involved dissident activities 1989, graduate student physics Beijing, became leader Tiananmen Square demonstrations.

After learning Monday's sentences, American Embassy here, spent last two years building improved relations China United States, issued strong condemnation termed deplorable decisions. We deeply disappointed guilty verdicts extremely harsh sentences, statement said. No individual arrested, tried sentenced exercising internationally recognized freedoms, including guaranteed International Covenant Civil Political Rights, China committed itself. Like Thursday's trials, proceeded defense attorneys prospective lawyers warned police detained, Monday's proceeding showed cases involving security issues, police courts could write rules. According criminal procedure law, defendants notified least 10 days trial, Xu told four days ago trial would Monday. His wife, Monday allowed contact since arrest Nov. 30, told three days ago. Under law, defendants also right lawyer choice, Xu assigned lawyer court late last week. Before Monday morning's trial, lawyer, Mo Shaoping, saw client one brief meeting, associate Mo's said.

Given Clinton's effusive praise China's senior leaders trip Beijing last summer, administration found defensive Monday harshly criticized prison sentences, even continued insist administration's policy engagement helping push Beijing toward democracy. James Foley, State Department spokesman, said United States deeply deplores jail terms called immediate release dissidents. These three men appear involved nothing efforts form new political party, said. While condemning prison sentences, Foley American officials careful note administration's assessment progress human rights China, linked Clinton's meeting Beijing Chinese President Jiang Zemin. There improvements human rights situation China, modest improvements, Foley said. The severe prison terms  recent instances harassment democracy campaigners China  steps backward relationship improved human rights performance, said. Critics administration's China policy noted long prison sentences handed less week Jiang delivered pointed speech Beijing made clear China's economic reforms prelude Western-style democracy. The Western mode political systems must never copied, said, adding challenged Communist Party's supremacy would crushed. Rep. Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., long among China's harshest critics Congress, said prison sentences handed Xu Wang clearest demonstration since president's visit China last summer Beijing's true intentions regarding human rights. They pathetic, really pathetic, said administration. The administration say wants, must know Monday policy China embarrassment. What Chinese learned latitude world. Mike Jendrzejczyk, Washington director Human Rights Group, said jail terms proof need administration revise China policy, described almost entirely driven administration's desire encourage trade. He said signs progress human rights situation China last year  notably, China's agreement sign international treaties civil economic rights  overall picture bleak. On balance, said, progress China made allowing greater openness may canceled repressive attitude. Human Rights Watch, largest American-based human rights group, called administration consider postponing canceling planned visit China early next year Commerce Secretary William Daley high-level trade delegation protest prison sentences. That would get Beijing's attention, Jendrzejczck said. Other China experts scholars insisted administration right continue policy engagement China, reason believe political reform would follow economic reform, Clinton argued. Peter Rodman, former Nixon Reagan administration official Nixon Center Washington, said United States cannot control evolution society complex China's. He said harsh prison sentences given Monday dissidents expected, especially since Xu Wang involved trying set political party challenge Communists. The pattern regime every while, ease bit somebody goes far there's crisis, said. I think blame United States crackdown, give us credit political reforms. On human rights, I think there's much do.

Beijing police Sunday detained one Xu's China Democracy Party colleagues, Zha Jianguo, prevent attending trial, Xu's wife said. Although pleased Liu Nianchun free, human rights groups decried Chinese government's timing manipulative. We want give credit Chinese government cynical game playing, said Xiao Qiang, director New York-based Human Rights China. After 3 1/2 years prison, Liu taken Tuanhe labor camp outskirts Beijing, driven capital's airport put Canadian Air flight, ultimately bound New York, mother brother said. Accompanying Liu exile wife, Chu Hailan, 11-year-old daughter, family said. Liu Nianchun's release follows pattern China used freeing two famous dissidents, Wei Jingsheng Nov. 1997 Wang Dan April. Authorities released Liu medical parole, exactly five months end prison term, provided go exile, said brother exiled democracy campaigner, Liu Qing. Liu Nianchun, 50, ill-health least two years. In exam authorities finally agreed provide last month, doctors discovered Liu tumors mouth, stomach bowels, Liu Qing said. Like Wang Wei, United States Western governments lobbied China release Liu. Chinese leaders forcing well-known dissidents exile throughout 1990s, finding abroad lose influence among dissidents home. In official comment release, Xinhua News Agency reported judicial departments took account Liu's health behavior labor camp approving parole medical treatment. I happy Liu Nianchun, time sending people directly prison exile type human rights violation persecution, Liu Qing said telephone interview home New York's Brooklyn borough. Liu Nianchun one respected figures fractured, persecuted dissident community. His 3 1/2 years prisons labor camps sad illustration way China's Communist Party rulers punish people deem threat. Liu imprisoned three times past 17 years. His last arrest came signed petition calling labor rights May 1995. Liu never put trial. Fourteen months passed wife, Chu Hailan, first learned fate whereabouts: three-year spell labor camp frigid, remote northeast. His term maximum police may impose criminal suspects without trial. Labor camp officials later extended Liu's sentence year trying escape, charge Chu claimed fabricated. Inside labor camp, Liu started hunger strike protest treatment. He beaten cattle prods confined room 2 square meters (2 square yards) could sit stand. His wife endured police harassment, beatings detentions campaigning release. Chu dragged away hit security forces tried hand letter U.N. human rights chief Mary Robinson outside Beijing hotel September. German Foreign Minister Joschka Fischer, drew China's anger recently meeting exiled dissident Wei Jingsheng, said China's sentencing two dissidents Monday unacceptable flouted international treaty country recently signed.

Chinese courts sentenced dissidents Xu Wenli Wang Youcai 13 11 years trying organize opposition political party. His friend political mentor jailed, robbing budding opposition political party potent organizer, Zha Jianguo afraid. A bag packed toothbrush, toothpaste medicine lies ready Beijing home day Chinese police take away. He told police interrogators expects jailed, likely years less 13 given China Democracy Party leader Xu Wenli Monday. Democracy process, process small number people sacrificed, Zha, 47-year-old former manager computer design company vice chairman party's Beijing branch, told The Associated Press interview Thursday.

His tenacity holds despite summary trials harsh punishments Xu, Wang Youcai Qin Yongmin  prominent party principals provinces sentenced 11 12 years  despite threatening signs ruling Communist Party. Chinese President Jiang Zemin warned speech published Wednesday political subversives threatened called China's fragile social order. Whenever element undermines stability raises head, must resolutely nipped bud, Jiang said. Zha maintains tactics unnecessary. In manifestoes, Democracy Party espoused peaceful means target undemocratic system, political power Communist Party. We believe elections held establishment democratic system decide power, said Zha. What many world consider democracy legally subversive China threatening Communist Party-led system. In past month, authorities arrested convicted Xu, Qin Wang detained interrogated least 29 party members. Police took Zha home Sunday afternoon held nearly 24 hours keep Xu's trial. Until crackdown, China Democracy Party distinguished past attempts opposition openness. Organizers publicly announced intention set party. They tried register authorities. Statements faxed foreign media human rights groups circumvent China's state-controlled media. Now, party's members  500 Zha's count  driven underground. Party members concentrate increasing ranks guarded use telephones faxes occasional meetings, Zha said. If Xu two first round, second round likely bigger, Zha said. In unbalanced contest, forced use secretive means. The arrests Xu, Wang Qin deprive party influential members, Zha said.
