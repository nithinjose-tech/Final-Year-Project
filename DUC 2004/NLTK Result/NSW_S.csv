","After the bombing of U.S. embassies in East Africa the U.S. on Aug. 20, 1998 made missile attacks on an Al-Qaeda training camp in Afghanistan and on a pharmaceutical plant in Sudan tenuously linked to Osama bin Laden.In September the U.S. initiated legal action against a Sudanese arrested in Germany and in November charges were prepared against six men including bin Laden.The U.S. had, in support of its case, documentary evidence and a cooperative former senior aide of bin Laden.Meanwhile, authorities reported bin Laden agents active in Bangladesh and the Balkans and the Taliban government of Afghanistan proclaimed bin Laden ""a man without sin.","In the aftermath of the almost simultaneous bombings of U.S. embassies in East Africa, much has been learned of the terrorist network put together and financed by Saudi billionaire Osama bin Laden.Osama bin Laden, the mastermind of the bombings and U.S. cruise missile attack against a supposed terrorist camp in Afghanistan shortly after the bombings was an attempt not only to disrupt the terrorist network but to get bin Laden himself.As the investigation into the bombings continues, more is being learned from seized computers and top aides turned informants.Bin Laden remains in Afghanistan by permission of the Taliban.","Evidence shows Sudanese factory bombed by US is linked to bin Laden.US prosecutors ask for an extension to extradite a bin Laden lieutenant.FBI questions witnesses of Nairobi embassy blast, preparing for trial of 6 suspects.The Taliban says the US is using bin Laden as an excuse to attack Afghanistan.Goal of US August raid there was to kill bin Laden and his aides.The Taliban declares bin Laden a free man, with no proof of anti-US terror.2 arrested for articles inciting Taliban-style revolt in Bangladesh.Bin Laden cell is in Albania and elsewhere in Europe.Bin Laden aide informs for the US.East African bin Laden cell has security woes in '97.","Following the bombings of the embassies in Africa, the US began a full-scale assault on Osama bin Laden.Attacked were a chemical plant in the Sudan and a camp in Afghanistan where he was believed to be, creating an assassination opportunity.Evidence was gathered from a captured computer and an in-law who defected.Suspects were identified and the FBI began to build a case in New York.Extradition of a suspect from Germany was sought.Reactions from Islamic nations varied: Afghanistan promised him safe haven; more liberal Bandladesh arrested pro-Taliban reporters; Albania feared it was an infiltration center for the rest of Europe, including Kosovo."

","Yugoslavia failed to comply with a U.N. resolution demanding that the forces sent to Kosovo to suppress the ethnic Albanian separatist uprising be withdrawn and is now threatened with NATO airstrikes.Though Milosevic moved some units from the Serbian province, U.S. special envoy Holbrooke called the situation serious.Russia, previously against a NATO attack, said the strikes could occur if steps aren't taken to end the crisis.Hundreds, mostly Albanian civilians, have been killed and thousands are refugees.While the U.S. and other nations want peace, they oppose Kosovo independence, fearing it could destabilize other Albanian-populated Balkan states.","Under threat of NATO attack, Milosevic orders back most army units.US envoy says situation is as grave as it was 2 weeks ago, despite temporary abatement of fighting.US and Russia increase pressure on Milosevic to end the humanitarian crisis in Kosovo or face NATO airstrikes.US envoy tells Milosevic to pull back his military and let Albanian refugees return home.Yugoslavia claims it is taking steps to comply with peace demands.However, NATO says that UN Security Council conditions have not yet been met.US envoy gives Milosevic last minute warning to halt ethnic crackdown in Kosovo.Milosevic calls NATO threat criminal act favoring guerrillas.","Yugoslav President Slbodan Milosevic does not appear to be complying completely with UN demands to withdraw his troops and stop anti-Albanian activity in Kosovo.U.S. special envoy Richard Holbrooke said the level of fighting may have abated but the situation is such that it could resume.The U.S. and Russia have ratcheted up pressure on Milosevic warning him of inevitable NATO air strikes.Yugoslavia claimed it ""is faced with the imminent danger of war"", will defend itself if attacked and called NATO's threats a ""criminal act"".Yugoslav generals put the nation's air defense on high alert then pulled some armored equipment out of Kosovo as a compromise.","On Oct. 4, 1998 Yugoslav President Milosevic ordered his forces in Kosovo back to their barracks.While supressing the Albanian independence movement they had massacred hundreds of civilians and left 275,000+ refugees.NATO threatened airstrikes unless hostilities ceased and peace talks began.U.S. envoy Holbrooke insisted that Milosevic pull all forces out of Kosovo.Milosevic called the NATO threat ""a criminal act"" and said Holbrooke aided Albanian terrorists.Russia also urged an end to hostilities, but the Yugoslavs denied any fighting and vowed to defend their country if attacked.Neither side budged as NATO seemed to wait for a U.N. decision."

","Despite economic problems and threats from the Asian Olympic Committee that it would move the games, Thailand was able to meet construction deadlines and open the 13th annual Asian Games to participants from 43 countries.The games have not been without controversy.In a surprise move, Saudi Arabia pulled its athletes from the games, probably in reprisal for a jewel theft and the murder of three of its diplomats.There was speculation that the Saudis would send a ceremonial delegation.National rivalries also were Apparent in a snooker game between India and Pakistan when an argument Arose following a disputed call.","Bangkok prepared for the 6000 athletes from 41 nations to compete in the Asian Games.Thai police detained more than 300 beggars to make the city's streets safer, but its notorious night life concerned some team managers.China considered recalling overseas soccer players to bolster chances at the Games.Saudi Arabia abruptly withdrew its 105-man team citing the approach of Ramadan but more likely for past grievances with the Thais.Later, they considered sending a ""small team"".The Iranian equestrian team's horses failed the vet's exam.The Thai King opened the Games with an elaborate ceremony.Rivals India and Pakistan argued during a snooker match.","Despite concern that corruption, incompetence and financial failure would delay or prevent Thailand's ability to host the Asian Games, Bangkok was ready for the December 6 deadline.After an extravagant opening ceremony, the games went well despite a brief soccer brawl, a snooker game incident, the banning of Iran's equestrian team horses for not being disease free, and the withdrawal of Saudi Arabia over strained relations with Thailand.Thai police cleared the streets of beggars and criminals, and athletes were disciplined to avoid Bangkok's night life.China's recall of four soccer players from Europe is testimony of the importance of the games.","The Asian Games scheduled for Bangkok Dec. 6-20, 1998 were never a sure thing.Thailand was in economic doldrums and there was question whether the sports complex for the games would be completed in time.By late October, however, it was clear the games could take place.Thai police rounded up beggars who might intimidate spectators, but then in late November Saudi Arabia withdrew its teams and there was concern that athletes might be tempted by Bangkok's nightlife and the availability of Viagra.But on Dec. 6 the games opened as scheduled as 6,000 athletes from 41 nations competed, including a heated snooker match between India and Pakistan."

","China arrested an activist on the eve of signing an international human rights agreement.It arrested an activist against official corruption and refused a monitoring group permission to operate.The China Democracy Party was founded during Clinton's visit to China.Founders were arrested for harming national security, sparking protests.One activist fled to NY.The arrests and speedy trials showed China's resolve to prevent opposition to the Communist Party.Defendents were prevented from getting lawyers so defended themselves.Their trials lasted only two hours each.The judge cut off one defendent's arguments and a US official was barred from a trial.","Although China was expected to sign a key U.N. human rights treaty, it continues to question and arrest political dissidents.Qin Yongmin was arrested following his attempt to form a human rights monitoring group.Fellow dissident Xu Wenli was arrested for trying to form an opposition party.Another dissident flew China for the U.S. to avoid arrest.In making the arrests, China has charged that the dissidents have threatened national security.Facing trial, Xu Wenli and Qin Yongmin were unable to obtain legal counsel.Qin Youngmin, attempting to defend himself, was cut off several times by the judge in a trial lasting just over two hours.","China continues to arrest dissidents even as it prepares to sign a UN human rights treaty and to host the first visit by a British PM in seven years.The dissident China Democracy Party believes it is legal to challenge the communists' power monopoly, but the PRC cites a ""grab-bag"" section of the criminal code making almost any political activity illegal.The US has protested the arrests.Two dissidents, Qin Yongmin and Wang Youcai must defend themselves at trail since lawyers have been dissuaded from assisting them.Other dissidents continue to be harassed and arrested.One dissident, Yao Zhenxian, was released from a labor camp and fled to New York.","On the eve of China's signing the International Covenant of Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR) in October 1998, police detained Chinese human rights advocate Qin Yongmin for questioning.Eight weeks after signing the ICCPR, Chinese police arrested Qin and an associate in the China Democracy Party (CDP), Xu Wenli, without stating charges.Another CDP leader already in custody, Wang Youcai, was accused of ""inciting the overthrow of the government"".Qin and Wang went to trial in December for inciting subversion.Police pressure on potential defense attorneys forced the accused to mount their own defenses.Xu Wenli had not yet been charged."

","Speaker of the House Newt Gingrich has announced that he will not seek re-election to the post when the vote comes up on November 18th.He also announced that he would be leaving the House when his current term as Speaker expires in January.This announcement comes on the heels of a poor Republican showing in the mid-term elections.Although the Republicans retained a majority in the House, the Margin of Republican control shrank in the face of Democratic gains.Gingrich had been seen as the man who led the Republicans our of the doldrums into control of the House and the Senate.","Most Democrats, except for former Clinton strategist James Carville, were hesitant to attack Speaker Newt Gingrich as the 1998 elections approached.Republicans were expected to add to their majority in Congress.However, Republicans lost seats in both the House and Senate.Republicans became disenchanted with the Gingrich ""vision"" and blamed him for the losses.An active campaign began to replace Gingrich as Speaker with Louisiana Congressman Robert Livingston as the main actor.After a losing struggle to maintain his position, Gingrich resigned as Speaker.House Republicans then turned their attention to impeachment proceedings of President Clinton.","The 1998 election ended the political career of Newt Gingrich, who had become Speaker in 1994, leading a conservative, issue-driven, GOP majority.In Oct Democrats were urged to go after him.Although both houses retained a narrowed GOP majority, Newt, with his combativeness and Impeachment-fixation, was blamed for the failures by both wings of his party.The 1998 winners were Gore, Clinton, and moderates.Newt's issues seemed dead in the booming economy and old Democratic loyalists ignored Clinton's morals and returned to the fold.As fellow Republicans jockeyed for his positions, Newt resigned as Speaker on Nov 6 and also decided to leave his House seat.","James Carville complained that fellow Democrats didn't join his war against Speaker Newt Gingrich leading up to the congressional elections of 1998.Gingrich had led the impeachment inquiry against President Clinton in the House.When, contrary to all predictions, the Democrats gained five seats in the House and held their own in the Senate, Republicans enlisted in Carville's cause, blaming Gingrich for the election results.Gingrich battled fiercely as Rep. Livingston rallied forces against him, but ultimately Gingrich accepted defeat agreeing to cede the speakership and his seat in the House.He blamed his defeat on blackmail by Republican cannibals."

","As the government continued to press its anti-trust suit against Microsoft, AOL has begun negotiations to purchase Netscape.Netscape is at the heart of the antitrust suit.Netscape alleges that Microsoft marketing practices, packaging its Internet Explorer in its operating system denied market opportunities to Netscape.The AOL deal, a three-way negotiation between AOL, Sun Microsystems and Netscape, would combined three Microsoft rivals.AOL is counting on the Netscape purchase to allow it to expand its internet Market by helping business operate on the internet in an effort to join Media and technology.","In a bid to become a leader in the lucrative cyberspace economy, AOL will buy Netscape and set up a partnership with Sun.The venture will let AOL offer corporations end-to-end services, including servers, software, and accessibility to consumers.Eventually, AOL hopes to capitalize on the production of cheap devices offering Internet access to more homes.News of the deal helped push the Dow Jones to a new high.Meanwhile, Microsoft, accused by the Justice Department of using its operating system dominance to squelch competition in the browser market, claims the deal shows the software industry is healthy and that Netscape needs no government protection.","As the U.S. government pressed its antitrust case against Microsoft Corp. in November 1998, America Online (AOL) proposed an alliance with Netscape Communications and Sun Microsystems.The three-pronged deal promised to provide on-line services, Internet software and electronic commerce.AOL was to buy Netscape and forge a partnership with Sun, benefiting all three and giving technological independence from Microsoft.Microsoft lawyers argued unconvincingly that AOL's purchase of Netscape would undermine the government's antitrust case, based in large part on Netscape's complaint.It remained to be seen whether AOL could achieve a vast virtual mall.","America Online became the leading force in cyberspace for individuals to exchange e-mail and check the latest news.AOL saw a bright day ahead as a company that could provide online services, Internet software, and electronic commerce.To position itself better in this growing market, AOL sought to buy Netscape and work an alliance with Sun Microsystems.Netscape has faltered because of the ubiquity of the Microsoft Windows operating system requiring its browser.Microsoft argued that a vibrant technology market and rising stock prices undercut antitrust charges against it.At the trial the government presented thousands of e-mails supporting its case."

","In October 1998 amid worldwide financial crises, particular concern focused on Russia where economic meltdown was exacerbated by conflicted politics.President Yeltsin's latest Prime Minister, Primakov, was supported by Communists and when word leaked out that a Communist economic program was under consideration, Yeltsin denounced it.Primakov then assured the public that ""there is no program,"" suggesting that there would not be until the International Monetary Fund (IMF) came forth with a massive loan.IMF demanded a sound economic program before approving loan payment.Meanwhile neighboring Ukraine felt economic effects of the IMF-Primakov standoff.","Early October was fraught with economic woes as the International Monetary Fund prepared for its annual meeting.The IMF faces criticism for ignoring the social costs of its actions and being a pawn to Western demands.A small cut in US interest rates lowered markets worldwide.Russia, whose economy collapsed in August, was looking for a cure--possibly instituting Soviet-style measures.Key issues were stopping dollars from leaving the country and getting foreign investment end IMF loans.The postal service was in chaos, owing everyone.Demonstrations were expected.The Ukraine also struggled, especially to keep banks working.An IMF loan was on the way.","As world finance an banking representatives met in Washington, the economic news continued to be bleak.IMF officials had predicted had predicted a banner year, but stocks continued to slide worldwide and the DOW probably would record its worst third quarter loss in eight years.Russia and Ukraine have been especially hard hit by the crisis.In Russia, Prime Minister Primakov had no plan to solve the problem as the economy continued to Suffer.Postal service was threatened as the Post Office could not pay its bills.President Kuchma of Ukraine called for changes in market reform even as the Parliament turned down a bill to restore lost savings.","Fifteen months of world economic turmoil are threatening political stability.Lowering Federal Reserve interest rates is not countering the crisis.IMF is worried about the turndown in Japan, economic meltdown in Russia, depression in Indonesia, and anxiety about Latin America where investors are pulling out.IMF critics say it needs to understand national politics better and focus on social issues.Russia's economic confusion is upsetting the US.Russia is considering hard currency controls, demanding IMF loans and will not end government privatization.Ukraine, affected by Russia, is trying to save its fast-developing money system and keep investors."

","In early October 1998 Turkey moved 10,000 troops to the Syrian border accusing its neighbor of harboring Kurdish rebels and their leader Abdullah Ocalan.Syria denied the charges and blamed Turkey's belligerence on its military alliance with Israel.As the dispute threatened to ignite the whole volatile region, Egypt's President Mubarak launched a mediation effort soon joined by Iran and Jordan.Saudi Arabia, Yemen, Sudan, Lebanon and Greece voiced support for Syria, but all called for a diplomatic solution.Israel did not take sides urging diplomatic talks and insisting that Israeli-Turkish military cooperation played no role in the crisis.","Tensions rose between Syria and Turkey over claims that Syria harbored Kurdish rebels, Turkey's growing ties with Israel, and Turkish dams on the Euphrates.Turkey sent 10,000 troops to the Syrian border.Israel declared non-involvement and limited border exercises.Egypt's President traveled to Syria and Turkey to mediate.Jordan urged the interests of the region and offered to mediate, as did Iran.Lebanon denied harboring Kurds, sided with Syria and blamed Israel for tensions, but urged peace.Greece said Turkey undermined stability but urged neighbors to get along.The Saudis, Yemen and Sudan supported Syria but urged peace.Assad was to visit Turkey.","Tensions between Syria and Turkey increased as Turkey sent 10,000 troops to its border with Syria.The dispute comes amid accusations by Turkey that Syria helping Kurdish rebels based in Syria.Kurdish rebels have been conducting cross border raids into Turkey in an effort to gain Kurdish autonomy in the region.Egyptian President Mubarek has been involved in shuttle diplomacy to the two states in an effort to defuse the situation and Iraq also has offered to mediate the dispute between the two countries.Although Israel has tried to demonstrate its neutrality, Lebanon has charged That Israel is the cause of the tensions between Syria and Turkey.","On October 1, Turkey moved 10,000 troops toward the Syrian border, and later sent jets along--possibly across--the border.Turkey warned Syria it could no longer tolerate Syria's sheltering Kurdish rebels in Syria and Lebanon's Bekaa Valley.Fighting with Kurdish rebels began in 1984.The Syrian denial included claims that Turkey was taking water and had a strategic alliance with Israel.Egypt, then Iran and Jordan, sought to defuse the situation and find a diplomatic solution for the two Muslim nations.Greece, predictably, chided Turkey, while Israel denied involvement and limited its military activities along the Syrian border."

","On Friday the shuttle Endeavor carried six astronauts into orbit to start building an international space station.The launch occurred after Russia and U.S. officials agreed not to delay the flight in order to orbit closer to MIR, and after a last-minute alarm forced a postponement.On Sunday astronauts joining the Russian-made Zarya control module cylinder with the American-made module to form a 70,000 pounds mass 77 feet long.NASA estimates 43 more launches and 159 more space walks are needed to assemble the complex.When completed the 16-nation space station will be longer than a football field.It will be used to study adaptation to space flight.","Russia and NASA jointly decided against a Russian cost-cutting proposal to orbit the 2nd space station, a 16-country cooperative project, closer to Mir, citing complexity, risk, and bad sun angles.After 5 years of assembly, the research station will house 7 people.A 12-day shuttle mission will attach the US Unity module to the Russian Zarya, already in orbit.Thursday's launch was delayed by a pressure drop.A 2nd attempt Friday was perfect.Unity was attached to Zarya in a blind docking using cameras and computer images.Electrical and cable connections come next.Unity will serve as a passageway for future modules.Two Zarya antennas failed to deploy.","After discarding a suggested change of orbit, the Russian Space Agency went ahead with plans to launch its Zarya module of the international space station on Nov. 20, 1998.Although delayed for a day, U.S. plans to launch the space shuttle Endeavour carrying the U.S. module Unity and six astronauts were carried out on Dec. 4.The astronauts' job was to connect Unity with the already-orbiting Zarya as the first step in assembling 100 major components of the planned space station.Using the shuttle's 50-foot robot arm, the two modules were joined setting the stage for a spacewalk by two astronauts the next day to attach electrical connectors and cables.","The International Space Station when completed will have a million pound mass and be longer than a football field.It will house up to seven space explorers.The initial assembly of space station components involves linking the US Unity, carried into space by the shuttle Endeavour, with the Russian Zarya.The Russians had asked for a different launch profile in order to be able to transfer equipment from its MIR station, but that was not possible.Endeavour astronauts successfully completed the complicated maneuvers to join the two space objects.NASA estimates that 43 more launches will be required to completely assemble the 16-nation space station."

","Eleven countries were to adopt a common European currency, the euro, on Dec. 31, 1998.In November and December there were various reactions.France made moves toward a pan-European equity market.Ten of the countries quickly cut interest rates causing fear of overheating in some economies.In Denmark, which had earlier rejected the euro, a majority was now in favor.And in faraway China, the euro was permitted in financial exchanges.Whatever the outcome, the euro's birthday, Dec. 31, 1998, would be an historical date.Some saw it as a step towards political union while others already considered themselves as citizens of Europe.","Eleven European nations are forming a ""Euro zone"".Britain, Denmark, Sweden, and Greece are not part of it.Danes favor joining.The Euro became official for intergovernmental transfers on Dec 31, 1998, but bills and coins will not come until 2002.The Paris, London, and Frankfurt stock exchanges have formed an alliance.Euro nations cut interest rates and inflation fell to an average 0.9%. China has authorized use of the Euro in trade.The president of the European Central Bank warns that growth is slowing and that he plans to complete his term.The EU monetary action has given rise to the new mobile, multi-lingual, non-nationalistic European.","France's offer to host a financial meeting for nine other European nations is seen as a precursor to a pan-European market.It shows how the new currency, the euro, is reshaping Europe financially.Eleven European nations lowered key interest rates in preparation for the conversion.China made trading in euro official Monday when it accepted its use in trade and finance starting Jan. 1.Denmark and Sweden may not join the euro for political reasons.Some smaller nations may become unstable from a growing inflation decline.A new generation, already cosmopolitan, won't be shocked.The head of the new European Central Bank will not step down at half term.","On 1 Jan 1999, the euro, a currency serving 11 European nations, entered the world financial market.As time grew short, questions remained over the pan-European market.When the head--serving an 8-year term--of the European Central Bank, which governs the euro, expressed fear of a slowing economy, the nations simultaneously dropped interest rates, spurring the market.Annual inflation rates also were encouraging.Denmark, who along with Sweden and Britain eschewed the euro, was becoming interested.As a step to a unified Europe, the euro will well serve the new, mobile, multi-lingual, business generation and could portend an economic giant."

Timor mosques were set fire to avenge attacks on majority Christian churches.Australia trained Indonesian officers to monitor human rights.Indonesian troop attacks on unarmed E.

","One of those mentioned for the 1998 Nobel Literature Prize was Jose Saramago, Portuguese writer, atheist and Communist.Saramago was weary of hearing again that this year he might win.But this time he did, much to the delight of Portugal, but not to the Vatican.In speculation on the Peace Prize it came out that only a strict deadline rule denied Jimmy Carter the 1978 prize.The 1998 Medicine Prize went to three American pharmacologists, Robert Furchgott, Louis Ignarro and Ferid Murad for their discovery of the role of nitric oxide in the nervous and cardiovascular systems, one of the most important discoveries in the history of cardiovascular medicine.","Announcement of the Nobel Prize awards always generates great interest.The prize for literature has always been one to receive varying responses.Past selections have been praised, questioned, or even written off as politically or nationally ""correct"".This year's winner is 75-year old Jose Saramago, the first Portuguese language writer to win.It is the fourth straight year that a European won.The Peace Prize always receives critical response.Then President Carter would have shared the 1978 Prize with Sadat and Begin, except for a missed deadline.The 1998 Nobel for medicine was awarded to three US researchers for discoveries with nitric oxide.","Jose Saramago is the first Portuguese-language writer and one of few communists to win the Nobel Prize for Literature.He is widely acclaimed for his imaginative allegories.Three American researchers, Robert Furchgott, Louis Ignarro, and Ferid Murad, shared the 1998 Nobel Prize for Medicine for discovering how nitric oxide acts as a signal molecule in the cardiovascular system.Their research led to new treatments for heart and lung diseases, shock, and impotence.The deliberations surrounding the awards are secret; however, Stig Ramel, a former director of the Nobel Foundation, revealed the committee wanted Jimmy Carter to share the 1978 peace prize.","1998's Nobel prize for literature went to a Portuguese for the 1st time, imaginative novelist Jose Saramago, long a candidate.Portugal celebrated but the Vatican called him a communist and anti-religious.The meaning of Nobel's advice to honor ""literature that works in an ideal direction"" is unclear.3 Americans won in medicine for 1980s discoveries concerning nitric oxide's function in the body, which sparked new research.Nobel nominations are secret.Prizes are awarded on Dec. 10th, the day of Nobel's death, all in Stockholm except the Peace prize in Oslo.The 1978 committee wanted to give the Peace Prize to Jimmy Carter but missed its own deadline."

","Ariel Sharon was named Israeli foreign minister just weeks before a scheduled peace summit in the US, aimed at negotiating an Israeli withdrawal from 13% of the West Bank.Arabs reacted strongly and said the hard-line, right-wing, warrior and former defense minister would kill any progress for a settlement in the mid-East.Many blame Sharon for a 1982 massacre of Palestinian civilians at refugee camps in Lebanon.Others believed his appointment was an effort to placate the far right and gain their support for the Netanyahu government and the concessions necessary for the peace process.Sharon vowed not to shake Yasser Arafat's hand.","Prior to his appointment as foreign minister by Israeli Prime Minister Natanyahu in 1998, seasoned warrior Ariel Sharon announced that if appointed, he would not shake hands with Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat.The remark fit Sharon's long history of unyielding bellicosity towards Palestine.When he was appointed some thought that Netanyahu was placating Israel's far right wing while striving for peace.Others saw it as a move to scuttle the peace effort.Arab commentary deemed the appointment ""tantamount to disaster"" and ""the bullet of mercy"" to the peace process.Peace talks in the U.S. were in the offing with the outcome in doubt.","Appointment of Ariel Sharon as Foreign Minister by PM Netanyahu does not bode well for the peace process.His appointment is surprising in that the two have differed on withdrawal from Palestinian territory and is seen as an effort to placate the right.Sharon, 70, is an unapologetic warrior on the battlefield and in partisan politics.He brings heavy baggage: right-wing intransigence and responsibility for failing to prevent the killings of 460 unarmed Palestinians in refugee camps during the Lebanon incursion.Sharon has said that he will not shake Arafat's hand and his appointment is seen as a ""bullet of mercy"" for the Middle East peace process.","In a move widely viewed as an effort to placate the far right as he moves to withdraw from more West Bank land, Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu named hardliner Ariel Sharon foreign minister and chief peace negotiator.Sharon, a military leader with legendary victories in the 1967 and 1973 Mideast wars, is infamous in the Arab world as the defense minister in the 1982 invasion of Lebanon during which Lebanese Christian militiamen, Israeli allies, slaughtered hundreds of unarmed Palestinians.His appointment as lead negotiator was denounced as a ""disaster"" in the Lebanese press and ""a bullet of mercy to the peace process"" in a Syrian paper."

allegation was made public when Holder revealed the Salt Lake City 2002 Games organizers offered scholarship payments to IOC members' relatives.The IOC is investigating the charges and further allegations of Olympic corruption in voting for the games of 1996, 1998 and 2000.IOC President Samaranch called for an investigation of the allegations, promising to expel anyone found guilty, and ordered Hodler to keep quiet.Japan denied allegations of bribery to host the 1998 Winter Games.","In 1995 Salt Lake City was chosen to host the 2002 Winter Olympics.The revelation that from 1991 to 1995, the city's bid committee spent nearly $400,000 on scholarships to 13 people, six of them relatives of IOC members, ignited an international scandal.IOC rules forbid bidding cities from giving members or their relatives anything valued greater than $150; however, IOC member Marc Hodler alleges widespread corruption.According to Hodler, agents offer to sell votes, and the bid campaigns for the 1996, 1998, and 2000 games were tainted.A special IOC panel investigating the Salt Lake City matter will also consider the allegations of broader wrongdoing.","In December 1998 a story broke that relatives of International Olympic Committee (IOC) members had received $400,000 in scholarships from promoters of Salt Lake City for the 2002 Winter Olympic Games.The IOC immediately ordered a top-level investigation.Senior IOC official Marc Hodler called the scholarships a ""bribe"".The IOC rules stated that cities could not give any IOC member anything exceeding $150 in value.Hodler went on to allege similar malpractice in choosing other Olympic sites and estimated that 5-7% of the 115 IOC members received compensation for their votes.IOC President Samaranch vowed to expel any guilty member.","Salt Lake Olympic bidders gave $400,000 in scholarships to 13 IOC relatives in the first case of host-city bribery.Gifts of over $150 to IOC members or relatives is banned.The IOC's Marc Hodler says agents and a member demanded payment to 5-7% of the IOC for votes.Bribery was also part of 1996, 2000, and 2002 bidding.Nagano's mayor denies bribery to host the 1998 games.$17 million went unaccounted for.Hodler says he won't resign but may be expelled.The IOC head says bribe takers will be expelled, Hodler will stay.The games will stay in Salt Lake.IOC VP Keba Mbaye, former World Court judge, headed an inquiry.The Salt Lake committee apologized."

","The Wye River Accord provided for an airport at Gaza, giving Palestinians their own airport with Israel in charge of security.Gaza International Airport opened on Nov. 24, 1998 with arrival of an Egypt Air flight, but the highlight was landing of the first Palestinian Airlines plane, greeted joyously by a celebrating crowd.Yasser Arafat was on hand to greet these and later flights.The airport was expected to provide stimulus to the Palestinian economy as well as facilitating Palestinians' travel abroad.Despite frequent ""differences"" between Palestinian and Israeli airport officials, the airport was still functioning at the end of the year.","On Tuesday, Palestinians celebrated the inauguration of the new Gaza International Airport as part of the latest Mideast peace accord.It will be the first unfettered access route Palestinians have ever had out of the Gaza Strip.An Egypt Air plane was the first to land, followed by an emotional touchdown of the first Palestinian plane.Palestinian leader Arafat greeted the crew and seven other planes.Saturday, a Palestinian flight inaugurated an air route between Gaza and Jordan.However, tensions developed when Israeli security officials delayed two planes from taking off when Palestinian workers refused to let them check a passenger's identity.","Gaza International Airport, the first Palestinian gateway to the world, opened on November 24 to celebrations, with Arafat greeting arrivals.The recent Wye Accords, signed between Israel and Palestine in the US, made the long-planned event possible.The Palestinian airlines began commercial flights on December 5 and looked forward to adding a fourth aircraft.While the Palestinians are running the airport, Israel approves all flights and monitors security.This cooperation could only lead to problems and by late December Israel was delaying flights and threatening to close the airport as violence continues elsewhere and the Accords appear to be doomed.","Israeli security officials delayed the take-off of two planes from Gaza International Airport, further straining the Mid-East peace process.Considered a milestone toward Palestinian autonomy, thousands cheered Gaza's opening in November.Though some equipment was still not installed, Palestinian planes as well as planes from Egypt and other nations landed on opening day and were met by Arafat.The airport's opening and the stipulation that Israel would control the airspace and monitor passengers were included in the U.S. brokered Wye River accord.Since Wye, however, Israel and the Palestinians have accused each other of failing to honor its provisions."

","The leader of the Kurdish rebel group fighting for autonomy in southeast Turkey, Abdullah Ocalan, was arrested at Rome's international airport on Thursday.The arrest set off a wave of protests throughout Europe as Kurdish groups in Italy, Romania, Germany, Austria rallied in support of Ocalan.The support ranged from a one-day shutdown of business in Romania to a hunger strike in Rome.In Turkey, Kurdish inmates took an Italian prisoner hostage in an effort to get Italy to extradite Ocalan.Italy's leftist Prime Minister was being pressured to grant Ocalan asylum.","An international incident resulted after the arrest in Rome of Abdullah Ocalan, the leader of the Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK).An armed struggle has ensued since the PKK was formed in 1978, and nearly 37,000 died.Turkey wants Ocalan extradited but Italy is reluctant since Turkey still has the death penalty.Kurds from all over Europe have come to Rome, or at least tried to, to protest Ocalan's detention and to urge asylum for him.Turkey has said countries bordering eastern Turkey have harbored Kurdish rebels and Greece has voiced support for the Kurds.Prisoners in Turkey held an Italian inmate hostage in hope of forcing Italy to extradite Ocalan.","PKK leader Ocalan was arrested on arrival at the Rome airport.He asked for asylum.Turkey pressured Italy to extradite Ocalan, whom they consider a terrorist.Kurds in Europe flocked to Rome to show their support.About 1,500 staged a hunger strike outside the hospital where he was held.Italy began a border crackdown to stop Kurds flocking to Rome.Greek media and officials oppose extradition.Romanian Kurds staged a 1-day business shutdown to protest his arrest.In a Turkish prison, an Italian prisoner was taken hostage.The Turkish president needed extra security for a trip to Austria.This is Italy's Prime Minister D'Alema's first foreign policy test.","Abdullah Ocalan, the leader of the Kurdish Workers Party, was detained in the Rome airport and is asking for political asylum.Ocalan has led the Kurdish insurgents in southeastern Turkey since 1978.Turkey, where he faces the death penalty, immediately requested his extradition and has heavily pressured Italy.Germany also wants him.Greeks and leftist Italians oppose his extradition.Others in Europe have joined with Kurds in staging demonstrations and hunger strikes.Prisoners in Turkey are holding an Italian in hopes of a swap.The Kurds join Cyprus as contentious issues as the Turkish President goes to Vienna to discuss European Union membership."

","Exxon and Mobil discuss combining business operations.A possible Exxon-Mobil merger would reunite 2 parts of Standard Oil broken up by the Supreme Court in 1911.Low crude oil prices and the high cost of exploration are motives for a merger that would create the world's largest oil company.As Exxon-Mobil merger talks continue, stocks of both companies surge.The merger talks show that corporate mergers are back in vogue.Antitrust lawyers, industry analysts, and government officials say a merger would require divestitures.A Mobil employee worries that a merger would put thousands out of work, but notes that his company's stock would go up.","In a move considered unthinkable a few years ago, Exxon Corp. and Mobile Corp, have entered into negotiations which could result in a merger of the two companies.Such a merger, should it occur, would form the world's largest oil company and the largest U.S. company, placing it above Wal-Mart.The merger, and talks like it among other oil companies, is being prompted By low petroleum prices and high production costs.Talks of a merger have sent the price of stocks of both companies soaring.The merger could prompt anti-trust action and the merging companies would have to divest themselves of some interests.Mobile workers fear a merger will cost them jobs.","Exxon Corp and Mobil Corp are reported to be discussing a business merger.Other oil companies have merged to compensate for low oil prices and increasing costs of oil exploration in more remote areas.The mergers are consistent with a trend in corporate marriages that is changing U.S. economic history.The mergers are pushing stocks up and the Exxon-Mobil merger could benefit consumers and lead to further savings.Some people believe the merger would require selling of large corporate pieces and put thousands out of work.If the companies merge, it would be the largest U.S. company and bigger than the world's largest oil company, Royal Dutch/Shell Group.","Exxon and Mobil consider merger.Partnerships already formed.Oil prices are lowest in 12 years and future exploration will be costly.The new company would be largest in the US and put back together pieces of Standard Oil, a monopoly broken up by courts.Experts mixed on merger's advantages.It would be an anti-trust test, since companies are involved in many facets of the business, require the sale of large units.Refinery workers, others would lose jobs.There is an upswing in corporate mergers, pushed by bull market and recognition that it's hard to increase revenue internally.Merger anticipation sent stocks higher in oil, internet and computers."

","During the Clinton impeachment debate in the House, Speaker-elect Bob Livingston declared that he would set an example for the president and resign from Congress over revelations of his marital infidelities.Republican demands that the president also resign were rejected by Democrats who also said that Livingston should not quit and that the Speaker-elect's resignation was, in the words of Jerrold Nadler (D-N.Y), ""a surrender to sexual McCarthyism"".With the House vote to impeach, the president will face a Senate trial, but it is unlikely that 67 members will vote for conviction.The trial could be mercifully shortened, however, by a vote of censure.","As impeachment proceedings in the House approached a climax, House members were stunned by an admission from House Speaker elect Livingston that he was guilty of an adulterous affair.The admission follows disclosures by Hustler published Larry Flynn, who had offered one million dollars to anyone who could provide such information on a House or Senate member.Livingston's admission was met with a standing ovation by House members, as was his subsequent resignation.In resigning, Livingston called on President Clinton to do the same.Political pundits see the whole process as driven by partisan politics.","House Speaker-elect Robert L. Livingston was forced to admit to his Republican colleagues his past adultery.This was forced by an investigation by Larry Flynt.When Livingston called for Clinton to quit, House Democrats yelled, ""You resign""!Stunningly, he did.TV commentators were caught off guard.Livingston put pressure on Clinton to follow his example.The House moved to impeach Clinton and called on the Senate to try him.Livingston's downfall was said to show a breakdown in legislative civility.Those who want impeachment were called radicals and fanatics.Livingston's pursuit of Clinton was characterized as ""rabid"", showing his own hypocrisy.","House Speaker-elect Robert Livingston shocked his Republican colleagues in the midst of a Clinton impeachment debate by admitting to adulterous affairs during his Congressional tenure.He later urged Clinton to follow his example and resign that increased the fury of the impeachment debate.The House moved to impeach the President for perjury and called on the Senate to try him, convict him and remove him from office.Some who believe the debate shows the fanatical, partisan, and hateful side of Republican behavior, advise the Senate only to censure Clinton and thus avoid partisan vengeance.The issue deepens a cultural fissure and a sense of uncertainty."

",NASA and the Russian Space Agency readied the first part of an international space station for launch from Baikonur base.They decided not to change the orbit of the Zarya module as Russia had requested.Zarya's Nov. 20 launch was a success.The Zarya module orbited Earth for 2 weeks before a rendezvous with U.S. shuttle Endeavor to join it to the Unity module.It was tweaked and working well.It will serve as a space tugboat.The first 2 building blocks of the international space station were successfully joined by Endeavor astronauts in the shuttle's open cargo bay.Endeavor astronauts made 2 of 3 planned spacewalks to work on the space station modules.,"Russia launched the first piece of the international space station into orbit a year after the originally scheduled date.The launch follows a last minute Russian request to change the orbit of the space station to put it closer to Mir.This request was set aside.Two weeks later, the U.S. carried the Unity chamber into orbit.U.S. astronauts aboard the Endeavor shuttle then joined the Unity chamber to the Russian Zarya control module.The resulting 7 story structure appeared to be a perfect fit.In a subsequent second space walk, the astronauts were to install antennas on the Unity chamber as well as to attempt to unjam a Russian antenna.","Jerry Ross and James Newman spacewalked to attach antennas to Unity, the American half of the first stage of the 16-nation space station.Unity will be a connecting passageway for other modules.The other portion of the fledgling station, the Russian- built and launched Zarya module, will provide power and propulsion to the facility.The successful launch of Zarya, which had been delayed over a year due to funding woes, was hailed by the Russian Space Agency head as proof that the Russian space industry ""is perfectly able to fulfill all of its commitments on the international space station"".Russia is scheduled to launch the crew module next year.","After a year's delay Russia launched the first unit of the international space station, then pushed it to a higher orbit.Zarya will provide propulsion, power, and comms.US shuttle Endeavour made a blind docking with Zarya.Two spacewalks made electrical connections with Unity, which will serve as a passageway, attached its antennas and attempted to open a stuck Zarya antenna.A Russian cost-cutting proposal to orbit the station closer to Mir jointly vetoed.Russia promised to destroy Mir but now wants to extend its life.Russia sold early research time on the station to NASA to pay construction costs but claims the management lead for 1st 5 years."

","North Korea agreed to receive a U.S. delegation to discuss concerns about an underground site feared to house a nuclear weapons program.South Korea supports the U.S. and calls for full access to the site by U.S. inspectors.North Korea denies the concerns and proposes a $300 mil payment to visit the site.President Clinton in Seoul cautioned North Korea to focus on diplomacy, not nuclear ambitions.North Korea has threatened war against U.S. if the dispute comes to blows.The issue threatens to jeopardize North and South Korean peace talks to improve relations.A recent U.S. official's visit toi North Korea revealed serious economic problems.","In August, US intelligence found a underground construction site near North Korea's nuclear complex.North Korea, suffering a devastating famine, claims the site is civilian and offered an inspection for a $300 million payment.This follows their August missile launch and suggests they are reneging on the 1994 agreement to end nuclear development in exchange for US aid.Clinton discussed these developments with allies during his November trip to Asia.He warned US troops in South Korea of increased danger, but has not directly attacked Kim Chong-il.North Korea has begun its militant posturing as the date to discuss this construction with the US nears.","The meeting of the US, China, and the two Koreas in Geneva appeared to ease tension on that Asian peninsula.However, indications of a revived North Korean nuclear program clouded President Clinton's ""economics and security"" Asian trip.North Korea's economy is bad, malnutrition widespread, yet the country maintains a 1.1 million military force.Past US food and fuel aid to that country has been based on it not promoting a nuclear program.The US policy on Iraq is the removal of Saddam Hussein.Now, apparently the US supports dumping PM Mahathir Mohamed in Malaysia.President Clinton visited US troops at Osan Air Base in South Korea on his Asian trip.","S. Korea says N. Korea may be producing plutonium in at least one underground site.Satellite photos show a possible nuclear complex.If it is, it will strain U.S.-N.Korean relations and stop aid.The U.S. wants a delegation to check the site.N. Korea wants huge payment for inspection.A recent missile test firing over Japan, N. Korean incursions into the south, and the suspicious site are major causes for concern.The U.S. demands full access to the site and warns N. Korea not to waste a chance for lasting peace on the peninsula.N. Korea says the U.S. is pushing it to the brink of war over demands for inspections and talks."

","Acknowledging his mistakes, Clinton supports Democrat candidates and speaks at fundraisers.He backs Mary Boyle of Ohio in her bid for U.S. Senate.Democrat candidates try to limit the effect of the Lewinsky debacle on their campaigns.A N.Y. labor union backs Democrat Schumer to keep Republicans from gaining a 60-seat majority.Sen. D'Amato sidesteps queries about Clinton's impeachment on the campaign trail.A gay group may back D'Amato, the prospect of which is upsetting Democrats.House Republicans are using idle time to get votes on issues to help their campaigns.The National Republican Congressional Committee sponsors deceptive fundraising calls.","In addition to the usual factors that prevail in Congressional elections, this year's is complicated by the uncertain effect of the impending impeachment of President Clinton.The president has admitted mistakes, but remains a popular campaigner for House Democrats.In the New York race between D'Amato and Schumer, both are seeking union and gay/lesbian endorsement.Republican Voinovich hopes to take the seat of retiring John Glenn in Ohio.A budget agreement between Republican congressional leaders and the White House is needed soon to avoid a government shutdown.A leadership award from Speaker Gingrich's office is merely a pitch for contributions.","President Clinton's impeachment woes are causing problems for the approaching mid-term elections.The President stopped apologizing, saying he must ""live with the consequences"" of his mistakes, and urging democrats to take pride in his achievements.Democratic candidates hope to contain the Lewinsky debacle while trying to prevent a Republican majority in the Senate.In New York, the Human Rights Campaign may endorse both candidates.In Ohio, Republican Voinovich is in a crucial face-off with Democrat Mary Boyles.Republicans are using a bait-and-switch routine to earn funds from small business.Their House votes are on topics to boast about back home.","In tight congressional and Senate races leading up to the Nov. 1998 elections, strategists and candidates were unsure how to deal with the Clinton/Lewinsky scandal.Though the President pointed to his record while stumping, many Democrats, embarrassed by his behavior, distanced themselves from him.With impeachment a possibility, the Senate races assumed even greater importance.While it was unlikely the Republicans would win enough Senate seats to remove the President, Democrats feared their opponents could gain a filibuster-proof, 60-seat majority.The NY senate race between Republican D'Amato and Schumer was one of the tightest in the nation."

","Yugoslavia has cooperated with the UN War crimes tribunal in cases where Serbs were victims in Bosnia and Croatia, but has been slow to allow investigation of alleged atrocities in Kosovo.Serbs fighting there suffered losses to the guerillas and took revenge on civilians including women and children.The war crimes tribunal acquitted a Muslim military commander of war crimes against Bosnian Serb prisoners but convicted three underlings.A Bosnian Serb, known as ""Serb Adolf"", accused of genocide, admitted killing Muslims and Croats.Allied forces arrested a Bosnian Serb general charged with genocide and who could implicate Slobodan Milosevic.","Milosevic cooperates with the U.N. war crimes tribunal when Serbs are victims, but is an obstructionist when they are the accused.Officials, for example, limited U.N. investigators' access to Kosovo, where Serbs massacred 21 ethnic Albanian civilians of the Delijaj clan.Further, while U.S. and allied forces arrested Bosnian Serb General Krstic on genocide charges, other indicted, high-ranking Serb leaders are protected in Serbia.Meanwhile, in the first trial involving anti-Serb acts, a Muslim military commander was freed, but three prison camp officials were convicted.Also, in The Hague, the genocide trial of Goran Jelisic, the ""Serb Adolf,"" has begun.","The UN war crimes tribunal demands Yugoslavia's full cooperation in its investigations.It blasted Belgrade for refusing to let investigators probe alleged atrocities in Kosovo.The tribunal acquitted a Muslim commander, but convicted 3 underlings.The commander was greeted by hundreds at Sarajevo a irport on his return.Survivors say Serb forces in Kosovo took revenge against civilians for their battle losses.Trial begins for Bosnian Serb Jelisic, nicknamed ""Serb Adolf,"" who boasted of many killings.He is accused of genocide, although he confessed to 12 killings.U.S. forces in Bosnia arrested a Serb general accused of genocide at Srebrenica.","Yugoslavia was told to cooperate with the UN War Crimes Tribunal whether Serbs were victims or accused.Belgrade refused visas to Kosovo atrocity investigators.Serbians took revenge on Kosovo civilians for heavy losses.Muslim commander Delalic was acquitted of anti-Bosnian Serb atrocities after 3 years and welcomed home.3 of his underlings were convicted.Croat commander Mucic was convicted for permitting atrocities.""Serb Adolf"" Goran Jelisic was freed from jail by Bosnian Serbs and told to go kill Muslims.He confessed to murdering 12.Maj.

","Italy's Communist Refounding Party rejected Prime Minister Prodi's proposed 1999 budget.Loss of the party's support put his 2.5-year coalition at risk.The proposed budget was needed to meet terms for the Jan. 1 switch to the euro currency.Prodi met with President Scalfaro and Parliament, trying to save his government.The break with Prodi divided the Refounding party.Prodi lost a confidence vote and was toppled from power.He will stay as caretaker until a new government is formed.Scalfaro must decide whether to hold new elections or to ask Prodi or someone else to forge a new majority.He is talking with political leaders, trying to reach a consensus.","Despite support from a breakaway faction of the far-left Communist Refounding Party, Italy's Prime Minister Romano Prodi lost a vote of confidence in Parliament, 313 - 312.The crisis was triggered when the Refounding Party rejected the government's 1999 budget.A respected economist with a fragile center-left coalition, Prodi was in office for 30 months, instituting fiscal reforms that qualified Italy for membership in the euro plan.Prodi was asked to remain as caretaker prime minister; however, as such, he will have difficulty passing the budget (necessary before joining the euro on 1 Jan.) or getting approval for actions related to the Kosovo crisis.","Italy's Communist Refoundation Party rejected PM Prodi's deficit-cutting budget for insufficient job stimulation.Italy needed to reduce its deficit to participate in the euro, a unifying desire that largely held together Prodi's 2.5-year gov't, the 55th since WWII.The rejection divided communists, whose 34 votes Prodi's coalition needed for a majority.A confidence vote lost by 1 vote, from a member of Prodi's own party.Italy's political instability clouded decisions on NATO's use of Italian air bases in strikes on Kosovo.Prodi resigned but Italy's president asked him to stay as caretaker until either early elections were called or he named a new PM.","Communist Refounding Party vote against proposed deficit-cutting 1999 budget in Italy's Parliament could destabilize the government.The defection imperils the future of the center-left coalition led by Premier Prodi.His 2-1/2-year-old alliance was the longest serving of 55 governments in Italy since WWII.Prodi. who appealed to Parliament to save the government with a confidence vote, lost the vote and fell from power.The break with Prodi's party also divided Refounding.Prodi stays as caretaker premier while President Scalfaro decides either to hold new elections or to force Prodi or someone else to form a new coalition out of the 40 parties in Italy."

","South Africa's Truth and Reconciliation Commission, appointed to reconcile the sides involved in the crimes of the apartheid era, is releasing its final 2.5- year report.Its purpose is to identify those who committed gross violations of human rights.The report is to lay most of the blame for the violations on the State, but the ANC also shares blame.The program offers amnesty to the accused if they confess but execution if they refuse.The process has angered many people of all walks of life.De Klerk, Apartheid's last president, is not being implicated but he is suing to stop publication.Criminal cases are nonetheless expected to go on for six years.","South Africa's Truth and Reconciliation Commission headed by Desmond Tutu proposes amnesty to heal the wounds of the apartheid era.If those accused of atrocities confess, they will be given amnesty, if not, they will be prosecuted.The Commission's report said most human rights violations were by the former state through security and law enforcement agencies.The African National Congress, Inkatha Freedom Party, and Winnie Mandela's United Football Club also shared guilt.Former president de Klerk, who shared the Nobel Peace Prize with Nelson Mandela, was not named as an accessory after the fact, since his threatened lawsuit would delay the report.","South Africa Truth and Reconciliation Commission's 3,500-page report on apartheid-era atrocities was issued on Oct 30.This report was intended to clear the air, grant amnesty to those who confessed, and begin the healing process.Those named for prosecution were warned before the release.Ex-prime minister de Klerk's name was removed.The ruling African National Congress remained.While the white government bore the brunt of the blame, several black movements were included.After the release many talked of a new amnesty period or a limited time to prosecute.Prosecutions could take 6 years; diverting judges, threatening elections, and slowing recovery.","The Truth and Reconciliation Commission, which was established to look into the human rights violations committed during the long struggle against white rule, released its final report.In what has been described as one of the most complete reports of its kind, the commission blames most of the atrocities on the former South African government.The ANC also came under fire for committing some atrocities during the struggle.Nelson Mandella's ex-wife, Winnie could be prosecuted for the part she played in such violations.Missing from the report was De Klerk, who threatened to sue if he was mentioned in connection with the atrocities."

","1,000 people mourned Matthew Shepherd, the gay University of Wyoming student who was severely beaten and left to die tied to a fence.The crime sparked nationwide vigils and prompted President Clinton to call for federal hate-crimes legislation.In 19 states, including Colorado, sexual orientation is not included in hate-crime laws.Wyoming is one of 10 states with no hate-crime laws at all, but the governor appealed to lawmakers to reconsider their opposition.Christian conservatives argue that hate-crime laws restrict freedom of speech, while gay rights activists and others say these laws send a message that attacks on minorities will not be tolerated.","A passerby who found Matthew Shepard's nearly lifeless body tied to a fence outside Laramie, Wyoming at first thought it was a scarecrow.Matthew, an openly gay student at the University of Wyoming, had been kidnapped, brutally beaten and left to die in near freezing temperatures.Two men, Russell Henderson and Aaron McKinney were arrested on charges of kidnapping and attempted first degree murder.Two women, friends of the accused, were charged as accessories after the fact.Seeing this as a hate crime, gay-rights activists nationwide renewed efforts to get the Clinton Administration to pass hate-crime legislation.","A 22-year old gay University of Wyoming student was found beaten and left to die lashed to a fence.Two men were arraigned on kidnapping, robbery, and attempted murder charges (changed to murder after Shepard died) and two females were charged as accessories.Expressions of sympathy came from across the nation, including President Clinton and the crime was widely denounced.The savage nature of the crime renewed calls for enactment of hate-crimes legislation.The House passed a resolution calling the killing ""outrageous"".On the day Shepard died, the Family Research Council co-hosted a press conference to demonize gay people.","Two men in Wyoming kidnapped, robbed, and brutally beat a gay university student who died in a coma five days after the assault.The incident fanned public outrage.Hundreds in Laramie and on campuses across the nation demonstrated support to the student with marches and candlelight vigils.President Clinton responded to nationwide calls by urging Congress to pass the Federal Hate Crimes Protection Act.Gay leaders stressed that hostility towards gays, based on several surveys, flourishes in high schools and universities.By coincidence, on the day of the beating a religious right organization in Washington was announcing a barrage of TV ads aimed at gays."

","Dr. Barnett Slepian, the mainstay of Buffalo's only abortion clinic, was slain as he stood at his kitchen window.Slepian has been described as a fatalist who stubbornly adhered to doing what he thought right.The FBI is looking for James Kopp for questioning as a material witness in the slaying.Kopp has long been identified as a major voice in the anti-abortion movement.Attorney General Reno will investigate if the slaying is part of a nation-wide plot.In Canada, authorities are worried that new violence could erupt as Remembrance Day approaches.Anti-abortion pamphlets have been delivered to a Canadian newspaper, possibly by Kopp.","On Oct. 23, 1998, a sniper killed Dr. Barnet Slepian, a mainstay in the last abortion clinic in the Buffalo area and one of only a few doctors performing the procedure in the face of protesters and threats.Many of the protesters are itinerants like Rev. Norman Weslin, founder of the anti-abortion group Lambs of Christ, who travel about spreading their message and shutting down clinics.Another itinerant demonstrator, James Charles Kopp, is wanted by the FBI as a material witness in the Slepian murder.In addition to anti-abortion violence, a shortage of doctors who are trained and willing to do the procedures imperil their widespread availability.","The primary doctor at the last abortion clinic in Buffalo, NY, was shot and killed.Dr. Slepian, a stubborn man, dedicated to women's care, and an unlikely martyr.It's the 7th such death, and the 4th similar attack.James Kopp is sought as a material witness.The anti-abortion movement has local and itinerate members.Their activities go from prayers and talking to confrontations, threats and violence.After this killing, the FBI resumed a search for an anti-abortion conspiracy.Since the first few years after Roe v Wade, the number of abortions has declined, as has the number of clinics and doctors providing the procedure, especially for poorer women.","Abortion clinics continue to be targeted by anti-abortion groups such as Operation Rescue, Lambs of Christ, and Army of God.Opposition ranges from silent vigils to vocal and physical intimidation, and even murder.Dr. Bart Shepian of Buffalo's only abortion clinic was murdered in his home.Police in the US and Canada are looking for James Kopp, a known abortion opponent, as a material witness in that murder.The clinics serve poor, young, and uneducated women since the well-to-do use their established providers.AG Janet Reno has named a task force to find out if the Slepian murder, the third in five years, is part of an organized campaign of violence."

","A fire at an overcrowded dance hall in Goteborg, Sweden killed 60 and injured 180.Most victims were 13-18, immigrants covering 19 nationalities.The 2-story brick building was rated for 150 but held 400.Owned by the Macedonian Association, it had been rented out to 8 party arrangers for a Halloween dance, held on the 2nd floor.One of two exit stairways was blocked by fire.A panicky phone call in poor Swedish to authorities took 3 minutes to understand.Fire trucks were on the scene 6 minutes later.The explosive, fast-spreading fire reached 600C.It may have burned undetected for some time.Arson was a possibility but the cause remains undetermined.","Sweden's deadliest fire occurred on Halloween when a dance hall in Goteborg, filled with teenagers, burst into flames.The cause is not known, but the hall, approved for 150, contained as many as 400 and one of the two exits was blocked.Sixty were killed and between 150 and 173 injured.Most were immigrants or their children and represented 19 nationalities.Many felt the rescue was late.Rescuers said they had trouble understanding the first call, but were there in 6 minutes.Condolences came from Swedish authorities.A memorial service was held and a memory wall was growing.Although identifications are difficult, 40 of the dead have been identified.","At least 60 teenagers were killed and another 160 were injured in a dance hall fire in Goteborg, Sweden, Sweden's second largest city.The fire was the worst in Sweden's modern history.At least 400 teenagers, attending a Halloween dance, were crammed into a facility meant to hold 150.The dance attendees were mostly immigrant children from representing 19 nationalities, including Somalia, Ethiopia, Iraq, Iran and former Yugoslavia.The cause of the fire, which quickly engulfed the two-story brick building is unknown as investigators continue to probe the ruins.Emergency help was delayed by about three minutes because of language difficulties.","A fire rapidly destroyed a Goteborg, Sweden dance hall as some 400 teenaged Halloween revelers jammed up while trying to evacuate.At least 60 died, mostly from smoke inhalation, and about 150 were injured.The actual capacity of the 2nd floor dance hall was 150.Forensic experts are having success identifying the burned bodies but the question of how the fire began is still unanswered.The blaze gutted the entire building owned by the Macedonian Association.Mostly immigrants attended the dance.The fire squads say they lost about six minutes while trying to respond to a call in poor Swedish.It is doubtful a quicker response would have made a difference."

","Whether to use the 1st surplus in decades for a tax cut, to pay off the national debt, or for new initiatives made the 1998 federal budget negotiations chaotic.The Oct 1 start of the fiscal year was extended 5 times.Major issues were census statistical sampling, federal health plan coverage of contraceptives regardless of religious affiliation, and school aid decisions by the federal gov't or local jurisdictions.Other issues included a Federal Election Commission provision, a road through an Alaskan wildlife refuge, and an airline peanut ban.Committees crafted the budget document after broad agreement was reached when 8 bills were lumped together.","In 1998, for the first time in decades, the US budget negotiators faced a surplus.Both sides said this was harder than a deficit situation, but they finally spent $1.7 trillion.The last seven spending bills were the most difficult and finally were merged into one package.Controversial issues included health insurance paying for contraception, control of new education allocations, an Alaskan wilderness road, whether the 2000 census would include statistical sampling, and establishing an emergency fund.Conservatives felt the results favored the liberals, but both sides were satisfied and glad to finish before Election Day and avoid a government shutdown.","Budget negotiations between the White House and House Republicans were delayed on several issues.At issue were provisions that included requiring Federal Health Insurance providers to provide contraceptives to women as Well as a provision to build a road across a wildlife preserve in Alaska.The contraceptive issue faced an uncertain future while Clinton likely will veto the road.There is disagreement also on how to spend the funding on education.This year's budget discussions also have been hampered because it is the first time since budget procedures were established in 1974 that there has been a surplus, preventing agreement on a budget resolution.","After several deadline extensions, Congressional leaders and the White House agreed on an omnibus spending package, the final portion of the $1.7 trillion budget.It includes more money for education and defense, business tax breaks, and farm aid, as well as funds for Colombia to use in drug interdiction.To offset the new spending, the surplus will be tapped for $20 billion, to the ire of conservatives.This year, without the common goal of reducing the deficit, reaching agreement was very difficult.Policy provisions involving the 2000 census, contraception, and the Alaskan wilderness were also tied to the spending package and were hotly debated."

","Russian President Yeltsin's health was a hot topic in October.First he burned his hand.Next, in Central Asia, he cancelled public appearances and appeared disoriented.The trip was shortened due to a ""respiratory infection"".He was ordered to rest and take antibiotics.He then cancelled his trip to the Asian Summit.Although stoutly defended by his family, many Russians, including former supporters, suspect he is sicker, question his ability to do his job, and want him to resign.He has a history of health problems including heart bypass surgery.The court was to judge on whether he could serve a third term, but he already has said he will not run.","Concern over the health of President Boris Yeltsin has led many Russians to question his ability to govern.He has had multiple bypass surgery and is susceptible to respiratory ailments.Periods of illness have caused him to cancel foreign trips and on some travels, he was unable to attend all official functions.He is politically weakened, leaving others to grapple with Russia's economic crisis.Russia's constitutional court was to hold hearings on whether Yeltsin could seek a third term under their two term limitations since part of his first term was under the Soviet constitution.That appears to be moot point since he has said he will not run again.","President Boris Yeltsin's health has become a matter of great concern to the Russian leadership.The concern began in 1996 when he had a heart attack followed by bypass surgery.Illness has often sidelined him during his seven years in power.He recently cut short a trip to Central Asia because of a respiratory infection and he later canceled two out-of-country summits.This revived questions about his ability to lead Russia through any crisis.Yeltsin refuses to admit he is seriously ill and his condition is kept secret, even the cause for burns on his hands.Russia's leaders are calling for his resignation and question his legal right to seek reelection.","President Boris Yeltsin had a heart attack in 1996, followed by multiple bypass surgery.Doctors say his health is more or less normal but secrecy increases conjecture.The cause of minor burns on his hand were not disclosed.On a trip to Uzbekistan he walked stiffly, stumbled, rambled and seemed confused.Ceremonies were canceled and the trip ended a day early because of his bronchitis and a 99.3F fever.He was treated with antibiotics and ordered to bed but went to the office anyway.Calls that he turn over power were revived.He says he will not run again.He canceled an upcoming trip to Austria and sent PM Primakov in his place to an Asian summit."

","Business rivals are seeking to break Microsoft Corp.'s monopoly on computer operating systems.The Government and 20 states have filed an anti-trust suit against Microsoft, invoking the Sherman Anti-trust Act of 1890.The suit began with a Microsoft vs Netscape battle over browser software but now extends far beyond that aiming at Microsoft's overall aggressive anti-competitive conduct.The effort is extensive but inconsistent because of the ambiguity of anti-trust laws, especially the Sherman Act.The Government is examining Microsoft's financial records and painting a dark image of its Chairman Bill Gates.An unpublished book may be crucial to the trial.","In 1998 the Justice Department filed a civil suit against Microsoft to change its 9-year pattern of anti-competitive conduct.Bill Gates appears a schemer ready to crush competitors by any means.He uses Microsoft's clout to squelch internet competition.A 1996 Netscape complaint over browsers was central to the case, which grew to include Intel, IBM, Sun, Apple, AOL, and Intuit.Microsoft was ordered to let Justice examine its records and sought a trial delay.An unpublished book provided evidence.The 1890 Sherman Anti-Trust Act centered on Standard Oil and was intended to protect consumers, but its wording is broad and rulings have been ambiguous.","The Justice Department and 20 states filed a suit against Microsoft for violation of the Sherman Act, charging it illegally tried to use its dominance as the provider of Windows, the industry standard operating system, to stifle competition in other areas.At the heart of the case are Microsoft's contracts with computer manufacturers that prohibit them from substituting Netscape's Navigator browser for Microsoft's Internet Explorer, but Justice also alleges Microsoft exhibited a broad pattern of anti-competitive conduct with numerous other software companies.Microsoft says that Windows and its browser is one tool that offers immediate consumer benefit.","The government suit against Microsoft is the most aggressive antitrust case in a quarter century.The heart of the case is the Internet browser battle between Microsoft and Netscape.Microsoft says that its Internet Explorer is an integral part of its Windows system, the industry dominant operating system.Microsoft, it is argued, has told computer manufacturers that if they want Windows, they must forgo Netscape.The Justice Department and 20 states are joined in the action brought under the Sherman Antitrust Act.Microsoft's chairman, Bill Gates, usually seen as a visionary is portrayed in much darker tones in the trial."

","Lebanon's leadership changed in Nov 1998.Army commander Emile Lahoud was elected to a 6-year term as President by the Parliament and took office on Nov 24.He had the backing of Syrian President Assad, the powerbroker in Lebanon, and a special constitutional amendment in Oct cleared his way.He did not immediately ask Prime Minister Rafik Hariri to form a new government.Hariri, the nation's top businessman, had served three terms and rebuilt the nation, but some accused him of corruption.His support in the Parliament had also slipped, but many believed Lahoud was trying to assert his authority.When finally asked to form a government, Hariri refused.","Power in Lebanon is shared equally by a Maronite Christian president, a Sunni Muslim prime minister, and a Shiite Parliament speaker, an arrangement made to prevent a recurrence of the 1975-90 civil war.Syria, with 30,000 troops in Lebanon is the main power broker there.The Lebanese parliament amended the constitution to permit popular army general Emile Lahoud to become president.Prime minister Rafik Hariri, the architect of Lebanon's postwar reconstruction, expected to get a fourth term but a conflict with the new president led him to bow out as premier.Lebanon's economic stability has been threatened by the conflict.","Lebanon's Parliament voted the country's top military man, Gen. Emile Lahoud, president.Lahoud, who promises to clean up a graft-riddled government, is popular and is backed by powerful Syria.It is unclear, though, whether Prime Minister Hariri, in office since 1992 and credited with the country's economic recovery, will continue to head the cabinet.31 of 128 legislators chose not to support him, leaving it to the president to name the next prime minister.Consequently, Hariri withdrew his candidacy, claiming the president acted unconstitutionally when he accepted the mandate to name a prime minister.Hariri's administration was plagued by nepotism.","Army Commander and Maronite Catholic Emile Lahoud was named Lebanon's president for the next 6 years, chosen by outgoing President Hrawi and Syria's Hafez Assad.Traditionally the president is a Maronite, the PM a Sunni, and Speaker of Parliament a Shiite.Election by Parliament is a formality.The constitution was amended to permit senior public servants to be president.Lahoud rebuilt the army and ended militia reign.Walid Jumblatt opposed a military president, fearing a return of surveillance on civilians.PM Rafik Hariri, a businessman who rebuilt the country and economy, refused his delayed re-appointment by Lahoud, who vowed to fight corruption."

","After 2 years of wooing the West by signing international accords, apparently relaxing controls on free speech, and releasing and exiling three dissenters, China cracked down against political dissent in Dec 1998.Leaders of the China Democracy Party (CDP) were arrested and three were sentenced to jail terms of 11 to 13 years.The West, including the US, UK and Germany, reacted strongly.Clinton's China policy of engagement was questioned.China's Jiang Zemin stated economic reform is not a prelude to democracy and vowed to crush any challenges to the Communist Party or ""social stability"".The CDP vowed to keep working, as more leaders awaited arrest.","While China plans to sign the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights at the U.N., it is still harassing and arresting human rights campaigners.Three prominent leaders of the China Democratic Party were put to trial and sentenced to 11-, 12- and 13-year prison terms.Germany and the U.S. condemned the arrests.A labor rights activist was released and exiled to the U.S. to blunt any opposition to Communist rule.U.S. policy to encourage trade and diplomacy in hope of democratic reforms evidences failure, but the U.S. is continuing its policy of encouragement.Friends of jailed dissidents state that they will continue to campaign for change.","The US trade-driven policy of expanded ties encouraging Chinese democracy is questioned.China signed rights treaties and dissidents used new laws to set up China Democracy Party, but China violates the new laws by persecuting dissidents.It regularly frees activists from prison then exiles them so they lose local influence.It arrested an activist trying to register a rights monitoring group.CP leader Jiang's hard-line speech and publicity for activists sentenced to long prison terms signals a renewed Chinese crackdown.A rights activist expected to be sacrificed in the cause of democracy.Germany called China's sentencing of dissidents unacceptable.","Xu Wenli, Wang Youchai, and Qin Yongmin, leading dissidents and prominent members of the China Democracy Party, were found guilty of subversion and sentenced to 13, 11, and 12 years in prison, respectively.Soon after the sentencing, China's president, Jiang Zemin, delivered speeches in which he asserted that Western political system must not be adopted and vowed to crush challenges to Communist Party rule.The harsh sentences and speeches signal a crackdown on dissent, but Zha Jianguo, another Democracy Party leader, says he will continue to push for change.Western nations condemned the sentences as violations of U.N. rights treaties signed by China."
