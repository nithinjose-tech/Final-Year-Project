The magazine say much it be base testimony FBI informant, former bin Laden associate, who make only vague connections Salim and terrorist activities. Zierl decline comment report, say U.S. authorities probably ask more time just precautionary measure. U.S. authorities charge Salim help finance, train and arm members terrorist organization, include alleged bombers U.S. embassies Kenya and Tanzania. A criminal complaint unseal Sept. 25 U.S. District Court New York charge him murder conspiracy and use weapons mass destruction. Sometime summer 1997, operative Osama bin Laden sit his personal computer hideaway Kenya. He be worried, he write angry dispatch, security East Africa network bin Laden, Saudi exile accuse mastermind worldwide terrorist conspiracy Americans. The organization, author complained, have declare war United States, he have learn that only news media. The writer, who federal authorities believe be Haroun Fazil, who be become one central suspects bomb U.S. Embassy Nairobi year later, note alarm british press reports arrest aide bin Laden. Striking almost bureaucratic tones, he say he be worry that important man close links bin Laden, seem have fall enemy's hands. He say Americans be breathe necks his associates Nairobi and that he have take precautions. The cell be 100 percent danger, operative warned. The letter, extraordinary bit digital evidence cloak-and-dagger case, be retrieve computer house where Fazil have be staying, accord papers file U.S. District Court New York City. The papers say computer be seize August 1997 raid Kenyan authorities that be attend FBI agent. The documents not make clear whether FBI have translate and read document or bombings U.S. Embassies Nairobi and Dar es Salaam, Tanzania, Aug. 7 this year. The timing be potentially important because there have be mount questions bombings whether United States adequately follow warnings possible terrorist attack american targets Kenya. Officials FBI and U.S. attorney's office New York City refuse say Tuesday night what point FBI agents learn computer file, nor would they make any other comment. Fazil elude american investigators bomb he travel Kenya his home Comoros Islands and then Middle East. He remain fugitive. The dispatch provide remarkable insight workings terrorist network twilight 20th century. The author talk how he and his fellow operatives follow events CNN and use Internet communicate. He refer himself media information officer East Africa cell and complain that he be not be keep loop big decisions. Along way, almost casual fashion, document seem confirm two central charges federal case bin Laden: That he have plant terrorist cell Nairobi and that his operatives carry out another crimes lay bin Laden's door federal authorities attacks american soldiers somalia 1993 and 1994. The writer document warn that followers bin Laden, whom he refer sheik, have become America's primary target. He say his comrades East Africa should know that there be american-kenyan-egyptian intelligence activity Nairobi aim identify names and residences members who be associate sheik America know well that youth who live Somalia and be members sheik's cell be ones who kill Americans Somalia. They know that Kenya be main gateway those members, there must be center Kenya, he wrote, concluding: We be really danger. The government have assert that one Fazil's duties be prepare and transmit reports bin Laden and his top lieutenants. Federal authorities say that Khalid al Fawwaz, london-based associate bin Laden, direct Fazil report periodically bin Laden security situation cell. Fawwaz, who serve informal press spokesman bin Laden London, be arrest british authorities September embassy bombings. He have deny any connection terrorist activities. A translation report be part package documents american prosecutors have send Britain support extradition Fawwaz trial New York. It be not clear materials whether report computer be forward bin Laden. The documents, which be initially file secret, include federal complaint that accuse Fawwaz conspire bin Laden kill Americans overseas. A second count charges him solicit do so. The report make clear that organization be be run shoestring. Its author write that his mother have fall ill, and that he would return his homeland visit. What do you think? Keep mind we only have $500. He repeatedly express his fears American intelligence, which he believe be midst worldwide search bin Laden and his associates. There be war and situation be dangerous, he said. He write that american forces kidnap anyone who threaten national security or american citizens.

On Aug. 7, they charge, Fazil drive pickup truck embassy, lead way vehicle carry bomb that kill more 200 people, include 12 Americans. The author report say that he stand ready fight forces atheism and dictators who wreak havoc earth. He say that group not have inform its nairobi-based operatives all its global plans, they need enough warn go underground while if authorities intensify pressure Nairobi. We, East Africa cell members, do not want know operations plans, he wrote, we be just implementers. If Osama bin Laden ever stand trial New York bombings U.S. embassies Africa and other acts terror, it be already clear who prosecutors will call chief witness: One his senior aides who have be talk U.S. investigators two years. The government have identify aide court papers pseudonym CS-1, say person plead guilty terrorism charges secret proceed U.S. district court Manhattan. accord government, informant work closely bin Laden 1989 1996, period when prosecutors assert that bin Laden be order deadly attack U.S. soldiers Somalia and elsewhere. From court papers file investigation embassy bombings East Africa August, it be clear that informant have provide crucial information federal investigators. They have cite source papers file support extradition two associates bin Laden who be arrest Germany and Britain. Bin Laden, Saudi exile, be think be live Afghanistan. The source be also basis many significant charges indictment bin Laden himself, include assertion that he direct attacks U.S. soldiers Somalia and that he attempt obtain nuclear weapons. It be not know whether source be custody somewhere, or hiding government protection. As recently 11 days ago, records show, source swore 5-page affidavit New York notary summarize his allegations bin laden. Government officials adamantly decline say anything identity CS-1, which stand confidential source. But least one operative bin Laden's group East Africa conclude more year ago that he know identity crucial turncoat: Sidi Tayyib, businessman who be marry one bin Laden's relatives. The operative's concerns be inflame report british newspaper that Tayyib be cooperate Saudi and U.S. authorities. In August, 1997 article, The Daily Telegraph say Tayyib have be custody Saudi Arabia May and have give intelligence officials details bin Laden's bank accounts and businesses. The news Tayyib's possible defection, East African operative write report apparently intend group's commanders, almost make me explode. An important man close links bin Laden seem have fall enemy's hands, and we have take all appropriate security precautions that, operative, Haroun Fazil, write his summary security concerns. Fazil have be charge embassy attacks and remain large. The report be type computer seize last year Kenyan authorities, accord government filing last week U.S. district court Manhattan. Thus far, U.S. prosecutors have charge least six members bin Laden's organization terrorist activities or conspiracy. In one recent filing, they say their case will part be base testimony confidential source, suggest that informant have agree testify any trial bin Laden or his associates. The arrangement appear have result plea bargain which source be cooperate hopes receive less sentence. There be no indication that source have be sentence and it seem likely that sentence would take place investigation and ensuing trials be complete. In affidavit prepare last week, source acknowledge plead guilty terrorism charges United States and say they stem attacks U.S. targets, which be not specifically identified. The source describe take oath allegiance follow bin Laden's orders, and give detail account bin Laden's group, include its history and inner workings. The source tell private statements bin Laden other al Qaeda members, encourage them attack U.S. troops and other citizens station Middle East and Africa. I either hear these statements myself, source said, or I read them or learn them other al Qaeda members. The government have also say other court papers that source help identify bin Laden's signature 1996 document urge Muslims kill Americans. Tayyib's whereabouts be unknown and he could not be reach comment. The Taliban's chief justice accuse United States Wednesday look excuse launch another missile attack his war-shattered homeland. And that excuse be Osama bin Laden, man Washington call Enemy no. 1 and blames Aug. 7 bombings U.S. embassies East Africa, Justice Noor Mohammed Saqib say interview The Associated Press. On Aug. 20 United States retaliate fire Tomahawk missiles suspect terrorist camps eastern Afghanistan, kill 26 people. accord U.S. intelligence sources, camps be be use train members bin Laden's al Qaeda terrorist group. America be look excuse fire more rockets our dear Afghanistan and that excuse be bin Laden, Saqib said. Washington, which have post dlrs 5 million reward bin Laden's arrest, hasn't rule out further attacks Afghanistan. Saqib, who head judicial inquiry establish Taliban investigate terrorism charges bin Laden, say United States have become insecure. America fear its shadow ... every part world it be afraid and see every danger connect bin Laden, he say interview Afghan capital Kabul. In Afghanistan, bin Laden be consider honored guest his Taliban hosts. They cite Afghan tradition, which demand host guarantee his guest protection. So far Saqib say he have no evidence bin Laden's involvement terrorist activities. The Taliban have refuse turn bin Laden United States, they say if there be evidence they will try him Islamic law. In 90 percent Afghanistan rule Taliban harsh brand Islamic justice have be imposed, include death penalty. We want good relations United States and all Muslim and non-muslim countries, they have respect our ways, he said. Saqib say his inquiry will wind Nov. 20 and if there be no evidence bin Laden case will be close least Taliban. Bin Laden be not sinful man ... America have be silent ... they have give no evidence, he said. It be too shameful America who be now see all that world have no reason go bin Laden. The man accuse orchestrate U.S. embassy bombings Tanzania and Kenya be declare free man Friday Afghanistan, where he have live years permission hard-line Islamic Taliban militia. The Taliban, who control 90 percent Afghanistan, Friday close their three-week inquiry allegations that Osama bin Laden be wag war terror United States. It's over, and America have not present any evidence, Afghanistan's chief justice, Noor Mohammed Saqib, tell The Associated Press interview Supreme Court building Afghan capital, Kabul. Without any evidence, bin Laden be man sin. ... He be free man. The Taliban have tell bin Laden, however, that political activity be ban and he have agree respect that, Taliban information minister say statement Friday. The minister, Amir Khan Muttaqi, also dispute U.S. assertions that bin Laden be rich man, say Saudi dissident have have his foreign assets frozen, claim not immediately corroborated. One clear unstated objectives last August's raid Afghanistan be kill Osama bin Laden and many his lieutenants possible, administration officials now acknowledge. accord officials, White House lawyers conduct secret review months attack and conclude that such operations be legal U.S. and international law. The officials say raid be time so that more 70 cruise missiles would hit bin Laden's camps moment when Central Intelligence Agency believe he would be meet there his chief operatives. A 1976 executive order bars anyone work U.S. government plot or carry out assassinations. But officials say White House legal opinion draft Afghan strike assert that president have authority target infrastructure terrorist groups that be attack Americans. A top U.S. counterterrorism official say this week that infrastructure bin Laden's group be mostly human. As we say time Aug. 20 strike, objective be disrupt training, organization and infrastructure bin Laden terrorist network Khost camps, say David C. Leavy, spokesman National Security Council White House. Targeting infrastructure, officials acknowledged, can also mean destroy leadership terrorist group. Command and control enemy be justifiable target, Leavy said. Senior administration officials say they never discuss kill bin Laden their planning sessions. His death, they say interviews attack, would simply have be side benefit. U.S. intelligence officials say they now believe that bin Laden be camp day attack, he appear have leave unscathed missiles hit. Officials say there be reports that least one his senior lieutenants may have die attack, and that total casualties complex be 50 and 100. Administration spokesmen have draw distinction attempt kill specific person bin Laden and attack group people who command terrorist organization. administration officials have deny August that raid be intend kill bin Laden, Saudi exile who have be charge federal prosecutors lead global war U.S. interests. He have be link Aug. 7 bomb two U.S. embassies East Africa. But less subtle explanation be offer Oct. 13 Defense Secretary William Cohen, who say visit Saudi Arabia that United States have be go bin Laden and his colleagues. We weren't quite successful, Cohen continued, we send message. Kenneth Bacon, Pentagon spokesman, say secretary have not retract his statements. The Los Angeles Times recently report that administration believe that it have legal right use deadly force terrorist leaders. Bin Laden's organization be significant concern Clinton administration bomb U.S. embassies East Africa. last spring, officials said, U.S. intelligence consider dare raid Afghanistan capture Saudi exile. Officials say that roughly same time, White House draft legal justification military attacks terrorist leadership. That review, officials said, provided legal basis August fire cruise missiles meet which it be believe bin Laden and his lieutenants would be gathered. The review, National Security Council, be basis say this operation not violate presidential order ban assassinations. That ban be impose President Ford 1975, congressional investigators uncover evidence that CIA have plot assassinate Fidel Castro, Cuban leader, and others. The order said: No person employ by, or act behalf United States government shall engage in, or conspire engage in, assassination. While it is, its face, sweeping and unqualified ban, it have be subject interpretation and intense debate years. In 1986, Reagan administration respond terrorist attack U.S. soldiers Germany bomb raid Libya. The targets include residence Libyan leader, Moammar Gadhafi. And Gulf War, U.S. forces use powerful bombs attempt kill Saddam Hussein, president Iraq. The legal review conduct White House would appear provide precedent future operations similar circumstances.

6,"He be classic small-town prodigy, creativity big-city profiteer. When there be no shot take, he invent new one. When there be no one pas to, he reconfigured play teammate be open. Larry Bird, Indiana countryside or Boston Garden, be luminous exception govern rule. That be why, six years his retirement National Basketball Association, his name be again basketball's most prominent, begin his induction Hall Fame 7,000 Bird watchers Civic Center here Friday night. deservedly enshrine forever exceptional, he again become Bird, exception, case study contentious and potentially disastrous labor war. No, not really, Bird said, when I ask whether he be troubled likelihood his legendary name soon represent symbol greed unsympathetic millions. There's always player's name attach these things. I know time I be very happy it. That would have be 1988, when Celtics want compensate Bird $4.9 million bonus push his back pain, go their savior. Three years later, contract arbitration involve Knicks' Patrick Ewing, agent David Falk would contend that NBA conspire Celtics circumvent salary cap, order satisfy Bird. Alan Greenspan, I be sure, would agree that this salary cap be convolute enough give anyone headache, so let's just say it be cap that do not exist when team be negotiate one its own. The process unsealing cap re-sign particular player eventually become known making use Larry Bird exception. And that be where we stand, this onetime exception have become very expensive rule owners don't want play anymore. I can understand sides, say Bird, safely middle, Bird, former exception, and Bird, present Indiana Pacers' coach. Without get exception, I think it's very important players stay same place. Important, he meant, franchise stability and fan identification. You have son who be 7 years old, he go 7 17 10 years you've played, Bird said. A lot people Boston tell me that they have follow me, time they be very young when they be college. The Bird years number only three Celtics championships, he be best player pro basketball's most famous team ever had. He and Magic Johnson create basketball renaissance that begin college title showdown Salt Lake City and spread worldwide, infectious smile. They stand pass, team play, now their decade selflessness have give way one selfishness. The NBA Michael Jordan reach great heights anyone imagine it could, it be league that now suffer sickness soul. If Larry and Magic hadn't do what they did, we might not survive what we're go through, say Bill Fitch, Bird's first Celtics coach, who, Bill Walton, stand him night that, he said, give closure his play career. The owners, always, be exaggerate their misery, this time, it be much easy not root players. The president union be Ewing, who one day command players boycott world championships because NBA's corporate fingerprints be them, then next day help himself some television commentary work David Stern's women's annex. Ewing leads fight protect $100 million contracts 21-year-olds who have achieve not single playoff victory, link big payoffs agents his friend Falk. The battle be wag name salary cap that make exceptions unexceptional, rewards everyone if they be Bird. I believe that any field there have be allowance truly special ones, Walton said. But that group be very small. When I be grow this sport, only players who get recognition be champions, ones who always make you feel good game, sports. That's how Larry and Magic played, always dream special team. It wasn't hype, money. That be not quite case, nor should it have been. Bird be businessman's ball player day he arrived, his flannel shirts and blue-collar ethic. He hire late Bob Woolf, one original heavy-hitting agents, and get himself record rookie contract. then he go out and turn 29-victory catastrophe 61-victory contender. A rare Bird, honest exception rule. Despite modest encouragement new proposal deliver players owners, National Basketball Association Tuesday cancel first two weeks regular season, first time league's 51-year history that it will lose games labor dispute. The NBA's deputy commissioner, Russ Granik, announce cancellation nearly three and half hours meetings conclude Manhattan hotel. The decision cancel 99 games Nov. 3 and Nov. 16 come players association propose implementation tax system instead hard salary cap, proposal owners say they would respond Friday. We try our best today try do what be possible salvage season, say Alonzo Mourning, Miami Heat center. Unfortunately, it didn't work out. After 35,001 games blemish, NBA now join National Hockey League, National Football League and Major League Baseball have lose games labor dispute. take account that three- four-week period would be need training camp and free-agent signings season starts, league say it would decide two weeks whether make further cancellations. I'm very sad and disappointed, say NBA commissioner, David Stern. I consider it be collective failure, I honestly don't know what else we could have done. I do things that I think be best interests game. And I believe this is. The decision come what sides agree be most substantive talks owners impose lockout player July 1. Seventeen players, include union president Patrick Ewing and vice presidents Mitch Richmond, Herb Williams, Dikemebe Mutombo and Ty Corbin, attend meeting Stern, Granik and five members ownership committee Madison Square Garden president Dave Checketts and owners Abe Pollin Washington, Gordon Gund Cleveland, Les Alexander Houston and Jerry Colangelo Phoenix. The talks feature what players association imply be bevy concessions make owners that they felt would accommodate league's desire swing revenue pendulum back owners. The dispute involve distribution approximately $2 billion league-wide income. The main sticking point have be owners' insistence salary cap exceptions, implementation which they believe would bring player salaries' line revenue growth. While players not discuss elimination Larry Bird exception clause that allow player secure any amount money he want re-signing his current team they address exception their taxation proposal. The main points be follows: A 50 percent tax would be impose salary earn $18 million, clause that would affect only few players who exercise their Bird rights. For example, if player make $20 million, team would be force put $1 million fund that would most likely be distribute low-revenue teams. There could be provisions make some players, say Jeffrey Kessler, chief counsel union. We don't want do anything that would encourage Chicago get Michael Jordan back. And I think league feels same way. The proposal be similar luxury tax propose union 1995 negotiations, it would not be nearly liberal. A salary cap credit would go effect if league pay out more 63 percent revenues salary. Whatever figure that number reduces salary cap next year. If figure be $29 million salary cap, then 29 teams would work salary cap $1 million less previous season. But players would have assurance that salary cap would go least $2 million credit go effect. Also, if 63-percent threshold be met, reduction annual 20 percent raises would take effect multi-year contracts. Players would either get raise 10 percent or rate growth league revenues. The union say this clearly address league's desire bring salaries line revenues. Since owners re-opened current agreement because 57.1 percent revenue be go salaries, 63-percent figure would probably have come substantially owners agree such proposal. Teams would get right first refusal free agents fourth year incoming rookies, meaning player would be contractually obligated same team first four years his deal. Currently, rookie scale be three years and include clause that enable player exercise his Bird rights two seasons clause Kevin Garnett parlay astronomical $126 million deal last year Minnesota. Finally, players agree make marijuana ban substance. Details test have not be negotiate and no specific discussions take place test performance-enhancing drugs, provision owners include their last proposal. In return concessions, players want increase minimum salary currently $272,500 and creation average salary exception. This would allow every team salary cap be able sign one free agent year average salary currently $2.6 million. We're buoy fact first time they've decide submit counterproposal, union's executive director, Billy Hunter, said. I don't know if I'm more optimistic, I can earnestly say we can look our ballplayers eye and say we make valiant effort. ask if players would finally be test financially cancellation games, Hunter added: It's not us blinking. We want reach agreement. We're tire rhetoric, we're tire game-playing. Our position all have be we don't want accept bad deal. Granik say refunds fans would be make end calendar month and that first refund would include monies cancel preseason games. He estimate losses hundreds millions dollars. I think we have serious concern whether tax system can address kind needs we have economically, he added. But there's some possibility. add Stern, We owe it fan go back and look notion whether tax rate might begin achieve result we wanted. It doesn't look promising, we're go spend next two days see if we can give favorable response. Though decision cancel games be not surprising, it represent major shift prior labor stalemates. Both sides reluctantly hammer out deal 1995 start train camp sole notion not miss games and preserve NBA's perfect record. Tuesday, they could not come such accord. I'd think these our last games we have cancel, Granik said. But unless this or something else works, or there's some dramatic breakthrough, I think that be certainly not all season that's jeopardy. In decision that will almost certainly lead first work stoppage National Basketball Association history, league Monday announce cancellation all 114 preseason games. Citing stall negotiations Players Association new collective bargaining agreement, league officials say they would decide next week whether cancel first week regular season games. While decision have be expect 10 days, it nonetheless send strong signal that owners and players will probably be willing cancel least part regular season order settle their labor dispute. Both sides agree that it would take least three weeks hold abbreviated training camps and sign 200 free agents new contracts. Privately, officials sides do not believe season will start schedule Nov. 3 or December. Unlike Major League Baseball, National Football League and National Hockey League, NBA have never lose regular-season game labor strife. Since we're not negotiating, you have conclude it's very likely that we're go miss some part regular season, deputy commissioner Russ Granik say Monday night. We'll try and defer any decisions last minute, right now it do not look good. The two sides will meet Thursday their first official bargaining session Aug. 6. Commissioner David Stern and group owners walk out meeting dismiss merits new proposal players. Neither Granik nor players association executive director Billy Hunter sound if this week's meeting would go long way sign new agreement precursor play again. I don't think you have any choice miss games this point, Hunter said. In fact, I think they've intend it all along. They've lock us out, they've refuse negotiate and they've give us proposal that's ludicrous. not only be sides still await outcome arbitration decision that be due Oct. 18 - Fordham Law School dean John Feerick will rule whether or not more 200 players $800 million guaranteed contracts should be pay lockout owners and players also be make time win public opinion they test their fans' loyalties cancel games. Monday 11 cities throughout country, players be hold make-shift press conferences training-camp venues, NBA arenas and gymnasiums. Patrick Ewing, union president, and several teammates will speak SUNY-Purchase Purchase, N.Y., where Knicks train season. With training camp originally schedule open Oct. 6, message players be clear: if owners would call end lockout, we would be ready play today. About 100 players be expect attend, speak and sign autograph fans afterward. I wish they would put their energies try negotiate deal rather various other things that they've be doing, Granik said. The dispute be essentially how owners and players will judiciously divvy $2 billion income. It begin last year contention owners that their employees be receive more their fair share pot. The owners be allow terminate current agreement because clause that enable them do so player salaries reach 53.8 percent total basketball-related income. The owners say that figure be currently hover 57.1 percent. Though many economic issues need be resolved, main point contention labor agreement expire and owners declare lockout July 1 have be clause which allow teams pay their free agents they want, regardless salary-cap rules govern NBA's 29 teams. call Larry Bird exception, it be create allow Hall Fame Boston Celtics forward re-sign Celtics end his career. Michael Jordan exercise clause last two years Chicago Bulls, earn more $30 million season figures more $5 million more what team be allow spend all its players. But exorbitant salaries pay several unproven stars last few years and $100 million deals sprout routinely, owners be determine swing income pendulum back themselves enforce restrict salary cap hard cap and put ceiling how much one player could earn. last year, players receive $1 billion dollars salaries and benefits and we have make proposals that be guarantee increase that number 20 percent next four years, Granik say prepared statement. Our proposals would result average player salary more $3.1 million and minimum salary 10-year veterans $750,000. Unfortunately, union leadership have be unwilling give any serious consideration what we have offered. Hunter label those claims optimistic projections, and shot number new proposals present players Sept. 25. If they have leave current deal place, we would have get much that anyway, he added. All we're say is, we're not position accept hard cap. Monday's decision cancel preseason come less two weeks NBA indefinitely postpone training camp and cancel first week exhibition games. Through tickets sales alone, Granik estimate that lose exhibition season would cost league $35 million and $40 million. Decisions cancellations regular season games be expect be make next week, he added. A league official say games would be cancel blocks one or two weeks, depend circumstances negotiations. Thursday's bargaining session have suddenly become last hope start season time. Hurdles could be overcome very quickly, I have no reason believe they will thursday, Granik said. Added Hunter: Of course they don't expect much get done. When Russ and David decide negotiations be go be real and substantive, then something will happen. What they're banking now be that players be go miss paychecks and cave November. It's if they've ingest something that have pass. And once it passes, then they'll negotiate. The first substantive talks more two months oppose sides National Basketball Association's labor dispute come and go Thursday hint settlement. Still, five-hour meeting that be describe cordial league and almost two bulls let little steam players association produce another scheduled talks next Tuesday. Barring major compromise, that will not be enough time preserve full season and prevent league lose its first regular-season games labor strife November. Russ Granik, NBA's deputy commissioner, say league would wait next week's meeting decide cancel regular-season games. He also discuss possibility significantly shorten season. We haven't make determination that you need this exact number games order have representative season, Granik said. But we recognize that certain point we can't possibly sell our fans that we're have NBA season. Whether's that 60 games, 50 games or 49 or 53, we're not there yet. We have few months we have face that decision. perhaps only progress involve Thursday conference room midtown Manhattan hotel be question-and-answer session league's late proposal players. Patrick Ewing, union president, and vice presidents Herb Williams and Dikembe Mutombo attend meet union's executive director, Billy Hunter, and union lawyers. No owners be present, Granik, Commissioner David Stern and league's lawyers spend most day explain intricacies two-week-old proposal players. At one point two parties break lunch, Stern and Hunter raise their voices and accuse each other handle their constituencies poorly, participant meeting said. But two be see shake hands and laugh meeting conclude shortly 3 p.m. There be some vent sides, Hunter said. We've be placid and very respectful. Today, we take coats and we be inclined take gloves little bit. have do that, I think it kind loosen sides. Hunter added: Did anybody blink today? They're sort look us any kind nuance they can find course negotiations that might, some way or another, give some indication that while we're mouth one thing we might be open something else. We're look their body language, too. I don't think that they're ready make deal. The last formal meeting sides Aug. 6 end when Stern and owners abruptly march out they have receive proposal players. In critical ruling north american National Basketball Association and players' union, arbitrator John Feerick decide Monday whether more 200 players guarantee contracts should be pay lockout. If players win, owners will be liable dlrs 800 million guarantee salaries, although they have vow appeal if they lose. The league already have sue players Feerick's jurisdiction. If we win, I think it just embolden spirit and resolve players, union director Billy Hunter said. But I don't think there will be anybody celebrate because there's no guarantee that it will end lockout. It only mean they have pay some 200 players, and they've indicate us their intent file immediate appeal and take it far they have order avoid payment. so if he do rule our favor, most it's hollow victory. The players aren't go get pay Nov. 15 any circumstance, Hunter said. If owners win, it will remove last wild card players have be holding. The sides have not negotiate last Tuesday, when union propose superstar tax high contracts. The league make counterproposal Friday, ask that tax be impose much low threshold. Hunter dismiss league's late proposal Friday afternoon, then say sides would be best serve await Feerick's ruling. It's unlikely any negotiations will be hold this week, union be hold meet all NBA players and agents advisory committee Las Vegas Wednesday Friday. We've get get sense where players are, what they consider be reasonable and what they're willing do order get season commence, Hunter said. The union file grievance Feerick lockout be impose July 1 owners' announcement June 29 that they would not honor guaranteed deals. In six-day hearing summer, union argue that owners should have protect themselves be liable guarantee salaries work stoppage insert lockout language standard player contract. The Sacramento Kings insert lockout clause center Olden Polynice's contract 1994, and it be approve league. The union use existence that clause argue that all other teams should have protect themselves similarly. most players be due receive their first paychecks Nov. 15, although dozen or so have clauses entitle them be pay summer. none have receive paycheck. The NBA argue that tenet labor law allow employers withhold pay employees lockout. The league also call former union director Simon Gourdine testify. He say it be his understanding when he negotiate old labor agreement 1995 that players would not be pay if owners choose reopen agreement and impose lockout. more 220 National Basketball Association players guarantee contracts will find out Monday whether they be be pay management lockout, long-awaited arbitrator's decision that may affect leverage league's dispute players and have major ramifications american sports-labor law. But neither players nor owners be count rule arbitrator, John Feerick, speed negotiations, especially if Feerick find favor players, award that could approach $800 million salaries. NBA attorneys have indicate union that if decision go management, they will seek have it vacated appeal U.S. District Court Manhattan and then, if necessary, 2nd U.S. Circuit Court Appeals, process that could prevent players get pay several months. The NBA have already cancel first two weeks regular season because labor dispute. The league have other litigation pending U.S. District Court Manhattan. If players win ruling, NBA intend renew its motion disqualify Feerick. The motion be bring last summer grounds that no collective bargaining agreement exist and, therefore, he have no jurisdiction hear matter. If he rules our favor, I think it embolden spirit and resolve players, say Billy Hunter, union executive director. But we understand that won't end lockout. It just mean they have pay 200-some players. And there be still other litigation alive that may take while resolve. At most, it's hollow victory. Feerick will have take full 30 days render his decision. Whatever he decides, his ruling will be watch carefully. There be no precedent locked-out athletes be paid. During NBA summer lockout 1995, players who miss paychecks not file grievance. Neither National Hockey League players who be lock out first three months 1994-95 season. The union argue that owners should have protect themselves insert clauses non-payment lockouts and strikes individual player contracts. In support its arguments, union point clauses few individual player contracts that contain language preclude payment lockout. The league be rely basic tenets labor law, which hold that employees not be pay strikes or lockouts. A ruling union would be significant all future negotiations players and owners. The deterrent factor lockout be that employees subject collective bargaining agreement do not get pay once agreement expires and they be unable reach new agreement. If Feerick find favor players, there will be no economic incentive those guarantee contracts reach agreement quickly. They would essentially be pay not play basketball. If Feerick find favor owners, reality not be pay may spur players reach agreement more quickly. But Hunter dispute this notion, and conference call Friday talk openly entire season's be cancel players would back away their ultimate goals. I'm not all concerned, Hunter said. There's be no demonstration that there's go be change our resolve. After players saw these proposals league and recent posturing NBA owners, well, I have two players call me and tell me, if need be, they'd be willing hock everything they've got. Another significant development may be thedeparture many players Europe dispute be settled, accord least two player agents. I think it would be case-by-case basis, yes, there's already some people talk that, say Bill Strickland, member union's agents advisory committee. Steve Kauffman, another member committee, say he would explore possibility that one client, Nets center Rony Seikaly, would sign professional team Greece. We wouldn't look void his deal team, Kauffman said. But we would want him have right him work temporarily he could come back and honor his contract.' Russ Granik, NBA deputy commissioner, say league have approve idea players' earn living elsewhere lockout be settled. Proposals exchange last week that include concept luxury-tax system player salaries appear reflect first signs progress negotiations lockout begin July 1. But sides have term figures each other's proposal unacceptable, and it be unclear whether either side be willing compromise. I don't think we should get too carry away possibilities just yet, Granik said. When they explore idea tax system, we be take players their word that they want make some headway. But call their first proposal meaningless be charitable. They propose something that have no impact. As it stands, that can't be solution. The owners' goal be slow growth player salaries relation leaguewide revenue next three years, while players want keep earn much possible. As labor battles go, current one National Basketball Association and its players be weird sports standards. There be real possibility that most, if not all, come season will be canceled. In this union battle it be interests best paid, not those who make union scale, that be dominate discussion. And here it be some workers, not management, who be try make union disappear. The current arrangement have produce unbalanced pay scale immense proportions. last year more players ever receive union minimum, then $242,000 rookies or $272,000 veterans. The number players make $1 million $2 million year middle class, NBA terms fell sharply. But Michael Jordan make $33 million. This should not be surprise. Sports be entertainment business, not movies. Big stars get millions, while most get union scale. Over years, NBA efforts stem rise salaries have failed. The most important loophole its salary cap lets team sign its free agent it be willing pay. When that be adopted, it be assume that no team would pay lot more rival could pay. But it have not work out that way. In current negotiation, league have offer guarantee that its payroll will rise 20 percent next four years, $1 billion $1.2 billion, and say it be open proposals split that money any way players want, whether raise minimum salary or guarantee raises veterans. The union say it be worry that middle class, seem determined preserve free market. The league get its broadcasters, NBC and Time Warner's cable channels, agree pay this year's television fees whether or not there be any games broadcast. (they will be pay back later years, either reduced fees or extra games show.) Owners hop players would think management be willing wait them out, and come terms only small part season canceled. But union be act unhurried. It turn aside requests negotiations this week, say players have meet first. then there be issue union suicide, tactic that be reject players 1995. The idea be that if players have no union, it would be illegal antitrust laws owners collude. The sky would be limit. That tactic might fail. The courts could reject union decertification vote sham, and any case some players may fear that teams would feel free offer less old union minimum. But if players go that route, it could be long time real negotiations get going. Billy Hunter, union's executive director, warn owners this week that prolong lockout could destroy league's popularity. That be what all seers say four years ago, when baseball's World Series be cancel labor troubles. But fan memories be relatively short, and now baseball seem more popular ever. With that mind, owners and players may choose battle months. In critical ruling north american National Basketball Association and players' union, arbitrator John Feerick decide Monday whether more 200 players guarantee contracts should be pay lockout. If players win, owners will be liable dlrs 800 million guarantee salaries, although they have vow appeal if they lose. The league already have sue players Feerick's jurisdiction.

The league also call former union director Simon Gourdine testify, Feerick upheld union objections and prohibit Gourdine say whether it be his understanding when he negotiate old labor agreement 1995 that players would not be pay if owners choose reopen agreement and impose lockout. Patrick Ewing not want sound strike longshoreman demand health benefits. I'm not go try and put it dollars and cents. But Ewing, president National Basketball Association Players Association, play public-relations game Tuesday expound themes labor unrest: strong-willed unity and short-sighted proposals. On day when training camps be schedule begin, players country hold news conferences 14 NBA cities proclaim themselves ready practice regular season. We want show public that we, players, want play, say Ewing, who be flank five teammates. today be suppose be start train camp. We want practice and we want season start. But unfortunately, owners have lock us out and season have be postponed. The owners and players be schedule hold their first bargaining session Aug. 6 Thursday Manhattan. Neither side be predict progress sign new collective bargaining agreement and begin season schedule Nov. 3. The league cancel entire 114-game preseason Monday. Next week, it will consider cancel first-ever regular season games league history. With wide philosophical differences how $2 billion annual income should be distributed, sides have privately say they don't expect play regular season game December. Billy Hunter, union's executive director, offer glimmer hope. He speak optimistically potential quick resolution. stand few feet away Ewing, he said, I hope owners and commissioner have get message: that we're serious deal. I'm prepare make quantum leap. I don't think we're that far off. I think there's lot jockeying, lot rhetoric and lot games be played. But if and when owners decide they want deal, then they'll get one. But soon after, he begin lambast owners' late proposal, which include eventual phase out Larry Bird exception clause that enable free agents earn unlimited salaries their current teams. That clause represent major rift negotiations. Owners would implement restrictive salary cap that would eventually put ceiling how much one player can earn. I don't know if this be go come speedy resolution, Ewing said. They're entrench what they want, which be hard cap. And we feel hard cap, we players, cannot survive. We would have be stupid and ignorant accept that deal. Said Hunter, If you go their proposal, it's just joke. It's step backwards. I cannot understand it. If intent be reach agreement this late stage or negotiate earnest, this be wrong way go it. League officials not respond players' comments. All we want be our fair share and we feel they're try take that away us, Ewing said. `There's perception that we're strike. It's other way around. We've be lock out. Besides Ewing, other Knicks include former union president Buck Williams, former vice president Herb Williams, Allan Houston and John Starks. Marcus Camby also show briefly. When media horde close in, however, third-year forward go look his late-arriving teammates practice facility. He be stop gym door, which be locked. They lock us out, say Rockets forward Mario Elie. Everybody's get get that corrected. It's not us. They're ones that close us down. The stalemate have elicit talks possibly bring mediator come weeks, Major League Baseball 1994 help solve its labor dispute. But players be convince commissioner David Stern and owners be set test their resolve any genuine headway can be make negotiations. That mean miss paychecks November, something Ewing say players be prepared do. Both sides be still await outcome arbitration decision that be due Oct. 18. Fordham Law School dean John Feerick will rule whether or not more 200 players $800 million guaranteed contracts should be pay lockout. Feerick's decision could give new leverage one side. But if players lose arbitration, more 400 athletes many extravagant lifestyles and tremendous financial obligations will have their allegiances instantly tested. It's they want see how strong we are, ewing said. base proposals we've received, we're very strong. so far, it seem though NBA be dig their position, Buck Williams said. I don't think they're too concerned this point make deal. He added, We're far apart Grand Canyon right now. The National Basketball Association, embroil labor dispute its players, Tuesday cancel first two weeks 1998-99 season. It be first time league's 51-year history that it will lose regular-season games. The NBA's deputy commissioner, Russ Granik, announce cancellation nearly three and half hours meetings conclude Manhattan hotel. The decision cancel 99 games Nov. 3 and Nov. 16 come players association propose implementation tax system instead hard salary cap, proposal owners say they would respond Friday. We try our best today try do what be possible salvage season, say Alonzo Mourning, Miami Heat center. Unfortunately, it didn't work out. After 35,001 games blemish, NBA now join National Hockey League, National Football League and Major League Baseball have lose games labor dispute. take account that three- four-week period would be need training camp and free-agent signings season starts, league say it would decide two weeks whether make further cancellations. I'm very sad and disappointed, say NBA commissioner, David Stern. I consider it be collective failure, I honestly don't know what else we could have done. I do things that I think be best interests game. And I believe this is. The decision come what sides agree be most substantive talks owners impose lockout player July 1. Seventeen players, include union president Patrick Ewing and vice presidents Mitch Richmond, Herb Williams, Dikemebe Mutombo and Ty Corbin, attend meeting Stern, Granik and five members ownership committee Madison Square Garden president Dave Checketts and owners Abe Pollin Washington, Gordon Gund Cleveland, Les Alexander Houston and Jerry Colangelo Phoenix. The talks feature what players association imply be bevy concessions make owners that they felt would accommodate league's desire swing revenue pendulum back owners. The dispute involve distribution approximately $2 billion league-wide income. The main sticking point have be owners' insistence salary cap exceptions, implementation which they believe would bring player salaries' line revenue growth. While players not discuss elimination Larry Bird exception clause that allow player secure any amount money he want re-signing his current team they address exception their taxation proposal. The main points be follows: A 50 percent tax would be impose salary earn $18 million, clause that would affect only few players who exercise their Bird rights. For example, if player make $20 million, team would be force put $1 million fund that would most likely be distribute low-revenue teams. There could be provisions make some players, say Jeffrey Kessler, chief counsel union. We don't want do anything that would encourage Chicago get Michael Jordan back. And I think league feels same way. The proposal be similar luxury tax propose union 1995 negotiations, it would not be nearly liberal. A salary cap credit would go effect if league pay out more 63 percent revenues salary. Whatever figure that number reduces salary cap next year. If figure be $29 million salary cap, then 29 teams would work salary cap $1 million less previous season. But players would have assurance that salary cap would go least $2 million credit go effect. Also, if 63-percent threshold be met, reduction annual 20 percent raises would take effect multi-year contracts. Players would either get raise 10 percent or rate growth league revenues. The union say this clearly address league's desire bring salaries line revenues. Since owners re-opened current agreement because 57.1 percent revenue be go salaries, 63-percent figure would probably have come substantially owners agree such proposal. Teams would get right first refusal free agents fourth year incoming rookies, meaning player would be contractually obligated same team first four years his deal. Currently, rookie scale be three years and include clause that enable player exercise his Bird rights two seasons clause Kevin Garnett parlay astronomical $126 million deal last year Minnesota. Finally, players agree make marijuana ban substance. Details test have not be negotiate and no specific discussions take place test performance-enhancing drugs, provision owners include their last proposal. In return concessions, players want increase minimum salary currently $272,500 and creation average salary exception. This would allow every team salary cap be able sign one free agent year average salary currently $2.6 million. We're buoy fact first time they've decide submit counterproposal, union's executive director, Billy Hunter, said. I don't know if I'm more optimistic, I can earnestly say we can look our ballplayers eye and say we make valiant effort. ask if players would finally be test financially cancellation games, Hunter added: It's not us blinking. We want reach agreement. We're tire rhetoric, we're tire game-playing. Our position all have be we don't want accept bad deal. Granik say refunds fans would be make end calendar month and that first refund would include monies cancel preseason games. He estimate losses hundreds millions dollars. I think we have serious concern whether tax system can address kind needs we have economically, he added. But there's some possibility. add Stern, We owe it fan go back and look notion whether tax rate might begin achieve result we wanted. It doesn't look promising, we're go spend next two days see if we can give favorable response. Though decision cancel games be not surprising, it represent major shift prior labor stalemates. Both sides reluctantly hammer out deal 1995 start train camp sole notion not miss games and preserve NBA's perfect record. Tuesday, they could not come such accord. I'd think these our last games we have cancel, Granik said. But unless this or something else works, or there's some dramatic breakthrough, I think that be certainly not all season that's jeopardy. ","The National Basketball Association joined the NHL, the NFL and baseball when it canceled first the preseason games then two weeks of regular season.In litigation that is complicated by a dispute over the distribution of nearly $2 billion in league income, the main sticking point is the owner's insistence on a salary cap without exceptions.Top players are avoiding discussion of the Larry Bird exception, which allows a player to secure any amount he wants in resigning with his current team except as it applies to their taxation proposal.Also pending is an arbiter's decision as to whether players will be paid during the lockout.","The Larry Bird exception has been used to pay some NBA players much more than the salary cap allows.Stalled labor dispute over NBA salaries cancels preseason games and threatens regular season games.NBA owners and players plan meeting, which is unsuccessful.Players submit proposal at next meeting.Owners to respond by Fri.First 2 weeks of the season, 99 games, are cancelled.An arbitrator will decide on Mon. whether or not NBA players with guaranteed salary contracts should be paid during the owners' lockout.As the NBA labor battle goes on, most, if not all, season games may be cancelled.Lesser paid players may suffer if union doesn't survive.","In a dispute over a new collective bargaining agreement the National Basketball Association owners declared a lockout on July 1, 1998.They wanted to discard a clause in the old agreement allowing teams to pay their own free agents whatever they wanted, substituting a hard salary cap.The players wanted to keep earning as much as possible.On Oct. 5 all 114 preseason games were cancelled.The players then proposed a 50% tax on salaries above $18 million that the owners rejected.On Oct. 13 the NBA cancelled the first two weeks of the regular season.By Oct. 21 the entire season seemed in jeopardy in the interests of the best paid.","In a dispute between the owners and NBA players over how to divide the $2 billion in league-wide income, all preseason and the first 99 1998-1999 regular season games were cancelled.The Larry Bird exception, a clause in the old agreement that allowed teams to pay their own free agents any amount, regardless of salary-cap rules, is the major issue.The owners want a restricted salary cap.The players have proposed a superstar tax, and the owners have presented a counter proposal, but negotiations have stalled.Meanwhile, both sides are awaiting a ruling by arbitrator Feerick on whether $800 million in guaranteed salaries will be paid during the lockout."

A group high-powered U.S. investors Southeast Asia Monday applaud efforts perk Thailand's stagger economy, say they have be assure top Thai officials that key economic reform packages will soon be approved. After meetings Thai Cabinet members, include Prime Minister Chuan Leekpai, members U.S.-ASEAN Business Council say they be confident future Thailand's economy and promise their companies would continue invest here and elsewhere region. We would be quick observers applaud aggressiveness reform packages that we see be propose front your government today, say business council chairman George David, who be also chairman and CEO United Technologies Corp.

This be very aggressive, good reform. It's very impressive, David said, add that Finance Minister Tarrin Nimmanahaeminda promise Parliament would pass reform measures months, not years. The U.S.-ASEAN Business Council be private organization comprise 300 U.S. companies substantial investments Southeast Asia. David say five executives delegation represent dlrs 300 billion assets. The council's lobbying efforts U.S. and Southeast asian governments have concentrate removing tariffs and other barriers overseas trade. The delegation will travel Kuala Lumpur Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum Nov. 14-18. David say free trade should be focus discussions government leaders attending. What I hope they will say APEC be very strong affirmation free-trade agenda and very strong affirmation foreign direct investment agenda, he added. In little more week, world's leaders will converge this businesslike city heart Southeast Asia annual meeting Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation forum. They could hardly be meet more provocative place. On Sept. 1, Malaysia discontinue trade its currency, ringgit, and impose sweeping controls flow capital its stock and currency markets, particularly investment overseas. In do so, malaysian prime minister, Mahathir Mohamad, effect slam door global economy that President Clinton and other leaders be come here champion. Mahathir's decision draw jeers international investors and policy- makers, who warn that Malaysia be seek quick fix that would retard its desperately need reforms and leave it odd man out when Asia finally recover regional malaise. Now, though, Mahathir's allies be marshal new economic data that they say indicate that capital controls be breathe new life country's moribund economy. Malaysia's foreign reserves rise strongly September, and there be anecdotal evidence that consumers be start spend again. It's nice be able say that we adopt capital controls, economy have improved, say Zainal Aznam Yusof, deputy director Institute Strategic and International Studies, research organization here that help draft policies. But we want see whether this be strongly sustainable. Critics say it be predictable that capital controls would be short-term tonic Malaysia's economy. Because country be sheltered vagaries capital flows and currency fluctuations, they said, government have be able ease interest rates and encourage consumer spending. Still, mere fact that Malaysia's experiment have yield some positive results guarantees that issue will come APEC meeting. With Mahathir lead campaign, cause capital controls will have fiery advocate who have penchant get skin Westerners. Mahathir be very outspoken political leader, say Chia Yew Boon, independent analyst Singapore. There be no way like Clinton or Jiang Zemin be go be able muzzle him, he added, refer President Jiang China. Policy-makers United States have express fears that if Malaysia's gambit be see successful, other economically weaken countries region, Indonesia, might be tempt try it. so far, indonesian officials have say they would stick recovery plan devise International Monetary Fund, which stress economic austerity and open markets. But officials Japan have express some sympathy Mahathir's policies, while Paul Krugman, economist Massachusetts Institute Technology, have advocate use them emergency measure. Yusof say recent events have vindicate Malaysia's contention that it need insulate itself ravages global financial system. He say recent near-collapse prominent american hedge fund underscore how sudden flow capital can have destructive consequences. The Long-Term Capital Management hedge fund, base Greenwich, Conn., be nearly wrecked series wrong bets Treasury securities collapse economy Russia prompt flight capital out that country. The LTCM fiasco really provide case study what could go wrong global economy, Yusof said. With capital controls protection, Yusof say Malaysia be pick pieces its shattered economy. In addition grow foreign reserves, he say Malaysia have improve its trade balance and revive consumer purchases durable goods. Foreign investors have also not wholly abandon Malaysia, experts have predict they would. While foreign direct investment fell September $142 million, average monthly rate $321 million period January September it not dry completely. For every comforting statistic, though, critics produce alarm one. They say increase Malaysia's foreign reserves be merely due new capital restrictions, which stipulate that malaysian currency hold country would be worthless unless repatriate Sept. 30. The skeptics also note that bank lending decline September, several reductions interest rates. So consumers who be buy new cars and home appliances be merely dip their savings, which mean buy spree will end when their savings be depleted. The argument be that impose capital controls, you'd regain control monetary policy, which would increase supply money and lessen liquidity crunch, say K.S. Jomo, professor political economy University Malaya here. But that's not happening. The big flaw Malaysia's policy, Jomo and said, be its timing. With asian crisis more year old, much foreign capital that be country have already gone. The critics say Mahathir have spook would-be investors lock ones who use be here. There be case be make temporary imposition capital controls, avert crisis, not respond one, Jomo said. In fact, other asian currencies, Indonesian rupiah and Thai baht, have actually rebound Malaysia suspend trade its currency and fixed exchange rate 3.8 ringgit dollar. Analysts liken situation buying insurance policy disaster that have come and gone. more important, capital controls be slow much-needed corporate and bank reforms. The government's rescue Renong, major conglomerate close ties Mahathir, be go ahead, though some analysts predict government will eventually scrap much-criticized plan. The rescue politically connected companies remain tense issue here. On Monday, trial Malaysia's former deputy prime minister, Anwar Ibrahim, charge corruption and sex-related crimes, Anwar angrily deny Mahathir's claim that he have approve bailout. Anwar's sensational trial be reminder that Mahathir's economic policies cannot be disentangle politics. Malaysia's 72-year-old prime minister clash his former protege how respond asian crisis, and he dismiss Anwar day impose capital controls. During boom times, Mahathir win support his policies wrap them anti-foreigner language. In speech Monday, he attack familiar target, say foreign currency traders be cause currency turmoil, adding: They spread it worldwide. They precipitate current recession every country. But Mahathir's treatment Anwar have stir anger and spark grow social unrest malaysia. With protesters chant reform orderly streets this city, experts say Mahathir need capital controls work order soothe country's agitate population. Things will heat if economy do not improve, say Chandra Muzaffar, professor political science University Malaya. then whole question Mahathir and his leadership will remain issue. In that regard, least, leaders who converge Kuala Lumpur two weeks will be able identify their embattled host. The leaders Malaysia's rule party meet Tuesday discuss replacement oust deputy prime minister Anwar Ibrahim, who face trial next month case that will test country's legal system. Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad, 72, say last week he could drop dead any time. But because large number candidates deputy's job ruling United Malays National Organization, decision be not expect quickly. The party leaders, who have be conduct national campaign explain Malaysians why popular Anwar be fire Sept. 2, will also confer what do now that High Court judge have ban all comments Anwar's guilt or innocence. The ruling coalition have schedule giant rally capital Saturday, aim draw youth whom Anwar's campaign reform have most appeal. Mahathir, who have heart bypass surgery 1989, have groom Anwar, 51, his successor. But he fire his protege his posts deputy prime minister and finance minister grounds he be morally unfit lead. The two have differ economic policy and Anwar have say Mahathir fear he be threat his 17-year rule. Anwar be also dump rule party, and two weeks nationwide rallies which he call government reform and Mahathir's resignation, he be arrest law that allow police hold him indefinitely, and prevent him see his family and lawyers. On Tuesday, Mahathir denounce demonstrators who have flock thousands streets downtown Kuala Lumpur recent weeks, call them part plot topple government. Baton-wielding riot police have disperse crowd tear gas and water cannons, arrest more 100 people. They decide that government should be bring demonstrations, riots, Bernama news agency quote Mahathir say Sarawak state Borneo Island. He be expect return Kuala Lumpur later Tuesday chair UMNO meeting. After Anwar appear court black eye, bruise face, neck and arms, his case draw international attention, particularly presidents Philippines and Indonesia, who have raise possibility they might not attend 18-nation summit Malaysia next month. The United States would downgrade President Bill Clinton's visit Kuala Lumpur next month if Anwar continue be mistreated, Wall Street Journal quote official Washington saying. Clinton be schedule go Malaysia meet asia-pacific Economic Cooperation forum. Wearing neck brace Monday court-ordered hospital checkup, Anwar be order stand trial Nov. 2 four charges abuse his powers interfere police investigation. His trial be halt Nov. 14 and resume APEC meetings. He have plead innocent all charges, include another corruption count and five charges sodomy. He face 14 years prison and fine each corruption count and 20 years, whipping, each sexual charge, if convicted. Anwar be arrest Sept. 20 Internal Security Act, which allow jail trial. Under same law, police also arrest 17 people consider Anwar associates and risk national security. As Tuesday, 12 have be released. The UMNO supreme council be expect prepare list top candidates Anwar's job Mahathir's final decision. The Star newspaper, which be close government, list favorites Foreign Minister Abdullah Ahmad Badawi and Education Minister Najib Tun Razak. other top contenders include Mahathir's confidant Daim Zainuddin, former finance minister bring back Cabinet June special functions minister charge economic recovery. Rafidah Aziz, international trade and industry minister, and Tengku Razaleigh Hamzah, former finance minister, be also running. The last time asia-pacific region hold its annual summit promote free trade, Japan's prime minister assure everyone that his economy wouldn't be next victim Asia's financial crisis. Canada, host country, be criticize some Canada crack demonstrations Suharto, Indonesia's iron-fisted ruler time. And President Bill Clinton, whose popularity and boom economy be envy planet, join everyone else urge countries such Thailand and South Korea bite bullet and comply tough economic reforms that International Monetary Fund be demanding. My, how challenges have grown, 21-nation asia-pacific Economic Cooperation forum prepare its November summit Malaysia. Japan world's second large economy, and Asia's financial anchor be suffer its bad recession World War II, and that bad news cost Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto his job. Suharto, who rule Indonesia 32 years, be drive out power violent, pro-democracy movement, and world's fourth most populous country be real trouble financially. Wall Street be now cop steep downturn. And though Clinton have promise attend APEC meeting, some people wonder how he can do that while face impeachment inquiry back home, thanks Monica Lewinsky sex scandal. Worse still, Asia's economic crisis be show signs go global, and more and more economists be criticize IMF way it be handle its bailouts. other well-respected economists be go further, question whether free-market philosophy doesn't leave some countries too vulnerable chaos major market speculators. In fact, Malaysia isn't only country try self-defense mechanisms such capital controls. Hong Kong recently spend fortune invest its stock market ward speculators. And Washington be try figure out what do hedge funds watch its Federal Reserve help bail out major one that be go under, and see investments send U.S. dollar tailspin Japan's yen. Ironically, Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad, who make one his typical anti-free-market comments last year's summit, probably could have open this year's I tell you so. But he be have major domestic problems. Mahathir, 72, who be widely credit create modern Malaysia his 17 years power, dismiss Anwar Ibrahim, his expect successor, apparent dispute how battle country's economic mess. instead step aside, Anwar launch reform movement Malaysia that quickly lead big rallies demand that Mahathir step down. The prime minister use riot police thwart protests, and jailed Anwar, charge him corruption and sex crimes, and schedule his trial Nov. 2. The trial will be interrupt Nov. 12-18 APEC meetings, Mahathir's treatment Anwar and his reform movement already have be criticize APEC members such Australia, Indonesia, Philippines and United States. President B.J. Habibie Indonesia and Philippine President Joseph Estrada consider Anwar friend, and Estrada won't say whether he plan attend this year's APEC summit. John S. Wolf, U.S. ambassador APEC, recently acknowledge that it won't be easy APEC members meet malaysia Asian crisis ricochets world no clear sign what will happen next. But he also say leaders 21 APEC members should aim productive meeting. Wolf say such gatherings give members chance discuss IMF bailout strategies and free-market philosophy, resolve bilateral disputes, and continue reduce tariff rates help struggle countries improve their exports. This have be lousy year general. It have affect all us. It have set APEC back, and there be no silver bullet solve crisis right away, say Wolf. But we should welcome chance work together and develop sense what's possible. So far, APEC have be criticize do little financial crisis. But next month it hop complete plan that would lift trade barriers nine key industries: environmental products and services, energy, fisheries, forestry, toys, jewelry, medical goods, chemical products and telecommunications. Besides United States, APEC, which account half all global trade consist these members: Australia, Brunei, Canada, Chile, China, Hong Kong, Indonesia, Japan, Malaysia, Mexico, New Zealand, Papua New Guinea, Philippines, Singapore, South Korea, Taiwan and Thailand.

But Bar-Illan say palestinian legislature have never pass such law. Why Mr. Arafat agree Wye accord outlaw them if he have already do it? he asked. The Wye memorandum states that palestinian Authority will inform United States fully actions it have take outlaw all organizations (or wings organizations, appropriate) military, terrorist or violent character, and their support structure and prevent them freedom action areas its jurisdiction.

In book his six-month detention same law that keep Anwar away family and lawyers 10 days, Syed describe be hit and deprive sleep. At least I didn't have bruises my face, although I be slap and hit stomach, Syed tell The Associated Press. Anwar's bruise raise alarm questions state governance country, say Lim Kit Siang, leader opposition democratic Action Party. If Mahathir not know alleged beatings, it suggest police act their own. At series rally his arrest, Anwar lead throngs chant Mahathir's resignation and more open, less corrupt government. His arrest Sept. 20 be follow street protests and hundreds additional arrests. Before his arrest, Anwar designate his wife, Azizah Ismail, leader his new reform movement. But police have ban her speaking publicly. On Thursday she be summon third time police headquarters question interview regional television network CNBC Asia. She have express fears that her husband would be inject HIV virus prove allegations homosexuality, and police be investigate possible charges sedition her. She call repeat interviews pressure and harassment. Three Malaysian police officers travel Singapore Thursday ask CNBC news anchors how they have arrange get Sept. 21 interview Azizah and one Anwar Sept. 3. CNBC refuse answer questions its news gathering, say vice president news program Chris Blackman. Anwar, who plead innocent this week five charges sodomy and five corruption, tell court that police beat him night he be arrested, blood seep my nose, leave him half-conscious. His allegations, accompany pictorial evidence, bring prompt expressions disapproval, U.S. State Department, Australian government, Amnesty International, and finance ministers other countries who use meet Anwar international conferences. On Thursday, Indonesian government, where security forces have be accuse years mistreat prisoners, say it regret reports Anwar's injuries and that allegations have place doubt visit Malaysia President B.J. Habibie. The arrest former Malaysian Deputy Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim won't lead massive social unrest or frighten away investors, Malaysia's trade minister say Thursday. Anwar be fire Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad Sept. 2 two differed economic policy. He then begin speak out Mahathir and be arrest Sept. 20. Frankly speaking there be no reason say that just because one man be arrest something ... that it should bring any unrest, trade minister Rafidah Aziz said. Leaders come and go. ... They get sack all countries world. They die, she tell news conference Manila, where she attend meet Association Southeast Asian Nations economic ministers. Rafidah say there have only be few demonstrations Malaysia Anwar's arrest, all them orchestrated. In recent visits Chicago, New York, Houston and Boston, she say potential investors ask her Anwar's arrest be still interested invest Malaysia. Anwar say police beat him custody. In recent appearances court, where he be face charges corruption and illegal homosexual acts, he be see black eye and neck brace. At least two ASEAN leaders, Philippine President Joseph Estrada and Indonesian President B.J. Habibie, have speak out Anwar's treatment. The philippine leader say he be skip summit asia-pacific leaders Malaysia November protest arrest Anwar, whom he describe personal friend. He later say he would attend summit and have only make earlier remarks out sympathy Anwar. The Philippines, Malaysia and Indonesia be found member countries ASEAN, which also include Brunei, Laos, Myanmar, Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam. Among Asia's leaders, Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad be notable man bold vision: physical and social transformation that would push this nation forefront world affairs. It almost come true. In 17 years prime minister, Mahathir, 72, who be medical doctor, foster economic liberalization that lead some world's fast rates growth. He drive Malaysians be more productive, embrace high technology and begin major investments world. He create national affirmative-action program that allow country's ethnic Chinese, Malays and Indians share improve living standards and new sense malaysian identity and pride. This year be have be Mahathir's year triumph, perhaps pave way his retirement, inauguration huge public work projects and impressive gatherings foreign leaders and sportsmen. But today, dizzy turnaround, Malaysia be Asia's critical list, its economy teeter edge disaster and its stability shake what seem have be entirely avoidable political cat fight. last month, Mahathir dismiss and arrest his deputy and heir apparent, Anwar Ibrahim, 51, accuse him corruption and illegal sex acts. The move set street demonstrations and arouse international condemnation, particularly Anwar's many friends foreign governments. One region's most stable and prosperous nations be suddenly uproar. It appear that Indonesia, Thailand, Japan and South Korea, pressure economic collapse have spawn political crisis. In all those nations, result be change leadership. The question now is: Is Mahathir next? The answer be far clear. Unlike Indonesia, there have be little evidence simmer discontent Malaysia. The ouster former President Suharto Indonesia have be predict many people. almost no one seem have foresee eruption here. Malaysia be not familiar political demonstrations. Unlike Indonesians, Malaysians rarely riot. many people here be puzzle and disturb when they encounter water cannon and riot police streets recent weeks. What we're see be unprecedented, say Ambassador John Malott United States. This have never happen Malaysia, and nobody know where it's go go. You can write lot scenarios we be totally uncharted waters. Mahathir, confident nation-builder, seem be flail he watch his legacy crumble. An economy that have be grow more 8 percent year last decade be now head contraction perhaps 6 percent. Angry and frustrated, he close Malaysia international financial markets one month ago, turn his back foreign investors whom he once embrace and who have fuel country's rapid growth. The move have intend effect bring home Malaysian currency, insulate it speculators Mahathir blame crisis, and give adrenaline jolt now self-contained economy. It be move that seem tune recent question economic orthodoxy International Monetary Fund. But few foreign economists expect it work long. Mahathir be attack fundamental beliefs free market, capitalism, Wall Street, foreign diplomat said. We be either watch economic theory be rewrite or reconfirm and I don't think it's be rewritten. The day make his economic gamble, Mahathir set most severe political crisis his tenure, dismiss Anwar, man he have be groom be his successor. Two weeks later, Anwar be arrest his home and hold incommunicado 10 days, which he say he be beat his jailers. last week he be charge 10 counts corruption and sexual misconduct that could result prison term 34 years. The harshness those moves unleash surge largely unsuspected discontent that mobilize Anwar's motley fellow constituencies: liberal democrats, young professionals and politically assertive Muslims. For first time decades, Malaysians thousands demonstrate streets and mosques and be meet tear gas and water cannon. many people be beat and hundreds be detained, although most be later released. With emergence this still-tentative opposition movement, fear express one western diplomat be downward spiral which suppression breed more discontent breeds more suppression breeds more discontent. People here whisper that Mahathir's days may now be numbered. But few venture guess what number might be. Given his control lever power and lack focus or leadership opposition, Mahathir could ride out storm Anwar's trial proceeds. But he have strike harsh blow morale his nation, sense confidence he have work so hard build slogan Malaysia Can! In this generally decorous nation, depth anger express two men who once call each other father and son be disturb hear. Anwar, say prime minister, be despicable and sodomist. Mahathir, say his former deputy, be senile and insane. Malaysians, who have stolidly accept Mahathir's authoritarian rule mixture gratitude and emerge pride, seem stunned. Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad say Friday he be not too choosy who will be his successor. The man need not necessarily be very religious and only preoccupy do virtuous deeds all times, national news agency, Bernama, quote Mahathir say Friday prayers Al-Falah Mosque northern town Jitra Kedah state. It be sufficient that person do things acceptable people, Mahathir said. So far Mahathir, 72, have designate three heirs-apparent his 17-year rule. One resigned. Another challenge Mahathir leadership ruling party, and lost. On Sept. 2, he fire last one, Anwar Ibrahim, call him morally unfit office. Anwar mount nationwide campaign prime minister be detain national security risk and charge illegal homosexual acts and corruption connection those allegations. Mahathir tell reporters later that Anwar have be work topple him prime minister and president govern coalition's dominant party, United Malays National Organization. He appear very good me he be actually plan ways bring me down. At first, I not believe when people tell me this, I now know this be true, say Mahathir. Mahathir say Anwar have arrange his supporters contest and gain control UMNO divisions so that he could win party's top post next year's party elections. Indonesian President B.J. Habibie find attend summit asia-pacific leaders difficult because his concerns arrest Malaysia's former deputy prime minister, Thai newspaper report Sunday. asia-pacific leaders be schedule meet next month Malaysia annual economics meeting. last week, Philippine President Joseph Estrada say he be not go asia-pacific Economic Cooperation forum because Anwar Ibrahim's arrest. I'm very concern how my friend Anwar Ibrahim have be treated, Habibie be quote say english-language newspaper The Nation. I'm concern because people should not forget that Anwar Ibrahim have contribute lot benefit his country. Anwar be charismatic politician who be once pick be successor Malaysia's long-serving Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad. But he be suddenly fired Mahathir Sept. 2 two differed economic policy. He then begin speak out Mahathir and be arrest Sept. 20. Anwar have be accuse engage homosexual acts illegal Malaysia law, charges be generally see pretext his political persecution. In court appearance last week, Anwar's face be bruise and he say he have be beat police, heighten international attention his case. Because human rights involve and I think it be universal people should be give chance defend themselves, Habibie be quote say interview conduct Saturday. People should not be tortured. Habibie say Anwar's dismissal should not have be base things which have not be proven. On attend APEC meeting, he said, It's difficult me. But he say he would consult parliament, adding, I'm not come personally president 211 million people Indonesia.

Sources speak condition anonymity say Holbrooke arrive Belgrade late Monday afternoon and be expect meet Milosevic evening. BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) U.S. special envoy Richard Holbrooke say Monday military situation Kosovo be bad now two weeks ago.

Clark, Holbrooke say while level fight (in Kosovo) may have abate temporarily, capacity its resumption be there. The situation therefore remain fully serious today it be week or two ago, he tell reporters fly Belgrade. He plan meet Kosovan Albanian leaders Tuesday. We hope make clear president Milosevic and people Yugoslavia extreme gravity situation, he said. Under NATO threat end his punish offensive ethnic albanian separatists Kosovo, President Slobodan Milosevic Yugoslavia have order most units his army back their barracks and may well avoid attack alliance, military observers and diplomats say. Milosevic, who one hand be excoriate Washington scourge Kosovo other hand be treat key peace Bosnia, act european Union, NATO and United Nations prepare review Monday possible military intervention. Russia step its warnings such action and dispatch its foreign and defense ministers unusually high-level mission see Yugoslav president Sunday Belgrade. As he have so often, Milosevic appear have bow foreign demands nick time and still accomplish what he wanted. This weekend, foreign diplomatic observers Kosovo report that military stand-down have take place province, where Milosevic's forces have wag fierce offensive albanian rebels. The observers say that segments three brigades, most units yugoslav army be home. The daily reports observer mission, make u.s., european Union and russian military experts, be one key elements help Washington and european capitals decide whether Milosevic have meet their demands cease-fire. By put army back its barracks, send some police units out Kosovo and order end burning and loot villages, Milosevic may well avoid NATO attack, diplomats here and Washington said. But same time, they acknowledge that while NATO look other way, he enjoy three-month license overwhelm Kosovo Liberation Army rebel army fight independence Kosovo and its ethnic albanian majority and terrorize rural civilian population that support it. His military operation create more 250,000 refugees, whom Clinton administration be gear take care this winter variety relief organizations. U.S. officials say they expect Richard Holbrooke, U.S. envoy who deal Milosevic negotiate end war Bosnia, meet him Monday discuss political plan Kosovo. The heart disagreement Kosovo be Serbia, Yugoslavia's principal republic, which insist keep Kosovo province, and ethnic Albanians there who have chafe Milosevic's repression he strip province virtual autonomy 1989, and who now seek independence. The West, fear precedent that independence Kosovo would set other conflicts world, have be try mediate middle course. In essence, diplomats say they believe that plan Holbrooke will present Milosevic call three-year interim period lead status fairly close pre-1989 autonomy arrangement. Since Kosovo conflict flare March, critics Washington's policy Milosevic argue that he have be able choreograph every move suit his goal: push albanian population submission impunity. The United States and its allies have wait four months while he clean clock Kosovo Liberation Army, say Morton Abramowitz, head International Crisis Group, policy analysis organization, and take three weeks discuss military action, result that 500 albanian villages be destroyed. Administration officials now acknowledge that when NATO fail live its early threat June strike Serbia, Milosevic take advantage indecision and plunge ahead artillery and tank offensive lightly arm guerrilla forces, whose bedrock popular support have help win them effective control large swaths Kosovo territory, include key roads. While he be do that, Milosevic skillfully manage key requirement Washington: he make sure that war not spill neighbor Albania and Macedonia, fragile countries traditionally volatile area. All along, big fear Washington have be that Kosovo conflict would engulf neighboring countries and encourage Albania and ethnic albanian population Macedonia join cause. such possibility raise specter new Balkans conflict just three years peace be secure Bosnia. Milosevic cater Washington's concern that conflict be contained. The Yugoslav army mine Kosovo's borders Macedonia and Albania, ensure that few refugees could escape and limit routes arms supplies rebels. The Yugoslav leader also understand that Washington be unsure how deal disorganized Albanian political leadership Kosovo and unbending Kosovo Liberation Army, whose main chiefs be harden emigres return Switzerland and Germany. For example, Holbrooke persuade Milosevic meet May Ibrahim Rugova, top Albanian political leader Kosovo, encounter that turn out be little more photo opportunity. For that procedural breakthrough, Holbrooke recommend lifting ban foreign investment Serbia that have be put place month before. After meet Rugova, Milosevic step his military operations Kosovo, force Washington reverse itself again and carry out investment ban. In late June, Holbrooke meet two self-styled Kosovo guerrilla commanders province's western town Junik then break all contact. Clinton administration officials say time that they be concern that NATO intervention would bolster separatist forces. To try put best face situation, Washington work Moscow get Milosevic accept presence international monitors who would patrol Kosovo and report military action. The monitors be slow get organized. By August, when Yugoslav army, back serbian special police, be full swing rebels and burning and looting villages process, monitors find it difficult gain access fighting. They drive roadblocks, know something be go sounds and smoke, could not be precise. In recent days tanks and artillery have withdrawn, access have improved, monitors say. But there be some areas central Kosovo Likovac and Gornje Obrinje that monitors have rule limits because land mines roads. The mines be believe have be plant guerrillas. Gornje Obrinje be site massacre 18 ethnic albanian women, children and elderly people Sept. 26. A british reporter who walk fields village Sunday say 10 mortar shells, apparently serbian police or Yugoslav army, be fire village early Sunday afternoon. The Yugoslav army and police forces have be responsible vast majority atrocities Kosovo conflict, say report New york-based group Human Rights Watch, release here Sunday. The report say rebels have also violate laws war take civilian hostages and carry out summary executions. But violations guerrillas be less scale government abuses, author report, Fred Abrahams, concluded. The report focus what it call watershed conflict attack police forces three ethnic albanian villages late February and early March Drenica region central Kosovo. At least 83 people, include 24 women and children, be kill attack, which involve helicopters, artillery and armored personnel carriers. In Yugoslav capital, Belgrade, which be four-hour drive north roll countryside Kosovo's capital Pristina, Milosevic remain politically secure. That be part, his domestic critics say, because diplomats Holbrooke and head U.N.refugee agency, Sadako Ogata, insist go see him, thus enhance his stature. The American envoy Richard Holbrooke meet President Slobodan Milosevic Yugoslavia Monday night and accord american diplomats tell him that he have take further steps pull back his military Kosovo Province or face NATO attack. Milosevic be also told, diplomats said, that he have insure that roughly 250,000 ethnic albanian refugees who have be force flee their homes fight last six months be allow return home. most these refugees be reluctant return because many Serb police officers who destroy their homes and villages remain neighborhoods. After deliver his stern message so far Milosevic Kosovo conflict, Holbrooke say news conference that NATO's military plans attack Serbia be move ahead serious, intense and sustained basis. Holbrooke's mission Milosevic be describe american diplomats not do or die trip, they added, we're very serious juncture. Shortly Holbrooke's meeting Milosevic, Yugoslav leader issue defiant statement Serbian television which he say threats aggression outline Holbrooke represent criminal act. Milosevic, who rarely comments his meetings foreign diplomats and whose tough words cast unusually ominous tone, also say that Holbrooke's position constitute support albanian terrorists and not albanian people. Milosevic be apparently accuse Holbrooke support ethnic albanian guerrillas Kosovo Liberation Army, who have be fight make serbian province Kosovo independent nation. The Yugoslav leader add that more seven days there have be no skirmishes or military action. An american diplomat familiar themes Holbrooke plan stress Milosevic say there have be no expectation that american envoy would walk out Monday night agreement. Rather, point be underscore yugoslav leader and make explicit what be expect him. It be not quite ultimatum, diplomat said, more matter what step have be take show compliance. The essence Holbrooke's demand centered issues outline United Nations Security Council resolution two weeks ago. The resolution order Milosevic withdraw extra army and police forces that be send Kosovo deal guerrillas and send back their bases military forces normally station province. so far, american diplomats said, Milosevic have withdraw troops field not all them be their barracks. such move be essential, american diplomats said, create conducive atmosphere any possible negotiations future status province. The U.N. resolution also call political solution. Holbrooke and U.S. ambassador Macedonia, Christopher Hill, discuss Milosevic political document drawn State Department that call broad autonomy Kosovo. Milosevic withdraw autonomy 1989 he begin his campaign Serb nationalism. The countryside central Kosovo have be eerily silent last Thursday. The sound artillery thud and mortar rounds have be noticeably absent and coils white smoke that signify burn villages have vanish green hills and valleys. Police checkpoints be more relaxed and areas that be seal this time last week Yugoslav army be now open patrols diplomatic monitors United States, European Union and Russia. These monitors, many whom be former military officers, have report that Yugoslav army have stand and that they have see virtually no military action late last week. There have be sporadic shooting, monitors have reported. But this superficial calm be not good enough because Serb military have capacity resume fight very quickly, NATO military officer say Monday. The officer add that cease-fire Kosovo be pretty much enacted. He also say that trend compliance be positive. The interior ministry police must also reduce their presence villages so that refugees who have flee have confidence return, military officer said. Some interior ministry police officers have leave province, not enough, he added. On question how badly damage KLA have be Yugoslav army's three-month offensive, NATO officer said, It's fair assessment that KLA be dismantle not destroyed. Holbrooke's first stop Monday be Brussels, where he meet secretary-general NATO, Javier Solana. On Tuesday he plan travel Pristina, capital Kosovo, where he be schedule meet ethnic albanian leader Ibrahim Rugova present political proposal future status Kosovo. He be expect back Belgrade Tuesday afternoon another session Milosevic. The United States and Russia be ratchet pressure President Slobodan Milosevic, warn that NATO airstrikes be inevitable unless he take decisive action soon end humanitarian crisis southern serbian province. fear airstrikes, Yugoslav generals put nation's air defense high alert, try belated compromise move some tanks and other heavy equipment out Kosovo. A Western diplomat say 120 Yugoslav army armor vehicles, include tanks, have be pull out. In Brussels, Belgium, however, U.S. special envoy Richard Holbrooke tell reporters Monday that situation Kosovo be bad now two weeks ago. Holbrooke be en route Belgrade meeting Milosevic.

Albanians province outnumber Serbs 9-to-1. Despite Annan's unwillingness declare Serb noncompliance, U.S. State Department spokesman James Foley say Clinton administration believe Milosevic have not meet conditions lay U.N. Security Council. Foley cite absence formal cease-fire, failure arrange meaningful dialogue ethnic albanian leaders and continue presence major army units southeastern Kosovo Albania's border. The European Union nations be divide Monday whether launch air strikes U.N. Security Council backing. The EU foreign ministers, meeting Luxembourg, agree tighten economic sanctions milosevic, it be unlikely that strict travel curbs Yugoslav officials and freeze more Yugoslav assets abroad would be anything more symbolic. Meanwhile, Yugoslavia's prime minister tell emergency session parliament Monday that country be face imminent danger war. Yugoslavia be comprise dominant Serbia and small Montenegro. The threats be serious, Prime Minister Momir Bulatovic said. And I call this parliament conclude that Yugoslavia be face imminent danger war. Yugoslavia have defend itself if it be attacked.

Some army units remain field, and there be enormous fear that violence will resume, particularly refugees, tens thousands whom be live hills and forests shelter. ","Yugoslavia failed to comply with a U.N. resolution demanding that the forces sent to Kosovo to suppress the ethnic Albanian separatist uprising be withdrawn and is now threatened with NATO airstrikes.Though Milosevic moved some units from the Serbian province, U.S. special envoy Holbrooke called the situation serious.Russia, previously against a NATO attack, said the strikes could occur if steps aren't taken to end the crisis.Hundreds, mostly Albanian civilians, have been killed and thousands are refugees.While the U.S. and other nations want peace, they oppose Kosovo independence, fearing it could destabilize other Albanian-populated Balkan states.","Under threat of NATO attack, Milosevic orders back most army units.US envoy says situation is as grave as it was 2 weeks ago, despite temporary abatement of fighting.US and Russia increase pressure on Milosevic to end the humanitarian crisis in Kosovo or face NATO airstrikes.US envoy tells Milosevic to pull back his military and let Albanian refugees return home.Yugoslavia claims it is taking steps to comply with peace demands.However, NATO says that UN Security Council conditions have not yet been met.US envoy gives Milosevic last minute warning to halt ethnic crackdown in Kosovo.Milosevic calls NATO threat criminal act favoring guerrillas.","Yugoslav President Slbodan Milosevic does not appear to be complying completely with UN demands to withdraw his troops and stop anti-Albanian activity in Kosovo.U.S. special envoy Richard Holbrooke said the level of fighting may have abated but the situation is such that it could resume.The U.S. and Russia have ratcheted up pressure on Milosevic warning him of inevitable NATO air strikes.Yugoslavia claimed it ""is faced with the imminent danger of war"", will defend itself if attacked and called NATO's threats a ""criminal act"".Yugoslav generals put the nation's air defense on high alert then pulled some armored equipment out of Kosovo as a compromise.","On Oct. 4, 1998 Yugoslav President Milosevic ordered his forces in Kosovo back to their barracks.While supressing the Albanian independence movement they had massacred hundreds of civilians and left 275,000+ refugees.NATO threatened airstrikes unless hostilities ceased and peace talks began.U.S. envoy Holbrooke insisted that Milosevic pull all forces out of Kosovo.Milosevic called the NATO threat ""a criminal act"" and said Holbrooke aided Albanian terrorists.Russia also urged an end to hostilities, but the Yugoslavs denied any fighting and vowed to defend their country if attacked.Neither side budged as NATO seemed to wait for a U.N. decision."
17,"A north korean man arrive Seoul Wednesday and seek asylum escape his hunger-stricken homeland, government officials said. Kim Myong Sup, 23, have be live hide third country flee North Korea last year, Ministry Foreign Affairs and Trade said. The ministry generally use term third country avoid name China, which be require treaty North Korea return defectors their homeland. The ministry describe Kim former athlete, say details his background and his method escape North Korea be not available. About 200 north Koreans have defect South Korea three years, include 60 so far this year. All complain severe food and fuel shortages their country. The Koreas be divide communist North and capitalist South 1945. They fight Korean War 1950-53 and never sign formal peace treaty. Hunger and malnutrition Cambodia be reach crisis levels comparable effects famine North Korea, U.N. World Food Program representative say Tuesday. Though North Korea be suffer simple lack food, falter economy Cambodia combine weak health care and education be cause similar levels malnutrition children, say Ken Davies, WFP's country director. There be enough rice. The problem be that people be too poor access it. The problem be poverty, Davies said. The WFP be currently support 1.7 million hungry Cambodians 15 percent population food-for-work and direct assistance programs, Davies say he fear there be still plenty more that be not get enough eat every day. The problem be so bad that it be only little bad North Korea, Davies said. The situation be much bad most people recognize. accord recent WFP survey, 49 percent cambodian children age 5 be stunt lack food and 20 percent suffer acute malnutrition. By comparison, similar survey north korean children 7 find that 65 percent be stunt and 16 percent suffer acute malnutrition. Cambodia have produce rice surplus export last two years and expect another this year, WFP statistics show that 25 percent rice-growing areas account 75 percent surplus. The majority cambodian farmers be not produce enough keep their families feed and be be increasingly saddle debts incur when they run out reserves harvest, Davies said. Money-lenders rural Cambodia typically charge 100 percent interest, which must be pay rice harvest time, give many farmers handicap start next crop season. Poor sanitation, lack health care and ignorance modern child rear problems leave mostly unaddressed under-funded health and education sectors Cambodia have exacerbate food security problem, Davies said. Davies urge new government substantially increase annual expenditures health, education and rural development first step long-term solution Cambodia's food crisis. The poverty be get bad right now and situation malnutrition children be crisis, Davies said. Cambodia typically earmark half its annual budget defense and security. In 1998 budget, education be allocate 6.5 percent, health 4.4 percent and rural development 0.2 percent. Actual disbursements three ministries be only 60 70 percent budget amount annual revenues fall short expectations, accord aid workers. A 1999 budget draft propose reduction health ministry's allotment, which cause outcry September health officials and U.N. World Health Program. The draft be later readjust provide unprecedented 33 percent increase health spending. North Korea be enter its fourth winter chronic food shortages its people malnourish and risk die normally curable illnesses, senior Red Cross officials say Tuesday. The officials warn international complacency and hostility North Korea food crisis stretches and isolated communist country show little willingness adopt far-reaching changes revive its ruined economy. humanitarian suffering cannot be routine any part world, say Margareta Wahlstrom, Red Cross' undersecretary disaster relief, who return Beijing Tuesday week inspect aid agency's operations North Korea. She and other Red Cross officials saw further ravages North Korea's slow-motion famine: electricity supply only half capital, Pyongyang, time; elderly look swollen, sign long-term hunger; generation children stunted, 10-year-olds look 6-year-olds and 5-year-olds 2-year-olds. Everywhere, bakeries government ministries, people be be serve noodles and cakes make soybeans mixed acorns, grass and herbs, Red Cross president Astrid Heiberg said. Heiberg liken additives cattle food and note that doctors report rise stomach illnesses mixtures. This be really part daily life, she said. You would not give them your children or your elderly mother know she would get cramp her stomach and diarrhea unless her stomach be moaning. Three years floods and drought that start 1995 devastate North Korea's collective farming and plan economy, already teeter loss its soviet bloc trading partners. With few goods or money barter or buy foreign supplies, country lack sufficient fertilizer crops, and fuel and parts machinery. The Red Cross inspectors saw soldiers and people harvest cabbage, winter's main vegetable. The grain harvest be finish and U.N. estimate little improve last year's: 3 million tons, only enough meet two-thirds needs North Korea's 22 million people. As long, harsh winter begins, doctors confirm and official statistics show widespread malnutrition, tuberculosis rise and hunger-weakened patients unable recover operations and sickness, Heiberg said. Doctors worry that respiratory illnesses so common winter may take toll weaken population, she said. One 10-bed hospital countryside be keep only three patients time because it not have food care more, say Heiberg. The Red Cross want focus its late dlrs 9 million appeal get essential medicines and blankets and warm clothes North Korea. Food aid be largely be turn U.N. agencies. Despite catastrophic hunger home, North Korea plan send 317 athletes and officials next month's asian Games Thailand, South Korean officials say Thursday. It will be large sports delegation communist country have send abroad recent years. north korean Sports Minister Chang Ung say 209 athletes his country will compete 21 events Bangkok, hop win medals women's judo, women's soccer, wrestling, table tennis, weightlifting and boxing. Chang make remarks interview publish recently Chosun Shinbo, newspaper run pro-north korean residents Japan, say Seoul's Naewoe Press, which obtain report. Chang say North Korea be send large delegation Bangkok prepare 2000 Sydney Olympics. North Korea not enter last asian Games, Hiroshima, Japan, 1994. It send only 18 athletes and officials Winter Olympics Nagano, Japan, February. Naewoe be run South Korea's main government intelligence agency and specialize monitor communist news media. Three years floods and drought that start 1995 devastate North Korea's collective farming and plan economy, force country rely aid fee its 23 million people. famine-threatened North Korea's harvest will be no better this year last and could be worse, senior U.N. aid official say Saturday. North Korea need minimum 4.5 million 5 million tons grain fee its 23 million people, manage last year harvest just 2.8 million tons, Namanga Ngongi, deputy head World Food Program said. Although hard figures be not available, prospects this year be that harvest will not be any better, Ngongi tell reporters Beijing visit North Korea. It may be bad last year. Poor harvests, economic collapse and three years floods and drought, have produce chronic food shortages North Korea and leave it heavily reliant foreign aid. Fertilizer be lacking, be fuel power tractors and farm machinery, mean most planting and harvest must be do hand. Every year it get worse, Ngongi said. But need food aid, Ngongi say government month ago cut number counties which WFP have access 171 145, reduce number people who can get aid 6.7 million 5.8 million. Most those receive WFP aid be children age 6 months and 6 years. Ngongi say government cite security concerns notably lack peace treaty its rival South Korea its decision. The government say ban would be temporary, Ngongi added. Ngongi, who spend four days inspect WFP relief efforts North Korea, say people generally look good visit last year. But he also say he could see that large part population be very weak. everybody have be consume very low level. So they may not be severely malnourished, they be not well nourished all, he said. U.S. officials who tour some hardest-hit regions North Korea this summer say 2 million people may have die because famine. Ngongi say he saw malnourished children who be say be 10 or 11 years old, appear be only 4 or 5 years old. About 30 percent children one primary school he visit be not class. A lot children be too weak come school, he said. But Ngongi say foreign food aid have save lives. A lot people be alive today thanks international community's support, he said. A congressman who visit remote parts North Korea last week say Saturday that food and health situation there be desperate and deteriorating, and that millions North Koreans might have starve death last few years. The congressman, Tony Hall, D-Ohio, who have have longtime interest world hunger, pass Tokyo his return United States and show photograph he have take north korean children patchy hair, protrude bones, open sores and other signs severe malnutrition. Hall also bring back bag what officials call substitute food be distributed government food station: dry leaves and straw, so coarse that cattle would normally turn away. They grind it powder and make it noodles, Hall said. The noodles have no nutrition and be indigestible, leave people hold their aching stomachs, he said. North Korea have admit that it be face serious economic difficulties, there have be sharply diverge assessments how serious these are. Some visitors United Nations and other organizations have say that food situation seem be bite better now year or two ago. Hall say that divergence might have arise because north korean capital, Pyongyang, life seem be slightly better his three previous trips North Korea. But rural areas where foreigners be not allow visit, he added, overall situation be bad ever. base visits four hospitals, Hall also emphasize that public health care have decline sharply. In one hospital, assistants be hold patient while surgeons conduct stomach operation electric lights or anesthesia. Ordinary North Koreans be suffering, part, because their government's hard-line policies have alienate would-be donors and aid agencies. The United Nations have repeatedly appeal relief aid North Korea, late appeal have raise less one-third target. In September, Doctors Without Borders announce that it be pull its staff 13 North Korea because it fear that its aid be go politically connect rather most needy. North Korea do not release mortality figures or health statistics, Hall say that United Nations have gather and would soon release data indicate that 30 percent north korean children age 2 be acutely malnourish and that 67 percent all children be physically stunted. Hall say he think that overall least 1 million people have die and that total be probably closer 3 million. In indication seriousness which professional demographers view situation, U.S. Bureau Census recently publish estimates suggest that North Korea's population peak 1995 21.55 million and have fall 21.23 million this year. That would be decline 320,000 three years, period when North Korea's population would have be expect grow 925,000 people, base population growth rate early 1990s. Nicholas Eberstadt, American specialist north korean population figures, say that there simply be not enough hard information him estimate death toll famine. But he note one political tidbit: North Korea's constitution stipulate that there should be one delegate country's people's assembly every 30,000 citizens. This year's assembly not expand previous ones did, rather have just 687 delegates, same previous assembly hold 1990. While Eberstadt counsels caution, that could mean that North Korea's population, eight years which it have be expect add several million people, be now back 20.6 million people or fewer. The United States have be supply grain North Korea, strains be grow secret underground complex North that some experts worry may be heart new nuclear weapons program. The United States warn last week that agree framework that be basis its relations North Korea will be jeopardy unless north lets american experts visit underground complex and resolve their doubts. North Korea have say that it will show complex only if Washington promise that if complex be not nuclear one, it will pay vilify us and impair our prestige. Washington refuse pay, and North Korea be warn that standoff could lead agreement fall apart. Their shameless and wicked demand be open infringement our sovereignty and wanton interference our internal affairs, declare North Korea's lead newspaper, Rodong Sinmun. More five years severe food shortages and near-total breakdown public health system have lead devastating malnutrition North Korea and probably leave entire generation children physically and mentally impaired, new study international aid groups have found. The study, first scientific nutritional survey North Korea, confirm disturb reports international aid workers, who year have gain increase access population this highly isolated and secretive country. Among other shock findings, researchers World Food Program, Unicef and European Union find that, because long-term food shortages, stagger 62 percent children 7 years old suffer stunt growth. They have discover that, huge international food aid program three years, severe malnutrition be widespread toddlers crucial stages brain development, suggest that this generation's physical and mental abilities will not develop normally and that losses can never be recovered. Separately, international medical workers groups Red Cross, have begin document how effects food shortages be be severely compound breakdown public health services. even basic water purification systems stand idle lack essential ingredients chlorine, Red Cross workers say, leave vast numbers people such severe diarrhea that they be unable absorb completely what little food they have. As north korean dictatorship have slowly, grudgingly, grant increased access international aid groups last six months, increasingly clear and saddening picture hunger haas emerge result large formal study and informal surveys and observations foreign aid agencies. Past assessments magnitude disaster country 23 million be consider flaw because they be base interviews small number north korean refugees who have flee China. And while researchers and aid workers grind North Korea have not see evidence cannibalism or starve children die roadside descriptions that have surface more lurid refugee reports what they find be many ways equally disturbing: A population wither nearly decade chronic hunger, people so weakened malnutrition that colds and stomach flus quickly turn lethal, future generation irretrievably lost. now last we have hard facts situation be very grave, say Judith Cheng-Hopkins, regional director Asia World Food Program, which have take part research. To me this be famine slow motion. People cope year year, and probably lot drop off. But totality be very hard gauge. For three weeks this fall, crews lead foreign scientists be finally permit fan out North Korea conduct first random sample nutritional survey children, provide far most solid data crisis. They find that 62 percent children 7 have stunt growth, symptom long-term malnutrition. Thirty percent 1-year-olds suffer moderate severe malnutrition. This mean high likelihood impair mental and physical development, because nervous system mature dramatically this essential first year. The researchers say that available scientific data suggest that 10 years ago, malnutrition be rare North Korea. even if situation improves, it be unlikely improve degree that country will fully recover what we saw, say Judit Katona-Apte, senior program adviser World Food Program. People will be small and not well developed otherwise and somewhat limit their mental capacities. Likewise, when Red Cross representatives this year test water supply 840 hospitals and clinics where they operate, they find that not one have water that be suitable human consumption, say Sten Swedlund, head Red Cross delegation North Korea. But course they drink it they have no choice, he say recent trip Beijing. There be very close relationship problems cause lack food and health sector that's very bad shape. Virtually all children 7 who be malnourish also have diarrhea, he said. None aid groups have be able study issue hunger-related deaths, and North Koreans have not release relevant figures, although most experts agree that probably more one million and perhaps many three million have die prematurely food shortages began. But public health experts say number who have perish might be difficult tally any case, because most deaths be probably not quick starvation, immune systems weaken years hunger, so that common colds more easily give way lethal pneumonia and ordinary bout infectious diarrhea prove fatal. Still, there be some disturb clues: In one limited study conduct World Food Program and other groups last year 4,000 children hand-picked government, 10 percent have parent who be dead. In this fall's independent nutritional survey, 18 teams experts send eight North Korea's nine provinces look 1,800 rural and urban children seven. In addition finding that 62 percent children have stunt growth, teams find that 16 percent children be suffer acute malnutrition and be underweight their height, sign that they be severely underfed time study. That figure be high any country East Asia and put North Korea world's bad 10 countries terms malnutrition. While that 16 percent figure be not quite bad that India and Bangladesh, worst world 18 percent malnutrition rate, experts say that North Korea's number some ways understates problem. In India and Bangladesh, pockets severe poverty alternate pockets relative plenty, while North Korea whole country be some degree underfed. even war-torn countries, famine be more pockets, Dr. Katona-Apte said. It's hard think another country that's be affect this way. The survey results be especially sober researchers study only children 7, group that receive nearly all food donate abroad. After three years food donations, many foreign aid workers country have remark that children nurseries and kindergartens be look better that their old siblings be failing. So month ago, World Food Program begin provide elementary schools high nutrition biscuits children age 7 12. We have reason believe that many people be suffer and that elderly be neglect age group that be just get weak and weaker, Swedlund said. There be now more 100 Westerners live Pyongyang, capital city, and many say long-term hunger be readily apparent there. If you walk street Pyongyang and ask child how old she is, you be three years, Swedlund said. She may be 7 she look just 3 or 4. Dr. Katona-Apte, nutrition expert who have work Bangladesh and Sudan, say she be shock when she first visit north Korean kindergarten last year. There be these two children sit desk who be obviously severely malnourish they be so thin and they have patchy hair, she said. And they be just sit there working. This be accept normal! They be school, and they should really be hospitalize or place nutritional rehabilitation. If you saw them refugee camp, you would recommend immediate intervention. But severely depleted public health and hospital system, that option do not exist, she and said. many korean doctors do not know how diagnose or treat malnutrition; few have see it this decade. And, any case, hospitals lack food and proper nutritional supplements. Swedlund say most hospitals lack medicines, have no glass replace broken windows and be cold out, have receive no coal 1994. He say that hospitals, sanitation and water purification systems be virtually nonexistent, because country lack chlorine purification and fuel run water pumps. He say that next year, Red Cross would start address those problems, spending $3.5 food hospital patients and $1 million water treatment. With few other options, vast numbers north Koreans have resort eat substitute food, hard cakes and noodles make mix nutritional plants, soybeans and sweet potatoes, combine indigestible filler, cornstalks and straw. This now constitute 40 percent food intake, Swedlund said. It's become regular part food basket. Doctors North Korea say many people suffer stomachaches eat this partly indigestible material, he said, added, If you're very hungry, it fill your stomach. Although north Koreans date their food problems series floods and droughts mid-1990's, foreign researchers who have work North Korea say medical records and childhood growth patterns indicate that hunger begin several years that and be link collapse Soviet Union, which have long be North Korea's main supplier food, fuel and fertilizer. North Korea be mountainous country, less 20 percent arable land. It have be food importer decades, mostly former Soviet Union, also China. The country have come grips fact that this be part structural problem and can't just be blame weather anymore, Ms. Cheng-Hopkins said. Still, she and praise normally rigid and secretive government slowly loosen its restrictions. Swedlund say that three years country, international Red Cross, which collaborate north korean Red Cross, have find officials increasingly responsive and doctors more willing share medical records and bring problems. Travel be still restricted. There be more 100 counties, home 30 percent population, which aid groups have no access and where they have therefore refuse provide food or medical supplies. Still, number counties open workers have increase steadily, and freedom move have improved. Ms. Cheng-Hopkins say half follow-up inspections be now unannounced, and she note that researchers nutritional survey be allow select villages visit and enter homes random. Workers Red Cross and World Food Program say they have not observe extreme scenes people die acute starvation and believe that they would have if they be occur frequently. I have not see acute starvation I have see Bangladesh, Dr. Katona-Apte said. But that doesn't mean it can't exist. We're still really limited what we can see. Swedlund say it be unlikely that counties still close foreigners be markedly different open ones. And while some have surmise that close counties might harbor pockets death and devastation, he say he accept North Korea's explanation that they have be exclude some areas national security reasons.

24,"This be what Newt Gingrich be suppose do well. The planning. The strategy. The big picture. The vision. His vision bring GOP majority Congress 1994 and make him first Republican House Speaker 40 years. But his admission, Gingrich's vision seem have blur this time around, cost Republicans net five seats Tuesday's election and leave party's narrow govern majority narrower. The disappointing election results also leave Gingrich open fractious challenge his post speaker. Members and aides say Wednesday that fury speaker have bubble overnight and that some members be try organize slate candidates replace Gingrich and his leadership team when House Republicans convene Nov. 18 select their leaders next year. As Rep. Mark Sanford, R-S.C., put it, When company's stock price go down, it's CEO who get fired. top Republican aides, speak anonymously, be blunter. People be very angry last night, one aide said. Today it's mixture seethe and dismay. It's just ugly. And Newt know it. His career be line. Another aide said, most people be really angry Newt, and no one know what do it. But some be dip their toe water and see what temperature is. A possible slate could contain names Reps. Robert L. Livingston Louisiana replace Gingrich, Steve Largent Oklahoma replace Dick Armey Texas majority leader, and Jennifer Dunn Washington replace John A. Boehner Ohio conference chairman. Rep. David M. McIntosh Indiana be also say be run speaker, it be not clear whether he would be part any slate. Rep. Tom DeLay Texas, majority whip, be say be secure. Armey bluntly acknowledge scramble go wings oust leadership. Told Nightline that there be Republicans his head, Armey replied: They're welcome it if they're big enough take it. Publicly, Gingrich have express confidence keep his job speaker. But he have be grim-faced last 24 hours and closet himself Wednesday his top strategists make calls shore his support members. He look victim accident, say Rep. Peter King, R-N.Y., who support Gingrich. He's very somber tone. The question, it always be Gingrich, be how many members be prepared rebel his leadership. In past, no more couple dozen members have openly express their dissatisfaction him, and coup attempt last year fizzle lack support. I'm hop more people will understand need serious reassessment this year, say Rep. Charles T. Canady, R-Fla., who say he have hop challenge speaker 1996 elections, when Republicans also lose seats. The reality be this: Our majority keep shrinking, Canady said. If it shrink any more, it will be gone. But Gingrich have build support moderates, and some perceived election repudiation conservatives. Rep. Sherwood L. Boehlert, R-Utah, say results show that this be right direction party. To maintain our majority, we've get moderate some our views, Boehlert said. Thomas Mann, Congressional scholar Brookings Institution, say that moderates support Gingrich part because no appeal alternative have emerged. They know he see broad world and be prepared moderate if it make sense, Mann said. Newt's go out his way support moderates. He's nurture relationship them. But Mann and say that anger have be build Gingrich several reasons, include his signing budget deal last month that seem capitulate President Clinton, not offer clear legislative agenda Republicans and not communicate clear political message. We be most defined who we hate say Rep. Mark Souder, R-Ind. But voters be more sophisticated that, and Republicans good have something say where we're going. The anger grow last few days when speaker approve $10-million anti-clinton advertising campaign that allow Democrats turn election referendum Gingrich, who have never be nearly popular public Clinton have been. As if only slowly absorbing implications loss, speaker seem unable news conference here Wednesday morning pinpoint why party suffer net drop five seats House. As late Tuesday afternoon, he be predict net pickup 10 and 30. Until we look it better, I frankly don't understand all things that happen yesterday, he said, and I'm not sure anybody else country do either. But he say Republicans should have maniacally focus basic message cut taxes, save Social Security and prevent drug abuse, and campaign aggressively those themes. He contrast lack focus this year Contract With America that prove so successful 1994. People think we stand something pretty big, he said. But Gingrich also seem aware mount concern his leadership, repeatedly cast election results victory his leadership team because Republicans have stay majority three elections row first time 70 years. He also suggest that those who would challenge him have little support. The people who normally be quote this be people who would fact take party narrow base, Gingrich said, refer periodic eruptions concern conservatives his leadership. I'd see who it be that have plan that they be confident last 60 days would have be more successful and why they didn't share it. An intense struggle control House be underway, Rep. Bob Livingston conduct telephone campaign replace Rep. Newt Gingrich speaker and Gingrich fight counter-campaign that have give some members pause oust him. At same time, small band Republicans vow Thursday that they would not vote re-elect Gingrich any circumstances, move that, because Republicans' shrink House majority, could tie party knots months because it could throw speakership Democrat. Rep. Matt Salmon, R-Ariz., said: I personally have make decision that I cannot vote Newt Gingrich speaker January, and there be six who have tell me they feel same way, seven people who just will not, and it take six deadlock vote. Fury speaker have boil Tuesday's elections, when Republicans suffer net loss five seats house. They blame Gingrich, party's chief strategist. But many be already angry him what they say be his failure articulate clear message party go elections and messy budget process that give President Clinton political edge and contradicted Republican principles fiscal conservativism contain massive amounts pork spending. House Republicans be meet Nov. 18 vote secret ballot their leaders. Whoever win party's nomination speaker then stand election full House January. even if Gingrich win secret ballot, he could be deny re-election speaker January if Salmon and least five refuse vote him. Because Republicans now control House only 12 seats, it would take just six votes Gingrich deny him majority and allow Democrats potentially elect one their speaker. With such chaotic and unacceptable prospect looming, Livingston tell Gingrich that he should step aside good party, accord Republican officials. The officials say that Livingston speak Gingrich shortly disastrous election returns also election, reflect Livingston's early displeasure speaker budget process. Several Republicans say that Livingston, chairman Appropriations Committee and one few members stature stand speaker, and Gingrich be work phones Thursday struggle votes. Livingston have say nothing publicly challenge Gingrich, several members and aides say Thursday that he would announce his intentions, possibly soon Friday, he have determine if he could win. He won't do it 'til he have his ducks row, and right now lot people be still loyal speaker, say aide Republican who, many others, be try straddle line fealty speaker who may retain power and encouragement challenger who offer salve embattle party. Stunned democratic resurgence mid-term elections, congressional Republicans tear each other Wednesday who be blame their failure make traditional opposition party gains off-year election. The soul-searching and recriminations and possibility congressional leadership challenges come election results show that Republicans have be unable increase their 55-45 hold Senate and that Democrats have pick five seats house. The democratic surge mark first time 1934 that president's party have gain seats midterm election, and it whittle Republican House majority mere six votes. The democratic victories be more remarkable political year mark months-long scandal President Clinton's affair Monica Lewinsky. The Republicans' new 223-211 majority (assuming Democrat lead Oregon hold win), one independent, amount small congressional majority Republican-controlled Congress 1953, last time Republicans control House they capture it again 1994. With attention now shift House Judiciary Committee and its impeachment inquiry, Rep. Henry Hyde tell fellow Republicans panel conference call Wednesday that only witness Republicans be likely call would be independent counsel, Kenneth Starr. Hyde, chairman, tell lawmakers he hop have committee vote possible articles impeachment Thanksgiving, act that would take issue out his hands and put it Gingrich's. Committee Democrats decline comment Wednesday they could discuss Hyde's plan themselves. Trying put best face results, Speaker Newt Gingrich say Marietta, Ga., that Republicans still hold House three elections row first time election 1932. But furious rank and file Republicans burn phone lines each other, discuss whether mount leadership challenge chambers next few weeks. We've get reach out and have more southern white males run Washington Republican Party, say Rep. Joe Scarborough, conservative Florida. He say that Republicans this year have be leave any accomplishments run on. We need agenda first all, he said. We go entire calendar year agenda. Rep. Chris Shays, moderate Connecticut call election devastating loss and say simply, There be go be major changes our leadership. All segments our party want see change. At White House, Clinton call election results vindication his party's policies. If you look all results, he said, they be clear and unambiguous. The american people want their business, their concerns, their children, their families, their future address here. That's what messag e election was. One first difficult questions now face Congress be how proceed impeachment inquiry face public resistance remove Clinton office, and republican majority now so slim that it be almost certain that 218 votes require impeachment cannot be assembled. In public statement release Wednesday, Hyde say The Committee continue have clear constituional duty complete its work fair and expeditious manner. Our duty have not change becasue constitution have not changed. But Sen. Robert Torricelli, D-N.J., say election results guarantee that impeachment will fail. I think any serious effort remove President Clinton office be effectively over, he said. It be simply Newt Gingrich and Trent Lott decide exit strategy. From other side aisle, Rep. Rick Lazio, Long Island Republican, said, The inquiry should be wrap expeditiously, fairly and it ought be resolve immediate future. For year, Republicans struggle keep control House 228-207 majority and find consensus their party's compete factions. With their numbers reduced, republican leadership will need carry out tortuous balance act unite hard-core conservative faction that want more aggressive social agenda bloc moderates who want their party return center. Any small Republican faction will now have enormous leverage. The new arithmetic House may lead Democrats' and moderate Republicans' forming ad hoc majorities issues, take control away Republican leaders. Already see some possibilities, Rep. Peter King Long Island, N.Y., say northeastern Republicans would be strengthened. It give us much more leverage leadership and make it easy protect New York, he said. It's go weaken position strident conservatives and anti-northeast conservatives. Just two weeks ago, Gingrich have foreseen election gains range 10 seats more 40. Seeming uncharacteristically uncertain Wednesday, he say he have trouble accounting results. Things be happen out there that none us fully understand--neither party my judgment, he said. take his share blame his party's losses, Georgia Republican say he have misjudge how public would recoil Clinton scandal amplify modern media world and how scandal would drown out other Republican themes. I mean I totally underestimate degree which people would just get sick 24-hour-a day talk television and talk radio and then degree which this whole scandal become just sort disgust sheer repetition, he said. And result I think we probably underestimate need really aggressively push much strong message cutting taxes and save Social Security, win war drugs, reform education and national defense. Majority Leader Sen. Trent Lott Mississippi also admit mistakes, say his party have not present clear enough message final 96 hours campaign. He also concede that Congress' final scramble pas $500 billion budget bill hurt his party. One this lessons Republicans out this be that we need listen more carefully people and we need have clear understanding and concise message that we do apply nation, he say Washington. Both Lott and Gingrich say Republicans would put emphasis next year tax-cutting and shore Social Security system. even two leaders spoke, their angry rank-and-file lawmakers be make phone calls try assess whether mount challenges republican leaders who have steer Congress Republican's assume control four years ago. One senior Republican staffer say House have become tinderbox intrigue. Scarborough said, The long distance charges Washington offices probably be go roof today. Everybody's call everybody. everybody recognize that something's terribly wrong direction Washington Republicans when republican governors be do so well New York, Massachusetts, Florida and Texas. And while Gingrich have not go out his way identify himself republican campaign's last-minute ad blitz attack President Clinton, his caucus know he be responsible. Gingrich have face uprising before, foil coup attempt him disgruntle conservatives and some his leadership team summer 1997. Any move remove him remain long-shot. But House leadership elections now set mid-november, Republicans say this time dissatisfaction their caucus have cross ideological lines moderates Shays well. We get shellacked, say Rep. Christopher Cannon, conserative Utah. We beat ourselves because we have no agenda. Republicans be discuss possible challenges Gingrich, his second-in-command, Rep. Dick Armey, and other members senior leadership team. Some be envision try run entire new ticket head Rep. Bob Livingston, Appropriations Committee chairman Louisiana and include Rep. Steve Largent, Oklahoma conservative. ask whether Tuesday's election results could cost him speakership, Gingrich said, I'm not particularly concerned. Republicans close him say they expect anger dissipate. In Senate, where leadership races take place early December, some Republicans be talk mount challenges mid-level leadership figures. several senators express particular pique re-election chairman, Senator Mitch McConnell Kentucky, who pour party dollars and much his time try defeat democratic champion campaign finance overhaul, Russell Feingold Wisconsin. Feingold win close race. Some lawmakers Wednesday approach Sen. Chuck Hagel Nebraska see if he would replace McConnell. Hagel confirm he have talk more eight senators, and be whether challenge McConnell. Hagel lambast republican leadership election outcome. This be big loss us, he said. We squander very historic opportunity last night. To just break be loss. most incumbents coast victory Tuesday night. But some will not be returning. Five House Republicans be defeated: Vince Snowbarger Kansas, Bill Redmond New Mexico, Jon Fox Pennsylvania, Mike Pappas New Jersey, and Rick White Washington. One Democrat also lose his re-election bid Rep. Jay Johnson Wisconsin. The new House members include 17 Republicans and least 22 Democrats. David Wu, Democrat be lead molly Bordonaro, Republican race one House seat Oregon, final victory announcement be not expect Friday absentee ballots be counted. Unlike self-proclaimed revolutionaries Republican class 1994, many newly elect members be career politicians who rise ranks local and state government. Three Democrats be sons former lawmakers, Mark Udall Colorado, son Morris Udall who represent Arizona; Tom Udall New Mexico, son other Udall brother, Stewart, former Congressman and Secretary Interior, and Charlie Gonzalez, who o win Texas seat his father, Henry.

Things be happen out there that none us fully understand--neither party my judgment, he said. take his share blame his party's losses, Georgia Republican say he have misjudge how public would recoil Clinton scandal amplify modern media world and how scandal would drown out other Republican themes. I mean I totally underestimate degree which people would just get sick 24-hour-a day talk television and talk radio and then degree which this whole scandal become just sort disgust sheer repetition, he said. And result I think we probably underestimate need really aggressively push much strong message cutting taxes and save Social Security, win war drugs, reform education and national defense. Majority Leader Sen. Trent Lott Mississippi also admit mistakes, say his party have not present clear enough message final 96 hours campaign. He also concede that Congress' final scramble pas $500 billion budget bill hurt his party. One this lessons Republicans out this be that we need listen more carefully people and we need have clear understanding and concise message that we do apply nation, he say Washington. Both Lott and Gingrich say Republicans would put emphasis next year tax-cutting and shore Social Security system. even two leaders spoke, their angry rank-and-file lawmakers be make phone calls try assess whether mount challenges republican leaders who have steer Congress Republican's assume control four years ago. One senior Republican staffer say House have become tinderbox intrigue. Scarborough said, The long distance charges Washington offices probably be go roof today. Everybody's call everybody. everybody recognize that something's terribly wrong direction Washington Republicans when republican governors be do so well New York, Massachusetts, Florida and Texas. And while Gingrich have not go out his way identify himself republican campaign's last-minute ad blitz attack President Clinton, his caucus know he be responsible. Gingrich have face uprising before, foil coup attempt him disgruntle conservatives and some his leadership team summer 1997. Any move remove him remain long-shot. But House leadership elections now set mid-november, Republicans say this time dissatisfaction their caucus have cross ideological lines moderates Shays well. We get shellacked, say Rep. Christopher Cannon, conservative Utah. We beat ourselves because we have no agenda. Republicans be discuss possible challenges Gingrich, his second-in-command, Rep. Dick Armey, and other members senior leadership team. Some be envision try run entire new ticket head Rep. Bob Livingston, Appropriations Committee chairman Louisiana and include Rep. Steve Largent, Oklahoma conservative. ask whether Tuesday's election results could cost him speakership, Gingrich said, I'm not particularly concerned. Republicans close him say they expect anger dissipate. In Senate, where leadership races take place early December, some Republicans be talk mount challenges mid-level leadership figures. several senators express particular pique re-election chairman, Senator Mitch McConnell Kentucky, who pour party dollars and much his time try defeat democratic champion campaign finance overhaul, Russell Feingold Wisconsin. Feingold win close race. Some lawmakers Wednesday approach Sen. Chuck Hagel Nebraska see if he would replace McConnell. Hagel confirm he have talk more eight senators, and be whether challenge McConnell. Hagel lambast republican leadership election outcome. This be big loss us, he said. We squander very historic opportunity last night. To just break be loss. most incumbents coast victory Tuesday night. But some will not be returning. Five House Republicans be defeated: Vince Snowbarger Kansas, Bill Redmond New Mexico, Jon Fox Pennsylvania, Mike Pappas New Jersey, and Rick White Washington. One Democrat also lose his re-election bid Rep. Jay Johnson Wisconsin. The new House members include 17 Republicans and least 22 Democrats. David Wu, Democrat be lead molly Bordonaro, Republican race one House seat Oregon, final victory announcement be not expect Friday absentee ballots be counted. Unlike self-proclaimed revolutionaries Republican class 1994, many newly elect members be career politicians who rise ranks local and state government. Three Democrats be sons former lawmakers, Mark Udall Colorado, son Morris Udall who represent Arizona; Tom Udall New Mexico, son other Udall brother, Stewart, former congressman and secretary Interior, and Charlie Gonzalez, who win Texas seat his father, Henry. A week White House and congressional Democrats disavow his war Speaker Newt Gingrich, James Carville, President Clinton's former campaign strategist and chief defender, put forth new battle cry Wednesday: He will not be muzzled. not only that, Carville go his customary denunciations Gingrich and Republicans and, interview, train his fire leaders his party not be sufficiently aggressive four weeks Election Day. My sense frustration be that I believe Democrats have much good chance do much good anyone expects, Carville said. And I don't think anyone's emerge try pull it together. everybody ought be pushing, leadership Congress, White House, DNC. We ought hammer Gingrich every day. How can you take Congress back if you don't make case people who be run it? I have never hear strategy that. Sounding increasingly agitated, he go on: The only people leave be activate this election be Democrats. The right wing, they're bounce walls. They're go out vote. Rep. Dick Gephardt, minority leader, complain Erskine Bowles, White House chief staff, Carville appear NBC News program Meet Press Sept. 27 and declared, Cpl. Cue Ball Carville will be rolling battle Newt Gingrich. The concern House Democrats, one express some White House officials well, be that Carville's vitriol would make Democrats appear overly partisan and could be especially damaging Democrats marginal districts who do not want appear too easy president. But Wednesday, Carville be anything timid. If gephardt people think they've quiet me down, he said, I'm not quieted. Carville say he tell officials White House, Don't waste your breath call me and tell me not say this. Carville insist that he would rather do battle Republicans his fellow Democrats. If they want fight me, they can, he said. I'm go fight Republicans. Yet he could not help ridicule his party. ask describe Democrats' strategy election, Carville said, If there be one, no one's share it me. just four years ago, it be good bet that Newt Gingrich would be pivotal figure U.S. politics turn millennium. seemingly overnight he have take moribund minority party and turn it pumped-up, issue-driven House majority. With promise balance budget, end welfare and represent more conservative social values, he appear have rearrange political map Congress just Ronald Reagan have do presidency. But Gingrich's leadership be now so shaky that if he maintain his hold speaker's office, he be danger marginalization. A change this dramatic suggest something far more profound miscalculation election tactics. What look one major realignments U.S. political history might turn out have be nothing temporary shift. The Gingrich revolution be fuel anger, revolt white working-class Americans what they perceive democratic bias favor blacks and other minorities, and middle-class rejection politics big government and big deficits. They be same resentments that Ronald Reagan have exploit so successfully. But old political habits and moribund Republican leadership allow Democrats retain control Congress throughout 1980s, and turn Reagan's economic program undisciplined tax-cutting spree that create prosperity huge budget gaps. Gingrich's attention-grabbing rhetoric, energy and talent political organization finally take Reagan's formula success congressional elections 1994. But once power, he run head Bill Clinton, whose political instincts be better. The president co-opted parts contract With America, particularly balance budget and welfare reform. He adapt Republican social message call things school uniforms and television rating systems, which symbolize more responsibility and parental control support government intrusion private lives. The Republican right's genuine contempt Clinton be base part well-known flaws president's character. But it be mainly reaction ease which he have divert what be suppose be flood tide their revolution. They expect that genuine successes Gingrich's first year office would lead still large victories minimal government and taxes, unfettered free enterprise and return conservative Christian values. But public be happy be lead another direction, and focus concerns age baby boomers health care and Social Security. The government that be see enemy when issues be budgetary once again look potential ally. Back 1994, parties be so stunned sudden change their congressional fortunes that they may have overestimate what it all meant. In particular they may not have realize how quickly good economic times, drop crime and national welfare reform could blunt power race U.S. politics. The Democrats have become literally minority party white voters resentfully identify their policies cities, blacks and immigrants. But last week union workers and Catholics return democratic fold. Without race wedge issue, solid black democratic vote become powerful advantage key states. Blacks, women and Latinos angry Republican anti-immigration initiatives be win coalition California, North Carolina and New York. The speaker be right say this be not election we expected. There may indeed be republican majority America, it appear resemble Republicanism Dwight Eisenhower rather Newt Gingrich pro-business, wary debt and inherent distaste bring messy social issues abortion. The Republicans who have begin talk compassionate conservatism and politics inclusion may be peddle political mush, they peddle it victory Tuesday. The congressional Republican Party's long sojourn wilderness House minority may have leave it too accustomed opposition figure out what it can be for, and too attached politics anger make sense nation mood moderation. Gingrich have suggest that his mistake be let Republicans drift politics impeachment when they should have be almost maniacally focused things tax cuts. But look maniacal be what get them trouble first place. Winning control Congress so many years be very tough Gingrich 1994. But it will be ten times tougher forge politics that do not depend rage. House Speaker Newt Gingrich, who orchestrate Republican revolution recent years and be oversee impeachment inquiry President Clinton, be drive office Friday party that swiftly turn him its unexpected losses Tuesday's midterm elections. Catching virtually everyone Capitol Hill surprise, Gingrich announce Friday night two conference call other Republicans that he would not seek re-election Speaker Nov. 18 vote and would leave Congress altogether when his term expire January. This will give us chance purge some poison that be system, Gingrich said, accord party aide who listen one calls. Gingrich's resignation be stun reversal one most combative and personally confrontational politicians America. He make his name decade ago bring one democratic speaker, Jim Wright, and continue his assaultive style Tuesday's elections last-minute commercials remind voters Clinton scandal. His reflexive pugilistic response be evident Friday night. In his second conference call, accord several people who listened, Gingrich blame House conservatives his downfall. Although it be their revolutionary zeal he harness take control Congress 1994, they have become his most bitter critics last two years his tumultuous speakership. Friday night he call them cannibals who have blackmail him quitting. Rep. Michael P. Forbes, R-N.Y., said: Newt say all those who have marginalize Republican Party have engage cannibalism. He said, `refer clips.' He's blame others. Another republican describe conference call this way: He start very statesmanlike, then you could see anger building. When someone ask him why he be leaving, he said, `a handful members have blackmail conference.' He said, `they're hateful.' And he said, `They're cannibals.' Gingrich announce his move just hours Rep. Robert L. Livingston Louisiana announce he be run speaker, put himself forward pragmatist and manager. After Gingrich calls, Rep. Bill Archer Texas announce he be his run speaker. Livingston and Archer be chairmen two most powerful committees house. In statement Gingrich said, The Republican conference needs be unified, and it be time me move forward. He say he hop his colleagues would pick successor who can reconcile and discipline, who can work together and communicate effectively. refer his wife, he tell his colleagues he be resign Congress because Marianne and I be tired. We need time get know each other again. He also acknowledge his knack bring negative attention himself and his party. If I stay, he tell his colleagues Friday night, my controversial nature would overshadow any successes we might have, understatement those who recall his suggestion two years ago that he force shutdown government because he be miff have sit back Air Force One trip President Clinton. accord another Republican who take notes, Gingrich say his resignation: There be lot bitterness amongst some members. So long I be around, I will always be target news media, which would mean we would never be able get our message out. Clinton said: Newt Gingrich have be worthy adversary leading Republican Party majority House and join me great national debate how best prepare America 21st century. Despite our profound differences, I appreciate those times we be able work together national interest, especially Speaker Gingrich's strong support America's continue leadership freedom, peace and prosperity world. many Republicans take opportunity portray Gingrich visionary. Rep. Sherwood Boehlert New York say that first conference call, there be shock and surprise and strong expressions appreciation lead us promise Land. His supporters say Gingrich have votes win election nominate speaker, which be be conduct secret ballot. But, they agreed, party's slim, six-vote majority meant every vote would be battle. Kenneth Duberstein, former official Reagan administration, said, I have no doubt he have votes be speaker, I'm not sure he have votes govern. He say that because deep rifts party, Gingrich would not have be able implement his plans. In unusually bite reaction, Rep. Dick Gephardt Missouri, Democratic leader, say he hop that Gingrich's resignation would clear fierce partisan air that he have fostered. I hope that whoever succeed Newt Gingrich speaker will immediately begin process repair damage that be work this institution last four years, Gephardt said. House Republicans predict that Gingrich's resignation would set more wide-ranging and hectic scramble replace him have be anticipated. There will be lot pretenders throne who will test waters, say Boehlert, who have support Gingrich re-election speaker. There won't be any shortage candidates. The presidential campaign 2000 begin Wednesday, it or not. The millennial election will be fought political playing field whose rough outlines, if not its exact boundaries, be draw voters Tuesday's elections, which deliver crush disappointment giddy hopes Republicans and unexpected elixir recently ail Democrats. President Clinton call it astonish triumph issues investigations and say Democrats have win so many major victories because they have clear message. Republicans agreed. Of course next 18 months will bring many surprises and many reversals fortune. But election results offer important guidelines. Tuesday be great day Vice President Al Gore, least three reasons. He work furiously and successfully last ten days ballot persuade democratic loyalists not stay home and sulk, appear behalf no few 224 candidates, accord his office. A moderate spectrum his party, he watch moderates win crucial elections, notably California gubernatorial race, where Lt. Gov. Gray Davis, cautious pragmatist Gore, win smash victory. The returns break Senate and democratic gain five House Representatives also make impeachment President Clinton less likely. And good shape Clinton be his term ends, better chance Gore, his sidekick six years now, stand presidential nomination process and, ultimately, election. But California voters also complicate nominating process and set Gore strategists work tactics uncomplicate it, because he and they consider state absolutely central his presidential aspirations. In referendum 1996, California adopt primary system which Republicans, Democrats and independent voters would all receive same ballot, candidates all parties listed. That violate rules major parties, and measure ballot Tuesday, Proposition 3, would have rescind 1996 change. But it failed, raise possibility that California's March 7 primary will be mere political popularity poll, convention delegate choose caucus or convention nightmare. Tuesday be bad day Republican right. High-profile right-wingers lose country, Attorney General Dan Lungren California governor's race Sen. Lauch Faircloth, deny re-election North Carolina, Rep. Mark Neumann Wisconsin, who fail Senate race huge spending advantage Sen. Russell Feingold, Ellen Sauerbrey Maryland, who prove unable her second try prevail unpopular democratic governor, Parris Glendening. Both conservatives and moderates party say Republicans have get back basics. even Speaker Newt Gingrich concede that results should sober every Republican and call new strategic thinking. If you make it referendum president 67 cent approval rating, they try do, you shouldn't be surprise if election go you, say Gov. Tom Ridge Pennsylvania, moderate whose promoters mention him weekly possible vice-presidential nominee. Sen. John McCain Arizona, conservative who tend steer away divisive social issues, win re-election 68 cent vote. He be study possibility presidential race, he or any other republican nominee can hope win, he say interview Wednesday, congressional Republicans and their leaders need learn some lessons. I just hope this debacle be wake-up call our people, he said. You've get be something small government, better education, something. We're see party that's everything. Polls take late this year's campaign bore McCain out. They show that Republicans be no longer identify issues that be once their electoral bread and butter, such low taxes and law and order. Tuesday be also fresh demonstration, anyone who need one, political utility pitch tent big enough almost everyone. Black politicians North Carolina, Maryland and California report that their fears indifferent black turnout have prove groundless. Black vote prove indispensable considerable number hard-pressed democratic candidates, especially where they felt their interests directly threatened. The figures Hispanic voting, assemble exit polls and candidates' precinct analyses, show dramatic differences. In California, where outgo Republican governor, Pete Wilson, have play anti-immigration card vengeance, major democratic candidates Davis and Sen. Barbara Boxer, who win re-election trail early polls clean Hispanic voters. He take 78 percent, she 72. But Bush brothers, Jeb Florida and George W. Texas, take more half hispanic vote their highly successful gubernatorial campaigns. So McCain. Jeb Bush be married hispanic woman, he and his brother speak Spanish fluently and frequently, and Senator McCain have long espouse hispanic causes. Both George W. Bush and McCain will draw strength, if they decide run, their proven ability appeal Hispanic voters, well their general electoral strength. George W. Bush take 69 percent vote Texas, where Democrat sit governor's chair only four years ago, and which have second-largest bloc electoral votes. Florida have fourth-largest. Governor Bush Texas utter rally cry moderates. A leader who be compassionate and conservative, he say his victory speech, can erase gender gap and open Republican party new face and new voices. But figures right saw things differently. James Dobson, lead religious broadcaster, say that Republicans have fare poorly because Gingrich and Sen. Trent Lott Mississippi, majority leader, have cave president budget and de-emphasized social issues such abortion and flag desecration. He call all explicitly ouster Gingrich. Likewise, millionaire publisher Steve Forbes, another probable candidate 2000, say leadership will have lot answer for. Tuesday prove potency education issue, and suggest that it will emerge major theme 2000 campaign. Clinton, his limited involvement campaign, and Gore, his extensive participation, stress democratic programs build more schools and hire more teachers. Almost quarter California voters and there be now almost twice many voters California any other state name education their most pressing concern. Elsewhere, Democrats win governorships Alabama and South Carolina odds, partly emphasize their rivals' opposition lotteries that will help pay schools. In Iowa, Democrat be elect governor first time 1969 platform that feature dilapidated condition state's schools and promise remedy it. Tuesday demonstrate override importance money modern American politics. Feingold, one principal backers campaign-finance reform, survive fight another day, so opponents reform. And returns House races, show that all six 401 members who seek re-election have won, underline once again how hard it is, present system, challenger raise enough money compete effectively. The difficulties raise money may doom many would-be presidential candidacies. Gore will have what he needs, will Bush, Forbes and former Gov. Lamar Alexander Tennessee. But how many will? Finally, Tuesday deliver indecisive message impeachment. Close two-thirds voters nationwide tell exit pollsters that they intend send no message Clinton, they make it clear response other questions that they dislike House inquiry president's allege misdeeds and want see it end. In only two states, Kansas and Nebraska, majority voters say they favor congressional censure Clinton, much milder form punishment advocate many Clinton backers. Some Republicans say privately that there should be no hearings all Clinton matter, and some Democrats begin talk deal, equivalent plea bargain that would bring matter early close. Nevertheless, Republican members House Judiciary Committee say they need press ahead Constitutional process that House have set motion. Among those take that view be Rep. Bob Barr Georgia, fierce foe president, and Rep. Mary Bono California, whose tone have be more muted. But Rep. David Dreier California, incoming Rules Committee chairman, say that election have play role ensure that one us have desire drag that out. stun democratic resurgence mid-term elections, congressional Republicans tear each other Wednesday who be blame their failure make traditional opposition party gains off-year election. The soul-searching and recriminations and possibility congressional leadership challenges come election results show that Republicans have be unable increase their 55-45 hold Senate and that Democrats have pick five seats house. The democratic surge mark first time 1934 that president's party have gain seats midterm election, and it whittle Republican House majority mere six votes. The democratic victories be more remarkable political year mark months-long scandal President Clinton's affair Monica Lewinsky. The Republicans' new 223-211 majority (assuming Democrat lead Oregon hold win), one independent, amount small congressional majority Republican-controlled Congress 1953, last time Republicans control House they capture it again 1994. With attention now shift House Judiciary Committee and its impeachment inquiry, Rep. Henry Hyde tell fellow Republicans panel conference call Wednesday that only witness Republicans be likely call would be independent counsel, Kenneth Starr. Hyde, chairman, tell lawmakers he hop have committee vote possible articles impeachment Thanksgiving, act that would take issue out his hands and put it Gingrich's. Committee Democrats decline comment Wednesday they could discuss Hyde's plan themselves. Trying put best face results, Speaker Newt Gingrich say Marietta, Ga., that Republicans still hold House three elections row first time election 1932. But furious rank and file Republicans burn phone lines each other, discuss whether mount leadership challenge chambers next few weeks. We've get reach out and have more southern white males run Washington Republican Party, say Rep. Joe Scarborough, conservative Florida. He say that Republicans this year have be leave any accomplishments run on. We need agenda first all, he said. We go entire calendar year agenda. Rep. Chris Shays, moderate Connecticut call election devastating loss and say simply, There be go be major changes our leadership. All segments our party want see change. At White House, Clinton call election results vindication his party's policies. If you look all results, he said, they be clear and unambiguous. The american people want their business, their concerns, their children, their families, their future address here. That's what message election was. One first difficult questions now face Congress be how proceed impeachment inquiry face public resistance remove Clinton office, and republican majority now so slim that it be almost certain that 218 votes require impeachment cannot be assembled. In public statement release Wednesday, Hyde say The Committee continue have clear constitutional duty complete its work fair and expeditious manner. Our duty have not change because constitution have not changed. But Sen. Robert Torricelli, D-N.J., say election results guarantee that impeachment will fail. I think any serious effort remove President Clinton office be effectively over, he said. It be simply Newt Gingrich and Trent Lott decide exit strategy. From other side aisle, Rep. Rick Lazio, Long Island Republican, said, The inquiry should be wrap expeditiously, fairly and it ought be resolve immediate future. For year, Republicans struggle keep control House 228 seats and find consensus their party's compete factions. With their numbers reduced, republican leadership will need carry out tortuous balance act unite hard-core conservative faction that want more aggressive social agenda bloc moderates who want their party return center. The Democrats hold 206 seats, and one be hold indepenndent. Any small Republican faction will now have enormous leverage. The new arithmetic House may lead Democrats' and moderate Republicans' forming ad hoc majorities issues, take control away Republican leaders. Already see some possibilities, Rep. Peter King Long Island, N.Y., say northeastern Republicans would be strengthened. It give us much more leverage leadership and make it easy protect New York, he said. It's go weaken position strident conservatives and anti-northeast conservatives. Just two weeks ago, Gingrich have foreseen election gains range 10 seats more 40. Seeming uncharacteristically uncertain Wednesday, he say he have trouble accounting results. Things be happen out there that none us fully understand--neither party my judgment, he said. take his share blame his party's losses, Georgia Republican say he have misjudge how public would recoil Clinton scandal amplify modern media world and how scandal would drown out other Republican themes. I mean I totally underestimate degree which people would just get sick 24-hour-a day talk television and talk radio and then degree which this whole scandal become just sort disgust sheer repetition, he said. And result I think we probably underestimate need really aggressively push much strong message cutting taxes and save Social Security, win war drugs, reform education and national defense. Majority Leader Sen. Trent Lott Mississippi also admit mistakes, say his party have not present clear enough message final 96 hours campaign. He also concede that Congress' final scramble pas $500 billion budget bill hurt his party. One this lessons Republicans out this be that we need listen more carefully people and we need have clear understanding and concise message that we do apply nation, he say Washington. Both Lott and Gingrich say Republicans would put emphasis next year tax-cutting and shore Social Security system. even two leaders spoke, their angry rank-and-file lawmakers be make phone calls try assess whether mount challenges republican leaders who have steer Congress Republican's assume control four years ago. One senior Republican staffer say House have become tinderbox intrigue. Scarborough said, The long distance charges Washington offices probably be go roof today. Everybody's call everybody. everybody recognize that something's terribly wrong direction Washington Republicans when republican governors be do so well New York, Massachusetts, Florida and Texas. And while Gingrich have not go out his way identify himself republican campaign's last-minute ad blitz attack President Clinton, his caucus know he be responsible. Gingrich have face uprising before, foil coup attempt him disgruntle conservatives and some his leadership team summer 1997. Any move remove him remain long-shot. But House leadership elections now set mid-november, Republicans say this time dissatisfaction their caucus have cross ideological lines moderates Shays well. We get shellacked, say Rep. Christopher Cannon, conservative Utah. We beat ourselves because we have no agenda. Republicans be discuss possible challenges Gingrich, his second-in-command, Rep. Dick Armey, and other members senior leadership team. Some be envision try run entire new ticket head Rep. Bob Livingston, Appropriations Committee chairman Louisiana and include Rep. Steve Largent, Oklahoma conservative. ask whether Tuesday's election results could cost him speakership, Gingrich said, I'm not particularly concerned. Republicans close him say they expect anger dissipate. In Senate, where leadership races take place early December, some Republicans be talk mount challenges mid-level leadership figures. several senators express particular pique re-election chairman, Senator Mitch McConnell Kentucky, who pour party dollars and much his time try defeat democratic champion campaign finance overhaul, Russell Feingold Wisconsin. Feingold win close race. Some lawmakers Wednesday approach Sen. Chuck Hagel Nebraska see if he would replace McConnell. Hagel confirm he have talk more eight senators, and be whether challenge McConnell. Hagel lambast republican leadership election outcome. This be big loss us, he said. We squander very historic opportunity last night. To just break be loss. most incumbents coast victory Tuesday night. But some will not be returning. Five House Republicans be defeated: Vince Snowbarger Kansas, Bill Redmond New Mexico, Jon Fox Pennsylvania, Mike Pappas New Jersey, and Rick White Washington. One Democrat also lose his re-election bid Rep. Jay Johnson Wisconsin. The new House members include 17 Republicans and least 22 Democrats. David Wu, Democrat be lead molly Bordonaro, Republican race one House seat Oregon, final victory announcement be not expect Friday absentee ballots be counted. Unlike self-proclaimed revolutionaries Republican class 1994, many newly elect members be career politicians who rise ranks local and state government. Three Democrats be sons former lawmakers, Mark Udall Colorado, son Morris Udall who represent Arizona; Tom Udall New Mexico, son other Udall brother, Stewart, former congressman and secretary Interior, and Charlie Gonzalez, who win Texas seat his father, Henry. A struggle control House be way, Rep. Robert Livingston conduct telephone campaign that could lead him run Newt Gingrich speaker. But Gingrich's counter-campaign have give some members pause oust him. At same time, small band Republicans vow Thursday that they would not vote re-elect Gingrich any circumstances, move that, because Republicans' shrink House majority, could tie party knots months. Rep. Matt Salmon, R-Ariz., said: I personally have make decision that I cannot vote Newt Gingrich speaker January, and there be six who have tell me they feel same way, seven people who just will not, and it take six deadlock vote. Fury speaker have boil Tuesday's elections, when Republicans suffer net loss five seats house. They blame Gingrich, party's chief strategist. But many be already angry him what they say be his failure articulate clear message party go elections and messy budget process that give President Clinton political edge and contradicted Republican principles fiscal conservativism contain massive amounts spend local projects. House Republicans be meet Nov. 18 vote secret ballot their leaders. Whoever win republican nomination speaker must stand election full House January. even if Gingrich win secret ballot, he could be deny re-election speaker January if Salmon and least five refuse vote him. Because Republicans now control House only 12 seats, it would take just six votes Gingrich deny him majority. With such chaotic and unacceptable prospect looming, Livingston tell Gingrich that he should step aside good party, republican officials said. The officials say that Livingston speak Gingrich shortly election returns also election, reflect Livingston's early displeasure speaker budget process. Several Republicans say that Livingston, chairman Appropriations Committee and one few members stature stand speaker, and Gingrich be work phones Thursday struggle votes. Livingston have say nothing publicly challenge Gingrich, several members and aides say Thursday that he would announce his intentions, possibly soon Friday, only he have determine if he could win. Rep. Peter King, R-N.Y., be one several members who speak Livingston Thursday. He tell me he's make number phone calls, that he's gotten very positive response run speaker, and he'll decide next 48 hours, King said. He won't do it till he have his ducks row, and right now lot people be still loyal speaker, say aide Republican who, many others, be try straddle line fealty speaker who may retain power and encouragement challenger who offer salve embattle party. many Republicans immediately blame Gingrich party's losses Tuesday. Talk quickly emerge next day slate candidates oppose Gingrich and his lieutenants. The list possible candidates leadership positions include Rep.e Steve Largent Oklahoma, who talk Livingston Thursday challenge Gingrich, Republican officials said, speak condition that their names not be reported. Those officials say that Largent tell Livingston that he want run him ticket and that he would challenge Rep. Dick Armey, majority leader. But, these officials say that if Livingston not challenge Gingrich, Largent would run speaker instead. other names be float Wednesday leadership posts. They include Reps. David McIntosh Indiana speaker and Jennifer Dunn Washington conference chairman. Added mix Thursday be name Rep. Christopher Cox, California conservative. As sign uncertainty prevail House members Thursday, Rep. Henry Hyde, chairman Judiciary Committee and one House's most venerable members, rebuff chance endorse Gingrich speaker. Hyde say that Gingrich bore responsibility party's losses Tuesday. Leadership take credit when things go right, he said. They ought take blame when things go wrong. ask if Gingrich should remain speaker, Hyde said: I rather think he will, that remain be seen. The energy that many vent publicly Wednesday anger Gingrich seem devote Thursday intense internal political calculations whether Livingston could succeed topple Gingrich and whether he should succeed. While many support him veteran who understand House and have show shrewd political skills manage massive federal budget, be revive images Louisianan hot-head who give party bad name government shutdown two years ago and who tend arm-flailing heat moments. One conservative leader say that he and his allies have reservations Livingston because he be obsess try keep social issues out budget process. The budget, he said, have be vehicle conservatives years add restrictions federal money abortion and other things you can't get Senate or presidential veto. If Livingston be challenger, I doubt that will cause rally real conservatives Congress. Some moderates say they be prepared support him. Rep. Marge Roukema, R-N.J., said, I would be amenable Livingston. Still, she cautioned, I'm not Newt. But it's wrong not sit and seriously look our options. Ken Johnson, aide Rep. W.J. (Billy) Tauzin, R-La., say that his bos be emblematic confusion broad base House Republicans. Billy have be loyal Speaker Gingrich and Dick Armey, and he's still loyal them, he also want hear what they have say commit them next election, Johnson said. Everyone be ask same question: Can we refocus message and re-energize our base re-aligning leadership? Salmon say his refusal support Gingrich no matter what be base Gingrich's track record one fail strategy another, include impeachment process and pork-laden budget. With challenge way, Gingrich have be try show members that he be responsive their concerns. After election night which he portray Republicans victorious they lose seats, next day he take responsibility losses.

26,"America Online be verge agree purchase Netscape Communications Corp., Internet pioneer center government's antitrust suit Microsoft Corp., executives involve talks say Sunday. The propose deal be complex, three-way transaction involve AOL, Netscape and Sun Microsystems Inc. AOL, lead on-line service more 14 million subscribers, would acquire Netscape's popular site World Wide Web and its software business. AOL would also enter joint marketing and development partnership Sun Microsystems strengthen Netscape's other business sell large corporations heavy-duty software need serve Web pages and other Internet technologies many thousands users same time. The purchase, exchange AOL shares Netscape stock, be value roughly $4 billion. A complete deal could be announce soon Monday morning. But executives involve talks caution Sunday night that some details remain be negotiated. The Netscape deal, if consummated, would realign three businesses forefront modern economy on-line services, Internet software and electronic commerce. It would strengthen two Microsoft's lead rivals, AOL and Sun Microsystems. At same time, however, it would end independent existence Netscape, Internet software maker once regard most serious challenger Microsoft's dominance personal computer software market. Netscape, found 1994, have struggle last 18 months assault Microsoft. Its Navigator be runaway leader market browser software use navigate World Wide Web. But Microsoft, respond Internet revolution, enter market aggressively, quickly match quality Netscape's technology and then bundle Microsoft browser, Internet Explorer, its industry-standard Windows operating system and give it away free. Eventually, Microsoft's browser technology catch Netscape's. Earlier this year, Netscape announce layoffs and start distribute Navigator free well, Microsoft steadily gain browser market. Since then, Netscape have focus mainly two businesses advertising and transaction fees its Netcenter Web site and sell industrial-strength software corporations that be build their Internet sites which conduct electronic commerce. AOL believe it have expertise increase revenues Netscape's Web site and, help Sun's programmers and vast corporate sales force, accelerate Netscape's software sales well, executives involve negotiations said. Among large corporations, Sun's version Unix, Solaris, be most popular operate systems powerful computers that run Netscape's server software. The much small Netscape would be place wing AOL and Sun Microsystems. The three companies have combine revenues more $12.4 billion last year. Microsoft, comparison, have revenues more $14 billion. This deal would insure that fundamental elements Netscape survive big companies that can drive its technologies forward, say David B. Yoffie, professor Harvard business school and co-author Michael A. Cusumano Massachusetts Institute Technology recent book, compete Internet Time: Lessons Netscape and Its Battle Microsoft. The impact deal, if any, government's antitrust suit Microsoft be uncertain. It do appear support key theme Microsoft's defense namely, that it operate fast-moving industry where corporate alliances shift all time. Thus, Microsoft argues, antitrust policy should tread gently. But deal, government officials insist, should have no direct effect current case. No matter how much alliances shift, it doesn't affect central fact Microsoft's monopoly and how it have use and abuse its market power protect its monopoly, say David Boies, Justice Department's lead trial lawyer Microsoft case. Executives represent Netscape, AOL and Sun Microsystems be government witnesses Microsoft trial. And serious merger talks Netscape Chief Executive Officer James Barksdale and AOL Chairman Steve Case begin month ago, or just start Microsoft trial, accord people close talks. Industry analysts suggest that companies may have be embolden take strong anti-microsoft steps base partly perception that antitrust case would weaken Microsoft. And representatives Kleiner Perkins Caufield &AMP; Byers, Silicon Valley venture capital firm regard power broker Microsoft's rivals, sit boards Netscape, Sun and AOL. Still, executives involve talks say that time propose deal be unrelated antitrust trial. Nor should it, one person noted, be regard single-minded attempt circle wagons Microsoft. Indeed, AOL, accord one person close talks, plans keep Microsoft's Internet Explorer browser default choice its on-line service. One government's allegations antitrust suit be that Microsoft win out Netscape main browser AOL because Microsoft use its Windows monopoly bargaining chip. To win browser deal, Microsoft offer AOL prime real estate Windows desktop, main screen more 90 percent personal computers sell today. Staying Microsoft's browser can be see proof that AOL still regard placement Windows desktop crucial, well careful step avoid undermine one allegations government's case. For AOL, Netscape purchase would accelerate its evolution Internet. At present, its flagship on-line service be hybrid its proprietary service, it have add gateway World Wide Web. In addition, consumers who do not subscribe AOL's dial-up service, it also have its Web site, aol.com, which attract 24 million visitors month, accord Media Metrix/Relevant Knowledge, market research firm. Its big Web site offers wide range information, entertainment, Internet chat and e-mail, leading example all-in-one sites that have become know portals. Netscape's Netcenter traffic have slip bit recent months, 16 million visitors month, it, too, be major portal. together, they should be huge player intensify portal battle viewers and result advertising revenues. Yahoo be current leader portal sit more 25 million monthly visitors, while Microsoft's site attract more 20 million month. Though know new-media company consumers, AOL be also interested boost its electronic commerce business Netscape purchase. AOL have recently do work Eastman Kodak, American Greetings and other companies, not only promote their products on-line subscribers also build Internet infrastructure software conduct electronic commerce. AOL notes projections recent one Forrester Research Inc., which predict that worldwide Internet commerce could reach high $3.2 trillion 2003, or 5 percent global sales. Sun Microsystems, analysts say, could be strong partner AOL market Internet commerce software. Sun be corporate software company sales force several thousand. As it move increasingly Internet technology, AOL should prove excellent partner Sun terms develop and use Sun's Java, Internet program language. And while Netscape's browser no longer generate revenue its own, it be distribution channel Java technology. Having Netscape's browser safely hand friendly company be strategic importance Sun, Microsoft own alternative browser market. AOL be expect pay little, if any, premium Netscape's stock price Friday, executives close deal said, Netscape shares have more double last month. In last week alone, Netscape's stock have jump $12, or nearly 45 percent, reports that it be discuss possible partnership AOL. The stock close Friday $39.1875, $2.625. AOL's shares gain $1.50 Friday, closing $84.875. Envisioning thoroughly network world which World Wide Web be limitless marketplace information, entertainment, products and services, America Online Inc. Tuesday lay out details its agreement buy Netscape Communications Corporation $4.2 billion. By move quickly what companies have recently come see inevitable convergence technology and media, America Online hop that it will secure solid lead battle already join giants Microsoft Corp. and International Business Machines Corp. transform great part cyberspace vast virtual mall. Part that vision rests alliance Sun Microsystems that America Online negotiate part deal. Sun not only bring cyber-savvy sales force effort but, more importantly, strong technology partner develop Netscape's industrial-strength software run Internet sites. Sun be indeed technology heavyweight. It own Java program language specially design Internet applications, and Solaris, most popular commercial operate systems powerful computers that big corporations use serve Internet services World Wide Web, e-mail and retail transactions. It also manufacture highly respected line powerful computers base its microprocessor chips. But America Online and big Internet players which it will compete real potential gold mine lie further road, perhaps five years away, when people will venture line information or shopping not only personal computers inexpensive Internet appliances cost $200 each, or maybe include free part subscription service, just some cellular phones be now. Today, be wire remains comparatively elitist activity estimate 25 percent american households have access Internet last year, and 5 percent households buy merchandise line. But executives America Online and Netscape hope that their deal will accelerate timetable day when net be ubiquitous, when people will tap World Wide Web appliance-like devices, pagers, cell phones, television set-top boxes or computers routinely they use telephone today. A new generation Internet devices be able deliver our service anywhere be key part what this deal be long run, say Stephen M. Case, 40, chairman America Online. For present, however, idea be make America Online, nation's lead online service, standard way get Internet, executives explained. Netscape, Internet pioneer, be crucial part that effort, they said. There be no assurance that this vision technological future will prove accurate or, if it does, that America Online-Netscape combination will lead way. Still, long-range game plan help explain what bring America Online and Netscape together. And ability companies' executives sell that vision Netscape's whiz-kid programmers particular will determine whether merger succeeds. Netscape's headquarters Mountain View, Calif., be likely become prime target Silicon Valley headhunters. As be case any software company, Netscape's key asset be its talented programmers, and many these code hackers may be reluctant work America Online, which still have reputation middle-brow service cater online newcomers, know derisively newbies. Stock options and other financial incentives will be tailor try keep Netscape employees board. But these people want change world, and we've get be clear that join America Online, Sun component, really be big opportunity us, say Marc Andreessen, 26-year-old cofounder Netscape who lead team young programmers supercomputing center University Illinois Silicon Valley start Internet software company 1994. This ought be preeminent Internet company next decade, Andreessen declared, speak cell phone streetcorner Palo Alto, Calif. For his part, Andreessen, Netscape executive vice president, will become Netscape's chief technology officer next three or four months, merger be completed. His new job America Online have not be determined, it be likely be chief technology officer combine company well, America Online executive said. Already, accord one Netscape board member, Andreessen have deliver 12-page single-spaced memorandum Case, set out his view technological road map new company should follow future, emphasize opportunities electronic commerce environment which most people be link Internet. Netscape, populate compute sophisticates, and America Online, know on-ramp Internet technologically challenged, seem corporate odd couple. But two companies, its executives explained, have be evolve each other more year. In telephone interview America Online's headquarters Dulles, Va., Case describe Netscape enterprise that have morph itself company dependent sales its software use browse World Wide Web and Microsoft's cross-hairs business that rely advertising and other revenues its popular Netcenter Web site and selling software corporations handle electronic commerce. The Netscape transformation be largely reaction Microsoft's competitive assault its browser business central element government's antitrust suit Microsoft. Microsoft bundle its browser its industry-standard Windows operating system, and give away browser free. The government allege these steps be part pattern anticompetitive practices, while Microsoft maintain moves be intend mainly benefit consumers. early this year, lay workers and suffer large loss last year, Netscape announce that it would also distribute its browser free. It seem have stabilize its business its new model. Netscape announce Tuesday that it earn $2.7 million revenues $162 million its fourth fiscal quarter, which end September. Yet America Online have also change last couple years, move well its reputation online service beginners. It now have Internet chat service and run its all-in-one site Web, know portal, which include e-mail, Internet searching, news, entertainment and online shopping. America Online have really change closed online service novice users Internet media and technology company diverse set brands, Andreessen said. These two companies have be move same direction, and fit be good one. America Online Inc. want become next Microsoft two promise information-age fields where Microsoft Corp. be just another company Internet media business and electronic commerce. With its propose purchase Netscape Communications Corp., AOL, nation's large dial-up online service more 14 million subscribers, hopes take significant step that ambitious goal. If $4 billion deal be complete companies have not reach final agreement Monday night AOL would acquire lead Internet brand and enlarge its wired audience absorb millions who regularly visit Netscape's popular NetCenter site World Wide Web. Acquiring Netscape would really enhance America Online's role premier Internet media company, say James F. Moore, president Geopartners Inc., consult firm. America Online be assemble kind audience numbers that will convince people Internet be become mainstream media. In new media business, traditional media television or newspapers, eyeballs translate advertising revenue. But what really intrigues media executives and consumer marketers new media news, entertainment and services render computer code be that it be inherently two-way medium which people can interact tap key or click mouse button The interaction that advertisers and marketers want see, course, be buying. And it be potential exploit instant, direct connection consumers that have fuel all recent optimism electronic commerce. Today, companies be sell everything books baby clothes Internet. most companies have not progress experimentation stage, there be handful encouraging success stories Amazon.com, on-line bookstore. By 2003, Forrester Research Inc., whose business be analyze trends cyberspace, projects that Internet commerce could reach $3.2 trillion, or 5 percent all sales worldwide. AOL be forefront this convergence media and commerce converge, and integration reflect lineage its leaders. Steve Case, chairman, be once new-product manager Pepsico's Pizza Hut chain, while Robert Pittman, president, be former MTV executive. Microsoft be also invest heavily new media and electronic commerce. It have online service, MSN, which compete AOL, well information-and commerce Web sit that focus travel, cars and real estate. It also own Sidewalk, network local sites that list movies, restaurants and stores cities country include Seattle and New York. Its MSNBC Internet news service be half joint venture NBC. Microsoft be expect be formidable competitor media-and-commerce business. It have no shortage bright people and it have more money any rival. Besides deep pockets, Microsoft have built-in advantage any computer-based medium because its Windows operating system run more 90 percent personal computers sell today. Its control Windows desktop give it most valuable piece commercial real estate information age. In theory, least, own that desktop screen should help Microsoft steer consumers its online offerings issue that be key government's antitrust suit Microsoft. But so far, Microsoft have start slowly fields Internet media and electronic commerce. Microsoft may want to, it do not dominate these new markets, say Richard Shaffer, principal Technologic Partners, research firm. America Online recognize that big opportunity be these emerge growth businesses electronic commerce instead try take Microsoft head-on. Still, if Netscape deal be completed, AOL will also find itself software business way it have never be past. Netscape be know pioneer commercial development software use navigate World Wide Web. Microsoft saw browser software direct threat its industry dominance and pursue that market aggressively, bundle its browser its Windows and give it away free tactics that have be challenge government. But Netscape no longer generate revenues its browser, which it now also distribute free, sale heavy-duty software sell corporations. much this software be use technological back office electronic commerce use building Web sites and process transactions. A surprising element propose deal be that AOL intend hold Netscape's corporate software business instead sell it establish software company. America Online just doesn't have credibility that market, observe Michael A. Cusumano, professor Massachusetts Institute Technology's Sloan School Management. Executives close AOL explain decision need provide full-line offerings electronic commerce, corporate Web site computer screens consumers. But AOL have decide it need help preserve and strengthen Netscape's corporate software business. To do that, it have bring Sun Microsystems Inc. side deal, which have complicate transaction considerably. AOL, accord executives close propose deal, will netscape, it will have joint marketing and development partnership Sun. As part deal, AOL will agree purchase $300 million worth Sun's computers its service, while Sun will apparently agree purchase sizeable amounts Netscape software, which Sun's sales force must sell. Still, AOL and Sun have longer-term objective well one that promise place them more direct conflict Microsoft. For nearly year, William J. Raduchel, Sun's chief strategist, have be work closely AOL, accord Sun executives. A former Harvard economics professor who teach Scott McNealy, Sun chairman, Raduchel have focus Sun's Internet program technologies, call Java and Jini, which be see potential threats Microsoft's dominance. By combine Sun's technology prowess AOL's powerful consumer brand, Sun executives say, there be potential kind end-run Microsoft's grip desktop computing. In its research laboratories, Sun have be work stripped-down network computer simple-to-use information appliance, which could cost little $200 or be give away part subscription service. The concept be that AOL's Internet media and electronic commerce services could be deliver many more homes today because many people still shun expense and difficulty use personal computer. The appliance would be mainly receiver and screen, most computing power reside vast central computers serve information users request tap few buttons. Sun's technological specialty be this kind centralize network computing. If long-term AOL-Sun vision ever materialize certainly three-to-five year bet, least it could give companies boost and technological independence Microsoft. Microsoft Corp. argue federal court Monday that propose acquisition Netscape Communications Corp. America Online seriously undermine government's antitrust suit software giant. From legal standpoint, this propose deal pull rug out government, William Neukom, Microsoft's senior vice president legal affairs, say Monday morning courthouse steps. The reasoning this assertion, Microsoft says, be that proposed deal demonstrate that Netscape and large software industry be healthy and vibrant all illegal and anti-competitive practices allege government's suit. But David Boies, government's lead attorney, say all that be irrelevant. Whatever deal end be if there end be deal be not go remove any obstacles that Microsoft have place path competition this industry, he said. Michael Lacovara, Microsoft lawyer who be question government witness, economist Frederick Warren-Boulton, suggest him trial Monday that propose acquisition undermine Warren-Boulton's argument, that Microsoft seem head obtain monopoly Internet browser software match one it apparently hold operate systems. After all, 22 percent Americans who use Internet reach it America Online. And present AOL use Microsoft's Web browser, Internet Explorer, service's default choice. In exchange that, Microsoft places AOL advertisement and Internet link Windows 98. Lacovara ask witness whether, once AOL's service contract expire January, he would expect AOL continue distribute Microsoft software. Yes, Warren-Boulton responded. It be not all clear me that AOL's incentive do this be change this propose merger Netscape. He note that America Online officials have say their need be online services feature Windows force them accept Microsoft terms establish Internet Explorer default choice. Lacovara then ask Warren-Boulton question that lay his entire cross-examination witness and Microsoft's large assertion Monday propose Netscape-AOL deal. surely this combination, he asked, tells you something nature competition software industry? Warren-Boulton's answer be probably not one Lacovara have be after. To extent that this potential merger be result Microsoft's actions these exclusive contracts and other actions, he said, it be unfortunate see disappearance firm Netscape, brightest, new star. warren-boulton's purpose stand government be establish that Microsoft do have monopoly operating-system software; more 90 percent world's computers use Microsoft operate system. That be foundation most government's case federal antitrust law forbids certain behavior monopolist that would be legal firm that face healthy competition. Through repeated, circumlocutious questioning, Lacovara try make case that Microsoft's overwhelm market share be ephemeral. The software industry be so vibrant and fast moving, he suggested, that Microsoft could be topple its position any moment point view company encourage its employees. On Friday and Monday, Lacovara repeatedly point out that other companies be place other operate systems market, and some software companies principally Microsoft's great rivals be write software these new systems. But Warren-Boulton argue that existence these fringe competitors operate system market do not mean any way that Microsoft do not have monopoly power. On Monday afternoon, Lacovara make issue success Apple Computer Co. be have sell its new imac computer. He enter evidence Apple news release issue last month showing, other things, that 12.5 percent people buy Apple's new imac computer have previously own Windows machine. Apple computers use different operate system, Mac-OS. The outcome Microsoft antitrust case may be long way off, one thing be already clear: This be first major e-mail trial. The government's prosecution and Microsoft Corp.'s defense, strike degree, be legal campaigns wag electronic messages. The human testimony pales next e-mail evidence. On stand or videotape testimony, people be question shrug, mumble and forget. The e-mail be alive ideas and competitive zeal, punctuate profanity and exclamation points. The second week trial end prosecutors be frustrate because lengthy cross-examination Microsoft's lead lawyer leave no time government show several hours videotape deposition Bill Gates, Microsoft chairman. With new witness, executive Apple Computer Inc., take stand Monday, it be uncertain when Gates tape will be played. The Justice Department and 20 states sue Microsoft believe that tape will strengthen their case because it show gate say he be not involved plans take what government alleges be illegal steps stifle competition Internet software market. The Gates videotape, say David Boies, Justice Department's trial lawyer, offers opportunity judge Gates' credibility. But Gates credibility gap, if there be one, becomes issue not because videotape because his taped remarks can be compare and contrast e-mail he write and received. The e-mail record, government insists, show gate waist-deep plot anti-competitive deals and bully tactics that he deny or professes have never hear his taped deposition. If his machinations be central government's case, why not summon Gates trial? The government do not need put Gates stand, because we have his e-mail and memoranda, Stephen Houck, lawyer states, tell court. The Microsoft legal team have months be prepare its e-mail defense. First, Microsoft argues, anything that look damaging be take out context. I urge your honor, John Warden, Microsoft's lead lawyer, tell Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson, view considerable skepticism crazy quilt e-mail fragments that seem form core government's case. But Microsoft have also mount e-mail counterattack, cull millions messages it obtain subpoena competitors pretrial discovery. Warden's cross-examination ritual be present government witness internal e-mail his company and then pose declaration question. These interrogations have two refrains: Isn't it true your company do exactly what you be accuse Microsoft doing, and isn't it true that Microsoft prevail not because it be predatory monopolist because its superior technology? Microsoft be accuse try prod companies stay out its way. So last week, example, Warden produce e-mail Stephen Case, chairman America Online, suggest partnership Netscape Communications Corp. which companies would focus their respective strengths. That division labor, Case wrote, would be best way achieve goal that Marc Andreessen, Netscape's cofounder, describe earlier e-mail beat Beast From Redmond that want see us dead reference Microsoft's headquarters Redmond, Wash. Printouts e-mail be just another form write communication. By 1920s, typewriters become common, type memoranda start be use court cases. From 1950s 1980s, legal experts say, there be explosion documentation fuel new technologies electric typewriters, photocopying and fax machines, and then personal computers. And e-mail, they add, have play important role legal inquiries years, iran-contra case 1980s when e-mail find Oliver North's computer prove crucial. But Microsoft case be result sweeping government antitrust investigation high-technology company where e-mail have supplant telephone most common instrument communication. E-mail have just revolutionize investigations this kind, one senior Justice Department official said. While investigation, Microsoft have hand government estimate 30 million documents, mostly e-mail. In trial, two sides have submit 3,000 exhibits, mainly e-mail. And their e-mail, people communicate more frankly and informally when write letter or report tap it out, punch button and it's go cyberspace. But e-mail communication be documentary evidence, which legal cases provide rich, contemporaneous record what people be think and plan time. It can be sharp contrast formal oral testimony, so coached lawyers and craft selective memory. The e-mail record certainly make i-don't-recall line response harder sustain, say Robert Litan, former senior official Justice Department's antitrust division who be now Brookings Institution. It can also be powerful ammunition point contradictions testimony. And that be what government will do attack Gates' credibility his videotaped deposition, take three days august. The government offer glimpse that strategy first day trial. It show few brief clips point deposition when Gates be ask meeting June 21, 1995, which, government alleges, Microsoft offer divide browser market Netscape and make investment company, which be its chief rival that market. In taped deposition, Gates say he recall be ask one his subordinate whether he think it make sense invest Netscape. He say that he be ask it June 1995 meeting and replied, I didn't see that something that make sense. But e-mail May 31, 1995, Gates urge alliance Netscape. We could pay them money part deal, he wrote, buy piece them or something. The contradiction Gates' deposition and his e-mail, though, do not itself speak issue whether Microsoft make illegal offer Netscape. To be sure, it be what Microsoft not what it say e-mail communications that count most. But once e-mail that look bad get record, you end do what Microsoft's lawyers be go spend much this trial do try explain it away, say Stephen Axinn, lead antitrust litigator firm Axinn, Veltrop &AMP; Harkrider New York. America Online build itself most potent force cyberspace largely appeal families chatty teen-agers who want flirt online and adults look easy way send electronic mail while check weather and sports scores. Now, company have get serious if it be win hearts and minds corporate executives pin-stripe suits. nearly lose complexity America Online's deal buy Netscape Communication Corp. be America Online's announcement that it will enter entirely new market: work computer screen help companies open and operate online stores. Netscape already have create software that make it player provide support what be already know electronic commerce. But America Online now say it have ambitions offer much wide array software, consulting and services online merchants. most companies that sell consumers realize that they need get e-commerce space, say America Online president Robert Pittman news conference Tuesday. We see major business offer them end-to-end solution. The market be big and grow big day. Forrester Research estimate that $325 million will be spend this year electronic commerce software and another $5.3 billion services that range graphic design turn-key operation entire online stores. By 2002, Forrester estimates, combine market electronic commerce services and software should top $35 billion. E-commerce services be silver bullet that will enable companies be able take advantage true business opportunities Web, say Traci Gere, analyst International Data Corp. The market be grow very rapidly, it be very fragmented. Analysts say leader today e-commerce services be IBM, which have full line offerings sophisticate software products hand-holding consulting. other competitors include well-known information technology consult companies such Andersen Consulting, spin-off Arthur Andersen account firm; Electronic Data Systems, which run computer systems big companies, and PricewaterhouseCoopers, which offer accounting and consult separately one umbrella. Software companies Microsoft and Netscape sell package programs, typically little or no consult help customers use them. There be also plenty new companies that have sprout provide electronic commerce services. Some, Agency.Com and Organic Online, start basically advertise and design firms. Others, include U S Web and Viant, have emphasize programming and consulting. In fact, those two strains be blur together, exemplify U S Web's pending merger CKS Group. America Online argue that its advantage this increasingly crowd bazaar be its ability combine broad subscriber base 15 million customers Netscape software, hardware Sun Microsystems, which have join America Online's venture electronic commerce engineering. This be first time anyone have put true end-to-end solution that start silicon and end audience, say Barry Schuler, America Online's president interactive services. We start Sun's line servers, then commerce tools build store, support services process orders and then deal online real estate that can drive traffic. Despite advantages Netscape and Sun bring, analysts say that America Online face variety problems its new quest. Chief them be whether it can appear have consistency, focus and follow-through that corporate customers demand. AOL be not first company that come my mind when it come business-quality software, say Robert Chatham, senior analyst Forrester Research. Its decision keep Netscape separate unit and offer electronic commerce services partnership Sun will not enhance its credibility, Chatham said. America Online doesn't look homogenous vendor, he added. It look customers will have tangle menage trois AOL, Netscape and Sun. Nor have Internet service providers and other telecommunications-oriented companies show much evidence, Ms. Gere International Data said, that they be capable offering highly specific customize services that big corporate clients demand. Telecommunications companies that try do things efficiently large number customers have not be able offer customize one-to-one relationships, she said. Pittman say that America Online have be drive e-commerce business because companies that approach it want sell their goods need more help simply advertise online. We be find people who be expert run bricks-and-mortar stores be limit their infrastructure, he said. They have online store, their square footage be too small. even Netscape deal, America Online be move provide some electronic commerce software and services. It have be rewrite software that let companies open online stores be base universally accepted Internet standards rather specific computer language use only America Online. This new software, which now will be combine Netscape's online store services, will be available companies use America Online and Internet. Similarly, it have develop service that let users create file their credit card numbers and ship address so they can make online purchases retyping all that information each time. America Online be work offer it fee stores broad Internet. There be wide range services that be incorporate electronic commerce. These include high-end strategy consult help companies decide whether and how sell online hurt their traditional sale stores. There be all sorts computer systems be developed, range online stores themselves connect those sites company's exist inventory and accounting systems. There be creative services that include graphic design, media buying, customer list analysis and other marketing and promotional efforts. And there be operational services that involve actually maintain big servers that users connect when they use online stores that display catalogs, take orders and process payments. America Online, Schuler said, will emphasize services that relate market rather back-office functions. We will consult how merchandise and sell online, he said. We understand consumer piece puzzle. Some competitors worry that America Online's electronic commerce services may simply be device sell its software and hardware. The challenge be prove that clients be get best possible solution their business, say Robert Gett, chief executive Viant. If they offer AOL and Netscape and Sun, their answer be bit tainted. netscape do have expand force 700 people who provide consult and custom programming. But they have be most competitive, Gett said, compete nuts-and-bolts projects rather more lucrative assignments develop and carry out full-fledged strategy Web. They say, `who know our software better Netscape?' Gett said. We help customers decide which platform be best them. But America Online argue that combine might it, Netscape and Sun be just what business needs. We always believe that commerce, that be buy goods and services, be huge revenue stream future, Schuler said. We have only see tiny tip iceberg. America Online build itself most potent force cyberspace largely appeal families chatty teen-agers who want flirt online and adults look easy way send electronic mail while check weather and sports scores.

Others, include U S Web and Viant, have emphasize programming and consulting. In fact, those two strains be blur together, exemplify U S Web's pending merger CKS Group. America Online argue that its advantage this increasingly crowd bazaar be its ability combine broad subscriber base 15 million customers Netscape software, hardware Sun Microsystems, which have join America Online's venture electronic commerce engineering. This be first time anyone have put true end-to-end solution that start silicon and end audience, say Barry Schuler, America Online's president interactive services. We start Sun's line servers, then commerce tools build store, support services process orders and then deal online real estate that can drive traffic. Despite advantages Netscape and Sun bring, analysts say that America Online face variety problems its new quest. Chief them be whether it can appear have consistency, focus and follow-through that corporate customers demand. AOL be not first company that come my mind when it come business-quality software, say Robert Chatham, senior analyst Forrester Research. Its decision keep Netscape separate unit and offer electronic commerce services partnership Sun will not enhance its credibility, Chatham said. America Online doesn't look homogenous vendor, he added. It look customers will have tangle menage trois AOL, Netscape and Sun. Nor have Internet service providers and other telecommunications-oriented companies show much evidence, Ms. Gere International Data said, that they be capable offering highly specific customize services that big corporate clients demand. Telecommunications companies that try do things efficiently large number customers have not be able offer customize one-to-one relationships, she said. Pittman say that America Online have be drive e-commerce business because companies that approach it want sell their goods need more help simply advertise online. We be find people who be expert run bricks-and-mortar stores be limit their infrastructure, he said. They have online store, their square footage be too small. even Netscape deal, America Online be move provide some electronic commerce software and services. It have be rewrite software that let companies open online stores be base universally accepted Internet standards rather specific computer language use only America Online. This new software, which now will be combine Netscape's online store services, will be available companies use America Online and Internet. Similarly, it have develop service that let users create file their credit card numbers and ship address so they can make online purchases retyping all that information each time. America Online be work offer it fee stores broad Internet. There be wide range services that be incorporate electronic commerce. These include high-end strategy consult help companies decide whether and how sell online hurt their traditional sale stores. There be all sorts computer systems be developed, range online stores themselves connect those sites company's exist inventory and accounting systems. America Online be verge agree purchase Netscape Communications Corp., Internet pioneer center government's antitrust suit Microsoft Corp., executives involve talks say Sunday. The propose deal be complex, three-way transaction involve AOL, Netscape and Sun Microsystems Inc. AOL, lead on-line service more 14 million subscribers, would acquire Netscape's popular site World Wide Web and its software business. But part deal, AOL would also enter joint marketing and development partnership Sun Microsystems strengthen Netscape's other business sell large corporations heavy-duty software need serve Web pages and other Internet technologies many thousands users same time. The purchase, exchange AOL shares Netscape stock, be value roughly $4 billion. A complete deal could be announce soon Monday morning. But executives involve talks caution Sunday night that some details remain be negotiated. The Netscape deal, if consummated, would realign three businesses forefront modern economy on-line services, Internet software and electronic commerce. It would strengthen two Microsoft's lead rivals, AOL and Sun Microsystems. At same time, however, it would subsume Netscape, Internet software maker once regard most serious challenger Microsoft's dominance personal computer software market. Netscape, found 1994, have struggle last 18 months assault Microsoft. Its Navigator be runaway leader market browser software use navigate World Wide Web. But Microsoft, respond Internet revolution, enter market aggressively, quickly match quality Netscape's technology and then bundle Microsoft browser, Internet Explorer, its industry-standard Windows operating system and give it away free. Earlier this year, Netscape announce layoffs and start distribute Navigator free well, Microsoft steadily gain browser market. Since then, Netscape have focus mainly two businesses advertising and transaction fees its Netcenter Web site and sell industrial-strength software corporations that be build their Internet sites which conduct electronic commerce. AOL believe it have expertise increase revenues Netscape's Web site and, help Sun's programmers and vast corporate sales force, accelerate Netscape's software sales well, executives involve negotiations said. Sun's version Unix, Solaris, be most popular operate systems large, powerful computers that run Netscape's server software. This deal would insure that fundamental elements Netscape survive big companies that can drive its technologies forward, say David B. Yoffie, professor Harvard business school and co-author Michael A. Cusumano Massachusetts Institute Technology recent book, compete Internet Time: Lessons Netscape and Its Battle Microsoft. The impact deal, if any, government's antitrust suit Microsoft be uncertain. It do appear support key theme Microsoft's defense namely, that it operate fast-moving industry where corporate alliances shift all time. Thus, Microsoft argues, antitrust policy should tread gently. But deal, government officials insist, should have no direct effect current case. No matter how much alliances shift, it doesn't affect central fact Microsoft's monopoly and how it have use and abuse its market power protect its monopoly, say David Boies, Justice Department's lead trial lawyer Microsoft case. Executives represent Netscape, AOL and Sun Microsystems be government witnesses Microsoft trial. And serious merger talks Netscape Chief Executive Officer James Barksdale and AOL Chairman Steve Case begin month ago, or just start Microsoft trial, accord people close talks. Industry analysts suggest that companies may have be embolden take strong anti-microsoft steps base partly perception that antitrust case would weaken Microsoft. And representatives Kleiner Perkins Caufield &AMP; Byers, Silicon Valley venture capital firm regard power broker Microsoft's rivals, sit boards Netscape, Sun and AOL. Stock prices vault record levels Monday, further recovery that recently two months ago seem nearly unthinkable. I think we be most serious correction 1990, I never think or write that bull market be over, say Byron Wien, U.S. equity strategist Morgan Stanley Dean Witter &AMP; Co. now it seem all that be us. The Dow Jones industrial average rise 214.72 points, or 2.34 percent, 9,374.27. The record be first July 17, when Dow close 9,337.97. Since Aug. 31, when Dow stand 7,539.07 steep slide, blue-chip gauge have rise more 24 percent. For year, Dow be 18.54 percent and have chance rise more 20 percent fourth consecutive year, something never accomplish before. Broader averages also climbed. The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock index set record, rise 24.66 points, or 2.12 percent, 1,188.21. The Nasdaq composite index not reach new high post big percentage gain Monday, rise 49.21 points, or 2.55 percent, 1,977.42. And Russell 2000 index smaller-company issues gain 3.86 points, or nearly 1 percent, 398.15. Monday's action be energize daily record number mergers and acquisitions value $1 billion or more. The merger announcements not only prompted investors change estimate how much companies be worth also indicate come declines outstanding shares stock. This may be supply-demand story, where demand stocks be rise and supply stock be reduce one company another merges, say Hugh Johnson, chief investment officer First Albany Corp. The flow money mutual funds be fairly strong, and there be pressure managers put that money work. Two deals seem be catalysts broad swaths stocks. News that Bankers Trust may be close accept $8.9 billion offer Deutsche Bank Germany heighten interest financial-services and bank stocks. And word that America Online may acquire Netscape Communications $4 billion stock power Internet and other technology stocks loftier valuations. Among financial companies, J.P. Morgan gain 6 1/16, 115 11/16. American Express be 4 3/8, 108 15/16. Merrill Lynch jump 4 3/8, 76. And Donaldson, Lufkin &AMP; Jenrette rise 3 9/16, 42}. Netscape be most active stock Monday, gain 2}, 41 15/16. America Online gain 4 3/8, 89\. other Internet stocks also surged, and analysts say group, which have see meteoric gains recent weeks, be ripe steep correction. Yahoo and Amazon.com become $200 stocks Monday. Yahoo rise 30 7/16, 221 7/16. And Amazon.com gain 37 3/8, 218. The performance Internet stocks be unsettling sign, Wien said. Still, more-established technology shares also have very good day. IBM rise 7, 166 5/8. Microsoft jump 5 9/16, 119 3/16. And Intel close 113 9/16, 1{. After Monday's big price moves, Wien say that accord his calculations, stocks be 10 percent overvalued. By contrast, middle July market be 20 percent overvalued, he said. Nonetheless, market's recovery, which have be buttress three cuts interest rates Federal Reserve Board, have leave many longtime Wall Street hands grasp historical parallels. At this point we be new ground, say Laszlo Birinyi, who head his market research firm. At begin year, I say my target Dow be 10,000 end 1998. If anyone have ask when market go what now look corrective blip, I would have say my new target would have be 9,000. I be surprised 10,000 figure come back table this year. The New York Times say editorial Wednesday, Nov. 25: America Online's effort acquire Netscape and set partnership Sun Microsystems be reminder how rapidly corporate landscape can change fast-moving technical fields. But it do not lessen need Justice Department vigorously pursue its antitrust suit Microsoft, dominant player software. The department have present solid evidence that Microsoft have use its monopoly operate systems muscle rivals and partners so head competition other software realms. The Internet have rise so quickly information medium that only four years ago, his book The Road Ahead, Bill Gates scarcely mention it. In addition, only couple years ago America Online, world's big online service, be have so much trouble get rid bugs system it be widely deride America On Hold. now Microsoft have move so aggressively Internet that Justice Department be accuse it predatory behavior, and America Online have rocket forward make deals other Internet players. In its antitrust suit Microsoft, federal government charges that company have illegally bundle its browser its Windows operating system smother Netscape's chances market its browser. now corridors antitrust trial Microsoft's lawyers maintain that Netscape have find new partner America Online and have no need protection government. But it could be easily argue that Microsoft have bludgeon Netscape dissolution, force distress sale America Online. Nor be it clear that customers America Online will choose Netscape's browser vehicle buying and selling Internet. Even its newly musclebound form, America Online remain dependent Microsoft's good will favorable placement AOL icon main desktop screen. It may be that, years hence, America Online, Netscape and Sun will put together alternative means Internet telephone lines, cables or like. But that day, fairness require Justice Department action insure that Microsoft not use its current position thwart consumer choice. only when companies know they can get their products consumer will they have incentive innovate and turn Internet revolutionary medium it promise be. ","As the government continued to press its anti-trust suit against Microsoft, AOL has begun negotiations to purchase Netscape.Netscape is at the heart of the antitrust suit.Netscape alleges that Microsoft marketing practices, packaging its Internet Explorer in its operating system denied market opportunities to Netscape.The AOL deal, a three-way negotiation between AOL, Sun Microsystems and Netscape, would combined three Microsoft rivals.AOL is counting on the Netscape purchase to allow it to expand its internet Market by helping business operate on the internet in an effort to join Media and technology.","In a bid to become a leader in the lucrative cyberspace economy, AOL will buy Netscape and set up a partnership with Sun.The venture will let AOL offer corporations end-to-end services, including servers, software, and accessibility to consumers.Eventually, AOL hopes to capitalize on the production of cheap devices offering Internet access to more homes.News of the deal helped push the Dow Jones to a new high.Meanwhile, Microsoft, accused by the Justice Department of using its operating system dominance to squelch competition in the browser market, claims the deal shows the software industry is healthy and that Netscape needs no government protection.","As the U.S. government pressed its antitrust case against Microsoft Corp. in November 1998, America Online (AOL) proposed an alliance with Netscape Communications and Sun Microsystems.The three-pronged deal promised to provide on-line services, Internet software and electronic commerce.AOL was to buy Netscape and forge a partnership with Sun, benefiting all three and giving technological independence from Microsoft.Microsoft lawyers argued unconvincingly that AOL's purchase of Netscape would undermine the government's antitrust case, based in large part on Netscape's complaint.It remained to be seen whether AOL could achieve a vast virtual mall.","America Online became the leading force in cyberspace for individuals to exchange e-mail and check the latest news.AOL saw a bright day ahead as a company that could provide online services, Internet software, and electronic commerce.To position itself better in this growing market, AOL sought to buy Netscape and work an alliance with Sun Microsystems.Netscape has faltered because of the ubiquity of the Microsoft Windows operating system requiring its browser.Microsoft argued that a vibrant technology market and rising stock prices undercut antitrust charges against it.At the trial the government presented thousands of e-mails supporting its case."
27,"President Leonid Kuchma call Friday corrections Ukraine's program market reforms, pledge that reforms would continue. Kuchma not elaborate his comments group ukrainian economists, say only that changes be necessary because country's economic problems. Kuchma urge economists come recommendations national meeting economists November, Interfax news agency reported. Ukraine have suffer economic problems 1991 collapse Soviet Union and it have be especially hard hit financial crisis neighbor Russia, its main trading partner. The russian crisis have hurt bilateral trade, cause ukrainian currency fall and lead withdrawal investors Ukraine. In recent months, Kuchma have implement some economic reforms decree, prompt International Monetary Fund release first installment long-awaited dlrs 2.2 billion loan. many reforms, however, remain stalled. National Bank chairman Viktor Yushchenko be Washington this week consultations IMF officials. Yushchenko have warn that bank would not spend its dwindle reserves support hryvna currency, have avoid comments currency recent days. Kuchma meet Friday Yushchenko, Prime Minister Valery Pustovoitenko and other senior officials discuss ways stabilize hryvna. The government's press service say they focus possible ways keep hryvna 3.5 U.S. dollar end year. The hryvna have be trade 3.4 dollar recent days trading have be limited. There be wide expectations ukraine that hryvna will fall further, and Ukrainians have be stock food, clothing and household goods their fast-devaluing money. When world's finance ministers and central bankers gather last year Hong Kong, they nervously congratulate each other contain least moment nasty financial brush fire Asia. In year's time, many predict hallway chatter, troubles Thailand and Indonesia would look replay Mexico 1995 rough bump road world enjoy remarkable prosperity. talk bad market calls. Twelve months later, same financial mandarins clog Washington their limousines and glide endless receptions annual meeting International Monetary Fund and World Bank, just everything that could have go wrong world economy has: bad downturn Japan World War II, economic meltdown Russia, depression Indonesia that be plunge 100 million people poverty line, and deep fears what happen next Latin America. What make this year's IMF meeting most remarkable, though, be that harsh criticisms be direct monetary fund itself, and, extension, U.S. Treasury, which be view power IMF. This year, place confident predictions, there be mutual recriminations. Arguments be break out whether true culprits be crony capitalists and weaken leaders russian President Boris Yeltsin, or huge investors who pour money world's emerge markets reckless abandon mid-1990s and panicked twelve months. Whatever reason, one reality prevails: Hundreds billions dollars have flee economies four continents seek safest havens possible, United States and money be not return anytime soon. And subtext every seminar capital flows and every conclave nervous ministers will be some painfully blunt questions: Can this be stopped? Or be world head global recession? Fifty-three years ago IMF be create Bretton Woods conference which seek stabilize world economy and secure peace World War II. now it be attack all sides, charge not only worsen bad situation misjudge economics, be politically tone-deaf some most volatile capitals world, Jakarta, Indonesia, Moscow. For first time, there be disturb questions whether institution itself be still capable, financially or politically, contain kind economic contagion that catch world unaware. Once, IMF's critics be largely find Africa and South Asia, be fund be view arrogant; today they include Wall Street's big players and top officials most powerful economies Asia and Europe. Only few include former Secretary State George Schultz and members Congress who be increasingly suspicious all international institutions be talk scrap IMF altogether. But almost everyone be talk create new financial architecture that can do what old one clearly cannot: smother financial wildfires they leap globe. President Clinton, British Prime Minister Tony Blair and other leaders, months silence, have edge debate, some cases wrest issue first time their finance ministers and central banks. Their fear, their advisers say, be that 15 months financial turmoil be now threaten political stability. such concerns have turn this year's meeting tumble mass worries and grope short and long-term solutions. The Japanese, French, Southeast Asians be all arrive Washington different diagnoses what go wrong, and different solutions how set it right. The United States have its set plans, mix suggestions force more disclosure financial data countries world and impose more american-style financial standards and regulation. Meanwhile, ideological argument be break out whether world should slow long march more free and open markets strategy press Clinton administration six years. Others argue that it be unwise start rebuild hospital while patients be still operate tables. last year standard answer that all us be give come this: `We have IMF and World Bank, and they know best,' Indonesian Foreign Minister Ali Alatas say breakfast Washington other day, reflect how crisis turn 30 years astound growth his country overnight depression. then they say everything that go wrong be our fault, he said. But now, now I think people know that much problem come outside, and we need something better. And IMF itself be begin fight back, awkward role institution dominate Ph.D. economists who be unaccustomed be openly challenged. Every place you turn you read same story, that we come in, that we make things worse, say Stanley Fischer, deputy manage director fund, who be bear Northern Rhodesia now Zambia and become chairman Massachusetts Institute Technology's economics department take job that have now put him center financial storm. We frequently get blame, some it well-deserved, he said. But it be politically convenient governments world cry, `the IMF make us do it,' and pin their mistakes us. That's fine. We'd rather be loved, more that we'd be effective. MISCALCULATIONS, POLITICS AND SAFETY NETS On steam January day, Michel Camdessus, IMF's top official, slip Jakarta private residence President Suharto and sit four-hour meeting tick off, line line, huge reforms Indonesia would have implement return tens billions dollars emergency aid. Two previous deals have collapse when Suharto ignore fund's conditions, so Camdessus insist that he strike deal directly Suharto, then Asia's longest-serving leader. It be meet men who know different worlds power politics: Suharto rise general central Java, and Camdessus have detonate mines Algeria french army enter french Treasury his way become head France's central bank. It be all there, senior IMF official recalled. He be tell he have dismantle national airplane project, cleave monopoly, all distribution monopolies. At one point, Camdessus look impassive Suharto and said, You see what this mean your family, reference their vast investments country's key industries. He said, `i call my children, and they all understand.' But months, that exchange Jakarta come symbolize IMF's twin troubles: Its inability understand and reckon national politics countries need radical reform, and its focus economic stabilization rather social costs its actions. Suharto have no intention fulfil agreement. It was, one his former Cabinet members said, delay move that be obvious everyone Camdessus. perhaps one reason why IMF sometimes appear tone-deaf be that its senior staff be almost entirely composed Ph.D. economists. There be few officials deep experience international politics, much less complexities javanese culture that be work Indonesia. Historically, experts politics and security have gravitate United Nations, development experts World Bank, and economists IMF create dangerous gaps crisis this one. As result, fund have only rudimentary understanding what would happen if its demands be meet and all Indonesia's state monopolies be quickly dissolved. While that system line pockets Suhartos and their friends, it also distribute food, gasoline and other staples country that stretch 3,000 miles thousands islands. To help balance budget, fund demand quick end expensive subsidies that keep price food and gasoline artificially low. But that, combine huge currency devaluation that spark crisis, result high prices and shortages that fuel riots that continue this day, millions Indonesians lose their jobs. The IMF unintentionally, its officials insist also speed Suharto's resignation, insist elimination crony capitalism, code words remove Suharto family center economy. Ultimately, that may prove be Indonesia's salvation, if new government can contain riot ethnic chinese minority whose money be desperately need country's fast-shrinking economy. It be worth noting, Fischer say this week, that our programs Asia Indonesia, Korea and Thailand only take hold there be change government. Nonetheless, Indonesia experience have revive argument that IMF be so focused stabilize banks and currencies, prevent capital flight and free markets, that it be blind social costs its actions. Among tough critics have be its sister institution, World Bank, whose main charge be alleviate poverty. You've see tension almost every day, one senior World Bank official say recently. The bank have go extraordinary lengths recent months differentiate its role that fund, and announce triple aid poor countries hit economic chaos. even U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan have join argument, warn speech Harvard recently that if globalization be succeed, it must succeed poor and rich alike. It must deliver rights no less riches. It must be harness cause not capital alone, development and prosperity poorest world. IMF officials say they be change strategies when they see they be exact too great social cost. It's very difficult formula get exactly right, Fischer say August, Russia be teeter and IMF be send $4.8 billion aid that be rapidly wasted. You need enough discipline send right message markets and keep investors fleeing. But you need enough leeway keep people suffer more they otherwise would. In recent months, he noted, IMF have allow more spending sustain subsidies basic goods longer periods Indonesia, Korea and elsewhere. There be new flexibility IMF senior Indonesian official conclude recently. It be lot better. A U.S. PAWN, OR A RUNAWAY AGENCY? The Clinton administration admit that IMF have many failings, many them display this year. But it insist that world have go global financial crises IMF once this century and result be 1930s. I have no doubt situation year would have be much bad great devaluations, more defaults, more contagion, and great trade dislocations program agree IMF and finance it have provided, Deputy Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers tell Congress last week. many Republicans and some Democrats be unconvinced. even though Senate have overwhelmingly approve $18 billion contribution fund help it fight new crises, House defeat that measure two weeks ago. The fund's last hope get money, which will free nearly $100 billion contributions other nations wait United States act, will come when House and Senate try resolve their budget differences conference committee next 10 days. A rejection, Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin insists, would send message world that United States be turn its back one institution charge restore economic stability. Everywhere else world, though, politicians and businessmen insist that one big problems IMF be that, contrary view Congress, it act U.S. Treasury's lap dog. Ask Jakarta or Moscow, and response be same: The IMF never ventures far look back approve nod its master. When United States weigh in, however, be when IMF be call rescue country deep trouble. only then do IMF and U.S. Treasury have leverage extract commitments return billions aid. In theory, U.S. influence be limited: It have 18.5 percent vote fund. Germany, Japan, France and Britain have 5 percent each. But practice United States get its way, exercise its influence scenes, interactions Fischer and Summers. The two meet when Fischer be MIT faculty and Summers be graduate student take one his classes, later become colleague MIT. Each serve chief economist World Bank. It be Summers who be instrumental placing Fischer fund's no. 2 job, and these days they talk constantly. It's warm relationship, Fischer say this summer. Remember, this be job where you cannot turn outsiders advice you can't call chief economist Wall Street firm, or many your academic friends, because so many issues be confidential. The Treasury's relations Camdessus be more strained he play role world diplomat, travel globe and try coax political leaders. The tensions be obvious start Asia crisis. The fund make little secret its displeasure that United States be not offer direct aid Thailand, major U.S. ally, sign support and confidence. Mindful backlash Congress when Mexico be bail out U.S. money, that be last thing Treasury plan do. Summers, turn, think fund be not force Thais implement its reform commitments rigorously enough or disclose their true financial picture. Within U.S. government there be other dissension: The State and Defense Departments felt United States should do more Thailand, back when Treasury ask if they would pony some aid out their budgets. There be other conflicts. When Japan use last IMF meeting propose set $100 billion Asia Fund one that would exclude United States and would probably offer aid much more relaxed conditions IMF does. Rubin call Camdessus breakfast one morning and tell him that japanese proposal would undercut IMF's authority. We've just have dispute Michel, Rubin report his aides he return his orange juice and croissant. One them shot back: And it's only 8 a.m. Camdessus back Rubin's insistence and walk away money that Asia could have used. Japan say it will be back similar proposal this weekend, this time $30 billion fund. Camdessus have also rankle U.S. officials statements that amount cheerlead reassure markets sometimes face facts. In June, Russia its way collapse, Camdessus declare that contrary what markets and commentators be imagine slow collapse Russia's economy, this be not crisis. This be not major development. The bailouts Russia and South Korea be prime examples how Washington muscle IMF's turf soon major U.S. strategic interests be involved. last Christmas, South Korea slip days run out hard currency pay its debts December, it send secret envoy, Kim Kihwan, work out rescue package. I didn't bother go IMF, Kim recall recently. I call Summers' office Treasury my home Seoul, fly Washington and go directly there. I know that be how this would get done. Within days Treasury dispatch David Lipton, its most experienced veteran emergency bailouts, who be leave his post undersecretary international affairs this month, shadow IMF staff's negotiations government Seoul. Fischer be displeased. To make negotiation effective, it have be clear who have authority do negotiating, he said. WHO LOST RUSSIA? The pattern be repeat this summer, when United States race put together $17 billion package Russia. The IMF's staff Moscow declare that Russia need no money all it just need enact policies that would restore confidence investors. The Americans and Germans come different conclusion. Soon after, U.S. officials gather White House situation room consider what might happen Russia if ruble be devalue and market reforms collapse and push IMF come emergency money. so fund begin assemble last-ditch program prop country that have resist its reform plans seven years. Camdessus, though, be still hesitant, question whether IMF should risk its scarce resources Russia. We have pull Michel along, senior Treasury official recalled. As it turn out, Camdessus' instincts be right while approach champion Rubin and Summers prove disastrously wrong. The first installment that payment $4.8 billion be wasted, propping currency long enough, words one IMF official, let oligarchs get their money out country. then Yeltsin reverse his commitments, let ruble devalue anyway, begin print money abandon and fire virtually every reformer his government result collapse IMF agreements and indefinite suspension its aid program. Now, IMF and Capitol Hill, there be recriminations who lose Russia. Publicly, Fischer argue that there be no apologies owe what we attempt Russia. But some IMF officials complain privately that they let Rubin and Summers run roughshod them, strike deal that fell apart weeks russian parliament rebel and Yeltsin back away his commitments. Summers respond that United States take calculate risk because it be vastly good that Russia succeed not succeed. The russian collapse touch new rounds economic contagion, investors flee Latin America, and trigger huge losses hedge funds long Term Capital, Greenwich, Conn., investment firm that need be rescue Wall Street powerhouses whose money it have invested. Russia be turn point, say Robert Hormats, vice chairman Goldman, Sachs &AMP; Co. It make world realize that some countries can fail, if IMF and Treasury intercede. And that change perception risk. Now, countries meet face future that IMF have warn could be very bleak, they need reverse those perceptions, or watch countries slowly starve lack capital. The emerge markets be call controls short term investments. The french want strong IMF. The Americans say answer be more disclosure, so that investors be good warned, and tough regulation. These be nice, quiet meetings; everyone very polite, top U.S. official say earlier this week. not this year. Ukraine's parliament Friday refuse approve President Leonid Kuchma's decree establish state fund compensate people savings lose banks. Deputies vote 240-47 prepare revise version decree and debate it later month. They must consider decree Oct. 10, or else it automatically take effect constitution. Leftist factions, which vote propose legislation, say it would not fully guarantee return savings lose financial instability that have recently hit Ukraine. The fund Kuchma propose establish would have accumulate money special National Bank account and repay people case bank they keep their savings go bankrupt or become insolvent. Although decree provide compensation deposits amount only 500 hryvna (dlrs 147 current exchange rate), its authors say it would cover more 90 percent Ukrainians who keep their money banks. The measure be mean prevent mass withdrawals deposit that most ukrainian banks have already experience people, scar fall national currency and turmoil neighbor Russia, start stock food, clothing and household goods. Government officials say that Ukrainians have recently withdraw least 10 percent 3 billion hryvna (dlrs 882 million) they deposit banks. Russia's new prime minister pick unusual way reassure nation Thursday. After two weeks deliberations he announce that he still have no plan rescue country its economic crisis. I want repeat once more there be no program, Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov said. It have be work out. In most nations such statement might provoke alarm. But Primakov be seek calm anxious public that be worry that Kremlin's cure could be bad disease. It be not if Russians do not have something be concern about. Thursday Primakov convene meet top aides try hammer out strategy overcome economic woes. A main item agenda be plan draft Yuri Maslyukov, Communist and government's senior policy maker economic issues. It not take long Maslyukov's plan hit street. A newspaper, Kommersant Daily, publish it full Thursday morning. not surprisingly Maslyukov's plan call great state role economy, include controls hard currency. A new State Bank Reconstruction and Development would be establish use nationalized assets fail commercial banks. Wages and pensions would be pay two months, and minimum wage would be indexed inflation. There would be huge tax cuts, combination that suggest that government be commit print additional money. The exchange rate ruble would be set central bank, base changes inflation and balance payments. Maslyukov's plan also imply that Russians would be able buy dollars exchanges country. It stipulate that hard currency could enter country only special authorization. Exporters would be require sell most their hard currency reserves. That be allusion currency control that send shock waves russian public. Russians have come treat dollar second currency, and many people have squirreled away dollars hedge inflation. It be obvious stupidity, Otto Latsis, commentator newspaper Noviye Izvestiya, said. People won't give their dollars away. They will go black market if they need to. Yegor Gaidar, former prime minister who favor free markets, say plan be war dollar and predict that it would lead shortage imports. As criticism grew, Primakov rush distance himself talk currency controls. The rumors state's become monopolist inflow hard currency country be nonsense, he said, assert that document publish Kommersant Daily be just one six possible plans. Primakov may be oppose wildly unpopular currency controls. He may be worry that plan would would set panic buying dollars, further depress ruble. Or he may simply be try keep his distance Maslyukov's plan while Russia try wrangle its next disbursement, $4.3 billion, International Monetary Fund. The particulars could be modified, many people maneuver say they believe that it represent basic thrust government's thinking. Primakov have call great state regulation and expansion money supply, two themes Maslyukov's plan. The plan also have many similarities plan presented government Gorbachev-era advisers. We think it be close be final document, say United Financial Group, Russian investment business. It be unclear how long Primakov can carry spell out detailed strategy. The oust tax chief, Boris Fyodorov, have argue that IMF should not provide further aid Primakov have take tough measures build free market. Primakov has, however, seek turn that logic its head, arguing that his government's economic strategy will depend fund's willingness provide aid. His aim appear be pressure fund implying that it will be fund's fault if Russia be force default its loans or take draconian measures home. Or Primakov put it Thursday, fund's money, Russia will have impose unpopular measures. Wall Street extend global stock selloff Thursday Dow industrials tumble more 200 points second straight day. The Dow Jones industrial average, which plunge 237.90 points Wednesday, fell additional 210.09, or 2.7 percent, close 7,632.53. broad market indicators also sink sharply heavy trading.

The United States be disappointed economic confusion new russian government Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov, say Secretary State Madeleine Albright Friday, and she warn Russia dangers anti-western policy. In her first comprehensive review u.s.-russian relations Primakov be confirm prime minister last month, Albright say Washington be deeply concerned Russia's direction and not think crisis there would soon abate. We have hear lot talk recent days print new money, index wages, imposing price and capital controls and restore state management parts economy, she tell U.S.-Russia Business Council Chicago. We can only wonder if some members Primakov's team understand basic arithmetic global economy. While praise Primakov, once her counterpart when he be foreign minister, pragmatist able cooperate key issues Washington, she have harsh words warn him. Our initial reaction some direction he's go have not be particularly positive, she said, adding, The question now be whether that cooperation can continue. The United States must keep its aid Russia be adjust it promote build democracy and student exchanges well arms control, Albright said. Washington do not favor more direct aid. more big bailouts be not themselves go restore investor confidence Russia, she said. In long run, gap Russia's need and its resources must be meet not foreign bailouts foreign investment. Albright sharply criticize self-defeating many voices Russia who want shift emphasis Russia's interaction America and our allies one partnership one assertiveness, opposition and defiance its stake. Russia could not stand alone world, she said, and United States' ability help Russians help themselves will go be merely very, very difficult be absolutely impossible. At same time, she said, Washington would not assume worst, there be still plenty people Russia who will fight turn back clock. And she urge world and american critics be patient workings democratic process Russia and not start each day take census reformers Kremlin, census that american officials themselves promote President Boris Yeltsin dismiss previous government. While Moscow may continue oppose any NATO use force serbian forces southern province Kosovo, Albright said, NATO must be prepare act regardless. If Communist Party have its way and it have be plan months millions Russians will take streets Wednesday some big demonstrations years. But now that Communists or politicians communist stamp approval be run country and its economy question be what marchers will be demonstrate against. President Boris Yeltsin and his economic advisers be easy targets two months ago. But Yeltsin seem shadow himself today, and his advisers be gone. The Communists, who have undergone sort resurgence playing discontent, be work hard cast themselves outsiders government that they help run and keep focus protests Wednesday Yeltsin and his policies. even that strategy may backfire, however, because discontent Yeltsin do not necessarily translate support his predecessors. An adviser Communist Party leader, Gennadi Zyuganov, make headlines not long ago when he call new government bourgeois. The characterization be striking, because new prime minister, Yevgeny Primakov, be one Zyuganov's top choices post. The deputy prime minister charge economy, Yuri Maslyukov, be Communist Party figure who once head Gosplan, infamous central-planning program that help bring Soviet Union ruin. We don't have slogans that be aim government, first secretary Moscow Communist Party committee, Alexander Kuvayev, say recent interview. All slogans be aim president and economic course country. only president can fully be blame course that have bring country this situation. Anger Russia's fate, and their own, be draw some Russians back soviet-style slogans and old-style hostility capitalism. The ardently pro-communist newspaper Sovietskaya Rossiya devote most its front page Thursday what it say be results contest readers protest slogans. The entries range catchy kitschy, from, Legislator, official, banker study Constitution; exam be Oct. 7, to, Imperialist! Help Russia return export capital, and we will pay debts once. Russia have see nothing approach this sort economic chaos and despair 1993, when hyperinflation sweep economy. There be no real way know whether late travails will produce huge and ugly crowds or small, peaceful ones. A deputy editor and political analyst newsweekly, Itogi, Masha Lipman, say situation be not that 1993, when Yeltsin sought, and won, popular mandate referendum. He use it dissolve Communist-dominated Parliament and increase his power. That lead autumn showdown, shell Parliament tanks and total defeat, time being, Yeltsin's legislative opponents. You can interpret this demonstration Communist mandate, I don't think they will act Yeltsin, Ms. Lipman said. Support Communists be its small level, maybe 20 percent. In survey 1,714 people that be release last week all-russian Public Opinion Center say that nearly half population support idea demonstrations yeltsin, that barely one-tenth be likely participate any way. nobody be interested any sort struggle, Yuri Levada, who head center, say interview. This be mainly general expression great wave distrust authorities, mainly president. He's great scapegoat all our sins. There seem be little enthusiasm demonstrations any sort. only few thousand people turn out Sunday fifth anniversary shelling Parliament and Yeltsin's subsequent triumph Communists. The Communist Party and Federation Independent Russian Unions, leftist organization that say it be main sponsor protests, predict that 9 million Russians will participate Wednesday. The government have vow keep order resort force. But it be concern enough that it have summon 11,000 police officers patrol Moscow and 6,000 military troops intervene if violence erupts. Protests 1993 have generally be tepid, deep-seated feeling here. Some demonstrations last week, more or less practice runs, hint similarly dampen marches this year. President Boris Yeltsin would respond strongly any effort prohibit Russians buy foreign currencies, believe move would be bring another Iron Curtain country, his spokesman say Friday. The president clearly understand that such ban would be clear violation our rights ... that would mean return Iron Curtain everyday life, say presidential spokesman Dmitry yakushin. The remarks come media reports government economic plan work that would prohibit Russians buy U.S. dollars and other foreign currencies, and institute other strict economic controls, roll back seven years reforms. Though government officials say such plan be only one six possibilities, Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov warn Thursday that he might be force take unpopular measures rescue russian economy if it do not receive next installment dlrs 22.6 billion loan International Monetary Fund. Central Bank Chairman Viktor Gerashchenko and Finance Minister Mikhail Zadornov fly Washington Friday negotiations IMF dlrs 4.3 billion installment. IMF officials have say they want russian government come sound economic program loan be given, and have make it clear that currency controls and boost money supply print rubles be not acceptable. But Primakov say that country's plan would be dependent IMF loan, not other way around. No short-term economic plan will be know another three weeks, long IMF be set make its decision, say First Deputy Prime Minister Vadim Gustov. A draft version government's fourth-quarter budget would rely heavily IMF loan, Kommersant newspaper said. Without loan, government would have engage major deficit spending. Calls Soviet-style controls part plan draft First Deputy Prime Minister Yuri Maslyukov and leak press have apparently create rift Cabinet. The plan draw heavy criticism Zadornov, and Gerashchenko call idea ban foreign currency sales mad idea. Meanwhile, Russia's stock market drop 5 percent 38.8 Friday, trading be so light downward move mean little. The stock market have continue fall crisis hit Aug. 17. And tax collection be September, result collapse Russia's banking system, say Alexander Pochinok, head government's finance and credit department. Revenues total 14.3 billion rubles (dlrs 875 million), 700 million rubles (dlrs 43 million) less expected. The government want reverse this trend raise taxes oil and gas companies, idea be expect meet sharp resistance lower house Russia's parliament, which want cut tax rates, Pochinok said. Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov say Saturday that economic crisis would not bring end government's program privatize state property. Privatization will be accomplish growth production, growth investment and growth production effectiveness renewal major funds, Primakov say meeting western businessmen. We shall conduct privatization so that it serve interests people, state, and business, he said, accord ITAR-Tass news agency. Primakov reassure businessmen, members prime minister's consultive council foreign investment Russia, that government have no plans ban circulation U.S. dollars Russia. But, he said, government would take steps staunch flow dollars Russia. respond media reports government economic plan that would prohibit Russians buy U.S. dollars and other foreign currency, Primakov say reports absolutely do not correspond reality, ITAR-Tass quote him saying. He say there be no need regulate influx dollars russia, government should take steps prevent what he call dollar drain. russian companies stash dlrs 2.5 billion country September alone, Interfax news agency report Friday, quote central bank figures. Primakov say foreign investors be force that will help Russia minimize its losses current economic crisis. We be very much interested foreign investments, especially ones that go real production sector, Primakov said, accord Interfax. We need continuous dialogue foreign investors, whom it will be difficult us overcome current difficulties. He say Russia want long-term investments. Foreign capital have be come country short-term operations, Primakov said. This, he said, be not our liking or yours. Viktor Gerashchenko, central bank chairman, say Friday that government must act stem flow dollars Russia. Gerashchenko and Finance Minister Mikhail Zadornov be Washington Saturday annual meeting International Monetary Fund, where they plan spell out measures Russia be take bail out its finance system. Russia want IMF release second dlrs 4.3 billion installment loan that be approve July, month country's economy crash and government effectively default its foreign loans. IMF officials have say they want russian government come sound economic program installment be given, and have make it clear that currency controls and boost money supply print rubles be not acceptable. In season crash banks, plunge rubles, bounce paychecks, fail cropsand rotate governments, maybe it be not ultimate insult. But nation that bore Tolstoy and Chekhov, and still regard well-written letter labor love, be buckle little this week, because it can no longer wish good health Baba Anya Omsk. The Post Office be broke. In 60 country's 89 statelike regions, more 1,000 mail cars have be sidetracked, many stuff 18 tons letters, newspapers and parcels. The state Railway Ministry refuse carry more mail Post Office make good some 210 million rubles old bills $13 million today's dollars, or $35 million dollars six weeks ago. Air mail, which amount one every four or five letters, be also suspend one Moscow's major airports this week, when Post Office cough 5 million rubles old bills. A second airport be still demand 3 million rubles past-due debts. so much mail be back that post offices Moscow and elsewhere have simply stop accept out-of-town mail, areas that can be easily reach truck. Delivery schedules have fall weeks, and perhaps months, behind. The situation be really extraordinary, say Vladimir Sherekhov, deputy chief mail service administration government's Communications Committee. We've never have anything this before. Maybe Post Office have be lucky. Extraordinary be rule elsewhere Russia. Until Friday, low house Parliament be prepare sue government failure provide soap, heat, toilet paper and copy-machine paper legislature's monumental downtown offices. It turn out that politicians have exhaust their funds cut short their recess and return address nation's economic crisis. Earlier week, officials say Russia's Arctic shipping routes may close next month because half nation's icebreakers be disrepair and there be no money fix them. The old ships be so ancient that its nickname be Granny. such anecdotal evidence that Russia be lose its wheels, one its old, ill-maintained Volga sedans, be everywhere. But oddly, real signs public distress be not particularly common, perhaps because system rarely seem shed part big postal system. If U.S. Postal Service be increasingly pipeline sweepstakes notices and bills, Russian Post Office still hold special place national conversation. Russians still write letters each other, frequently and fervently, and many remote regions get their news mail. Millions use mail ship can goods and other provisions needy relatives and friends faraway areas, especially vital service winter. And last few years, Post Office have become vehicle grow mail-order trade books, clothes and other catalog items not readily available big cities. exactly why all this have rumble halt be some dispute. What be clear be that Post Office and Railway Ministry suffer what ail every russian venture, private and public alike: nobody pay his bills. The state Railway Ministry complain that it be continually stiffed customers who believe railroads be honor-bound carry freight whether they be pay or not. The government have specify nearly 40 categories freight which railroad must carry next nothing. Among big deadbeats be power ministries military and interior departments which not pay soviet times and feel little need pay now. It's psychology form socialist period, say Tatiana Pashkova, deputy spokeswoman ministry, and same situation exist Post Office. We've be dispute very long time. Always we try understand their differences. But we can't carry cargo free. No kidding, say Post Office: It, too, be owe 200 million rubles government agencies, and be bar raise rates though freight costs be outstrip revenues. Moreover, Post Office be also required government carry some forms mail, such pension checks, reduce rates. Officials state Communications Department say they also suspect ulterior motive railroads' actions: struggle dominate thrive mail-order business. Here's competition us and railroad delivery parcels, and I think decisions make railroads be mainly explain this competition, Sherekhov said. They blame us carry some commercial cargoes instead mail. The Railways Ministry's spokeswoman, Ms. Pashkova, say such commercial cargoes be indeed problem, only because railroads know that Post Office have already get cash transport packages. The railroads be still wait their share that money, she said. In meantime, situation have come boil. In late September railroads cut mail service and out Moscow, effectively decapitate postal system and forcing officials draft fleet trucks move letters and out city. Hundreds empty and full rail cars have clog some local yards point where move cars position unloading have become difficult. At last count, 39 loaded cars be await service one yard. And customers be get angry. We've get all kinds complaints, say Viktor Salikov, deputy Communications Department's mail shipping center. People be come us, search mail that be send weeks ago.

","In early October 1998 Turkey moved 10,000 troops to the Syrian border accusing its neighbor of harboring Kurdish rebels and their leader Abdullah Ocalan.Syria denied the charges and blamed Turkey's belligerence on its military alliance with Israel.As the dispute threatened to ignite the whole volatile region, Egypt's President Mubarak launched a mediation effort soon joined by Iran and Jordan.Saudi Arabia, Yemen, Sudan, Lebanon and Greece voiced support for Syria, but all called for a diplomatic solution.Israel did not take sides urging diplomatic talks and insisting that Israeli-Turkish military cooperation played no role in the crisis.","Tensions rose between Syria and Turkey over claims that Syria harbored Kurdish rebels, Turkey's growing ties with Israel, and Turkish dams on the Euphrates.Turkey sent 10,000 troops to the Syrian border.Israel declared non-involvement and limited border exercises.Egypt's President traveled to Syria and Turkey to mediate.Jordan urged the interests of the region and offered to mediate, as did Iran.Lebanon denied harboring Kurds, sided with Syria and blamed Israel for tensions, but urged peace.Greece said Turkey undermined stability but urged neighbors to get along.The Saudis, Yemen and Sudan supported Syria but urged peace.Assad was to visit Turkey.","Tensions between Syria and Turkey increased as Turkey sent 10,000 troops to its border with Syria.The dispute comes amid accusations by Turkey that Syria helping Kurdish rebels based in Syria.Kurdish rebels have been conducting cross border raids into Turkey in an effort to gain Kurdish autonomy in the region.Egyptian President Mubarek has been involved in shuttle diplomacy to the two states in an effort to defuse the situation and Iraq also has offered to mediate the dispute between the two countries.Although Israel has tried to demonstrate its neutrality, Lebanon has charged That Israel is the cause of the tensions between Syria and Turkey.","On October 1, Turkey moved 10,000 troops toward the Syrian border, and later sent jets along--possibly across--the border.Turkey warned Syria it could no longer tolerate Syria's sheltering Kurdish rebels in Syria and Lebanon's Bekaa Valley.Fighting with Kurdish rebels began in 1984.The Syrian denial included claims that Turkey was taking water and had a strategic alliance with Israel.Egypt, then Iran and Jordan, sought to defuse the situation and find a diplomatic solution for the two Muslim nations.Greece, predictably, chided Turkey, while Israel denied involvement and limited its military activities along the Syrian border."

31,"Endeavour's astronauts connect first two building blocks international space station Sunday, create seven-story tower shuttle cargo bay. It be first time that Russian-built Zarya control module and made-in-america Unity chamber have ever touched. It look be perfect and, hopefully, long-lasting fit. We have capture Zarya, commander Robert Cabana announce two pieces come together. Congratulations crew good ship Endeavour, reply Mission Control. That's terrific. The 240-mile-high construction job begin two hours earlier Nancy Currie's capture Zarya (russian Sunrise) use shuttle robot arm. We're halfway home, Cabana said. then come hard part: stack two giant cylinders cargo bay. The two station pieces be so big 77 feet tip one tip other combine mass 70,000 pounds that Currie and her crewmates have rely computerize vision system and camera views, rather direct line sight. This be first time such blind dock have ever be attempted. Currie position solar-winged Zarya, still end shuttle robot arm, several inches directly Unity. It be slow going; she want and need perfect alignment. Once she be sure she have it, Cabana fire Endeavour's thrusters, and brief burst raise shuttle and thereby Unity enough dock mechanisms two station components snap together. The historical moment occur South Pacific. The union intend last station's 15-year or more lifetime set stage spacewalk two astronauts Monday attach electrical connectors and cables two components. Mission Control think Sunday's work might take hours longer plan and give six astronauts plenty time tasks. But everything occur more or less when and how it be suppose to, aside piece space junk that stray too close. Before begin their final approach Zarya, six astronauts have steer clear chunk rocket launch last month California. Mission Control order pilots fire shuttle thrusters put extra three miles Endeavour and space junk, put Endeavour total five miles orbit debris. The small gap would have be probably little too close comfort, Mission Control said. The big worry, far, be Endeavour's pursuit and capture Zarya, and its coupling Unity. The shuttle's 50-foot robot arm have never handle object massive 41-foot, 44,000-pound Zarya, power and propulsion module that be launch Kazakstan Nov. 20. It will provide all necessary electricity and steer fledgling space station permanent control module can be launch next summer. Minutes Zarya's capture, Cabana call that two antennas module be still undeployed russian flight controllers have feared. The antenna must be fully deploy order Zarya's manual docking system work; that system won't be need next summer, officials said. The only other problem be Zarya battery; astronauts take replacement part. The 36-foot, 25,000-pound Unity, first American-made component, will serve connect passageway, or vestibule, future modules. It be crucial that Zarya and Unity be joined; if they could not be connect robot arm, NASA would have send out two spacewalk astronauts manually fit them together. In all, three spacewalks be plan Endeavour's 12-day flight, not only hook electrical connections two modules install handrails and other tools future crews. The joined modules will be release Endeavour once all work be completed. NASA estimate 43 more launches and 159 more spacewalks will be need this mission assemble entire orbit complex. once completed, 16-nation space station will have mass 1 million pounds, be long football field, and house seven astronauts and cosmonauts. WASHINGTON NASA and russian Space Agency have agree set aside last-minute russian request launch international space station orbit close Mir, officials announce Friday. While put new station closer Russia's 12-year-old Mir station would make it easy transfer equipment and supplies old outpost new one, request come too late be act on, say Randy Brinkley, NASA's space station program manager. NASA be surprise last week when Russia's prime station contractor propose orbital position change just two-and-a-half weeks launch first part new station. Delaying Nov. 20 flight 10 hours match orbits would have force similar shifts subsequent assembly flights, and result potentially unfavorable sun angles solar-powered station, engineers said. We have mutually conclude that it would not be prudent make these changes, Brinkley say news conference hold Johnson Space Center Houston. It add technical complexity and risks mission that be not justified. The decision, which follow frank and candid discussions two partners, be not impose United States, he said. The conclusions be mutual, Brinkley said. Both sides conclude that it not make sense. The Russians, struggle find money their space program their nation economic collapse, have say they want transfer thousands pound new equipment and scientific instruments Mir economy move. However, some critics question Russians' motives, wonder if request orbital change be part plan delay decommission and destruction Mir, which Russians have agree do next summer. The Russians have so little money that United States and other partners international station fear that money spend Mir will prevent Russia meet its obligations new project. The Mir compete international space station very critical resources and funding, Brinkley said. NASA will consider ideas salvage Mir's research equipment use international space station, he said, only if it do not interfere assemble new station. The United States and 15 other nations plan begin build new station orbit next week when Russians launch module that will supply power and propulsion early stages five-year construction period.

Mission Control order pilots fire shuttle thrusters put extra three miles Endeavour and space junk, put Endeavour total five miles orbit debris. The small gap would have be probably little too close comfort, Mission Control said. The big worry, far, be Endeavour's pursuit and capture Zarya, and its coupling Unity. The shuttle's 50-foot robot arm have never handle object massive 41-foot, 44,000-pound Zarya, power and propulsion module that be launch Kazakstan Nov. 20. It will provide all necessary electricity and steer fledgling space station permanent control module can be launch next summer. Minutes Zarya's capture, Cabana call that two antennas module be still undeployed russian flight controllers have feared. The antenna must be fully deploy order Zarya's manual docking system work; that system won't be need next summer, officials said. The only other problem be Zarya battery; astronauts take replacement part. The 36-foot, 25,000-pound Unity, first American-made component, will serve connect passageway, or vestibule, future modules. It be crucial that Zarya and Unity be joined; if they could not be connect robot arm, NASA would have send out two spacewalk astronauts manually fit them together. In all, three spacewalks be plan Endeavour's 12-day flight, not only hook electrical connections two modules install handrails and other tools future crews. The joined modules will be release Endeavour once all work be completed. NASA estimate 43 more launches and 159 more spacewalks will be need this mission assemble entire orbit complex. once completed, 16-nation space station will have mass 1 million pounds, be long football field, and house seven astronauts and cosmonauts. Endeavour's astronauts connect first two building blocks international space station Sunday, create seven-story tower shuttle cargo bay. It be first time that Russian-built Zarya control module and made-in-america Unity chamber have ever touched. It look be perfect and, hopefully, long-lasting fit. We have capture Zarya, commander Robert Cabana announce moment two pieces come together. Congratulations crew good ship Endeavour, reply Mission Control. That's terrific. The 240-mile-high construction job begin two hours earlier Nancy Currie's capture Zarya (russian Sunrise) use shuttle robot arm. We're halfway home, Cabana said. then come hard part: stack two giant cylinders cargo bay. The two station pieces be so big 77 feet tip one tip other combine mass 70,000 pounds that Currie and her crewmates have rely computerize vision system and camera views, rather direct line sight. This be first time such blind dock have ever be attempted. Currie position solar-winged Zarya, still end shuttle robot arm, several inches directly Unity. It be slow going; she want and need perfect alignment. Once she be sure she have it, Cabana fire Endeavour's thrusters, and brief burst raise shuttle and thereby Unity enough dock mechanisms two station components snap together. The historical moment occur South Pacific. It take several tries, however, Zarya and Unity be pull tightly together. The dock ring them would not retract properly; Mission Control quickly trace problem attach robot arm and ask crew release its hold dock Zarya. That trick. The union intend last station's 15-year or more lifetime set stage spacewalk two astronauts Monday attach electrical connectors and cables two components. Mission Control think Sunday's work might take hours longer plan and give six astronauts plenty time tasks.

For second day row, astronauts board space shuttle Endeavour Friday liftoff NASA's first space station construction flight. Let's go do this, say commander Robert Cabana. Amen, reply launch controller. Rain and cloudy skies be once again threat. But NASA be confident master alarm Endeavour's cockpit would behave; it go just 4{ minutes go countdown Thursday, force delay. NASA have only five minutes or less each day launch Endeavour order meet first space station part, which be put orbit two weeks ago Russians. The shuttle contain second station component. The master alarm blare and red lights flash just shuttle be lift early Thursday. By time controllers trace problem momentary drop hydraulic pressure and decide press ahead, it be too late they have miss cutoff second or two. Sure, it's frustrating, say Bill Readdy, shuttle program director and veteran shuttle commander. But we do things right. We do things book, and we're not go cut any corners if it mean just shave second or two. The six astronauts crawl out shuttle, and two throw their hands. Cabana hold his thumb and index finger half-inch apart: We be that close. The problem be confine one Endeavour's three hydraulic pressure units. The pressure drop just long enough trigger alarm, evidently because sensitive switch, then return normal. NASA engineers spend day examine problem, find nothing wrong any systems and be confident it would not reoccur. Endeavour's flight be already year late because cash crunch Russia, one NASA's partners build international space station. The one-day delay cost NASA $600,000, mostly fuel and overtime pay. Aboard Endeavour be american-made connect passageway name Unity. The astronauts will use shuttle robot arm capture russian space station piece and attach it Unity. Then, two spacewalkers will hook all electrical connections and cables two cylinders, and attach handrails and tools future crews. Until alarm sounded, it look though weather would be only problem. Rain and clouds move Atlantic 1{ hours liftoff, drift away minutes spare. Secretary State Madeleine Albright and other dignitaries world have gather drizzle see Endeavour and its crew off. here we have 16 countries cooperate venture future, say Albright, who be expect back Friday's attempt. This be good investment. The planet's most daring construction job begin Friday shuttle Endeavour carry orbit six astronauts and first u.s.-built part international space station that be expect cost more $100 billion. After last-minute alarm shuttle force postponement early Thursday, launch go flawlessly 3:36 Friday morning, right schedule. The night sky be clear, and moon full. With roar, Endeavour make its fiery ascent and briefly turn Florida coastline night day. More five minutes and 500 miles later, spaceship's main engines could still be see distance, twinkle new star. On their 12-day flight, Endeavour's astronauts be locate russian part already orbit, grasp it shuttle's robot arm and attach new U.S. module. Wielding tools hundreds miles Earth, work methodically cold void, astronauts will be start five-year assembly that be likely make construction Pyramids and great cathedrals look child's play. Construction station, which will be research facility, will require estimated 160 space walks, which, safety reasons, will always be do two people. When complete, international space station, dominate solar power arrays, will cover area equal that two football fields. Modules interconnect laboratories and live quarters seven astronauts be form habitat equal that two 747 jetliners. The station's batteries alone, if line up, would extend half-mile. The project entail high risk, because technical difficulty put all this together unforgiving environment space, dangers inherent fly space shuttle construction site. The work be far complicate international politics and worries money. The Russians, whose participation partnership clinch post-cold War deal five years ago, be now wild card. Moscow's economic and political woes have leave western officials unsure its ability and willingness come its share money and technology. At same time, station's costs be rising, and its critics scientists worry that its appetite money will consume their federal financing. The project's total cost be subject debate, most credible estimates now put price assembly and operation decade, station's estimate lifetime, $110 billion. Of that, american taxpayers be spend roughly $96 billion, and project's 15 foreign partners $14 billion. The station be intend be grand laboratory where, environment weightlessness, investigators can develop new materials and new drugs and explore physiology's remain mysteries, part so that humans may someday know how adapt long space flight other worlds. Friday, any case, little be hear project praise. Great show, Endeavour, mission control Houston radio six astronauts shuttle go orbit. At Florida spaceport, Secretary State Madeleine Albright laud launch team and new venture. That be truly, truly fantastic, she tell team liftoff. And it be important, she added, have so many nations work together kinds issues that 21st century be go be concern with. So my congratulations all you, secretary said. Stupendous work. The main cargo Thursday be Unity module, first u.s.-built station part. Small compare giants come three dozen shuttle flights assembly, unit be 18 feet long, weighs 13 tons and be serve connect hub other modules. Saturday, one astronauts, Lt. Col. Nancy Currie Army, be have shuttle's robot arm hoist Unity payload bay and secure it Endeavour's dock system, move unit horizontal vertical position. Then, Sunday, astronauts be rendezvous module know Zarya, or Sunrise, which Russia launch orbit Kazakhstan Nov. 20. Financed United States build Russia, Zarya, 41 feet long, be be kind tugboat embryonic station, furnish power and propulsion well communication and rendezvous abilities. When Endeavour's payload bay be 10 feet Zarya, Colonel Currie be reach out robot arm and pull Russian module position Unity. The mechanical arm have never move anything so big. Zarya, while completely weightless space, have 21 tons mass. If mishandled, it can crush and kill. As Col. Currie hold Zarya steady, Endeavour's commander, Col. Robert Cabana Marine Corps, veteran three space flights, be nudge shuttle forward join two station pieces together. When mat special attachments, Zarya and Unity will form station's first element, 63 feet long and 78 feet wide out tips solar arrays. start Monday, pair space-walking astronauts be hook electrical connections and data cables units, attach antennas and install tools and handrails future visitors. The builders will be Col. Jerry Ross Air Force, 50, and Dr. James Newman, 42, physicist. Their series three space walks will continue Wednesday and end Saturday, Dec. 12. As construction go outside, astronauts Endeavour will be busy make preparations enter new station connect tunnel and dock system. Next Thursday, crew will enter embryonic station first time, instal portable fans and lights. Friday they will again enter, prepare arrival 1999 next major element, first one built and finance Russia. The other astronauts Endeavour be its pilot, Maj. Frederick Sturckow Marine Corps, and mission specialist, Sergei Krikalev russian Space Agency. After separate new outpost, crew be bring Endeavour back Kennedy Space Center Dec. 15, mission length just shy 12 days. Gretchen McClain, NASA's director Washington international space station, say interview here that its overall costs be actually small individual Americans. Over its lifetime, she said, annual cost will equal that pizza and soft drink each nation's 96 million taxpayers. U.S. costs construction, she added, be $24 billion, and operations year 2012 be $10.4 billion, total $34.4 billion. most experts agency consider this figure ridiculously low because it ignore many billions dollars spend early development work well cost numerous shuttle flights, which run $800 million apiece. Following series intricate maneuvers and skillful use space shuttle Endeavour's robot arm, astronauts Sunday join first two many segments that will form international space station. The shuttle and its crew six snare Russian-made Zarya control module chase it Earth ever-closing orbits throughout day. Less hour rendezvous 240 miles earth shortly 6 p.m., Lt. Col. Nancy Currie Army deftly use 50-foot arm grab 40,000-pound cylinder craft pass Russia and slowly pull it shuttle. see Zarya close, Col. Robert Cabana Marines, shuttle commander, confirm that two antennas have fail deploy module its launch Kazakhstan Nov. 20. There be early indications that antennas, which will be use later station manually assist spacecraft dockings, have not extended. Currie take almost two hours painstakingly move Zarya American-made Unity dock port position Endeavour's cargo bay. When two pieces be align inches one another, Cabana fire small thruster rockets that raise shuttle, allow modules clamp together. The two station pieces, together measure 77 feet end end and have combine mass 70,000 pounds, be first 100 major components be united space next five years form orbit outpost that would weigh almost million pounds and span area size two football fields. more 40 additional missions U.S. shuttles and russian rockets will be use haul all components and other supplies orbit, and astronauts nations be spend almost 1,800 hours do spacewalks assemble entire structure. The spece station be expect cost its partnership 16 nations more $40 billion just construct. Bringing pieces together be only first step mat them. A pair astronauts be make three spacewalks this week, first Monday, which they will hook electrical and communications cables, remove covers, attach handrails and perform other tasks get modules work one unit. The most difficult part Sunday's mating $240 million Zarya $300 million Unity be bring them together shuttle caught Russian unit. Currie have use Canadian-built robot arm place Zarya top Unity be able see where pieces joined. Unity, raise Endeavour's cargo bay Saturday, be so large that it block Currie's view mating fixtures shuttle's windows. She use views remote cameras and computerize vision system build arm estimate relative positions two large segments. The computerized system examine markings modules, compute their relationship one another use marks and displayed results laptop computer. We've never do anything this before, Currie say flight, add that she have practice difficult maneuver more 100 times last two years. The flight Endeavour, which take Cape Canaveral, Fla., last Friday, have go accord plan early Sunday, when mission control order shuttle change its orbit slightly avoid piece space debris. Air Force space debris trackers note that shuttle be pass 1.6 miles spent stage american booster rocket launch last month. Although this be consider safe distance, shuttle controllers decide widen separation five miles extra precaution. Endeavour and its astronauts close Sunday capture first piece international space station, Russian-made Zarya control module that have be connect Unity chamber shuttle. stack two giant cylinders 240 miles Earth be consider most difficult part mission. The job fell Nancy Currie, shuttle crane operator who have deftly hoist and reposition Unity cargo bay Saturday. The two station pieces be so big 77 feet tip one tip other combine mass 70,000 pounds that Currie and her crewmates be go have rely computerize vision system and camera views, rather direct line sight. such blind dock have never be attempt before. Mission Control give astronauts plenty time tasks. The main thing I've try do last two years work this flight be make sure we have time. We have margin everything, say flight director Bob Castle. Before begin their final approach Zarya Russian Sunrise shuttle's six astronauts have steer clear chunk rocket launch last month California. Mission Control order pilots fire shuttle thrusters put extra three miles Endeavour and space junk, put Endeavour total five miles orbit debris. The small gap would have be probably little too close comfort, Mission Control said. The big worry, far, be Endeavour's pursuit and capture Zarya, and its coupling Unity. The shuttle's 50-foot robot arm have never be assign handle object massive 44,000-pound Zarya, power and propulsion module that be launch Kazakhstan Nov. 20. It will provide all necessary electricity and steer fledgling space station permanent control module can be launch next summer. The 36-foot, 25,000-pound Unity will serve connect passageway, or vestibule, future modules. In case Zarya and Unity could not be connect robot arm, two spacewalking astronauts would have manually fit them together. The astronauts would be go out anyway Monday attach electrical connectors and cables two components. In all, three spacewalks be plan Endeavour's 12-day flight. NASA estimate 43 more launches and 159 more spacewalks will be need this mission assemble entire orbit complex. once completed, 16-nation space station will have mass 1 million pounds, be long football field, and house seven astronauts and cosmonauts.

A last-minute alarm force NASA halt Thursday's launch space shuttle Endeavour, mission start assemble international space station. Another attempt Endeavour and its crew six astronauts be schedule Friday 3:36 a.m. This be first time three years, and 19 flights, that shuttle countdown have be stop spaceship be fuel and crew craft and ready go. The uncommon delay prompt frowns and furrow brows here, although officials stress that it be entirely warranted. We want err conservative side, Ralph Roe, launch director Kennedy Space Center, say news conference sudden halt countdown just 19 seconds liftoff. Everything have be go smoothly rare nighttime launching, set 3:58 Thursday morning. The weather, forecast be iffy, turn out be fine, and sky be alight nearly full moon. But length so-called launching window was, planned, unusually short only 10 minutes. That brevity be result Endeavour's have rendezvous space-station part that Russia put orbit last month. The show-stopper arose four minutes liftoff when computer space shuttle set master alarm. Controllers study data and discover momentary pressure drop one hydraulic systems that control movements shuttle's engines and its rudder and other flight surfaces. Officials eventually decide that pressure drop be insignificant, and they resolve press ahead. But then it be too late: time have run out one procedures need keep shuttle's fuel supercold. So countdown be abort just 19 seconds blastoff. The six astronauts begin emerge shuttle hour later and ultimately head bed rest another attempt early Friday. ","On Friday the shuttle Endeavor carried six astronauts into orbit to start building an international space station.The launch occurred after Russia and U.S. officials agreed not to delay the flight in order to orbit closer to MIR, and after a last-minute alarm forced a postponement.On Sunday astronauts joining the Russian-made Zarya control module cylinder with the American-made module to form a 70,000 pounds mass 77 feet long.NASA estimates 43 more launches and 159 more space walks are needed to assemble the complex.When completed the 16-nation space station will be longer than a football field.It will be used to study adaptation to space flight.","Russia and NASA jointly decided against a Russian cost-cutting proposal to orbit the 2nd space station, a 16-country cooperative project, closer to Mir, citing complexity, risk, and bad sun angles.After 5 years of assembly, the research station will house 7 people.A 12-day shuttle mission will attach the US Unity module to the Russian Zarya, already in orbit.Thursday's launch was delayed by a pressure drop.A 2nd attempt Friday was perfect.Unity was attached to Zarya in a blind docking using cameras and computer images.Electrical and cable connections come next.Unity will serve as a passageway for future modules.Two Zarya antennas failed to deploy.","After discarding a suggested change of orbit, the Russian Space Agency went ahead with plans to launch its Zarya module of the international space station on Nov. 20, 1998.Although delayed for a day, U.S. plans to launch the space shuttle Endeavour carrying the U.S. module Unity and six astronauts were carried out on Dec. 4.The astronauts' job was to connect Unity with the already-orbiting Zarya as the first step in assembling 100 major components of the planned space station.Using the shuttle's 50-foot robot arm, the two modules were joined setting the stage for a spacewalk by two astronauts the next day to attach electrical connectors and cables.","The International Space Station when completed will have a million pound mass and be longer than a football field.It will house up to seven space explorers.The initial assembly of space station components involves linking the US Unity, carried into space by the shuttle Endeavour, with the Russian Zarya.The Russians had asked for a different launch profile in order to be able to transfer equipment from its MIR station, but that was not possible.Endeavour astronauts successfully completed the complicated maneuvers to join the two space objects.NASA estimates that 43 more launches will be required to completely assemble the 16-nation space station."
33,"make their first collective decision monetary policy, 11 european nations launch common currency Jan. 1 cut interest rates Thursday surprise move that win market confidence. Ten 11 countries join european economic union drop their key interest rate 3 percent, Portugal make most significant plunge, 3.75 percent. Austria make small cut, 3.2 percent. The exception be Italy, which cut 4 3.5 percent. It be expect drop common rate time euro be launched. unify interest rate be critical step lay groundwork monetary union, and analysts generally expect rates settle level Germany's, 3.3 percent cut, now 3 percent. However, interest rate levels have become contentious political issue center-left governments Germany and France push rate cuts help spur growth and combat unemployment, stick 10.9 percent nations adopt euro. The head european Central Bank that will set monetary policy euro nations, Wim Duisenberg, again Thursday suggest governments should reform rigid labor markets create jobs, and not pressure him cut rates. The remarks Brussels cuts be make give no hint that rate drop be imminent, make clear his resistance political pressure be strong ever. so strong, fact, that Dutch Finance Minister Gerrit Zalm say he have fear bank would delay decision. What have be fear be that, order prove its independence, ECB would go its analysis and would wait longer, which would have be nonsensical, Zalm said. Hans Tietmeyer, who run German Bundesbank which ECB be modeled, hint rate cut be design boost confidence new currency, dampen global economic crises and Europe's worsen outlook. The coordinate rate cut could lead reduction current pessimism and reduction financial market turbulence, Tietmeyer said. The cuts seem have desire impact. Frankfurt's main index close 2.1 percent, while France's be 1.8 percent. The cuts also boost markets Spain, Belgium, Italy and Britain, which be not nations launch euro. The reaction is, `Oh good, they're do little bit prop euro economy.' But confidence have take quite hit Europe recently, and I think further action ECB will be need next year, maybe 2.5 percent, James Mitchell, senior london-based strategist Nomura. An economist Banque Bruxelles Lambert, Liesbeth Van de Craen, say cuts be timely. We be clearly head slowdown, she said. Until recently, Europe's economies have hold out relatively well damage Asia and Russia's economic crises and unstable financial markets. But just two days ago, Duisenberg paint bleak picture Europe's economies, warn growth will likely slow 2.5 percent next year earlier expectations 3 percent. The rate cuts may help. By make it cheap borrow money, rate cuts can lead more investment and new businesses, make it less worthwhile and inducing people spend. That expand economy. The 11 countries launch euro be Austria, Belgium, Ireland, Italy, Finland, France, Germany, Luxembourg, Netherlands, Spain and Portugal. Wim Duisenberg, head new european Central Bank, say interview publish Wednesday that he won't step complete half his term earlier agreed. I have hop you wouldn't ask me that question. The answer be no, Duisenberg tell Le Monde daily, which have ask him if he would step four years job. Duisenberg be name this spring head new european Central Bank, which will govern policies euro, new single currency which go effect Jan. 1. France surprise its euro partners propose its central banker, Jean-Claude Trichet, last minute job Duisenberg be expect secure easily. Although he be elect easily, Duisenberg agree step four years his eight year term although he have say no such gentleman's agreement exists. Duisenberg tell Le Monde, newspaper that fervently have back euro, that the introduction new currency be most significant step so far european unification. However, he say that he would see further political integration, especially area foreign tax and social policies. China make trade euro official Monday, announce authorization european common currency's use trade and financial dealings start Jan. 1. The expect announcement central People's Bank China and State Administration Foreign Exchange, carry official Xinhua News Agency, also authorize open euro accounts. Financial institutions, enterprises and individuals China can accept and use euro economic, trade and financial exchanges 11 members European Union effective January 1, 1999, Xinhua reported. In addition, they can convert, use and open euro accounts, it said. chinese officials have say government may convert proportion its dlrs 145 billion worth foreign exchange reserves euro currency's Jan. 1 debut. The 11 countries launch common currency be Austria, Belgium, Ireland, Italy, Finland, France, Germany, Luxembourg, Netherlands, Spain and Portugal. The annual inflation rate 11 nations that adopt euro their shared currency Jan. 1 fell 0.9 percent November, European Union's statistics agency report Wednesday. The fall continue steady decline inflation euro-zone year. Annual inflation stand 1 percent October and 1.6 percent November 1997, accord Eurostat's monthly report. In 15 nation EU whole, inflation fell 1 percent November compare 1.5 percent United States and 0.8 percent Japan. Germany, France, Italy, Spain, Netherlands, Belgium, Austria, Portugal, Finland, Ireland and Luxembourg be set adopt euro common currency midnight New Year's Eve. The late figures may hint trouble ahead euro-zone significant increases year Portugal and Ireland. With european Central Bank set common interest rate whole bloc, some economists fear low rate design boost core EU economies France and Germany may bring overheat small nations faster growth. There be good news Greece which be keep out euro-zone fail meet economic conditions joining, include low inflation. It's rate be 3.9 percent November 5 percent year before. Greece hop join euro-zone 2001. Denmark, Sweden and Britain decide stay out euro political reasons. Eurostat give rates November 1998, November 1997 brackets: Sweden, 0.1 (2.7); France, 0.2 (1.4); Germany, 0.6 (1.4); Austria, 0.5 (1.1); Luxembourg, 0.5 (1.5); Belgium, 0.6 (1.3 percent); Denmark, 1.1 (1.6); Netherlands, 1.5 (2.5); Finland, 0.9 (1.8); Britain, 1.4 (1.9); Spain, 1.4 (1.9); Italy, 1.7 (1.8); Portugal, 2.6 (1.9); Ireland, 2.2 (1.1); Greece, 3.9 (5). In his most candid remarks economy, european Central Bank President Wim Duisenberg say Friday that growth appear be slow 11 countries adopt EU common currency or euro Jan. 1. Despite area-wide survey that suggest moderation pace growth, Duisenberg say domestic demand will continue boost economy. He point also gradual improvement labor market conditions support growth, well interest-rate cuts 3.3 percent level euro-zone's lowest rate countries. Duisenberg, who speak event London, say Dec. 1 and Dec. 22 meetings Central Bank's policy-making body will gauge outlook inflation and EU economy. The bank, which will set monetary policy currency bloc, have be pressure politicians keep interest rates low help boost growth and create jobs. While inflation be its low levels decades just 1 percent euro-zone unemployment 11 nations remain stubbornly high 10.9 percent. struggle avoid be sideline continent-wide equities market promise Europe's soon-to-be-introduced single currency, French authorities say Thursday that Paris stock exchange would join alliance London and Frankfurt that be see precursor pan-european market. The Bourse Paris also announce that it would play host meeting Nov. 27 nine other european exchanges discuss steps and conditions need create unifying and competitive pan-european equity market. The two announcements show how introduction currency, euro, be reshape Europe's financial landscape, require Europeans think Continental rather national terms finance and business. And it suggest that exchange authorities Paris, ruffle announcement July strategic alliance London Stock Exchange and Deutsche Borse Frankfurt, have not only abandoned effort set rival market be also seek gain initiative organize Nov. 27 gathering. Some doubt remained, however, timing and technicalities french entry alliance. Foreign Minister Dominique Strauss-Kahn said, Paris be join this alliance creation January 1999 joint company. However, officials London and Frankfurt who welcome idea principle decline say whether timing and arrangements be far advanced strauss-kahn implied. I'm afraid I can't confirm anything that, spokeswoman London Stock Exchange said. The appearances be well ahead reality this point, say american banker, who speak condition anonymity. not only that, notion Europe-wide exchange raise technical questions compatibility not just trade systems also regulations govern stock market operations countries that will use euro begin January. That have lead some analysts forecast that pan-european exchange could not be and run 2000. There be awful lot issues be resolved, american banker said. The euro be be introduce electronic trading equities, bonds and futures and intergovernmental transfers. Notes and coins pocket money that shoppers and travelers will carry will be introduce only 2002. Initially, currency will group 11 european nations euro zone, leave Britain, Denmark, Sweden and Greece outside. With its concentration banking and trading, however, London be expect continue main market center. The prospect have heighten pressure consolidation exchanges. Stock market officials Milan, Madrid, Amsterdam and Brussels have indicate they would be interested join London-Frankfurt alliance, which will initially create single point liquidity trading British and german blue-chip issues.

Palm Pilot one hand, cellular phone other, Jean-Marc Routiers, 26, be juggle business call halfway London and Paris. When his phone go dead high-speed Eurostar train pull underwater tunnel that link England Continent, london-based french banker loosen his italian silk tie and introduce himself. I definitely describe myself European, he say fluent English he perfect work australian bank. I may get sentimental when they play Marseillaise, all practical things, I see myself citizen Europe. I lifestyle France, I don't make my living there. The year 1999 be official start-up date euro, common european currency that will unite 11 countries monetarily. But throughout Europe, different kind integration have already take root. Routiers, who be spend day Paris meet his bank's french clients, be vanguard new generation Europeans who do not have brace themselves shock new year. Mobile, fluent several languages and aggressively non-nationalistic, they be already live kind borderless, cosmopolitan existence that single european currency be suppose advance. They do not share their parents' memories World War II or their parents' sense national identity. People worry when they hear talk common european defense policy because it suggest that end day, we have one government, say Kleon Papadopoulos, Greek banker base London. Countries be afraid lose their sovereignty, I don't see it bad thing. If government be good, stable and efficient, who care if it be base Berlin or Athens? Papadopoulos, 36, who study business United States and Britain, could serve model new Europeans. He work swiss bank London, speak Greek, English and French, and year have traveled, other places, Belgium, United States, Cuba, Switzerland and Italy. Like hundreds thousands other Europeans, he choose London and its busy financial markets best place work. He say he do not feel if he live England. He live London, clubhouse financial Europe. And membership have its privileges. Papadopoulos live fashionable Knightsbridge area, drives Porsche he buy Brussels, and work out fashionable gym Carleton Towers. I go London School Economics 1984, and only other `foreigners' I meet be Middle East, he says. now friends and co-workers be Italian, French, Greek, Spanish, German, Russian. You feel it everywhere. The streets be jam foreigners. not tourists people who live and work here. Baby-boomers Europe describe themselves 1968 generation, wean protest and social turmoil that convulse european societies 30 years ago. Less dramatic equally significant be 1968 law guarantee freedom movement what be then six countries Common Market. A Frenchman could work Holland, Italian could work Germany permit. Back then some economists dourly predict huge migrations, particularly unskilled laborers move southern countries more prosperous north. Actually, huge industries steel shrink 1970s and '80s, so job opportunities working-class Europeans. There be 15 countries what be now european Union, only small percentage their citizens have move other countries, accord estimates prepared Eurostat. Those who do mostly find jobs service industry waiters, maids or garbage collectors. There be still legal barriers prevent most doctors, lawyers and academics find work other countries. so far european Union have be most profitably put use white-collar business executives who eagerly follow career opportunities national borders, time zones and language barriers. Twenty-five years ago that kind mobility be preserve far small elite, top executives major companies or multinational corporations. Technology, high-speed trains ever-evolving apparatus business lap-top computers, cell phones, fax machines have make european mobility accessible mid-level managers, young entrepreneurs and students. Cable television, which allow Germans watch italian game shows or Swedes watch french news programs, have spread Zeitgeist masses. This year Superga, Italian brand sports clothes and shoes, open major advertising campaign series magazine ads that show fashionable young people saucily cavort european leaders leggy young woman push her bicycle steps Elysee Palace greet President Jacques Chirac, young man playfully stick his tongue out window plane former German chancellor, Helmut Kohl. This kind ad would not have be possible five or 10 years ago, say Aldo Cernuto, executive creative director Milan office Pirella Gottsche Lowe, international advertising agency. now european unification be TV all time; it have seep people's unconscious. even people who do not care politics recognize face Tony Blair or Jacques Chirac. Ten years ago, very few people did. accord European Union, Britain have twice many EU citizens France, it be not country high concentration residents other european countries. accord estimates base surveys prepare Eurostat, nearly third residents tiny Luxembourg, which have low unemployment and high standard living, be other european countries. Belgium, which have european Commission and NATO headquarters, be second, 5.4 percent. Paradoxically, perhaps, Britain, one major european nation that have hold join euro, be widely view nerve center new cosmopolitanism, headquarter New Europeans bankers and business executives draw London's financial district, more flexible bureaucracy and universality English language. perhaps just surprisingly, London also serve example another less obvious aspect european cosmopolitanism breakdown certain social barriers. study abroad be once privilege reserve sons and daughters Europe's elite. now European Union have 12-year-old scholarship program, call Socrates-Erasmus, that this year allow 200,000 european university students 5 percent EU's entire university population study other countries Union year, free. In last 20 years, business schools Europe have multiplied, and most offer u.s.-style MBA programs that teach american approach business. This too have allow measure meritocracy creep european business. Juergen Schrempp, head Daimler, start car mechanic, note Stephen Szabo, professor European Affairs Johns Hopkins University School International Studies Washington. That would have be unthinkable Germany 20 years ago. Social mobility, moreover, be fuel movement. When people transfer another country, they find it easy shed psychological or cultural trappings home. I could never have kind job I have have I stay Paris, Routier explained. France be still very hierarchical. Bosses want know where you go school, what your father does. In London, none that matters long you make money. many Britons still view their country weigh heavy class distinctions. For example, Tony Smith, 36, editor several Portuguese magazines Lisbon, seize opportunity study Vienna 14 years ago, and never look back. He have live all Europe, and be fluent Portuguese, Spanish, German, French and Serbo-Croatian. His father, car mechanic, have not travel out Britain 1992. Smith say he could never have succeed well have he stay home. I didn't go public schools or Oxbridge, he explained. I'm not say its impossible, it would have be much more difficult England. Yet Continental Europeans who flock London find themselves bypass english society and join cosmopolitan world where birth and breeding do not matter much. Ildiko Iliffe, 30, choose work London escape sexism she encounter Continent. Mrs. Iliffe, who be Hungarian, speaks fluent English, German, French and Italian, and meet her canadian husband, Roger Iliffe, 30, while be attend University Bocconi business school Milan 1995. Like his wife, Iliffe speak four languages and have live and travel all world. She work eastern european desk british bank; he work major international consulting firm. originally they plan work Italy, Mrs. Iliffe say prevailing attitude work women there make it impossible her find good job. I go job interviews italian banks and they only ask me my husband's job, she say grimace. And they make it clear that they be afraid I would get pregnant and ask maternity leave. Philippe Haspeslagh, 48, professor Insead, prestigious international business school Fontainebleau, Paris, call Mrs. Iliffe's choices cherry-picking choose best deal herself. As he put it, If they cannot find what they want one country, they can pick and seek it elsewhere. twenty-five years ago, Haspeslagh be pioneer when he same thing. A Belgian who study business Harvard, he live and teaches France and do consult work all Europe, Sweden Czech Republic. The message his cell phone be three languages French, Flemish and English. His students, generation him, see nothing exceptional his transnationalism. These Europeans form advance guard that be still relatively small numbers, experts say they carry disproportionate influence their societies. In Germany, example, it be business people who be push ahead change and pulling politicians them kick and screaming, Szabo said. They be look large market and feel competitive pressures globalization. Politicians be respond domestic constituency. They be answer international one.

Jose Saramago become first writer Portuguese win Nobel Prize Literature Thursday. His personal delight be second burst public elation his homeland. Saramago, 75, and Portuguese say they be pleased swedish Academy have finally acknowledge literary contribution Portugal, small country 10 million people border Spain Europe's southwestern Iberian Peninsula. It have take all this century win Nobel Prize Portuguese language, Saramago say Frankfurt Book Fair, speak interpreter. Saramago, soft-spoken man know his hard-edged and iconoclastic views, say he share honor his country and he hop win prize would make Portugal and its language more visible and audible. I'm personally very happy myself. I'm also happy my country, he say Frankfurt Book Fair Germany where he be engulf well-wishers offer roses. Back home, President Jorge Sampaio say award be cause great collective satisfaction. Prime Minister Antonio Guterres say award be all prize Portugal and Portuguese language which be speak 180 million worldwide, mostly Brazil, also Portugal's five former colonies Africa. Saramago's controversial opinions and atheistic outlook have frequently clash establishment and general public. even day he win prize, Vatican newspaper L'Osservatore Romano attack swedish Academy's choice, describe Saramago old-school communist who have substantially antireligious vision. Undersecretary State Sousa Lara be so upset one Saramago's novels 1992 that he withdraw his name Portugal's nominees european Literature Prize. At time, Lara say Saramago's 1991 novel O Evangelho Segundo Jesus Cristo (The Gospel accord Jesus Christ) offend Portugal's Roman Catholic religious convictions and divide country. The book describe Christ who, subject human desires, live Mary Magdalene and tries back out his crucifixion. I have not come bring peace sword, say Saramago, atheist, time. He retreat disgust his spanish wife, Pilar del Rio, his home Lanzarote Spain's Canary Islands. He have never court kind fame offer literary prizes, and his bluntness can sometimes offend. I be skeptical, reserved, I don't gush, I don't go smiling, hug people and try make friends, he once said. A gaunt man wisps white hair, Saramago be bear Azinhaga, small town Lisbon. From poor family, he never finish university continue study part-time while support himself metalworker. His first novel, publish 1947 Terra do Pecado, or Country Sin be tale peasants moral crisis. It sell badly win enough recognition propel him welder's shop literary magazine. But next 18 years, Saramago, communist who oppose 41-year conservative dictatorship Antonio Salazar, publish only few travel and poetry books while he work journalist. He return fiction only Salazar's regime be topple military uprising 1974. Since 1980s, he have be one Portugal's best-selling contemporary writers and his works have be translate more 20 languages. He first win critical acclaim abroad his 1982 historical fantasy Memorial do Convento, publish english 1988 Baltasar and Blimunda. It be set catholic-inspired inquisition and explore war individuals and organize religion, pick Saramago's recur theme loner struggle authority. He be most frequently compare colombian writer Gabriel Garcia Marquez because his prose be root recognizable settings same time ting magical elements. The Nobel citation praise his work that parables sustain imagination, compassion and irony continually enable us apprehend elusory reality. Saramago remain prominent nonconformist his regular newspaper and radio commentaries, though his views be always inspire his deep concern his fellow man. Blindness, his most recent book be translate English, be unsettling allegory social meltdown inexplicable blindness sweeps society. This blindness isn't real blindness, it's blindness rationality, he said. We're rational beings we don't behave rationally. If we did, there'd be no starvation world. In 1989 The History Siege Lisbon, Lisbon proofreader mischievously insert word not text 12th century capture Portuguese capital Moors, thereby fictionally alter course european history stroke his pen. such historical and literary mischief be Saramago trademarks. In his 1986 book, The Stone Raft, Iberian Peninsula snap rest european continent and floats North Atlantic apparently metaphorical search identity away standardizing nature european Union, which Portugal and Spain be enthusiastic members. Saramago will receive dlrs 978,000 prize Dec. 10 Stockholm. Former U.S. President Jimmy Carter, who seem perennial Nobel Peace Prize also-ran, could have win covet honor 1978 have it not be strict deadline rules nominations. That prize be share egyptian President Anwar Sadat and Israeli Prime Minister Menachem Begin sign Camp David peace accords. However, five-member norwegian awards committee also want honor Carter broker pact, only be foil their rules. The Nobel committee want give prize all three, say Geir Lundestad, current committee's nonvoting secretary, say Sunday. But Carter have not be nominate when deadline run out. Nominations postmark Feb. 1 be accept that year's prize. The committee can add it nominations its first meeting year, early March. The Camp David accords be not sign Sept. 17, 1978, five weeks that year's peace prize be annouCkuld not give him prize, norwegian committee recognize 1978 awards citation positive initiative take President Jimmy Carter. Lundestad say committee, which work deep secrecy its five or six meetings year, try find loophole rules, which be overseen Swedish Nobel Foundation. The Nobel Prizes be endow Alfred Nobel, Swedish industrialist whose 355 inventions include dynamite. In his 1895 will, Nobel endow prizes, and say peace prize should be pick norwegian committee and rest swedish institutions. Lundestad say committee turn swedish Nobel Foundation advice Carter because it be question principle. Stig Ramel, Swede who be then director Nobel Foundation, advise break rules, Lundestad say telephone. Normally, committee refuse discuss candidates keep strict policy secrecy which selection details be seal 50 years. Lundestad make exception because Ramel reveal Carter dilemma his 1994 memoirs. Carter have repeatedly be nominate Nobel prize his consistent and wide-ranging peace efforts. He be also 139 candidates prize be announce Oslo Friday. However, early speculation lean more someone involve Northern Ireland peace process, Czech President Vaclav Havel mark 30th anniversary soviet invasion his country, or human rights activist mark 50th anniversary U.N. Human Rights Charter. While committee want honor Carter and could not, hindsight some regret prize other reasons. Four years Begin win prize, Israeli prime minister order invasion southern Lebanon which thousands civilians died. Kare Kristiansen, who serve peace prize committee 1991 1994, once say that, have committee waited, Begin probably would not have won. There's room few more names 20th century honor roll writers, and one will be add this week when swedish Academy announces late Nobel Literature laureate. Who be choose and why stimulates animate conversation readers well academics, critics and authors themselves. This year's winner or, possibly, winners will be announce Thursday, Academy disclose Tuesday. The joke you hear be that it go people you never hear of, say Ian Jack, editor london-based Granta literary magazine. But Nobel, award most every year 1901, also shines light, deservedly, wonderful writers few people have read, he added. His favorites include Trinidad-born V.S. Naipaul, though he's convince Naipaul probably won't win because his dark ... pessimistic and scathing portrayals post-colonial African culture. The academy keep its deliberations secret. Who be consider seriously, who's nominated, isn't disclosed. A writer's nationality, terms prize founder Alfred Nobel's will, be suppose be irrelevant. Two can share prize, though last time that happen be 1974. Winners be expect personally receive it: awards be not give posthumously. look process afar, Harold Bloom, member american Academy Arts and Letters, say award committee have unsettling record selections that be nationally 'correct' and politically 'correct.' The winners list be prestigious, he concedes, no means uniformly lustrous. absolutely not! outrageously not, he say telephone interview New York. They include all kinds fifth-raters. ... James Joyce never get one, heaven's sake. Neither Marcel Proust. Bloom's U.S. favorites include Cormac McCarthy, author Blood Meridian; Philip Roth, author American Pastoral; and John Ashbery, best living poet. A review recent winners may foreshadow this year's laureate. seven 10 be men do that favor woman? Two three be poets do that favor prose writer? Four 10 write English, and last three laureates be European. In comparison, only three asian writers have ever won. Bei Dao be personal favorite mine, say Abe Harumasa, editor-in-chief Japanese literary magazine Bungei. The choice could be interpret be motivate partly politics, give poet's association China's democracy movement, it's clear he's wonderful poet. Minoru Takeuchi, professor chinese literature Japan's prestigious Kyoto University, cite novelists Pa Kin and Xie Bing Xin worthy. The latter be know her portrayals struggle chinese women. China, which translate and publishes work many Nobel winners, desperately want its first laureate, he added. Spain's Nobel hop be pin Francisco Ayala, 92, winner this year's renowned Prince Asturias prize, say Jose Maria Martinez Cachero, author, university professor and secretary jury that select Ayala. other presume latin candidates be Peru-born Mario Vargas Llosa, member 200-year-old Royal Spanish Language Academy, Martinez Cachero said, and Portugal's Jose Saramago, whose works have be translate more 20 languages. For his part, Saramago, 75, say recent Associated Press interview that he's weary speculation that this year, once again, he might win. Let's not get that, he said. I just write. Jose Saramago, 75-year-old Portuguese writer who take literature relatively late life and whose richly imaginative novels soon win him loyal readers Europe and vocal admirers United States, be award this year's Nobel Prize Literature Thursday Swedish Academy Stockholm. A tall, bald man whose large, tint glasses give him mien severity, Saramago be first portuguese-language writer and one first card-carrying Communists become Nobel Literature laureate. He be also fourth successive european win prize, Italy's Dario Fo 1997, Poland's Wislawa Szymborska 1996 and Ireland's Seamus Heaney 1995. In its citation Thursday, Swedish Academy praise Saramago who parables sustain imagination, compassion and irony continually enable us once again apprehend elusory reality. Although Saramago discounts influence latin american magical realism his work, his novels use supernatural, allegorical, paradoxical and irrational ways address complex questions faith and existence. Many his novels be set backdrop political or historical events, it be his unwavering concern individual fate that give his fiction its distinctive voice and independent character. His best-known books, all publish United States, be Baltasar and Blimunda, The Year Death Ricardo Reis, The Stone Raft and The History Siege Lisbon. His late book available English, Blindness, which all one his characters mysteriously become blind, be describe his symphonic new novel Andrew Miller The New York Times Book Review Sunday. There be no cynicism and there be no conclusions, just clear-eyed and compassionate acknowledgment things they are, quality can only honestly be term wisdom, Miller, himself novelist, wrote. We should be grateful when it be hand us such generous measures. Saramago learn his award Thursday Frankfurt airport, where he be prepare fly home Madrid Lanzarote Canary Islands attend Frankfurt Book Fair. Earlier this week, he participate round-table portuguese writers topic, Why I be still Communist. He immediately return fair where he be receive cheers and bouquets roses. I be personally very happy myself, he said. I be also happy my country. later he tell news conference: The portuguese language have wait 100 years this. There have be ways and mean protecting language so that it do not become museum, be something that be alive. The writer's role be protect it and work it. The award be also celebrate Lisbon, where President Jorge Sampaio describe it recognition Portuguese culture, while local Communist leader, Carlos Carvalho, saw it credit his party. As member our party, he note solemnly, Saramago make great contribution our ideals and struggle social change. The laureate's fiction, though, be never overtly political. Saramago, whose body work include poetry, essays, plays and journal well 10 novels, be unusual have emerge major literary figure only age 60. His novels have be translate 30 languages, sell particularly well Portugal, Brazil, Spain, Italy and Germany. While he have not be well know United States, his novels have always be critically well receive there. For all his late blooming, though, Saramago long dream become writer. Born family rural laborers and raise Lisbon, he be force poverty leave school while teen-ager and learn trade car mechanic. Yet he manage publish small novel age 25. Later, he find work Lisbon publishing company, oppressive and censorial atmosphere Salazar dictatorship discourage him writing. It be only Portugal's April 1974 revolution that Saramago felt free find his voice. A member Portuguese Communist Party 1969, he serve editor Lisbon newspaper, Diario de Noticias, 18-month period when left look likely seize power Portugal. But anti-communist backlash November 1975 force him out newspaper and he begin translate french text Portuguese make ends meet. In late 1970s, he also turn novels, publishing three succession 1977, 1978 and 1980. But it be 1982, Baltasar and Blimunda (Memorial do Convento Portuguese), that he achieve his international breakthrough. This be rich, multifaceted and polysemous text that same time have historical, social and individual perspective, Swedish Academy note Thursday. The insight and wealth imagination which it give expression be characteristic Saramago's work whole. Set 18th-century Portugal Inquisition, book tell baroque efforts war veteran, Baltasar, and visionary, Blimunda, escape heavens fly machine power human wills capture hypersensory Blimunda. This fantastic story take place very real background tortuous construction massive Mafra Convent thousands men hold grip Inquisition. When novel be publish United States 1987, Irving Howe acclaim it brilliant The New York Times Book Review. Mr. Saramago be constantly present voice European skepticism, connoisseur ironies, Howe wrote. I think I hear his prose echoes Enlightenment sensibility, caustic and shrewd. In his next novel, The Year Death Ricardo Reis, which be also homage great portuguese poet Fernando Pessoa, who appear it ghost, Saramago set his story early years Salazar dictatorship, tale romantic and sexual misadventures poet-physician. write The New York Times, Herbert Mitgang call it rare, old-fashioned novel once lyrical, symbolic and meditative. Saramago, whose sense literary freedom be evident his unconventional punctuation and conflicting use tenses, seek different form freedom The Stone Raft, where he imagine confusion unleash when iberian peninsula suddenly break free rest Europe and begin drift New World and threaten collide Azores. To delight Britons, Gibraltar be leave behind. Unsurprisingly, bitter satire, The Gospel accord Jesus Christ, prove controversial, God show use innocently human Jesus create religion that have spawn violence and intolerance. When Lisbon jury pick book Portugal's entry 1992 european literary prize, country's conservative government veto choice blasphemous. It be then that Saramago decide leave his small, crowd apartment Lisbon relative solitude Lanzarote. The History Siege Lisbon, publish United States last year, be whimsical tale set motion decision humble proofreader publishing house insert word not key passage standard history Portugal. With this lunatic creative act, Edmund White put it The New York Times Book Review, he totally derail national saga affirm that crusaders not fact help liberate 12th-century Lisbon Moorish occupation. White end his July 1997 review prescient remark. Word have it that Saramago be overdue Nobel Prize, he noted. No candidate have good claim last recognition this novelist. With recent publication Blindness United States, only Saramago's late novel, Todos os Nomes, or All Names still await translation English. In tradition Andre Gide and Julian Green, though, he have now embark his journals. The fourth volume these Cadernos de Lanzarote be just publish Lisbon. Saramago will receive his Nobel Prize, worth equivalent $967,500 this year, ceremony Stockholm Dec. 10. Three american pharmacologists be award Nobel Prize Monday their surprising discoveries how natural production gas, nitric oxide, can mediate wide variety bodily actions. Those include widen blood vessels, help regulate blood pressure, initiate erections, battle infections, prevent formation blood clots and act signal molecule nervous system. The prize, physiology or medicine, go Dr. Robert Furchgott, 82, State University New York Brooklyn; Dr. Louis Ignarro, 57, University California Los Angeles, and Dr. Ferid Murad, 62, University Texas Medical School Houston. The announcement significant phase discoveries two Monday's winners meeting 1986 elicit avalanche research activities many different laboratories world, say Nobel committee Karolinska Institute Stockholm, which make awards. Its citation say that research have lead new treatments treat heart and lung diseases, shock and impotence. Ignarro discover principle that lead use Viagra anti-impotency drug, say Dr. Sten Orrenius, professor toxicology Karolinska Institute. Nitric oxide start process which blood vessels penis widen produce erection. Nitric oxide, chemical relative anesthetic gas nitrous oxide, be better known common air pollutant form when nitrogen burns, such automobile exhaust fumes. But scientists now know it be distribute widely body. The discoveries honor Monday be make largely 1980s time when scientists know that bacteria produce nitric oxide not think it be important animals and humans. The award committee say that this be first discovery that gas can act signal molecule organism. The discovery be startle because nitric oxide be totally different any other know signal molecule and so unstable that it be convert nitrate and nitrite 10 seconds. Recipients Nobel Prize, include some who have lobby it years, profess surprise learn their award. This year's winners be refreshingly candid. Furchgott say he have plan sleep late Monday, holiday, be awaken 5:30 his home Hewlett, N.Y. He say that he know that previous Nobel prize winners have nominate him award, that he still be somewhat surprised receive it. I guess I have some good friends voting, Furchgott said. He say he could not get back sleep. Murad say he have ponder odds and think that maybe I could win prize, if not now maybe couple years. He describe award culmination career and say that when it happens, it's incredible. Ignarro be travel Italy. Dr. Gerald Levey, dean UCLA, say we actually anticipate this day four years now. The three 1998 winners never work together, we talk lot shop talk meetings, Furchgott said. Dr. Valentin Fuster, president American Heart Association and head cardiology Mt. Sinai Hospital Manhattan, say that discovery nitric oxide and its function be one most important history cardiovascular medicine. Doctors have learn prize-winning research that heart disease, endothelium, or inner lining arteries, make less nitric oxide. Drugs nitroglycerine, however, can help replenish stores nitric oxide. Now, drug companies be try develop more powerful heart drugs base new knowledge nitric oxide's role signal molecule. Researchers have also learn that nitric oxide produce endothelium rapidly spread cell membranes underlie muscle cells arteries. then it can shut muscle contractions arteries, thus widen them and reduce blood pressure. Inhalation nitric oxide gas have save live some people certain lung diseases, particularly infants who have develop dangerously high pulmonary blood pressure. But regulate amount nitric oxygen inhale be critical because too much can be lethal. Nitric oxide play harmful role collapse circulatory system, or shock, result overwhelming microbial infections. Bacteria can release products that cause white blood cells release enormous amounts nitric oxide. As result, blood pressure drops. Scientists be try develop drugs that can block production nitric oxide such infections. White blood cells also play role attack cancerous cells. The gas can also induce type program cell death know apoptosis. Scientists be study nitric oxide's effects immune system stop growth cancers. They be also explore nitric oxide's possible role regulate body temperature. Doctors be measure production nitric oxide lungs and intestines diagnose number ailments, include asthma and colitis, and be study its role menstruation. Nitric oxide form nerve cells spreads rapidly all directions activate cells vicinity and influence many functions, behavior and mobility intestinal tract. Nitric oxide be also be study its role smell and memory. Nitric oxide's role be still unfolding; scientists have write thousands scientific papers it recent years and have start journal, Nitric Oxide. The Nobel committee cite Furchgott perform 1980 ingenious experiment that show that drug, acetylcholine, widen blood vessels only if inner layer, or endothelium, be intact. Furchgott conclude that blood vessels widen because endothelial cells produce signal molecule that he call EDRF, endothelium-derived relaxing factor, which relax smooth muscle cells blood vessels. Furchgott's findings lead quest identify factor, citation said. (optional TRIM CAN BEGIN HERE) The citation not refer accident Furchgott's laboratory that play major role his discoveries. In 1995, Annual Review Pharmacology and Toxicology, Furchgott write that May 5, 1978, first series plan experiments arteries rabbit, technician not follow directions correctly. The technician perform one step experiment instead he be suppose wash out drug use earlier phase experiment. Furchgott expect that arteries would contract. Instead, they relaxed. It be first time he have see drugs study produce such reaction, and he use insight plan additional experiments. Furchgott omit technician's name that paper and another 1996 Journal American Medical Association. On Monday, he say David Davidson be technician. (optional TRIM ENDS HERE) The committee cite Ignarro conclude 1986, brilliant series analyses conduct independently Furchgott, that EDRF be identical nitric oxide. Furchgott say he and Ignarro make announcement same symposium 1986 Mayo Clinic Rochester, Minn., papers be not publish 1998. Murad be cite work conduct years while he work University Virginia Charlottesville, Stanford University Palo Alto, Calif., and Abbott Laboratories Illinois. Murad say he felt fortunate have hear Furchgott report his early work EDRF 1980. Murad show that gas could regulate important cellular functions and study how nitroglycerin and related heart drugs lead release nitric oxide. (OPTIONAL TRIM CAN BEGIN HERE) In his early training Case Western Reserve University Cleveland, Murad work laboratory Dr. Theodore Rall, who also train another Nobel prize winner, Dr. Alfred Gilman University Texas Southwestern Dallas. Gilman say interview that he believe Rall, now retire and live Charlottesville, Va., be first scientist have train two Nobel Prize winners. In addition, Rall work Dr. Earl Sutherland, who also win Nobel Prize. In his early reseach years, Murad work chemical know cyclic guanosine monophosphate, which later turn out be critical nitric oxide story. Murad's trainees refer early work dump experiments because all they could do laboratory time be crudely add various hormones and agents slices tissue, cell cultures. It take years develop more refined techniques that lead understand nitric oxide's many roles body. But many years, most scientific community be skeptical ability free radical nitric oxide activate enzyme, Murad say 1996 when he and Furchgott share Albert Lasker basic medical research award. (OPTIONAL TRIM ENDS HERE) The Nobel Prizes be create will Alfred Nobel, whose invention dynamite involve use nitroglycerine. The award committee note odd twist this year's award. When Nobel develop chest pain heart disease, it said, he refuse take nitroglycerine his doctor prescribed because he know it cause headache. Nobel dismiss nitroglycerine's benefit relief chest pain. Nobel die 1896. The prize that three scientists will share be now worth $938,000. When Alfred Nobel write directions establish literature prize his name, he choose unclear word and scratch out few letters. Questions prize have engage and pique literary world ever since. A new chapter mystery will be write Thursday, when Swedish Academy announce this year's winner world's most prestigious prize writers. The prize focus intense media attention Swedish capital and clamor journalists generally drown out question: Why do world care so much literary choices handful people quiet and remote country? Does Nobel Prize really recognize best? When ask that question, Swedish Academy permanent secretary Sture Allen smile and say Look list prizewinners! The answer obscure much it clarifies. On one hand, Nobel Prize have recognize world-renowned writers such Isaac Bashevis Singer and bring little-known wonders light, such Wislawa Szymborska. But prize arguably also have honor mediocre, heap attention those who would have be more fairly serve obscurity. Among them be winner first prize 1901, Sully Prudhomme. That choice be denounce Sweden's lead literary light, August Strindberg, and group Swedes send letter Leo Tolstoy apologize Academy's slight not choose him. Arguments Academy's choices be inevitable, instructions they be given. Nobel's will say prize should recognize literature that work ideal direction. What, exactly, he mean ideal** be unclear and Academy's choices have reflect confusion. The Academy have choose interpret word apply work range good-hearted charm Szymborska's poetry crush hopelessness Samuel Beckett's writings. When Nobel write word ideal swedish idealisk** he superimpose last couple letters previous one. Allen be so curious understand Nobel's thoughts that he engage forensic expert try find out what early letters were. The expert succeed point. He find that first word Nobel write be idealirad, word that doesn't exist. Despite inclarity edges, Allen say he be confident that Academy's choices bolster Nobel's core idea that literature would be basis some kind progress. About this year's choice, he won't say more that: Academy be bind keep its deliberations secret. But observers love speculate who might win, who's shortlist prize, this year worth 7.6 million kronor (about dlrs 974,000). Names that freuqently come guess include V.S. Naipaul, China's Bei Dao and Pa Kin, American poet John Ashbery, and Jose Saramago Portugal. A day win Nobel Prize literature, portuguese novelist Jose Saramago insist that while he be delighted win award, it could just easily have go many other Portuguese writers. I'm not only one who deserve it, say first Portuguese-language author obtain prestigious award. There have be other Portuguse authors, Fernando Pessoa, whose work would justify 1,000 Nobels Speaking pack press coference Madrid, Saramago joke how he hear he have win prize German air hostess Frankfurt airport he wait flight home Spain's Canary Islands. The news leave 75-year-old writer no choice leave airport and return city's book fair meet press and public. At that moment I be moon and return book fair only thing I be worry be that whole thing be error, say Saramago. Dismissing Vatican paper's disapproval Thursday his achievment, Saramago, know atheist, quip that he be aware that Pope have be jury, I wouldn't have win prize. The Vatican be easily upset, say Saramago, I think that Vatican should keep its mind its prayers and leave people alone. meanwhile Portugal, where Saramago be schedule arrive Tuesday, delight Swedish Academy's award Saramago be reflect daily papers, country's three daily sports papers ample space event. The two lead dailies, Publico and Diario de Noticias, give their entire front pages Saramago. Lisbon City Hall rush out posters say Congratulations Jose Saramago which be hung capital night. Saramago be bear poor, illiterate family Azinhaga, small town Lisbon. He never finish university continue study part-time while support himself metalworker. Nothing my life would have lead one think I'd win Nobel Prize, say Saramago. I wasn't born win Nobel. I didn't have my books I be 18. His first novel, publish 1947 Terra do Pecado, or Country Sin be tale peasants moral crisis. For next 18 years, Saramago, communist who oppose 41-year conservative dictatorship Antonio Salazar, publish only few travel and poetry books while he work journalist. He return fiction only Salazar's regime be topple military uprising 1974. Since 1980s, his works have be translate more 20 languages. regard future, Saramago say book he be currently work will be call The Cavern and deals modern version myth Plato and cave.

The citation Karolinska Institute say it be senation that simple, common air pollutant (nitric oxide), which be form when nitrogen burns ... could exert important functions organism. Because research, we know today that nitric oxide acts signal molecule nervous system, weapon infections and regulator blood pressure. Signal transmission gas that be produce one cell, penetrate membranes and regulate function another cell represent entirely new principle, citation said. Understanding how nitric oxide transmits signals have spark research wide range new drugs, include those that can be use treatment heart problems, artherosclerosis, shock and impotence. The prize amount 7.6 million kronor (dlrs 978,000) be divide equally three. last year, prize go Stanley B. Prusiner University California San Francisco his discovery prions, rogue proteins identify cause Mad Cow Disease.

Netanyahu have send clear message all those who be delude themselves and bet Israel (to) change its anti-peace stand give their illusions, paper said. Lebanon's peace talks Israel also have be suspend more two years pending progress syrian-israeli negotiations. The independent an-nahar newspaper quote lebanese Prime Minister Rafik Hariri asking, Does Israeli government really want peace it be try delude world? In front page comment, Sahar Baasiri, say The mere announcement that he (sharon) will lead negotiations (with Arabs) be tantamount disaster. Ariel Sharon, hawkish former general tip be Israel's next foreign minister, say interview publish Sunday that if he get job, he won't shake hand palestinian leader Yasser Arafat. Sharon, who oppose cede West Bank land Palestinians, be be consider government's no. 2 post. In it, he would be pivotal figure reach final peace settlement Palestinians. even if I will be appoint foreign minister and run negotiations, I won't shake Yasser Arafat's hand, Sharon be quote say Yediot Ahronot daily. The newspaper say Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu be close make decision appointment. Netanyahu himself have be act foreign minister post be vacate January David Levy, moderate who oppose Netanyahu's hardline negotiate strategy Palestinians. Sharon's appointment would signal toughen Israel's positions and could far strain relations Arab neighbors. Sharon be general who lead Israel's 1982 invasion Lebanon, and former housing minister who strengthen Jewish settlement territories Israel capture Syria, Jordan and Egypt 1967 Mideast war. Sharon tell Haaretz newspaper he would accept foreign minister's job if he be allow act strengthen country. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu appoint Ariel Sharon, hawkish former defense minister, be Israeli foreign minister Friday effort placate far right he move close turn more West Bank land Palestinians. With his appointment, Sharon, 70, ardent advocate jewish settlements West Bank, be expect quell domestic opposition concessions that Netanyahu be supposedly prepared make peace summit conference Washington area next week. For months, Sharon, who be currently minister national infrastructures, have maintain that redeploy Israeli troops more additional 9 percent West Bank would be national disaster. In assume role foreign minister, however, he would be force abandon his public opposition Netanyahu's decision withdraw another 13 percent palestinian territory if he vote accord. Sharon will be draw directly issue, Netanyahu have appoint him direct final status talks Palestinians, which would follow sign interim peace agreement. last week Sharon tell Israeli newspaper that, negotiations or not, he would never shake hand Yasser Arafat, Palestinian leader, whom he have long disdained. palestinian leaders and israeli leftists be divide their reactions, similar ways. Some profess be aghast, and some, Nabil Sha'ath, Palestinian transportation minister, say they be willing forget history if Sharon's appointment provide Netanyahu political backbone sign deal. In Washington, White House and State Department officials pledge work closely Sharon and emphasize that personnel israeli government be internal affair. Arik Sharon be most fitting person state Israel position foreign minister, Netanyahu said, use his nickname. He bring him rich experience, creativity, proven work ability and I think that he well know wounds and damages war well fruit peace. Sharon have never hide his beliefs, he continued, and his words have influence way that redeployment will be carry out if not its extent. In nod Sharon, Netanyahu have decide new location nature reserve that would constitute 3 percent West Bank land. It be suppose be Judean desert Israel's eastern border, which Sharon argue would pose strategic security risk. Instead, it be decide Thursday that nature reserve would instead be slopes Hebron hills, much closer exist jewish settlements. many Israeli political observers believe that Netanyahu have eviscerate his right-wing opposition this appointment, signal that he genuinely intend bring home peace agreement. Who be right wing now if Sharon be foreign ministry and negotiate Palestinians? ask Uzi Benziman, editorial board member newspaper Haaretz and author critical biography Sharon. It will be just settlers and some real hard-liners who don't comprise more 15 percent public opinion. So it's really quite intelligent move, suggest that Netanyahu mean business try get agreement. But Palestinians take news hard, and read it differently. I think it's clear-cut message Bibi, Saeb Erekat, lead negotiator Palestinians, said, use Netanyahu's nickname. I imagine people will try explain Netanyahu's intentions try get support right. What he be try do be make peace right wing expense make peace us. It mean he want continue path non-negotiations, because he want continue be prime minister any cost. Sharon decline be interview Friday because his appointment must still be approve Cabinet Tuesday, approval that be expected. An aide, Raanan Gisin, say Sharon accept position so that he could stem tide dangerous developments and contribute fight risks face Israel. A retired general who fight every Israeli war, Sharon, 70, be leading figure Likud Party who have do much battle Likud prime minister. At most recent party convention, he say that Netanyahu didn't know his right hand his left, which prime minister dismiss Friday comment make height political arguments. And when Netanyahu first form his Cabinet 1996, fact that he not give Sharon senior position cause 11th-hour crisis swearing-in ceremony. Sharon retreat his family farm Negev, and David Levy, who have be name foreign minister, say he would not serve unless Sharon be give post. Netanyahu then create Cabinet job, minister infrastructures, especially Sharon. Levy resign January lengthy power struggle prime minister, and then Netanyahu have be serve his foreign minister. Sharon, member old guard, have complicate political past, highlight string military victories, and checkered, many, his indirect role, defense minister, Lebanese Christian Phalangist massacre unarm civilians Sabra and Shatila refugee camps Lebanon 1982. Many Israelis, those who despise his politics, see him strong, experienced figure who know his mind and who be capable be moderate when he have power. Friday afternoon, right-wing political establishment nearly universally applauded appointment. Uzi Landau, who be Likud hard-liner, say he be relieve hear confirm what have be rumor weeks. I feel more safe negotiations if Minister Sharon be directly involved, say Landau, who head Parliament's security and foreign affairs committee. Undoubtedly it will facilitate situation prime minister show right that Arik Sharon be identify program, so therefore they can live it. Right announcement be made, leaders National Religious Party, who have threaten bring government, change their combative tone. They emerge mollified meetings Netanyahu late Thursday, say they would leave government intact. Still, they would not connect their change heart nomination Sharon. Appointing Sharon be political step we very much, say Shaul Yahalom, minister transportation and leader National Religious Party. But it will have no effect how we see peace agreement. Our concern there be whether any 160 jewish settlements be endangered. The appointment Sharon come backdrop violence that have erupt this week. Friday, 19-year-old Israeli soldier, Michal Adato, be stab death palestinian man she get bus her hometown, settlement Tomer Jordan Valley. Netanyahu report that he have receive sympathy note Arafat, who condemn attack. also Friday, continue clashes palestinian youths and soldiers divide city Hebron, 32 Palestinians be lightly injure rubber bullets funeral palestinian protester shot dead Thursday. After Netanyahu make announcement Friday, Israeli reporter introduce question state that Netanyahu have diminish political threat right wing appoint Sharon. Are you willing sign that? Netanyahu said. I do not know that. I do know one thing that when you be dependent vote one or two people you can never know what will be. He be refer his razor-thin majority parliament which some analysts perceive be his key motivator appoint Sharon. more anything else, this reflect political weakness Netanyahu, say Yaron Ezrahi, lead intellectual and critic prime minister. He have recognize that next redeployment be inevitable if he doesn't want be see contribute wave political violence that would follow failure. But he doesn't have domestic political power carry out big decision his own. The New York Times say editorial Saturday, Oct. 10: Just days head United States critical negotiations palestinian leaders, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu jolt Middle East peace effort appointment Ariel Sharon Israeli foreign minister. The most optimistic reading be that Sharon, long implacable foe Palestinians, be prepared make peace them and then sell it Israelis who be most opposed. Unfortunately, he be also capable wreck entire peace effort. Much will depend whether Netanyahu can control his strong-willed aide, goal that have elude other Israeli leaders. Like political typhoon, Sharon have roar Israeli life better three decades brilliant military commander, reckless defense minister and ardent conservative, leave destruction his wake. He still bear burden his role massacre hundreds Palestinians christian militiamen Lebanon 1982. An Israeli inquiry find he be indirectly responsible killings Sabra and Shatila refugee camps. As leader most conservative wing Likud party, Sharon can help Netanyahu hold together his shaky Cabinet potentially decisive negotiations Yasser Arafat, Palestinian leader. That will be fine if Sharon be willing play constructive role peace talks himself. But such behavior be not likely be first impulse man who have famously say he would never shake hands Arafat. Since Netanyahu have designate Sharon his chief negotiator, new foreign minister will soon have opportunity act more responsibly. The first order business when two sides get together next week Washington be wrap negotiations further withdrawal Israeli forces West Bank couple security guarantees Palestinians. Sharon can show statesmanship help Netanyahu close this deal, though it be oppose israeli settlers whose cause Sharon have long championed. Success these talks would clear way last and most difficult negotiations permanent settlement, include shape and status palestinian state and future Jerusalem. If Sharon ever hop overcome shame Sabra and Shatila, he must become force peace Middle East.

The man be hero Arab defeats; he be firm believer expansion land Israel and resolve palestinian problem expense Jordan. He be liar, Baasiri wrote. The conservative Ad-Diyar newspaper say front-page comment: The history Ariel Sharon be known. He have call burn Beirut, annex Golan, occupy (West) Bank and slaughter and displace Arabs everywhere. Ariel Sharon have law degree, and fancies himself farmer. But more three decades his role Israeli public life have be that unapologetic warrior, first battlefield and later bare-knuckled combat domestic partisan politics. With his blunt tongue, barrel chest and bar-scrapper's demeanor, Sharon 70 be his many critics here caricature right-wing intransigence. To his equally numerous admirers he be live symbol unrelenting dedication Israel's national survival. still convey physical vigor impressively expand frame, he remain pugnacious fault. Both his friends and foes would agree that new foreign minister be not natural diplomat. A Zionist underground operative teen-ager and infantry commander wound 1948 war independence, Sharon have fought, and fight memorably, virtually every major military engagement his country's history. He command legendary armored division that cross and seize control Sinai 1967 Arab-Israeli war. He return active service three-month retirement lead Israel's badly outgunned armored divisions victory, again Sinai, war 1973. As defense minister 982, Sharon lead Israel's invasion Lebanon, defy international condemnation unrelenting artillery assaults Beirut neighborhoods and palestinian refugee camps believe israeli high command be Palestine Liberation Organization redoubts. To some, Israel and abroad, Sharon's Lebanese incursion will forever be associate massacres lebanese Christian Phalangists, allies Israelis, report 460 unarmed Palestinians Sabra and Shatila refugee camps. In official inquiry Jerusalem and subsequent libel trial he bring New York, Sharon be see have effectively refute charges that he know and condone Phalangists' attacks beforehand. But government investigate commission hold that his failure prevent killings constitute grounds his dismissal Defense Ministry. Since 1982 invasion, Israel have be mire unpopular open-ended occupation southern Lebanon, operation constant casualties young inductees which Sharon be still blamed. To many Israelis, however, Lebanese incursion be ultimately risk worth taking, it succeed crush PLO militarily and drive its forces far Israel's borders. The PLO's defeat Sharon's hand Lebanon lead eventually its renunciation arm warfare Israel and embrace peace negotiation process which Sharon Foreign Minister will now be responsible. In civilian life he prove savvy political operator he be military strategist, help break Labor's hold Knesset and make himself indispensable bind force successive fractious Likud coalitions. His investiture foreign minister next week will mark his sixth Cabinet appointment 21 years.

As key member inner cabinet Begin's first government, Sharon begin construction and systematic expansion new Israeli housing developments throughout West Bank, Gaza Strip and Galilee area territories occupy Israel 1967, policy that he and his opponents alike would agree remain his signal domestic political achievement. At 70, Sharon remain one great polarize fixtures Israeli political life.

He angrily oppose any diplomatic discussions return internationally demilitarize Golan Heights Syria.

45,"Whether or not talks Exxon and Mobil lead merger or some other business combination, America's economic history be already be rewritten. In energy businesses financial services, telecommunication and automobiles, global competition and technology have make unthinkable combinations practical, necessary. Oil companies Exxon Corp. and Mobil Corp. have additional pressure, one unthinkable less two decades ago. Crude oil prices have fall sharply, plunge 40 percent just this year levels, adjust inflation, not see first oil embargo 25 years ago. As such, oil companies, have spent years cut their costs, be desperate further savings order continue operate profitably such low prices. Exxon and Mobil be two largest, strong competitors emerge nation's most famous antitrust case, 1911 breakup John D. Rockefeller's Standard Oil Trust. now they face Royal Dutch/Shell Group that be large either them. They will also confront British Petroleum PLC make far more potent United States its agreement this summer buy Amoco Corp. $48.2 billion. Industry executives say further deals this scale be inevitable. Executives companies not return calls Thursday comment talks, and it be unclear Thursday night what outcome might be. But if Exxon and Mobil agree become one, antitrust regulators be likely be cautious put back together much what they long ago break apart. even so, most oil industry analysts contend that improved efficiency combine giant energy companies would do more low costs more concentrated ownership gas stations and refineries would do raise them. The ultimate beneficiary all this will be consumer, say Daniel Yergin, chairman Cambridge Energy Research Associates. If Exxon and Mobil ultimately do combine, costs could prove heavy energy industry employees. Analysts say that 80,000 global employees Exxon, base Irving, Texas, and more 40,000 Mobil, Fairfax, Va., thousands would be likely lose their jobs. Exxon, Lee R. Raymond, and Mobil, Lucio a. Noto, have chief executives who have be preoccupy humble accommodations that low oil prices have make necessary. oil companies be everybody's favorite targets trust-busting era early this century and again arab oil embargoes 1970s. now they seem especially vulnerable demand weaken much world, especially economically troubled Asia, weigh further already depressed prices. They're pitiful, helpless giants, say Ronald Chernow, author Titan, biography John D. Rockefeller, Standard Oil's founder. As such, these giants be compel continue cut costs and spread risks their huge, expensive international projects that be need develop oil reserves need next century. Mobil, $58.4 billion sales last year, might seem large enough undertake anything. But compete rights develop huge natural gas fields Turkmenistan, former Soviet republic, Mobil be unable match Shell's offer build pipeline $1 billion or more. oil companies have decide that they cannot count rebound oil prices revive their fortunes any time soon. Earlier this month, Energy Department predict that collapse asian demand would continue depress oil prices nearly decade, and much $5.50 barrel year 2000. And Thursday, Organization Petroleum Exporting Countries put March any decision extend their oil production cutbacks prop prices. Moreover, improve technology exploration and production and open new regions development have add already huge supply oil that be hand now. In response, many energy companies have already begin new wave cutbacks their staffs and operations. To further reduce costs, companies Mobil be form partnerships that stop short full mergers. Two years ago, Mobil agree combine its european refining and marketing operations british Petroleum's, result annual savings $500 million. Shell and Texaco then form refine partnership United States. In face these partnerships, say Amy Jaffe, energy analysts James a. Baker III Institute Public Policy Houston, if you're Exxon, how do you compete? Though Mobil and Exxon might have high concentrations gas stations certain areas United States, analysts say they have far more competition pump oil prices collapse 1980s. Thousands convenience stores now also sell gasoline produce variety refining companies, and foreign national oil companies, Venezuela's, sell their supplies acquire companies Citgo. Under Noto, Mobil have be hunt ways become large and lean enough survive. He take lead deal British Petroleum and have consider buy small companies. And he have make it clear that corporate or personal pride would never block deal. In european agreement British Petroleum, Mobil's red fly horses have come fronts many gas stations, while green and yellow BP logos have go up. As major oil companies team up, say John Hervey, analyst Donaldson Lufkin &AMP; Jenrette, If price be right, egos will not get way. In past, Mobil reportedly have further talks british Petroleum other combinations, well talks amoco form American refining venture. The company be also interested Conoco Inc. when DuPont Co. begin look divest itself that oil and gas business. But no deals be reached. more recently, there be speculation Wall Street that Mobil have be talk Chevron Corp. British Petroleum purchase Amoco put more pressure Noto seek deal, Hervey said. I don't think this whole thing would have start if British Petroleum have not pull trigger, he said. The british Petroleum-Amoco deal, progress quickly August announcement expect $2 billion annual savings, have put companies large Exxon spot. There, Raymond have so far concentrated more make his operations more efficient find allies. Though Royal Dutch/Shell's financial resources be great Exxon's, some analysts say Exxon still have size and soundness absorb company Mobil's size. only large oil companies can afford take advantage today's best opportunities. find new fields deep waters coast West Africa or Gulf Mexico can require platforms cost $1 billion or more. Producing oil states former Soviet Union have take more time and money many investors anticipated. In September, Noto be american executives invite Saudi leader visit Washington greatly step investments his country, too. Noto spent 1977 1985 Saudi Arabia himself, building Mobil operations include huge refinery. But any new partnerships Saudis might require Mobil's connections and Exxon's capital. Back when Standard Oil organize its operations state, Exxon be Standard Oil New Jersey, while Mobil be Standard Oil New York. even Standard Oil monopoly be break up, they remain several years same building Manhattan. Chernow, Rockefeller biographer, note that two pieces Standard Oil trust be already likely be united. British Petroleum buy Standard Oil Ohio 1970s, and Amoco be once standard Oil Indiana. The break-up Standard Oil and result competition have be cite precedent current antitrust action Microsoft. Chernow see no reason why allow Exxon acquisition Mobil go should suggest more leniency Microsoft. Exxon would not be obviously large its leading competitors, way Microsoft is, he said. In energy business today, he added, there be other large dinosaurs that stalk that particular jungle. The boards Exxon Corp. and Mobil Corp. be expect meet Tuesday consider possible merger agreement that would form world's large oil company, source close negotiations say Friday. The source, who speak condition anonymity, say prospects be good complete agreement. Exxon and Mobil confirm Friday that they be discuss ways combine. They cautioned, however, that no agreement have be reach and there be no assurance they would reach one. The statement send stock companies surging, suggest investors believe companies will combine. Shares Exxon, big U.S. oil company, rise $1.6875, or 2.3 percent, $74.375. Shares Mobil, No. 2 U.S. oil company, rise $7.625, or 9.7 percent, $86. Some analysts say that if two giants reach agreement, it be likely be form takeover Exxon Mobil. Exxon be far large and financially stronger. Analysts predict that there would be huge cuts duplicate staff companies, which employ 122,700 people. Adam Sieminski, oil analyst BT Alex. Brown, say that companies would probably make cuts $3 billion $5 billion year. Sieminski and other analysts say Exxon would have offer premium 15 20 percent its price prior Monday, when serious speculation Exxon takeover Mobil first circulate and send Mobil shares sharply. They say transaction would probably be exchange Mobil shares Exxon shares. base Mobil's $75.25 share price week ago, takeover company would be worth $70 billion. The merger discussions come backdrop particularly severe pressure Lucio Noto, chairman, president and chief executive Mobil, find new reserves oil and natural gas and keep big projects profitable time deep decline crude oil prices. This be one most intelligent chief executives business and man considerable ability he inherit some serious structural problems his company, say J. Robin West, chairman Petroleum Finance Co., consult group energy industry base Washington. He say that Mobil's prime assets include Arun natural gas field Indonesia, one large world, which have contribute one-third Mobil's profits years be begin run down. The field, production 1977, supplies liquefy natural gas Japan and Korea. Although Mobil Noto have move quickly cut costs and muscle its way promise new areas such Kazakhstan, where it be partner joint venture develop huge Tengiz oil field, payoff such ventures be many years away. other companies face similar strains. The challenge be replace their crown jewels and grow increasingly competitive environment, West said. Noto have not be shy sit other companies such british Petroleum and Amoco this year see if combination make sense. Although Exxon chairman Lee Raymond heads much strong and big company Mobil, he have not be immune strains global petroleum business. Those strains intensify this year when Russia's economic collapse raise risks Exxon's extensive exploration venture that country. Exxon have also be more follower leader huge projects deep offshore fields, where major finds have be make West Africa and Gulf Mexico. News that Exxon and Mobil, two giants energy patch, be merger talks last week be big sign that corporate marriages be back vogue. even that combination come light, deal-making be fast and furious. On Monday alone, $40.4 billion corporate acquisitions be either announce or declare imminent. Driving resurgence mergers be roar stock market, recognition major corporations that it be get harder increase revenues internally and grow confidence market players that economy will not plunge recession next year. There be also industry-specific issues, low crude-oil prices that be drive oil giants one another's arms. But investors, mega-marriages be not where real money be be made. Rather, it be small companies, whose still-depressed stock prices be lure big acquirers stocks that again be their peaks. If Exxon buy Mobil close current prices, deals this month will have total value more $140 billion April's peak $244 billion three times volume September, when stock market be falling. Which industries be likely witness most mergers? Tom Burnett, director Merger Insight, institutional investment advisory firm New York, say more deals be certainty energy, which be suffer low crude-oil prices. Burnett also say health care executives be find it tough ever lift earnings. But small companies may be good way play takeover game. Charles LaLoggia, editor Special Situation Investor newsletter Potomac, Md., said: Some premiums high-profile mergers aren't so great anymore. The values be small-cap stocks. Another reason be that deals involve smaller-cap candidates be less likely incur wrath antitrust regulators. LaLoggia reckons that odds pick takeover winners increase if investor focus companies already partially own another. In energy sector, Houston Exploration qualifies, he says; oil and gas driller be 66 percent own Keyspan Energy. He also believe more deals be imminent drug chains and supermarkets. Longs Drug Stores and Drug Emporium, he says, remain acquisition candidates, though neither be control another concern. In supermarkets, LaLoggia like Great Atlantic &AMP; Pacific Tea Co., 55 percent own Tengelmann Group Germany. Another pick be Smart and Final, operator warehouse-style stores that be 55 percent own U.S. subsidiary Groupe Casino, France's large supermarket chain. Both A&AMP;P and Smart and Final be trade just book value, LaLoggia said. Takeovers typically occur book value. Finally, he recommend National Presto Industries, maker housewares and electrical appliances, which be trade $39, close its low year. The company have $30 share cash its balance sheet, no debt and dividend yield 5 percent. After last month's announce acquisition Rubbermaid Newell Co., LaLoggia think National Presto could find itself acquirer's cross-hairs. It be new highs again Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock and Nasdaq composite indexes Friday anticipation new wave mergers and general rush investors join equity rebound push stocks up. Oil stocks lead way investors soak news continue talks Exxon and Mobil merger that would create world's large oil company. Internet and computer stocks also rallied, help part announcement Tuesday America Online's purchase Netscape Communications three-way deal involve Sun Microsystems. At same time, Germany's Deutsche Bank and Bankers Trust be schedule formally announce their merger Monday. There be no question that merger euphoria be headline, say Hugh Johnson, chief investment officer First Albany Corp. But flow mutual funds be also strong. Exxon rise 1 11/16, 74], while Mobil jump 7|, 86. Chevron, reflect bounce that other oil companies get merger news, climb 5\, 85|. Exxon and Chevron, IBM, which rise 3\, 170, be main drivers Dow Jones industrial average. It climb 18.80 points, or two-tenths percent, 9,333.08. It now stand just 41 points short record it set Monday and 1.9 percent week. Mobil, Exxon, Chevron, IBM and Microsoft, which rise 3 13/16, 128 1/16, be power S &AMP; P. It climb 5.46 points, or five-tenths percent, 1,192.33, new high, second week. It jump 2.5 percent last five trading days. Cisco Systems, 2 15/16, 80; MCI Worldcom, 1 11/16, 62 7/16; Sun Microsystems, 4|, 80], and Microsoft push Nasdaq index its first new high July 20. The technology-heavy index finish 31.23 points, or 1.57 percent, higher, 2,016.44. It be 4.6 percent week. Whether Friday's gains will stick will not be know Monday. It be shorten trading session, New York Stock Exchange closing 1 p.m., and trading volume, 257 million shares, make it light day year. In bond market, which also close early because Thanksgiving weekend, price 30-year Treasury bond rise 11/32, 101 12/32. The bond's yield, which move direction price, fell 5.16 percent 5.18 percent Wednesday. Long-term and short-term yields all slip low this week new economic data that indicate economy be strong third quarter expect and seem be move good pace current quarter. This small recovery face strong growth be probably because new inflation numbers show that prices be check and analysts be still forecast that economy will begin slow next year. many analysts have note eight-week stock market rally, which Nasdaq composite index jump 42 percent, that investors be buy again though major financial problems world include slump Asia, weaken Latin America and trouble Russia have not be resolved. Johnson say he think that investors, inspire Federal Reserve's three interest rate cuts two months and new stimulus package Japan, assume that these problems will be solved. Investors be look valley and they what they see, he said. But he worry that financial crisis, which begin Thailand July 1997 and be intensify effective default Russia August, will not go away quickly. It seem that every financial crisis, everybody get impression that storm have passed, Johnson said. But it be never that easy. Exxon Corp. and Mobil Corp. have hold discussions combine their business operations, person involve talks say Wednesday. It be unclear Wednesday whether talks be continuing. If companies be merge, it would create large U.S. company terms revenue. A possible merger be report separately The Financial Times London and Bloomberg News. The reported talks Exxon, whose annual revenue exceed that Wal-Mart and General Electric, and Mobil, No. 2 U.S. oil company, come oil prices have sink their low almost 12 years. A combine company would be big Royal Dutch/Shell Group, world's large oil company revenue. Financial terms discussions could not be determine Wednesday. Neither Exxon or Mobil would comment. Any union would reunite two parts John D. Rockefeller's Standard Oil Trust, which be break Supreme Court 1911. Exxon be then know Standard Oil New Jersey, and Mobil consist two companies: Standard Oil New York and Vacuum Oil. Both Exxon, which have market value $176.7 billion, and Mobil, which have market value $61.1 billion, have history be fiercely independence. Both have already cut back staff and make themselves lean order survive long periods when oil prices be low. But this have be particularly unsettling year oil industry, and there be little prospect that crude oil prices will recover soon. Consequently, chief executives most oil companies have have swallow their pride and look suitable partners. This summer, British Petroleum announce $48.2 billion agreement buy Amoco Corp., create world's third-largest oil company and prompt analysts predict more widespread consolidation. It show that megamergers be doable, say Adam Sieminski, analyst BT Alex. Brown. He added, however, that combination Exxon and Mobil would not be easy match because Mobil have be know be proud company that have say that it would not want merge. Exxon, he added, be well run company that like grow its businesses. He add that heads companies, Lee Raymond, chairman Exxon, which be base Irving, Texas, and Lucio Noto, chairman, president and chief executive Mobil, which be base Fairfax, Va., be different personalities. It will not be easy, he say combine two far-flung companies, which have vast networks refineries and gas stations that overlap United States and Europe. If you offer enough money you can make anything happen, he added. Both companies be pressure find new fields oil help them survive long term. Like other oil companies, they have hop quickly tap vast reserves Russia. even though they be prepared spend billions, they have hold back because political and economic crisis Russia and great reluctance russian officials and oil companies give control vast fields. Thus they have have fall back their exploration areas such deep waters Gulf Mexico and West Africa. such exploration be very expensive, and when large fields be find it take platforms cost $1 billion bring oil production. oil prices have be pressure more year, fall more 40 percent $20-a-barrel level because grow inventories petroleum and decline asian demand cause economic crisis there. On Wednesday, crude oil January delivery fell 29 cents, or 2.6 percent, $11.86 barrel New York Mercantile Exchange, close 12-year low $11.42 reach June 15. Members Organization Petroleum Exporting Countries and some other oil-producing nations, notably Mexico, have try stem price drops pledge cut back production. But those pledges have not always be honored, and rally oil market this year have prove short-lived. OPEC members Wednesday continue their discussion extend their production cutbacks, and agreement be expect early Thursday. In spring, OPEC agree reduce production 2.6 million barrels day, 3 percent daily world supply 74 million barrels. The main result that agreement appear have be keep oil prices fall $10 barrel. Washington regulators say Wednesday that they have not be notify Exxon-Mobil discussions. The Federal Trade Commission be still review british Petroleum's pending purchase Amoco. An exxon-mobil deal would be certain receive several months' worth scrutiny commission, which would review how much industry such merger would control. Analysts and investment bankers be split logic possible merger. Some point difficulties that companies could face if they be combined. If you ask me if Exxon need be bigger, answer be probably no, say Garfield Miller, president Aegis Energy Advisors Corp., small independent investment bank base New York. It be hard say that there be anything particular gain. In particular, Miller said, two companies have enormous similarities their domestic refining and marketing businesses. They really do overlap quite bit, he said. You really do wonder what be benefit all that redundancy. Another investment banker energy business, speak condition anonymity, also question rationale discuss merger. When you look bp-amoco deal, you can rationalize it, banker said. But none those reasons apply exxon-mobil deal. But Amy Jaffe, energy research analyst James A. Baker III Institute Public Policy, say combination two companies would be logical, part because it would give them great influence bidding projects Middle Eastern countries. This be deal that make sense, Ms. Jaffe said. With this combine company, there be no project that would be too big. In addition, Ms. Jaffe said, merger would provide each company new oil and gas assets areas world where they have little influence. There be lot complimentary assets where they be not redundant, she said. She say that Exxon, example, have strong presence Angola, while Mobil do not. And Mobil have significant assets caspian Sea and Nigeria, where Exxon be weak. Exxon and Mobil, nation's two large oil companies, confirm Friday that they be discuss possible merger, and antitrust lawyers, industry analysts and government officials predict that any deal would require sale important large pieces such new corporate behemoth. Those divestitures would far reshape industry already undergoing broad transformation because low price oil. But mergers and other corporate combinations be also begin create new regulatory climate antitrust officials, one that may prove particularly challenging Exxon and Mobil. Although companies only confirm that they be discuss possibility merger, person close discussions say boards Exxon and Mobil be expect meet Tuesday consider agreement. Shares surge New York Stock Exchange. Oil exploration and drilling interests would not necessarily present antitrust problems exxon-mobil merger because competition those areas be brisk. But retailing and marketing operations, exxon-mobil combination would be Ford merge General Motors, Macy's Gimbels, say Stephen Axinn, antitrust lawyer New York who represent Texaco its acquisition Getty more decade ago. In United States, deal would come purview Federal Trade Commission, which Clinton administration have examine large corporate mergers vigor not see 1970s. The agency have block number propose mergers, such $4 billion combination Staples and Office Depot, two large office supply discounters, and two deals involve four large drug wholesalers. On other hand it have approve other big mergers, such Boeing's $14 billion acquisition McDonnell Douglas. The agency's analysis Exxon-Mobil combination, senior official say Friday, will turn how it might resemble John D. Rockefeller's Standard Oil trust it be dismantle Supreme Court 1911. The big antitrust issue be whether, merger or alliance, they will be able get competition one another their backs, particularly background BP-Amoco and Shell-Texaco, say Eleanor M. Fox, professor New York University School Law and antitrust expert. It may be that we be look consolidation world level that look consolidation national level 100 years ago. The Federal Trade Commission recently approve significant joint venture Shell and Texaco venture agree sell refinery and divest some retailing operations Hawaii and California. It be also propose $54 billion merger British Petroleum and Amoco and will now have re-examine that combination light new talks Exxon and Mobil. In past, when there have be two mergers involve same industry, government have consider them together decide how deal them, say Terry Calvani, former commissioner Federal Trade Commission whose clients now include Chevron. But come aftermath Shell-Texaco and BP-Amoco deals, combination Exxon and Mobil, which have significantly overlap retail and refinery businesses United States and Europe, poses questions that antitrust officials have not confront 1980s. It's real test case, say Frederick Leuffer, senior energy analyst Bear Stearns. If FTC let this one go major divesting, then everything would be fair game. Why couldn't GM merge Ford? While 1911 breakup Standard Oil be view Washington officials and industry executives ancient history, Exxon and Mobil have become dominant rivals some retailing and refining markets, and production lubricants and petrochemicals. Leuffer say he believe divestitures necessary this case could be so large that they be deal-breakers. other analysts and lawyers, while disagree that require divestitures could kill deal, say companies would nonetheless have shed significant operations and that they expect challenges be raise broad spectrum constituents, include competitors, customers and state officials. These be not absolute obstacles, say John Hervey, analyst Donaldson Lufkin &AMP; Jenrette. In past, when two big oil companies have merged, aggressive attorneys general states have almost always become involved raising questions because high visibility local gas station. When state attorney general drives and sees four stations corner and two them be Mobil and Exxon, they be certain raise questions, Axinn said. Exxon and Mobil have significant concentrations retailing and marketing concerns Northeast, Southwest and West Coast, where they also have big refining operations. Because two companies be involve everything exploration and shipping refining and retailing, meaning deal consumers will take months regulators sort out. The regulators examine such transaction would dissect each business, determine whether its market be global, national or more local, and determine whether combined entity have too high concentration business those areas. Experts agree that regulators be most likely permit Exxon and Mobil keep their exploratory and oil production businesses because those areas be already highly competitive and merger would not result high prices. Hervey say those markets be already so fragmented that combined market share major american and european oil companies be only 17 percent. They have be downsized, cut back and re-engineered. so when 900 or so remaining blue-collar workers here Mobil's large domestic refinery, out 1,500 decade ago, hear last week that their company be discuss possible merger Exxon, it be siren warn them that already suspect valve might be blow. I think it's terrible thing, say Dick Mabry, refinery operator, he emerge plant's artificial twilight main gate his 12-hour shift end 4:30 Sunday morning. He stop rub eyes rim red, this topic his bedtime could be delayed. It's revival Standard Oil Company. It's go put 20 or 30 thousand people out work. I think Justice Department should step and stop it. Ernest Lewis, whose overalls bore Big E patch appropriate his scale, add his uh-huh's. The late evidence where things be head hulk right nearby, he said, glance new power plant likely be operate company unions that now man refinery's generators. But if Mobil Corp. have be sold, Lewis said, note gains his company stock holdings, buyer solid and large Exxon Corp. might be least all evils. If we merge Chevron, we'd be Moron, he added. A grow american economy that can make billionaire out someone unproven idea Internet marketing be still slough workers old industries, petroleum much any. Those here point tote board Beaumont plant's brick headquarters, that they say shows they have already handle 171 million barrels out 130 million plan full year. But numbers that matter more be ones 89.9, 88.9, 81.9, nearby gas stations lowest prices, inflation, Depression. Which be why Mobil and Exxon be combine world's large oil company. Some people close talks caution that no deal would be consider their boards least Tuesday, maybe Wednesday. And that be why, begin last Wednesday evening, phone home Jimmy Herrington, president Oil, Chemical and Atomic Workers Local 4-243 rang stop. No, he didn't know that merger talk television, say Herrington, who also work full-time produce lubricants. He have ask some Mobil managers, meeting earlier this month, all rumors, they say they have hear nothing. oil industry analysts say that first targets combine company's efforts cut billions dollars annual costs would be office staff and professionals, geologists and engineers, field. One company's accountants could almost do work two. But crews here fully expect that Exxon or any other buyer would ask again whether refinery could turn more crude oil gasoline, motor oil and other products few people. Union leaders raise prospect that Exxon would have sell refinery. Antitrust regulators, they say, be bound notice that Exxon have refineries hour's drive one direction and three hours other, Gulf Mexico crescent that form petrochemical industry's home. The Beaumont plant, steaming, hum chemistry set lining Neches River Gulf, have become prime provider livelihoods here it be build almost spray nearby Spindletop gusher. With mount overtime that can stretch shift 16 hours or more, workers regularly make $55,000 or $65,000 year. People go there retire there, Herrington said, he drive plant's fence periphery. Lewis, his 17th year, be third-generation employee. But his nephew laboring here too be exception. The workers stream and plant dawn be mostly bald or go gray, sign that full generation refinery have be more concerned how get rid workers how attract them. The cutbacks have, so far, come attrition, retirements encourage incentives. But plywood sheets cover windows most fast food places and gas stations Herrington's union hall advertise that best times be long gone. His members chafe experts who come Wall Street question justification every person's job. In tire and dangerous tasks, they question elimination most relief laborers favor cover vacations and sickness overtime (although some extra pay, and they say plant have become safer years). They complain grow numbers contractors take formerly unionized tasks. But many workers choose invest least some retirement savings Mobil stock, 1990s ethos be gaining. Some share credit plant's management efficiency measure they agree be necessary true job security. Some take attitude that every company be always sale. They will not be too concerned what we feel it, say Sam Salim, one electrical plant workers whose future be uncertain. But if they fork out $60 billion? I'd look it over. With most Mobil executives say little possible now, call Sunday local plant manager and company spokesman not elicit peep. Union leaders, however, be already squawking. I don't believe create new monopolies be way prop industry, say Robert Wages, former refinery operator himself and now union's president, telephone Saturday. Nevertheless, admirable foresight union negotiate clause last November's three-year contract extension guarantee that any company buyer would have keep its terms. Many members, who typically come work high school, be already molding oil companies' late exploits case studies fit rapacious MBA's. They're biggest, say Bobby Whisneant, assistant operator gasoline and lubrication oil units, refer Exxon. He be coming, early Sunday morning, plant gate whose white canopy seem borrow self-service station. So they go buy second biggest. That's one way get rid competition. I just hope it's not something 80s buying companies and scrap them. Or something Robber Baron era century before, say Mabry, another operator. Didn't teachers teach us all school that Standard Oil Company would never come back? Remember that? he said, look his friend, Lewis, Big E, agreement. But I better shut up. I still work Mobil. use to, Lewis said. Exxon Corp. and Mobil Corp. have hold discussions combine their business operations, person involve talks say Wednesday. It be unclear Wednesday whether talks be continuing. If companies be merge, it would create large U.S. company terms revenue. A possible merger be report separately The Financial Times London and Bloomberg News. The reported talks Exxon, whose annual revenue exceed that General Electric Co., and Mobil, No. 2 U.S. oil company, come oil prices sink their low almost 12 years. A combine company would be big Royal Dutch/Shell Group, world's large oil company revenue. Financial terms discussions could not be determine Wednesday. Neither Exxon or Mobil would comment. Any union would reunite two parts John D. Rockefeller's Standard Oil Trust, which be break Supreme Court 1911. Exxon be then know Standard Oil New Jersey, and Mobil consist two companies: Standard Oil New York and Vacuum Oil. As oil prices have plummet levels last see mid-1980s, oil companies have be pressure cut costs. Exxon, which have market value $176.7 billion, and Mobil, which have market value $61.1 billion, have histories be fiercely independent, and have already cut back staff and make themselves lean survive prolonged period low oil prices. But this have be particularly unsettling year oil industry, and there be little prospect that crude oil prices will recover soon. Consequently, chief executives most oil companies have have swallow their pride and look suitable partners. This summer, British Petroleum announce agreement buy Amoco Corp. $48.2 million, create world's third-largest oil company and prompt analysts predict more widespread consolidation. It show that megamergers be doable, say Adam Sieminski, analyst BT Alex. Brown. He added, however, that any combination Exxon and Mobil would not be easy match because Mobil have be know be proud company that have say that it would not want merge. Exxon, he added, be well-run company that like grow its businesses. He add that heads companies, Lee Raymond, chairman Exxon, which be base Irving, Texas, and Lucio Noto, chairman, president and chief executive Mobil, which be base Fairfax, Va., be different personalities. It will not be easy, he say combine two far-flung companies, which have vast networks refineries and gas stations that overlap United States and Europe. If you offer enough money you can make anything happen, he added. Both companies be pressure find new fields oil help them survive long term. Like other oil companies, they have hop quickly tap vast reserves Russia. even though they be prepared spend billions, they have hold back because political and economic crisis Russia and great reluctance russian officials and oil companies give control vast fields. Thus they have have fall back exploration areas their such deep waters Gulf Mexico well West Africa and parts Asia. such exploration be very expensive, and when big field be discovered, platforms cost $1 billion or more be require bring it production. oil prices have be pressure more year, fall more 40 percent $20-a-barrel level because grow inventories petroleum and decline asian demand cause economic crisis there. On Wednesday, crude oil January delivery fell 29 cents, or 2.6 percent, $11.86 barrel New York Mercantile Exchange, close 12-year low $11.42 reach June 15. Members Organization Petroleum Exporting Countries and some other oil-producing nations, notably Mexico, have try stem price drops pledge cut back production. But those pledges have not always be honored, and rally oil market this year have prove short-lived. OPEC members Wednesday continue their discussion extend their production cutbacks, and agreement be expect early Thursday. In spring, OPEC agree reduce production 2.6 million barrels day, 3 percent daily world supply 74 million barrels. The main result that agreement appear have be keep oil prices fall $10 barrel. Washington regulators say Wednesday that they have not be notify Exxon-Mobil discussions. The Federal Trade Commission be still review british Petroleum's pending purchase Amoco. An exxon-mobil deal would be certain receive several months' worth scrutiny commission, which would review how much industry combine company would control. Analysts and investment bankers be split logic potential deal. Some point difficulties that companies could face if they be combined. If you ask me if Exxon need be bigger, answer be probably no, say Garfield Miller, president Aegis Energy Advisors Corp., small independent investment bank base New York. It be hard say that there be anything particular gain. In particular, Miller said, two companies have enormous similarities their domestic refining and marketing businesses. They really do overlap quite bit, he said. You really do wonder what be benefit all that redundancy. Another investment banker energy business, speak condition anonymity, also question rationale discuss merger. When you look bp-amoco deal, you can rationalize it, banker said. But none those reasons apply exxon-mobil deal. But Amy Jaffe, energy research analyst James A. Baker III Institute Public Policy, say combination two companies would be logical, part because it would give them great influence bidding development projects Middle East. This be deal that make sense, Ms. Jaffe said. With this combine company, there be no project that would be too big. Ms. Jaffe say propose deal would provide each company assets areas where it have little influence. There be lot complementary assets where they be not redundant, she said. She say that Exxon, example, have strong presence Angola, while Mobil do not. And Mobil have significant assets caspian Sea and Nigeria, where Exxon be weak. Times be tough oil patch. Still, it boggle mind accept notion that hardship be drive profitable big oil either merge, British Petroleum and Amoco have already agree do, or least consider prospect, Exxon and Mobil be doing. Still, Big Oil and small oil be get squeeze low petroleum prices and high capital costs exploration. Given exotic locales most promising, untapped fields, it seem unlikely that exploration will get cheaper. And West Texas crude trading $12 barrel, it seem safe bet oil that won't be sell $100 barrel turn century price some analysts early 1980s be predict it would reach. Philip K.

The first issue be competition local markets. The only possible problem area there be West Coast, companies be pretty small players there.

46,"The raw passions be such that House Democrats not hesitate bellow You resign! You resign! speaker-elect Robert Livingston when he call House floor President Clinton quit White House face certain impeachment. Shockingly, stunningly, Livingston just that. He quit one breathtaking utterance, if flicking trump card heap impeachment angst fester his eyes debate chamber. In his one and only strategem lead his fellow House Republicans, Livingston's decision strike Congress verbal bomb. stun Democrats saw their fury vaporize instant. They have stand, almost stagger their feet, join Republicans prolonged, emotional ovation Livingston and his undeniable self-sacrifice. As they stood, Democrats sense Livingston have most suddenly close trap president and his defenders. For, impeachment issue set move Senate, Livingston, whose marital indiscretions be now public his obvious misery, choose show how question political leader's resignation be very much play this tumult-tossed city. I must set example that I hope President Clinton will follow, Livingston declared, flabbergast all attend impeachment debate and nation watch beyond. Livingston walk floor sheriff some bullet-pocked political High Noon, discard leadership badge he have wrest earlier speaker-casualty, Newt Gingrich. In corridor just beyond, doorman shout police officer: Livingston just resigned! What? What? come reply officer, who obviously think momentous announcement would be Clinton's impeachment, not livingston's political self-immolation. Just so, Democrats, already deep bone-raw exhaustion their long fight president, grasp bearings. It be surrender develop sexual McCarthyism! declare Rep. Jerrold Nadler, D-N.Y., lead presidential defender try rally Democrats argument that Livingston should not resign any more President Clinton should quit fire. But Republicans be surge fore strength Livingston's announcement, fight tears they rise salute him ultimate political role model grueling impeachment process it roar final minutes debate. For some it be no longer good enough make mistake, confirm that mistake and take consequences that mistake, say Tom DeLay, Republican whip, his hands shaking, his eyes tear he address House and seek drive example Livingston all way Pennsylvania Avenue. He understand what this debate be all honor, duty, integrity and truth, say DeLay argue that one swift blow, Livingston have demonstrate himself have be far better speaker Clinton have be president. With something political elan president show initiating Iraq attack his impeachment loomed, House Republicans, batter public opinion polls, have find rocket's red glare their own. I have hurt you all deeply and beg your forgiveness, Livingston tell House, nation and his family he announce retreat. only moments before, Democrats openly hiss man Livingston firmly read his judgment president: Sir, you have do great damage this nation year. presidential resignation be order, he continued, and then come shouts You resign! You resign! And Livingston close circle his career, he stun place collective breath disbelief and somehow almost threaten reduce dark historic issue House impeachment president matter anticlimax. They must not succeed, David Bonior, Democratic whip say Republicans he be give task refocus day misdeeds president, not departure speaker. We be here debate impeachment and should not be distract that, he declared. The only way we can stop this vicious cycle, Bonior cry out floor, be if we refuse give it, whether it be Bill Clinton or Bob Livingston. But House be still reel frenzied day fateful vote presidency approach and notion resignation lick capital city flame forest. reject last-minute democratic attempt soften its action censure, House representatives move impeach President William Jefferson Clinton perjury Saturday and call Senate try him, convict him and remove him office. But vote, Republicans press another line attack, demand Clinton's resignation. Rep. Robert Livingston, nominate speaker last month his party, startle House when he announce he would not run speaker and would resign House 21 years service. He urge president heal wound that you have created. You, sir, may resign your post. angry Democrats boo and shouted, You resign! Livingston continued, I can only challenge you such fashion if I be willing heed my words. Apologizing again extramarital affairs reveal two days ago, he said, I believe I have it me do fine job. But I cannot do that job or be kind leader that I would be current circumstances. then he bolt House chamber, nearly knock reporters and members down. (the House vote 228-206 approve first article impeachment, accuse Clinton commit perjury federal grand jury. The vote be announce 1:24 p.m. EST, leave 42nd president face trial Senate whether he should be remove office.) Clinton reject advice immediately. His spokesman, Joe Lockhart, said, The president have no intention resigning. By call Livingston reconsider, president argue more broadly resignation fire. perhaps speak cases, Lockhart said, It would be wrong give this insidious politics personal destruction. Unless Clinton change course, this would be only second impeachment president 209-year history Republic, and first Andrew Johnson be acquit 1868. Sen. Trent Lott Mississippi, majority leader, have insist that no bargaining censure can prevent it starting. But Senate could halt trial later part deal. Considering degree partisanship display Saturday, assemble two-thirds majority require Constitution conviction be most unlikely. sixty-seven votes would be required, and there be only 55 Republicans Senate, 45 Democrats. Four articles impeachment House charge Clinton perjury lie his affair Monica Lewinsky federal grand jury here Aug. 17. He be also charge perjury Paula Jones sexual harassment suit, obstruction justice and abuse power. The Republican argument, and over, be that Clinton have lie deny have sexual relations Ms. Lewinsky. Rep. Dick Armey Texas, majority leader, said, A nation laws cannot be rule person who break law. Rep. Nancy Johnson Connecticut said: There can be no justice truth. That be just profoundly so, and that be why perjury matters. Rep. Gerald Kleczka Wisconsin begin Democrats' arguments saying, What president be wrong, personally and morally, his acts not threaten our democracy and thus do not rise level impeachable offenses define our founding fathers our Constitution. Rep. Charles Schumer, New York's senator-elect, said: The rule law require that punishment fit crime. Allow us vote censure. Saturday's votes be penultimate step most serious conflict Congress and president Richard M. Nixon resign face impeachment and certain conviction Aug. 9, 1974. But while that case spin out 1972 break-in democratic headquarters Watergate complex, this one begin murky land deal Arkansas 1978. Through efforts Kenneth Starr, independent counsel law enact wake Watergate, investigation spread examine Clinton's affair White House intern. All year it have preoccupy capital immense disconnect public opinion; scandal become public January, polls have show that public oppose impeachment and want inquiry bring end. even Friday night, 13-hour debate, CBS News Poll 548 people show that only 38 percent want their representative vote impeachment; 58 percent want no vote. The conflict now enter uncharted seas, Nixon resignation cut matter short and Johnson trial occur different America, no nuclear weapons or cable television or public opinion polls. But capital be still rife confident speculation. Some guessed, or hoped, that results recent poll, which show increases support resignation way spare nation trial which Ms. Lewinsky and Linda Tripp would be star witnesses, would weaken Clinton's resolve. Others think Republicans, see dismal numbers poll their party's standing United States, would be first blink. With majority Senate, they have power end trial any time Senate receive notice impeachment day it convenes, Jan. 6, or next day. But while Clinton have focus polls, and CBS News survey show that 64 percent still approve his handle his job president, resignation could almost immediately subject him criminal prosecution. And Republicans have steadfastly ignore polls all year, and confront them directly Saturday. Representative J.C. Watts Oklahoma, newly elect chairman Republican caucus, said: What's popular isn't always right. You say polls be this. Polls measure change feelings, not steadfast principle. Polls would have reject Ten Commandments. Polls would have embrace slavery and ridicule women's rights. You say we must draw this close. I say we must draw line right and wrong, not tiny fine line executive fountain pen, big fat lead no. 2 pencil. And we must do it so every kid America can see it. The point be not whether president can prevail, whether truth can prevail. last weekend, when Judiciary Committee recommend four articles impeachment, Clinton's side still hop prevail help 20 30 republican moderates who be uncommitted. As week wear on, almost all them break president. One who not, Rep. Christopher Shays Connecticut, say Saturday: After Judge Starr's report Congress September, and his presentation Judiciary Committee November, I conclude that impeachable offenses be not proven, and that proven offenses be not impeachable. But president's continued failure come grips his actions, sincerity and arguments members Judiciary Committee sides aisle, change heart and conviction members my side aisle who originally oppose impeachment and who now support it, and strong and powerful opinion so many my constituents who oppose my position and who want president impeached cause me rethink my position. He added: yesterday morning, I visit president, I conclude that my original position be correct one, me. I believe that impeachable offenses have not be proven, and that proven offenses be not impeachable. But Rep. Tom DeLay Texas, who have lead Republican effort force Clinton office, dismiss his and other arguments moral relativism. He begin praise Livingston: There be no great american my mind, least today, Bob Livingston, because he understand what this debate be all about. It be honor and decency and integrity and truth; everything that we honor this country. It be also debate relativism vs. absolute truth. He continued, The president's defenders have say that president be morally reprehensible, that he be reckless, that he have violate trust american people, lessen their esteem office president and dishonor office which they have entrust him, and that that doesn't rise level impeachment. Rep. Jose Serrano New York said, My constituents don't hate Bill Clinton; they love him and they're pray him right this very moment. You may have votes today impeach him, you don't have american people. And let me tell you something, I grow public housing projects South Bronx. I can see bunch bullies when I see them. The bullies get theirs, and you're go get yours, too. Rep. Henry Hyde Illinois, Judiciary Committee chairman who bring charges House floor, say Congress and american people need distinguish private acts infidelity and public acts public officials. In Clinton's case, he said, House be deal serial violator oath who be chief law-enforcement officer. He say that Senate could be innovative and creative decide how best punish Clinton, that House be bind Constitution move ahead article impeachment. Justice be so important most humble us, Hyde said. Equal justice law that's what we're fight for. Democrats, reading same Constitution, voice diametrically conclusions, and attacked fairness proceedings that culminate Saturday. We're lose track distinction sins and crimes, say Rep. Jerrold Nadler, D-N.Y. We're lowering standards impeachment. What president have do be not great and dangerous offense republic. Democrats also criticize Republicans impeach Clinton very moment that U.S. troops wag war Iraq. Six days Christmas our troops be battle, and lame-duck Congress be rush overthrow commander chief, say Rep. David Bonior Michigan, second-ranking House Democrat. The ghosts Watergate hung House chamber. One Republican cite parallels charges House Judiciary Committee bring Nixon 25 years ago, and count that same committee bring House floor affirmation Saturday. Nixon cheated. He cheat electoral system, say Rep. Lindsey Graham, South Carolina Republican Judiciary Committee. And now, Graham said, full House be vote impeach Clinton because we believe he commit crimes that result cheat our judicial system. But most day's debate be firmly root Clinton's effort conceal his sexual affair Monica Lewinsky. Rep. Bob Barr, Georgia Republican Judiciary Committee who be one Clinton's fierce critics, hold copies U.S. Criminal Code, Judiciary Committee's report impeachment inquiry and, finally, Constitution, defend his decision impeach president. Today, we rely three pillars our society: law itself, evidence and Constitution, say Barr. There be no joy uphold law, Watts said. If we cannot see lawlessness, our children cannot recognize it. How can we tell our children honesty be best policy when we don't demand it policy? But Democrats assail very premise which Republican majority build its impeachment case Clinton. Rep. John Conyers Jr. Michigan, rank Democrat Judiciary Committee, assail four articles impeachment, count count, unfounded evidence and fail rise impeachment. He save his most savage scorn final count, abuse power. The majority have simply try dress perjury counts Watergate abuse-of-power language, Conyers said. Rep. Bob Livingston, who confess his colleagues Thursday night that he have have adulterous affairs, stun House chamber Saturday morning say impeachment debate President Clinton that he would not serve speaker and would quit Congress six months. He urge president follow his example and quit, too. But White House, where call Clinton's resignation be deride republican strategy, president send spokesman driveway urge Livingston reconsider his resignation. Livingston stand well House he have serve two decades and call Clinton resign his office rather force trial Senate, draw boo his colleagues and cat-calls that he should quit instead. He then just that. I must set example that I hope President Clinton will follow, Livingston announce shocked and silent chamber act that leave Republican Party total chaos just hours vote impeach Clinton. The decision also leave party leaderless eve open 106th Congress, when Republicans must govern one narrow majorities history. several Republicans, include Rep. Tom DeLay Texas, majority whip, somberly welcome news, suggest it relieve them excruciate embarrassment. In laud Livingston's move, DeLay said, He understand what this debate be all it's honor and decency and integrity and truth, everything we honor this country. But Democrats say they be aghast, and many include Clinton call Livingston reconsider his decision. Mr. Livingston's resignation be wrong, declare Rep. Jerrold Nadler, D-N.Y. It be surrender develop sexual McCarthyism. Are we go have new test if someone want run public office be you now or have you ever be adulterer? He call country distinguish sins and crimes. White House press secretary Joe Lockhart say Clinton be disappoint news Livingston's plans and wish that he would reconsider. Lockhart say president firmly believe that politics personal destruction this town and this country have come end. He reaffirm that Clinton would not resign, saying: The president be go do what's best interest country. It would be wrong give this insidious politics personal destruction. Livingston's announce resignation be all more stunning its disclosure process that could result president's removal office. The speaker be second line presidency, vice president. Newt Gingrich, outgo speaker, who be drive post Republicans lose five seats November election, technically remain speaker Jan. 6, when Livingston's election be be ratify new Congress. But Gingrich have remove himself daily operations House this extraordinary session and have begin dismantle his office. Livingston's decision be say be drive part anger group dozen conservatives his party who be disillusion that he have withhold news his affairs them. They have threaten withhold their votes him election January that would formally make him speaker. He be also concerned pain cause his family further disclosures, some members said. They add that, not lose many his party, be example he would set president offer resign his post now. DeLay, no. 3 House Republican leadership, be expect fill power vacuum least temporarily, deed if not title, while party regroups find new speaker. many members quickly rally Rep. Dennis Hastert Illinois. Hastert, one DeLay's deputy whips who be well respect his colleagues, have be promote candidate majority leader last month, never mount campaign. Rep. Dick Armey Texas only precariously hold his majority-leader post last month and be not consider likely candidate speaker. He be expect manage reorganization, which republican leaders have set Jan. 4. Livingston meet privately his close advisers Friday impeachment debate unfolded. Some his colleagues believe he have make mistake disclose Thursday night just House be move divisive debate impeachment that he have occasion stray my marriage. He tell republican leaders late Thursday afternoon that Hustler magazine be go expose his affairs early next year. Some leaders urge him keep quiet, his wife, Bonnie, encourage him tell his colleagues immediately, momentous vote that be near floor. At that point Thursday night, Roll Call, newspaper Capitol Hill, report its Web site that Livingston be go admit affairs and be go offer resign. In closed-door meeting his fellow Republicans, he admit affairs make no offer step down, receive three stand ovations instead. Thursday night, Livingston state that he would not be intimidate these efforts exploit his past. But Friday he remove himself public action and that night draw his close advisers his confidence. His aides say Saturday that they have no clue what be he be contemplating, and few other members be aware his plans. ask if he have any advance word, Rep. J.C. Watts Oklahoma, newly elect member Republican leadership, said: I have no idea. ask if there have be internal party pressure Livingston resign, Rep. Harold Rogers, R-Ky., said: I didn't know it if there was, added, There be some members who be critical it. As leaders try Saturday hold party together and House floor, most Republicans stick their prepared scripts floor favor impeach president. But some begin express their anguish. Rep. Henry Hyde, R-Ill., who admit his adulterous affair earlier this year, say Livingston's resignation: Those us who be sinners must feel wretched today. Something be go repeatedly that have be stopped, and that be confusion private acts infidelity and public acts. To much applause, Hyde declared: Congress have no business intrude private acts. Republicans, indeed Livingston himself, have make this same distinction Clinton's sexual indiscretions and Livingston's, say that Clinton lie his private acts and therefore abused legal system and his powers. As Livingston say his statement Thursday: These indiscretions be not employees my staff and I have never be ask testify oath them. Democrats hop that Livingston's seemingly drastic action would wake House how poison atmosphere have become and might prompt Republicans reconsider impeachment Clinton. Rep. Paul Kanjorski, D-Pa., said, We be now start offer sacrificial lamb terrible disease this is. In stir speech applaud some Republicans, Rep. Dick Gephardt Missouri, Democratic leader, praise Livingston worthy, good and honorable man and say his resignation be grave mistake. It's terrible capitulation negative political forces that be consume our political system and our country, Gephardt said, add that events last few days show life imitates farce. We need stop destroying imperfect people unattainable altar public morality, he said, urge his colleagues step back abyss and reject resignation, impeachment and vicious self-righteousness. The New York Times say editorial Sunday, Dec. 20: The Republicans' drive partisan impeachment base soley party-line voting power rather any sense proportion produce unexpected sideshow resignation Rep. Bob Livingston his role future speaker House. Analysts sides struggle President Clinton's future will point Livingston's downfall evidence generalize breakdown legislative civility Capitol Hill. Democrats will see moral symmetry, depict Livingston victim sexual puritanism he be wield Clinton. But one thing that no one should fall be Livingston's invitation use his resignation model resolve crisis White House. Livingston's statement rock Congress, it should not shake foundations somber constitutional process now underway. By lie oath, Clinton make it necessary House consider impeachment. The evidence convince most Americans that president should be censured, not remove office. Livingston allow GOP partisans block censure House. The result be that Saturday's expect impeachment vote, Livingston's unexpected announcement, mission Senate remain same. It must resist those Republicans who want short-circuit constitutional process demands resignation, and it must use upcoming Senate trial forum find censure commensurate president's personal dishonesty and offenses law. These require stern punishment not removal office. In undertake this work, Senate must also reassure american people that decisive wisdom core our messy-looking political system have not melt down. In such distempered times, this be shin opportunity Senate. Its members pride themselves be Republic's fire wall presidential excess and popular or partisan passions that sometimes seize House Representatives. No one can predict whether Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott will rise define challenge his career or whether he will surrender mean streak he acquire 16 grumpy years minority member House. We would see Lott reach star role history. Lott's growl response questions censure be not encouraging. He may be right that Constitution require him convene trial, nothing that document prevent him speedily guide Senate censure negotiations. Indeed, simple majority vote 45 Democrats 6 cooperate Republicans can end Senate trial any time, clear way introduction kind censure resolution suggest former Sen. Bob Dole. In intrigue report NBC, Tim Russert describe discussions bipartisan group senators censure that would involve some form presidential confession, fine and joint congressional request that Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr not prosecute Clinton courts. If Lott refuse allow bipartisan search censure, burden will fall respected members Joseph Lieberman democratic side and Orrin Hatch Republicans. Through cooperation, they can guide Senate punishment that fix Clinton history president who lie oath, avoids taint partisan vengeance associate House impeachment vote. The Senate's historic reputation prudence require it find appropriate punishment personally weak president who have damage rule law, not threaten stability government. House Speaker-elect Robert L. Livingston present fresh note shock impeachment debate President Clinton Thursday night Republican leader be force admit his republican colleagues that he have carry adulterous affairs his past. It have suddenly come my attention that there be individuals work together media who be investigate my personal background effort find indiscretions which may be exploitable me and my party eve upcoming historic vote impeachment, Livingston declare statement appear shock House Republican conference head disclosure it surface news reports. After hear his admissions close session, Livingston's colleagues give him stand ovation support and say question his resigning have never arisen. My fate be your hands, Livingston tell Republicans, accord lawmakers who be present. The debate president's fate would go forward, Republicans later insisted, draw distinctions speaker-elect's revelations and sex-and-mendacity scandal that have put Clinton brink impeachment. The president be charge impeachment resolution perjury and abuse power his attempt hide sexual indiscretions. Democrats offer no immediate comment, Republicans be brace hear Livingston's admissions allude debate Friday Democrats who have decry investigation president basically partisan and unfair rummage his sex life. Livingston, say he have seek spiritual counseling and have receive forgiveness his family, note he have several times tell reporters his campaign become speaker that I be run speaker, not sainthood. He added, There be reason those words. During my 33-year marriage my wife, Bonnie, I have occasion stray my marriage, and do so nearly cost me my marriage and family, Livingston say his brief prepared statement. But he attempt draw contrast allegations president, asserting: I want assure everyone that these indiscretions be not employees my staff and I have never be ask testify oath them. The disclosure speaker-elect's marital infidelities, disclose Rollcall, Capitol Hill newspaper, send new jolt uncertainty lawmakers they prepare momentous debate president's admit misbehavior office and whether he should be impeach and try Senate. Rep. Henry Hyde, Republican chairman House Judiciary Committee who be bring impeachment charges president, previously be cite magazine extra-marital affair his past. Then, Thursday night, Republicans voiced suspicions that democratic defenders president instigate media investigations effort embarrass Clinton's principal accusers. But no proof be offer Republicans leave their conference, face uncertainties debate that already promise be bare-knuckled its partisanship. Livingston leave conference surround Capitol police, not take questions wait reporters. His chief leadership aides immediately rally support. Some who would rather not struggle this constitutional question continue try twist debate unseemly investigation private lives, say Rep. Dick Armey, Republican majority leader. In its report internet Thursday night, Rollcall not disclose its source make oblique reference Hustler, sex magazine. Larry Flint, publisher Hustler, earlier this year advertise offer $1 million bounty information e members Congress guilty sexual indiscretions. It break your heart because we're all subject human frailties, say Asa Hutchinson, R-Ark., he leave conference. This be not comfortable circumstance anyone, he added, insist president and speaker-elect present two separate issues. We've get duty do constitution. It have get point where drastic action may be necessary. You know those movies Ebola virus outbreaks, where guys sterile suits come in, seal area and completely irradiate it? They may have do that Washington. Just eradicate us and start scratch. In few, short days we have manage make terms surreal, bizarre, split-screen America, shocking, runaway train and politics personal destruction useless cliches. We no longer govern here. We just roll gutter wonder who's next this sexual auto-de-fe. On Saturday morning, we have surreal, shocking, bizarre, split-screen image Bob Livingston, speaker-elect, step his marital infidelities be revealed. We be all pawns chessboard, Livingston said, ask president resign and then resign himself. Livingston's rabid pursuit president, he hop hide his dirty laundry, make him avatar hypocrisy capital rot hypocrisy. On Thursday night, when Livingston first confess his sins Republicans hop keep his hold his post, his colleagues give him stand ovation. And he make his surprise announcement Saturday, Republicans give him another ovation and step deliver encomiums their lose speaker. One's self-esteem get utterly crush times this, sigh Henry Hyde, another tormenter president who also have admit that he have succumb temptation. Tom DeLay, jagged-edge exterminator who may next-up speaker roundelay, be choke up, praise greatness Livingston understanding that this be debate relativism absolute truth. What could be more relative Republican who have hide lot affairs try impeach president lie his? Spurred Larry Flynt's bounty sinnuendo, city be brace more craziness. The Ship Fools reach cruise speed Friday evening, when we have frighten scene Republicans so crazed hatred president that they be railroad impeachment though United States be war Iraq, though House chamber be mostly empty, though Republicans be huddled glass house issue sex and lies, and though White House be still pitch tent and planning sleigh rides Winter Wonderland press party Monday. (The White House be keep journalists quarantine this year, encourage them bring their kids. To soak some that cozy family atmosphere, no doubt. Why be Republicans so obsessed, when everyone his right mind agree that impeachment be outlandishly over-the-top punishment Clinton and self-destructive course country? Because they genuinely hate president. They think he's dishonest, immoral, issue-stealing, selfish child '60s. They don't think they're go pay political price this, and if they do, they don't care. It might be great time see lot combovers, it's not great time see lot stature. The House debate be not history. It be just more hideous version The McLaughlin Group. While Republicans try draw distinction that Clinton have perjure himself, they ignore that president have be lure Starr-Jones attorney team testify Monica Lewinsky. Ordinarily one would feel sorry Livingston. But Republicans have bring this sexual doomsday machine themselves focus so single-mindedly Clinton's sex life. The Republicans be so determine do their high-tech lynching that they engage wacky role reversals. many Republican hawk argue that Bill Clinton should not be bomb Saddam, claim timing be suspicious, though they have hammer him not bomb five weeks ago. In incredibly unseemly display, Trent Lott, majority leader, and former Bush national security adviser Brent Scowcroft and Bush Secretary State Lawrence Eagleburger chime attack. There's too much hate here. And I hate it. We be here debate impeachment and should not be distract that, minority whip, Rep. David Bonior, Democrat Michigan, say Saturday's House debate, what leap out impossible goal. It would have take kaleidoscopic television screen capture constantly shift images compete center stage: impeachment, Iraq, resignation Rep. Robert Livingston, response White House. The months lead impeachment President Clinton have become series televise anticlimaxes, hours vote make that lack drama. There be hardly enough shorthand terms or split screens cover activity. All networks and cable channels carry moment that unexpectedly set tone, Livingston, Louisiana Republican, announce debate that he would not become House speaker. The commentators have be set carry congressional ratification inevitable vote, suddenly most plugged-in reporters be catch guard. As Tim Russert say Tom Brokaw NBC, Tom, knock us all over. In echo chamber that television news so becomes, share mantra have be weightier early morning. For only second time american history president would be impeached, go standard line. yet all pundits speculate and politicians telegraph every move, no one have hint Livingston resignation. The announcement was, Brokaw put it, least partly political ploy, and repercussions be immediate. Reporters begin gather word Capitol Hill candidates speaker's job, and conversation move next stage political tug war. The Republicans use Livingston's resignation say that president should resign, too; Democrats immediately counter idea that president would stay and that Livingston should well. That lead one less-expected split screens day, and it be not bad choice. While Congress be debating, CNN show anti-aircraft fire Baghdad one box. In other, Joe Lockhart, Clinton's press secretary, stand White House driveway tell reporters that president would Livingston reconsider his decision. There be more stateliness House television offers, and one reason be purely visual. Keep mind that we do not control picture, Dan Rather say CBS, explain that television cameras Congress be provide House, not individual networks. There be no way roam and zoom reaction shots, political convention. But sense history and decorum didn't last long CBS. At noon, vote, CBS go football game, become only network leave news coverage. CBS' corporate decision try have it ways mean that Rather would break updates Washington. I'll see you very soon, he say he sign complete coverage, look trouper. But he be position no news anchor should have be this day. He later announce impeachment votes split screen football game progress upper part screen. On other networks and cable channels, vote itself literally happen background. As tv screens tot numbers electronically-cast vote, members Congress mill and chat floor. even brief democratic walkout motion consider censure be defeat be thoroughly forecast. As Democrats straggle steps Congress, it look curiously undramatic television, though it probably make better still photograph once they be all place. And while votes be progress, jockey speaker's job heat up. We already have presumptive leader, Gwen Ifill NBC News say midafternoon, name Rep. Dennis Hassert, R-Ill., who have also be cite other networks likely candidate. If political and military action have not intruded, it might have be more obvious that debate House floor send message vast divisions politics and morality, signal how deep cultural fissure this crisis have opened. The impeachment, say Rep. Tom DeLay, R-Texas, be debate relativism vs. absolute truth. Rep. Jerrold Nadler, D-N.Y., contend that Congress have lose distinction sins and crimes, and argue sexual McCarthyism that have become prominent. And backdrop revelations adultery that lead Livingston's resignation, Rep. Dick Gephardt, minority leader, declare politics personal destruction have end. But all jabbering and political posturing continued, reporters race cover president's statement impeachment and late briefings Pentagon, there be little time focus profound cultural message those rhetorical flourishes. Bob Livingston, incoming speaker House, take no public role Friday debate unfold whether impeach President Clinton. His previous 24 hours have be his most visible month his party nominate him speaker and perhaps most excruciate his public career: He spend most day chaotic procedural wrangle terms Friday's debate; he end it tell his republican colleagues that he have have extramarital affairs his 20-year tenure Congress. His disclosure follow investigation Larry Flynt, publisher Hustler, sex magazine, who say Friday news conference Beverly Hills, Calif., that his publication have learn that Livingston have have adulterous affairs last 10 years. Flynt say earlier this year that he want expose hypocrisy those Washington who be investigate Clinton and October offer $1 million anyone who could prove they have have affairs members Congress. He say Friday that this large investigation, be publish perhaps soon January, would reveal what he describe indiscretions several other Republicans. He say he have no connection White House that he have hire investigative firm base Washington and make former employees FBI and CIA. He would not confirm whether firm be Terry Lenzner's Investigative Group Inc., which have do work president's private lawyers. Livingston be unavailable reporters Friday. He spend some time Friday morning sprawl chair back House chamber, listen debate whether impeach Clinton lie his sexual indiscretions. several colleagues kneel Livingston's knee, whisper him and pat him back. He spend most day private office chamber, avoid gauntlet reporters who lay wait him House and his regular office street. The only word out his aides be that Navy have award contracts worth millions dollars ships be build his Louisiana district Avondale Shipyards. During Friday's debate, handful Democrats make only oblique allusions human failures. For example, Rep. John Lewis, D-Ga., said: Let he that have no sin cast first stone. Who, who us have not sinned? But no one say that Livingston's disclosure or mild democratic attempts exploit it would influence their votes impeachment. Rather, House floor and hallway chitchat, Livingston's conduct seem be last thing that either Republicans or Democrats want talk about. Bob Livingston be first-rate human being, say Rep. David Obey, D-Wis., who have work closely and spar Livingston Appropriations Committee, interview. I will repeat what nuns taught me St. James long time ago: We would all be hell lot better look our souls rather try evaluate somebody else's. none us have any business have opinion it. even conservative Republicans seem ready overlook disclosure. We're not go say, `Bob, you can't be speaker because you violate your vows your wife,' say Rep. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C. Like many, include Livingston, Graham distinguish Livingston's conduct Clinton's say that president have trample legal system whereas Livingston's behavior be strictly private. Despite Flynt's claims, many Republicans blame Clinton administration smear Livingston, although they offer no evidence. This isn't just happen its own, say Rep. Dana Rohrabacher, R- Calif. The only thing certain now be uncertainty. The smart money shout that President Clinton will never resign, and he concurs. The smart money argue that Senate could not muster 67 votes that would be need remove wound president office, which would require defection 12 Democrats if all Republicans stand him. The smart money insist that someone will cut deal end all this. Maybe so. But smart money whispers, Remember. Remember that everyone Washington, include Rep. Henry Hyde, R-Ill., chairman Judiciary Committee, say House would never, ever, treat impeachment partisan issue. Wrong. Remember that all pundits predict democratic losses midterm elections, and when happened, they say impeachment be dead. Twice wrong. And remember that New Year nation may travel road it have never travel before. One other president, Andrew Johnson Tennessee, have be try Senate, course. But that happen different country one only 37 states, primitive communications, simple economy base largely agriculture, only minimal commitments abroad. In toxic politics century's end Washington, inconceivable have become commonplace. The wholly unanticipated announcement Saturday morning Rep. Robert Livingston, R-La., that he would not serve speaker and would resign Congress, his equally unanticipated disclosure Thursday night several extramarital affairs, only deepen capital's profound sense insecurity. The deadly sweep scythe neo-puritanism appear unstoppable, least moment, and Livingston's forthcoming resignation will increase pressure president do likewise. You've set us example, leader House Republican majority, Rep. Dick Armey Texas, tell Livingston Saturday. The example be that principle come power. The Democrats make point, argue that Livingston case show how very wrong it be savage people personal pecaddillos. One transcendently important thing remain same: Although surrounded judicial trappings and preside chief justice, trials presidents be political processes, power reside hands elective politicians. In addition narrow legal issues guilt or innocence, they can weigh considerations party, nation's future, their individual political well-being and almost anything else they care weigh reach verdict. The longer they took, more numerous call resignation would probably be. even Saturday's epochal roll-calls, four ten Americans interview late New York Times/CBS News Poll say they think president should step if he be be indicted, fact that large majority voice disapproval impeachment proceedings. What lie that seem contradiction, course, be fear that Clinton, and country him, would be incapacitated. No one take Andrew Johnson very seriously he escape conviction single vote. But Clinton, man powerful will whose whole life have be series comebacks, have already embark effort show that he can do nation's business. Richard Nixon claw his way back respectability leave White House when no one think he could; Clinton intend re-establish his authority while still office. He have one great advantage: Two-thirds american public continue voice its approval his political stewardship, it think him man. The president will press hard, his much-reduced leverage, deal censure. Indeed, fine piece political irony one could ask for, he have already seek enlist former Sen. Bob Dole, Republican he defeat 1996, emissary Senate majority. The numbers be not unpromising: help six Republicans, 45 Democrats could end trial any time and pas censure resolution that House would surely take up. There be enough Republican moderates and sometime party-buckers make that plausible target. But republican leader Senate, Trent Lott Mississippi, who have make his unwillingness take president's word plainly evident recent days, be determine fight such trial-aborting arrangement. It be clear that Clinton's reputation have be stain forever, no matter what Senate does. The spot will not out. History will remember this man who so coveted glow legacy not impresario economic growth, not Moses who point way 21st century, second president ever be impeached, if not first be ousted. That harsh word, impeachment, will cling his name surely Teapot Dome clings Harding's and Depression Hoover's. But he be not alone have suffer grievous injury political avalanche that be shake loose disclosure Clinton's sexual relationship former White House intern, Monica Lewinsky. The Republicans' public support have shrivel 40 percent new Times/CBS News poll, its low level 14 years, and it could go low once fact impeachment sinks in. Journalists be see many jackals, indifferent personal suffering or national angst they may cause long they get story, and none too concerned accuracy. In fact, whole political culture 1990s, its criminalization political conduct and its seem indifference important national and international issues, have fall disrepute ordinary Americans. The last week seem crystallize long-term decline political civility. Republicans call Clinton liar, he be commit american pilots skies Iraq, and Democrats accuse their rivals conduct political lynching or political coup d'etat. Bipartisanship may have be big victim all. Party lines Saturday's rolls call held firm leg irons. Almost all Republicans who oppose impeachment so not exclusively legal principle least partly because special political circumstances democratic majority Rep. Constance Morella's district Maryland suburbs Washington, example, and gratitude Rep. Peter King, R-N.Y., Clinton's peacemaking Ireland. It be hard see who have emerge it reputation enhanced, perhaps Hillary Rodham Clinton, staunch face deception. If some threats and dire predictions uttered House Democrats recent days be be take face value, nation be enter Era Bad Feelings, polar second Era Good Feelings, similar that 1820s, that Clinton have hop preside over. Rep. Tom Sawyer, D-Ohio, compare Clinton Friday Sir Thomas More, execute treason 1535 because his religious beliefs. He quote More's words admonition today: What you have hunt me be not my actions thoughts my heart. It be long road you have opened. God help statesmen who walk your road. But amidst all loose talk permanent damage this institution or that, remember: Things change startle speed modern American politics, and institutions american government have prove extraordinarily resilient. President Nixon, it be almost universally agree 1974, have weaken american presidency many decades come. nobody say that eight years Ronald Reagan, and that be only 15 years later. In end, will people mean nothing. Bob Livingston couldn't have be clear that. His mind and mind his followers be closed. even bomb continue Iraq and Americans coast coast be clamor alternative impeachment, his adulterous be be flush out grotesque invasions privacy that inevitably follow relentlessly prurient pursuit president, country begin contemplate destructive effects lengthy and bitter Senate trial, speaker-designate arrogantly and stupidly proclaimed: Let us disregard influences. The radicals Hill would hear nothing echoes their fanaticism. Impeach! Impeach! And that continue stun announcement Saturday morning that Livingston would quit House. Dismayed partisan stampede, Dick Gephardt, Democratic leader, warn impeachment debate Friday: In your effort uphold Constitution, you be trample Constitution. David Bonior, Democratic whip, said: This be wrong. It be unfair. It be unjust. At time when events world and challenge home demand that we stand united, censure be one solution that can bring us together. To my colleagues aisle, I say let go your obsession. listen american people. But voices reason would not be heard. Livingston and his right-wing colleagues, Tom DeLays, Henry Hydes, Bob Barrs, be mission destruction and would not be denied. Ordinary Americans could cry out all they wanted. They could protest and demonstrate, send faxes and E-mails. It didn't matter. The right be march and democracy be run. Rep. Thomas Barrett, Democrat Wisconsin, try remind his republican colleagues that Constitution do not allow you remove president office because you can't stand him. He was, course, ignored. The Republicans will pay huge price their brazen, utterly partisan attempt drag president White House defiance will people. The party's contempt voters be arrogantly quite adequately summed Alan Simpson, former senator Wyoming, who said: The attention span Americans be which movie be come out next month and whether quarterly report their stock will change. If voters be dope that Mr. Simpson think they are, then come 2000 everyone will have forget there be impeachment crisis. But Rep. Robert Menendez, D-N.J., be probably closer truth when he said, I warn my colleagues that you will reap bitter harvest unfair partisan seeds you sow today. One many strange events couple weeks be way which virtually all previously undecided Republicans, so-called moderates, surrender their independence and line lackeys follow right wing's lead. All proclaim loudly that they be vote principle, fact it be exercise mass cowardice, exemplify Rep. John McHugh upstate New York. McHugh announce Tuesday that he would vote impeachment. But if his decision be base principle, he have odd way express it. The Washington Post say McHugh appear have no stomach Senate conviction or removal president office. Of his colleagues Senate, McHugh said, I, one, would accept, welcome, their mercy. In other words, let Senate do heavy constitutional lifting. McHugh may have wish out loud mercy, he clearly be too frightened right-wingers House cast compassionate vote himself. The GOP can no longer conceal that it be party extremists, right-wing absolutists, party out step political and cultural orientation most Americans. Bob Livingston may be leaving, his arrogant comment can still serve his party's slogan. Let us disregard influences. Let us disregard people. ","During the Clinton impeachment debate in the House, Speaker-elect Bob Livingston declared that he would set an example for the president and resign from Congress over revelations of his marital infidelities.Republican demands that the president also resign were rejected by Democrats who also said that Livingston should not quit and that the Speaker-elect's resignation was, in the words of Jerrold Nadler (D-N.Y), ""a surrender to sexual McCarthyism"".With the House vote to impeach, the president will face a Senate trial, but it is unlikely that 67 members will vote for conviction.The trial could be mercifully shortened, however, by a vote of censure.","As impeachment proceedings in the House approached a climax, House members were stunned by an admission from House Speaker elect Livingston that he was guilty of an adulterous affair.The admission follows disclosures by Hustler published Larry Flynn, who had offered one million dollars to anyone who could provide such information on a House or Senate member.Livingston's admission was met with a standing ovation by House members, as was his subsequent resignation.In resigning, Livingston called on President Clinton to do the same.Political pundits see the whole process as driven by partisan politics.","House Speaker-elect Robert L.

47,"The first part international space station be smoothly orbit Earth Friday faultless launch that mark start new age space exploration and colonization. A russian Proton booster rocket carry module its initial orbit 200 kilometers (125 miles) Earth and unit be operate planned, officials said. Russia's Zarya, or Sunrise, module be fly alone two weeks rendezvous american space shuttle Endeavour, which be be launch Dec. 3 carry Unity connect module. Space officials 16 nations take part project cheer rocket soar cloudy sky central asian steppe Baikonur launch pad Friday year later planned. During the, pickup 4th pvs Endeavour's astronauts connect first two building blocks international space station Sunday, create seven-story tower shuttle cargo bay. It be first time that Russian-built Zarya control module and made-in-america Unity chamber have ever touched. It look be perfect and, hopefully, long-lasting fit. We have capture Zarya, commander Robert Cabana announce moment two pieces come together. Congratulations crew good ship Endeavour, reply Mission Control. That's terrific. The 240-mile-high construction job begin two hours earlier Nancy Currie's capture Zarya (russian Sunrise) use shuttle robot arm. We're halfway home, Cabana said. then come hard part: stack two giant cylinders cargo bay. The two station pieces be so big 77 feet tip one tip other combine mass 70,000 pounds that Currie and her crewmates have rely computerize vision system and camera views, rather direct line sight. This be first time such blind dock have ever be attempted. Currie position solar-winged Zarya, still end shuttle robot arm, several inches directly Unity. It be slow going; she want and need perfect alignment. Once she be sure she have it, Cabana fire Endeavour's thrusters, and brief burst raise shuttle and thereby Unity enough dock mechanisms two station components snap together. The historical moment occur South Pacific. The union intend last station's 15-year or more lifetime set stage spacewalk two astronauts Monday attach electrical connectors and cables two components. Mission Control think Sunday's work might take hours longer plan and give six astronauts plenty time tasks. But everything occur more or less when and how it be suppose to, aside piece space junk that stray too close. Before begin their final approach Zarya, six astronauts have steer clear chunk rocket launch last month California. Mission Control order pilots fire shuttle thrusters put extra three miles Endeavour and space junk, put Endeavour total five miles orbit debris. The small gap would have be probably little too close comfort, Mission Control said. The big worry, far, be Endeavour's pursuit and capture Zarya, and its coupling Unity. The shuttle's 50-foot robot arm have never handle object massive 41-foot, 44,000-pound Zarya, power and propulsion module that be launch Kazakstan Nov. 20. It will provide all necessary electricity and steer fledgling space station permanent control module can be launch next summer. Minutes Zarya's capture, Cabana call that two antennas module be still undeployed russian flight controllers have feared. The antenna must be fully deploy order Zarya's manual docking system work; that system won't be need next summer, officials said. The only other problem be Zarya battery; astronauts take replacement part. The 36-foot, 25,000-pound Unity, first American-made component, will serve connect passageway, or vestibule, future modules. It be crucial that Zarya and Unity be joined; if they could not be connect robot arm, NASA would have send out two spacewalk astronauts manually fit them together. In all, three spacewalks be plan Endeavour's 12-day flight, not only hook electrical connections two modules install handrails and other tools future crews. The joined modules will be release Endeavour once all work be completed. NASA estimate 43 more launches and 159 more spacewalks will be need this mission assemble entire orbit complex. once completed, 16-nation space station will have mass 1 million pounds, be long football field, and house seven astronauts and cosmonauts. russian space officials give first module international space station routine tweak Saturday push it high orbit, and convene meet Earth map out its future. Flight controllers fire one module's two maneuvering engines raise it orbit 230 kilometers (157 miles) space, station's public affairs office said. russian Space Agency general director Yuri Koptev tell reporters maneuver be carry out great accuracy, and 24-ton core module be cruise space any problems. The module, call Zarya, or Sunrise, lift Friday Baikonur launchpad Kazakstan initial orbit 200 kilometers (125 miles) Earth. Zarya be serve space tugboat early stages international project, provide propulsion, power and communications.

The international space station be u.s.-led successor Russia's Mir space station, and be be heralded space officials vehicle unprecedented international cooperation space 21st century. The heads space agencies United States, Russia, Japan and Canada, European Space Agency, meet Moscow Saturday discuss project, Interfax news agency reported. The space agency heads agree schedule future meetings and hold scientific conference project somewhere Europe, unspecified date. also Saturday, head Russia's Mission Control, Vladimir Lobachev, be quote say that Russia would take lead role manage international space station its first five years. Previously, space officials have say station would be jointly control Moscow and Houston, U.S. space agency NASA take lead role. accord Interfax, Lobachev say it make sense Russia control project because Russian-built Zarya and Russian-built service module would perform most life support and navigational functions station's first five years. Furthermore, russian engineers be more experienced this job and NASA officials be aware this, he said. The space station be expect cost least dlrs 40 billion, which United States be expect pay dlrs 24 billion. Russia's financing problems delay initial launch year, and some critics have say station amounts expensive way NASA keep Russia's beleaguered space program alive. The station will serve orbital home visiting astronauts and cosmonauts least 15 years.

Built Russian company and be launch atop Russian booster rocket, 24-ton Zarya (Sunrise) control and cargo module be u.s.-funded component station. It will serve space tugboat early stages project, provide propulsion, power and communications. The unmanned launch, set 9:40 Moscow time (0640 GMT) Friday Baikonur Kazakhstan, have be delay one year mainly because cash-strapped russian space agency's failure complete another part station. After years discussing, plan and replanning, we be launch hardware, Gretchen McClain, deputy associate administrator new station, say news conference earlier this week. We be ready begin project that will bring us millennium women and men live and work space permanently. russian officials add their traditional note superstition. It be not russian tradition preface launch ... some advance statements. I would knock wood, which be rather common Russian tradition, say Alexander Krasnov, deputy chief russian Space Agency's man flight department. The station, involve 16 nations United States and Russia play big roles, will consist more 100 elements that will take 45 assembly flights complete. It be due be complete 2004. The station will weigh 500 tons (more million pounds) and be expect cost least dlrs 40 billion, United States plan pay dlrs 21 billion. It will serve orbital home visiting astronauts and cosmonauts 20 years. Zarya be fly alone two weeks rendezvous american space shuttle Endeavor, which be be launch Dec. 3 carry Unity connect module. The shuttle crew will attach two modules together three space walks, use Endeavors robot arm. The 12.4-meter (41.2-feet) Zarya hold more 6 tons fuel its 16 tanks and be capable fly independently 430 days. Its control system consist 36 thrusters and two large engines major orbital changes. It will be launch three-stage heavy-lift Proton booster rocket that would put Zarya orbit less 10 minutes blastoff. In ensue days, ground controllers will gradually adjust its orbit preparation meeting Endeavor. The space station will not be inhabitable early 2000, launch Russian crew module which be set blast next July or August. Russia have repeatedly fail meet deadlines construct crew module, put whole project schedule. have lose hope get promised government funds, russian space agency have sell its early research time station NASA dlrs 60 million complete segment. Agency chief Yuri Koptev say that take part new station be only hope beleaguer russian space industry, whose funding have collapse soviet collapse. The project would allow Russia keep 80,000 jobs next 15 years. Koptev assail some russian space engineers who continue insist that more money should be put Russia's batter 12-year old Mir space station extend its lifetime instead commit more funds new space outpost. The choice mustn't be determine emotions. Some people be glue one thing (mir) and don't care rest, Koptev say recent news conference. We must proceed understand what would take us future, allow us preserve our industry. The russian Khrunichev company have earn dlrs 200 million building Zarya, whose design be base earlier soviet spacecraft, include some Mir's six modules. WASHINGTON NASA and russian Space Agency have agree set aside last-minute russian request launch international space station orbit close Mir, officials announce Friday. While put new station closer Russia's 12-year-old Mir station would make it easy transfer equipment and supplies old outpost new one, request come too late be act on, say Randy Brinkley, NASA's space station program manager. NASA be surprise last week when Russia's prime station contractor propose orbital position change just two-and-a-half weeks launch first part new station. Delaying Nov. 20 flight 10 hours match orbits would have force similar shifts subsequent assembly flights, and result potentially unfavorable sun angles solar-powered station, engineers said. We have mutually conclude that it would not be prudent make these changes, Brinkley say news conference hold Johnson Space Center Houston. It add technical complexity and risks mission that be not justified. The decision, which follow frank and candid discussions two partners, be not impose United States, he said. The conclusions be mutual, Brinkley said. Both sides conclude that it not make sense. The Russians, struggle find money their space program their nation economic collapse, have say they want transfer thousands pound new equipment and scientific instruments Mir economy move. However, some critics question Russians' motives, wonder if request orbital change be part plan delay decommission and destruction Mir, which Russians have agree do next summer. The Russians have so little money that United States and other partners international station fear that money spend Mir will prevent Russia meet its obligations new project. The Mir compete international space station very critical resources and funding, Brinkley said. NASA will consider ideas salvage Mir's research equipment use international space station, he said, only if it do not interfere assemble new station. The United States and 15 other nations plan begin build new station orbit next week when Russians launch module that will supply power and propulsion early stages five-year construction period. The space shuttle Endeavor be follow Dec. 3 second station part, u.s.-built connect passageway that attach first module. The first piece international space station be orbit Earth Friday, sprout antenna and unfold solar power panels it await other segments, which will eventually grow large orbital laboratory history. The module, call Zarya russian term mean sunrise or dawn, take flawless ride space atop three-stage russian Proton booster rocket that lift 1:40 a.m. eastern time Baikonur cosmodrome Kazakhstan. The launching be witness heads space agencies 16 nations that be sponsor station, which will cost least $40 billion build next five years. Zarya, build Russia $240 million United States, be be join two weeks first american module, dock hub call Unity. The space shuttle Endeavour be take Dec. 3 rendezvous Zarya and attach two units. This be be follow 43 more flights American and russian rockets carry more 100 parts be assemble space form 900,000-pound research station housing seven astronauts. Daniel Goldin, administrator NASA, say news conference launching, now we only have 44 launches go, 1,000 hours space walks and countless problems. But because all partner nations trust each other and work together, he said, international space station be go be reality. even new space station be come together, questions continue fate Russia's exist space laboratory, 12-year-old Mir. Because collapse russian economy, doubts that Russia can produce enough rockets and other equipment support projects lead Russia promise that it would abandon Mir and destroy station next summer. However, recent weeks russian officials have be lobby find ways extend Mir's life. accord report news agency Reuters, President Boris Yeltsin's space adviser, Yevgeny Shaposhnikov, say Friday he be prepare number proposals extend Mir's life year 2000. Support such options have be grow recent weeks russian space officials, astronauts and nationalists, who see Mir symbol russian achievements space. James Van Laak, NASA's deputy manager operations space station, say Friday that agency have not receive any formal proposals extend Mir's life. NASA would find such proposal unacceptable if it have any measurable impact international space station, Van Laak say telephone interview Johnson Space Center Houston, No one have any objection Mir or keep it operational if Russians find way support projects, they have demonstrate they can. Yuri Koptev, head russian Space Agency, say launch Zarya, 42,000-pound space tugboat that will supply power and propulsion early stages station construction, be need vindication trouble russian space program. The russian space industry be alive and well and be perfectly able fulfill all its commitments international space station, Koptev said. A Russian Proton booster rocket carry first part international space station orbit Friday, herald start new era international space colonization. russian space officials and cheered ground control announce that capsule have separate its booster rocket and reach its first orbit 200 kilometers (125 miles) Earth. Success, shout one exultant official some 10 minutes giant rocket blast and enter orbit. The heads space agencies 16 nations participate project watch lift-off distance 5 kilometers (3 miles). Strategic Rocket Forces troops who have prepare launch be underground bunkers avoid poison highly toxic rocket fuel. Russian and U.S. officials say launch be flawless and module perform well initial tests. They caution that much work remain be do get ambitious space station project and working. now we only have 44 launches go, 1,000 hours space walks and countless problems, because trust and mutual respect ... international space station be go be reality, NASA chief Daniel Goldin tell press conference launch. His russian counterpart, Yuri Koptev, say launch be vital vindication trouble russian space industry, prove it could play major role space operations. today we make truly epoch-making step carry out this project. The russian space industry be alive and well and be perfectly able fulfill all its commitments international space station, he said. The launch go smoothly, rocket soar cloudy sky central asian steppes. The huge roar rocket reverberate dozens kilometers (miles) empty plain base. The mood launch pad be tense launch, space officials and workers anxiously make last-minute checks ensure there be no problems. Solar power panels module be successfully deploy shortly it reach its first orbit and all systems be work normally, officials said. The launch Russian cargo module, which have be delay more year, ushers new era cooperation former space-race rivals. Space officials express optimism that cooperation would far promote world stability end Cold War. We still have some contradictions, we still have combat missiles aim each other, predominant trend be state cooperation and do things together, say Yuri Semyonov Russia's Energia space company. The 12.4-meter (41.2-feet) Zarya, or Sunrise, be launch three-stage Proton booster rocket. Zarya be design serve space tugboat early stages project, provide propulsion, power and communications. Engineers finish final preparations early Friday liftoff 24-ton module. The rocket blast cloudy skies and strong winds, and disappear clouds 40 seconds later. The international space station, u.s.-led successor Russia's beleaguer Mir, involve 16 nations and be due be complete 2004. It will consist more 100 elements that will take 45 assembly flights complete. Russia's crucial participation have be hamper country's financial problems. The launch first segment be postpone repeatedly, mainly because chronically break russian space agency couldn't afford complete another part station that be go later. Zarya be fly alone two weeks rendezvous american space shuttle Endeavor, which be be launch Dec. 3 carry Unity connect module. The space station will not be inhabitable least early 2000, launch Russian crew module which be set blast next July or August. The space station be expect cost least dlrs 40 billion, United States plan pay dlrs 24 billion. It will serve orbital home visiting astronauts and cosmonauts least 15 years. Russia have repeatedly fail meet deadlines construct crew module, put whole project schedule. have lose hope get promised government funds, russian space agency have sell research time station NASA dlrs 60 million complete segment. Russia rent Baikonur launch pad Kazakstan. Endeavour and its astronauts close Sunday capture first piece international space station, Russian-made Zarya control module that have be connect Unity chamber shuttle. stack two giant cylinders 240 miles Earth be consider most difficult part mission. The job fell Nancy Currie, shuttle crane operator who have deftly hoist and reposition Unity cargo bay Saturday. The two station pieces be so big 77 feet tip one tip other combine mass 70,000 pounds that Currie and her crewmates be go have rely computerize vision system and camera views, rather direct line sight. such blind dock have never be attempt before. Mission Control give astronauts plenty time tasks. The main thing I've try do last two years work this flight be make sure we have time. We have margin everything, say flight director Bob Castle. Before begin their final approach Zarya Russian Sunrise shuttle's six astronauts have steer clear chunk rocket launch last month California. Mission Control order pilots fire shuttle thrusters put extra three miles Endeavour and space junk, put Endeavour total five miles orbit debris. The small gap would have be probably little too close comfort, Mission Control said. The big worry, far, be Endeavour's pursuit and capture Zarya, and its coupling Unity. The shuttle's 50-foot robot arm have never be assign handle object massive 44,000-pound Zarya, power and propulsion module that be launch Kazakhstan Nov. 20. It will provide all necessary electricity and steer fledgling space station permanent control module can be launch next summer. The 36-foot, 25,000-pound Unity will serve connect passageway, or vestibule, future modules. In case Zarya and Unity could not be connect robot arm, two spacewalking astronauts would have manually fit them together. The astronauts would be go out anyway Monday attach electrical connectors and cables two components. In all, three spacewalks be plan Endeavour's 12-day flight. NASA estimate 43 more launches and 159 more spacewalks will be need this mission assemble entire orbit complex. once completed, 16-nation space station will have mass 1 million pounds, be long football field, and house seven astronauts and cosmonauts. Two astronauts venture back out another spacewalk Wednesday attach antennas international space station construction nearly 250 miles Earth. For second time this week, Jerry Ross and James Newman float out hatch shuttle Endeavour work seven-story, 35-ton station take shape open cargo bay. Their no. 1 priority be attach two 100-pound antennas Unity, American-made side space station. Their other job, time permitting, be trickier: try open stick antenna Zarya, Russian-built control module. The plan seven-hour spacewalk be not nearly difficult or crucial Monday night's outing, which Ross and Newman hook 40 electrical connections Zarya and Unity. The plan call men lug two suitcase-size antennas halfway Unity and install them sides 36-foot cylinder. Once activated, antennas will provide direct, virtually uninterrupted communication link Unity and NASA's Mission Control. Otherwise, U.S. flight controllers would have rely sporadic coverage provide russian ground stations. The electronic and computer hookups antennas will be make Unity Thursday, entire crew enters orbit station first time. other spacewalk chores Ross and Newman Wednesday evening include erect sunshade computer mount Unity. Mission Control decide just spacewalk let Newman take crack unjamming Zarya antenna. Flight controllers urge caution. The antenna be roll spool, and engineers worry 3-foot strip might pop open enough force hurt him if he get too close. Newman have 10-foot grappling hook job. The antenna be one two that fail open properly Zarya's Nov. 20 launch Kazakstan. One more spacewalk be plan Endeavour's 12-day mission: On Saturday, Ross and Newman will conduct photo survey and take out sack tools that will be use future station visitors. Newman also may try unjam other Zarya antenna. This be sixth spacewalk Ross his 18-year NASA career, most American, and third Newman. ",NASA and the Russian Space Agency readied the first part of an international space station for launch from Baikonur base.They decided not to change the orbit of the Zarya module as Russia had requested.Zarya's Nov. 20 launch was a success.The Zarya module orbited Earth for 2 weeks before a rendezvous with U.S. shuttle Endeavor to join it to the Unity module.It was tweaked and working well.It will serve as a space tugboat.The first 2 building blocks of the international space station were successfully joined by Endeavor astronauts in the shuttle's open cargo bay.Endeavor astronauts made 2 of 3 planned spacewalks to work on the space station modules.,"Russia launched the first piece of the international space station into orbit a year after the originally scheduled date.The launch follows a last minute Russian request to change the orbit of the space station to put it closer to Mir.This request was set aside.Two weeks later, the U.S. carried the Unity chamber into orbit.U.S. astronauts aboard the Endeavor shuttle then joined the Unity chamber to the Russian Zarya control module.The resulting 7 story structure appeared to be a perfect fit.In a subsequent second space walk, the astronauts were to install antennas on the Unity chamber as well as to attempt to unjam a Russian antenna.","Jerry Ross and James Newman spacewalked to attach antennas to Unity, the American half of the first stage of the 16-nation space station.Unity will be a connecting passageway for other modules.The other portion of the fledgling station, the Russian- built and launched Zarya module, will provide power and propulsion to the facility.The successful launch of Zarya, which had been delayed over a year due to funding woes, was hailed by the Russian Space Agency head as proof that the Russian space industry ""is perfectly able to fulfill all of its commitments on the international space station"".Russia is scheduled to launch the crew module next year.","After a year's delay Russia launched the first unit of the international space station, then pushed it to a higher orbit.Zarya will provide propulsion, power, and comms.US shuttle Endeavour made a blind docking with Zarya.Two spacewalks made electrical connections with Unity, which will serve as a passageway, attached its antennas and attempted to open a stuck Zarya antenna.A Russian cost-cutting proposal to orbit the station closer to Mir jointly vetoed.Russia promised to destroy Mir but now wants to extend its life.Russia sold early research time on the station to NASA to pay construction costs but claims the management lead for 1st 5 years."
48,"Caught middle economic crisis, many brazilian factories fear they won't be able pay their workers mandatory year-end bonus. So they're pay products instead cash. Some workplaces have already offer their employees such things hammers, nails, screws and bolts instead traditional cash bonus that normally be equivalent one month's wage, say head Brazil's large federation trade unions. The idea be completely unacceptable, say Joao Antonio Felicio, secretary-general federation, which represent more 2,000 unions and 19 million workers. We will recommend our unions reject such preposterous proposal. But strap cash and punished high interest rates and decline sales, factory owners may have no other choice, say Joseph Curi, president Sao Paulo State Association Small Industries, which represent 110,000 factories that employ nearly 800,000 workers. Access credit be almost impossible, Curi said. If banks and government don't create some kind emergency credit line, only option many our associates will have will be use products pay bonus. Factories that produce clothes, shoes, food, toys and household appliances be most enthusiastic idea, Curi said. Curi predict harsher times Brazil belt-tightening austerity package newly re-elected President Fernando Henrique Cardoso be expect announce Tuesday. The measures, aim curb country's ballooning budget deficit equal 7 percent gross domestic product be expect include spending cuts and, possibly, more taxes. There be lot talk increase taxes, which mean less cash circulate market and more credit restrictions, Curi said. It be shortsighted approach that will spell more recession and collapse many small factories. Brazil have be major casualty global economic crisis, buffet loss investor confidence and strong outflow capital. The country's foreign reserves have fall dlrs 50 billion, dlrs 70 billion end July. In effort prevent collapse nation's currency, real, and stem capital flight, interest rates be hike 50 percent year. For union leader Felicio, propose product-for-cash swap be clear sign despair business sector be feel because recessive economic policies bring Real Plan, economic stabilization program put together 1994 when Cardoso be finance minister. The plan succeed slash inflation 2,400 percent almost zero today. But it also bring recession and unemployment, which now stand almost 8 percent, high decade. President Fernando Henrique Cardoso's efforts repair large economy Latin America may depend outcome this weekend's gubernatorial elections. Cardoso want impose tough measures that would slash government spending and impose new taxes try halt slide Brazil's economy and restore investor confidence. But his plan, expect be unveiled next week, must be approve Congress, and state governors have enormous sway local delegations. The influence governors have their congressional bloc be overwhelming, say University Sao Paulo political scientist Eduardo Kugelmas. Brazil have be catch financial turmoil that begin more year ago Southeast Asia. As wary investors have flee its financial markets, Brazil's foreign reserves have fall dlrs 50 billion dlrs 70 billion end July. On Sunday, voters return polls runoff elections 12 states and Federal District Brasilia. The outcome will likely determine how successful Cardoso be get Congress approve his economic program, which be aim trim budget deficit. New income, fuel and bank transaction taxes be expect be proposed. Kugelmas say opponents president stand good chance win four large states Sao Paulo, Minas Gerais, Rio de Janeiro and Rio Grande do Sul. If they win, president will face tough uphill battle, he said. Cardoso need governors' support not only influence congressional delegations, also hold their spending. The problem be that none candidates Sunday's elections ... want be identify unpopular austerity measures, say Kugelmas. So they promise spend more money schools, hospitals and public work projects. Sao Paulo, Brazil's industrial and financial powerhouse, be perhaps state most critical success Cardoso's austerity plans. With more 34 million inhabitants, nearly equal entire population neighbor Argentina, it alone accounts more one-third Brazil's economic output and 70 513 congressional seats. While incumbent governor Mario Covas, Cardoso ally who be seek re-election, have commit himself austerity plan, Covas opponent Paulo Maluf be question mark. If Maluf wins, he will use his victory launch pad presidency 2003, Kugelmas predicted. And that mean he will try stay far away possible any austerity measure. Brazil and International Monetary Fund move closer Tuesday agreement expect dlrs 30 billion rescue package world's ninth-largest economy. A joint statement IMF and brazilian government say two sides agree Brazil should aim reduce its budget deficit expect eight percent gross domestic product zero 2000. The statement be issue weekend talks IMF officials and brazilian delegation head Pedro Parente, executive secretary Finance Ministry. Representatives World Bank and Inter-American Development Bank take part talks. Both organizations well private banks be expect contribute rescue package. Brazil be late country be hit financial crisis that begin 15 months ago Asia and then spread Russia. Brazil have lose dlrs 25 billion foreign currency reserves August when Russia default its debts and spark new crisis confidence emerge market countries. If instability continue Brazil it could affect Argentina, its main trading partner, and other latin american economies. Despite re-election Fernando Henrique Cardoso second term president and announcement Oct. 8 that Brazil and IMF have agree broad outlines financial assistance package, investors continue withdraw large sums money Brazil. Cardoso be prepare emergency program budget cuts restore investor confidence and prevent devaluation country's currency. Investors want Cardoso outline plans this week he be expect wait Sunday's second elections state governors, whose support he need his budget cuts. The joint statement say brazil-imf discussions be aim prepare ground prompt support international community, include IMF, multi-year fiscal program be announce soon brazilian authorities, which will include new policy initiatives. The statement reiterate Brazil's goal achieve primary budget surplus 2.6 percent its gross domestic product 1999, 2.8 percent 2000 and 3.0 percent 2001 which would fulfill government target stabilize ratio net consolidate public sector debt GDP year 2000. The two sides be continue their talks objective reach early agreement, statement said. There's no such thing free lunch any long Brazil, President Fernando Henrique Cardoso be tell government workers. No haircuts or phone calls, either. Eager bolster sag economy, Cardoso want slash dlrs 19 billion (23.5 billion reals) budget deficit, and he's begin par perks more 2,000 workers presidential palace Brasilia, capital. Sure, it's not much when compare deficit some dlrs 65 billion, or 7 percent economic output. But Cardoso ready package spending cuts and tax increases, he clearly want show Brazilians that economy start home. so goodbye afternoon courtesy snack sandwiches, fruit and juice, palace tradition. Three barber shops palace be closed, and use cellular phones and copiers be restricted. The price buffet offer employees lunch be raise dlrs 6 dlrs 8.50 (7 reals 10 reals). Cardoso himself have promise travel less and more cheaply. On trip summit Portugal this month, he take delegation just eight, half usual number. The savings palace could come nearly dlrs 145,000 (170,000 reals) month, say Nilson Rebello, chief administrator president's office. Cardoso, pressure repair economy batter world financial turmoil, be expect unveil full scope his deficit-cutting plan next week. It be believe include spate new taxes fuel, income, personal fortunes and bank transactions. The plan be part deal International Monetary Fund rescue package estimate dlrs 30 billion. The money would strengthen and, hopefully, restore investor confidence world's ninth-largest economy, now center financial crisis buffet develop nations more year. Brazil already have agree annual targets sharply reduce its deficit year 2001. On Wednesday, newspapers publish joint statement Brazil and IMF, although final agreement hasn't be reach yet. Despite Cardoso's efforts, many Brazilians be less impressed palace penny-pinching. The leftist Workers Party say government be make big deal insignificant savings while it fail cut other dubious projects, such dlrs 800,000 (1 million reals) moat be build Congress keep protesters easily enter building. The Globo tv network also suggest there still be plenty fat cut, cite government expenses run shoes, persian carpets and gold cufflinks, intend presents visit dignitaries. Cardoso be count help friendly state governors control spending. But governors, some face runoff elections Sunday, be promise pay raises and public work projects that could sink austerity plan. In Brasilia, Joaquim Roriz have promise civil service raises, bonuses and new jobs that his opponent estimates would cost some dlrs 1 billion (1.2 billion reals). Roriz hasn't explain where money would come from. In powerful Minas Gerais state, government will almost certainly have lay workers state payroll consume 78 percent budget. To rein free-spending habits provincial politicians, Cardoso reportedly want hold local governments bimonthly limits spending. Federal money would automatically be cut if spending get out hand. latin american leaders fly Friday Portugal weekend summit figure out how they can shield their economies global financial crisis. not early 1980s have so many countries be recession, and crisis now threaten cripple Latin America's develop economies. An early arrival, Cuban President Fidel Castro, describe turmoil world financial markets most important issue face world moment. I don't know if we be come end world economic order. It will be interesting know, Cuban leader say hotel press conference shortly his arrival annual ibero-american summit. Emphasizing scale threat, Castro say President Clinton be aware that if South America fall crisis, it will be extend inevitably also United States, which be heavily involve investments and loans region. Jittery investors have abruptly pull cash out Latin America devastate effects stock markets and currency reserves. The heads state and government Latin America, Spain and Portugal will explore measures ward financial turmoil that already have devastate Asia and Russia. Stock markets also fell Portugal and Spain, heavy investors Latin america. The latin american leaders must gauge need unpopular reforms their public finances, include austerity packages which risk social unrest and political upheaval. A joint declaration will be sign Sunday this ancient port city Douro River northern Portugal. Diplomats say there be consensus form final statement. The declaration call international community, and Group Seven countries particular, take necessary measures promote stability international financial markets, which be necessary condition sustain economic growth, say Luis Augusto Castro Neves, Brazilian Foreign Ministry. Latin America's leaders favor create some kind regulatory system global financial transactions that would place controls speculators, measures slow internatioal flow money. They also want reforms that allow international financial institutions head crises rather react them rescue packages. International institutions must be active tackling crises recent one ... and contribute stability, Portuguese Foreign Minister Jaime Gama said. Countries that have progressive policies should not be penalized, they should be give incentives, Gama add reference latin american nations' efforts modernize their economies. Brazil, continent's large economy and potential bulwark creep recession, be wait news dlrs 30 billion bailout package International Monetary Fund. The presidents World Bank and InterAmerican Development Bank also be expect talks. The move U.S. Federal Reserve cut interest rates Thursday revive Latin America's financial markets, analysts expect reprieve be short-lived because deep concerns continent's economic health. The recent economic troubles stem part structural weaknesses latin american economies. A strike be wag state employees Colombia government austerity package offer glimpse trouble that could arise if tough reforms be introduced. Brazil be draft austerity package that will hit public spending, especially social security. brazilian officials end four days meetings representatives International Monetary Fund Tuesday live their public pledge announce concrete measures reduce government deficits. In Washington, Pedro Parente, executive secretary brazilian Finance Ministry, offer only details Brazil's plan raise primary account surplus next three years. With only five days go gubernatorial runoffs Sunday, neither he nor President Fernando Henrique Cardoso, Brasilia, say how government plan achieve savings. Important allies Cardoso be lag three key states, and government promises, market analysts not expect announcement elections. Instead, strategy Brasilia and Washington appear focus reassure markets that work cut deficit be go forward, provide fodder opponents domestic elections. The discussions continue objective reaching agreement soon detail program, say joint statement IMF and brazilian Finance Ministry. Because Brazil's enormous deficits, collapse emerge markets have hit nation particularly hard, drain foreign currency reserves and push economy recession. Finance officials Washington and world fear that collapse Brazil, because its size and link other economies, would worsen financial instability throughout hemisphere. With 160 million people, Brazil represent world's ninth-largest economy and be financial engine Latin America. Throughout day, government officials meet Cardoso Brasilia and be expect fine-tune three-year austerity package that Cardoso be discuss congressional party leaders Wednesday morning. In Brasilia, officials say that measures be consider be tax increase financial transactions, three-tenths percent two-tenths percent, and extend Fiscal Stabilization Fund, which set aside 20 percent all taxes collect presidential discretionary spending. The fund be have expire 1999. speak Washington, Parente say that Brazil would aim surplus 2.6 percent 1999, 2.8 percent 2000 and 3 percent 2001. It have already be announced, end IMF's annual meeting Washington two weeks ago that Brazil would have reach primary account surplus 2.5 percent 3 percent qualify IMF aid. The primary account cover government expenses, interest payments debt. Ernest Brown, senior economist Latin America Morgan Stanley Dean Witter, say signs that brazilian government and IMF be move closer aid package be reassuring, and that he not expect much more reassurance next week. I call this `we have pope' scenario, Brown said. You're just go hear that we have pope, maybe see white smoke rising, he said, and not figure out who pope be elections. The United States be prepare commit U.S. taxpayer funds part lend program least $30 billion try insulate Brazil, and it rest latin America, bad effects financial turmoil circle globe, accord U.S. and foreign officials assemble program. Details U.S. contribution, which be expect total several billion dollars direct aid or loan guarantees, have be negotiated. But several congressional leaders have be alert likelihood that administration would have act while Congress be recess. This early warning administration reflect memories how Congress erupt objections and hearings 1995 when President Clinton commit $20 billion U.S. funds bailout Mexico. But administration officials say last week that their early soundings indicate that members Congress be deeply concerned prevent economic collapse Latin America that would resound United States, and thus they expect few objections. The timing aid package Brazil originally expect next few days be complicate unexpected delays that have crop deal brazilian government. The government President Fernando Henrique Cardoso face politically risky gubernatorial elections Sunday, which may well determine whether Brazil can execute austerity program that be key condition loans it be concurrently negotiate International Monetary Fund. The big role rescue program Brazil will be take International Monetary Fund, which say last week that it would contribute least $15 billion and appear be pressure United States do more. Another $9 billion or so will come World Bank and Inter-American Development Bank, and remainder United States and other major industrial nations. Germany and Japan, though, have be reluctant take part, one U.S. official noted, suggest that Latin America be chiefly Washington's problem, not their own. so far, U.S. officials work scenes organize aid package have say nothing public details plans direct contribution Brazil. Brazil be very important economic well-being region, United States and international community, and all us be very much focus see how we can be helpful, Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin say Friday. But wide-ranging interview global economic turmoil, Rubin decline say what strategy he would pursue deal Brazil's problems and insist that no decisions have be make how United States might contribute. But he discuss Brazil opportunity engage kind preventive financial diplomacy that President Clinton advocate speeches IMF and World Bank here three weeks ago. At time, Clinton argue that monetary fund should provide contingent finance help countries ward global financial contagion rather wait disaster strike. Direct U.S. aid Brazil would clearly send symbolic message: that year try manage financial crisis monetary fund, United States be now ready put limited amount its capital risk prevent far havoc not only Brazil stop chaos spread Argentina, Mexico and other countries that be major U.S. trading partners. That would be change strategy. so far, United States have operate almost entirely international financial institutions, chiefly IMF But it would also be risky move President Clinton, economically and politically. even though Congress object $20 billion U.S. funds commit bailout Mexico, it turn out that only $12 billion be ultimately needed, and it have be pay back, interest. But Rubin note Friday that it's very different environment now. other administration officials say they believe that there would be few objections Congress direct U.S. participation Brazil bailout. I think there be lot more people Congress who be now scar death what's be happen markets, and what could happen their districts, White House official say last week, and they won't say much long they don't have vote it. By act soon stabilize Latin America, administration be hop capitalize two weeks relative calm late-summer panic that engulf Russia and, its height, lead outflow billion dollars day Brazil, fear that it would be next country force devalue its currency. Whether this calm marks begin turnaround or just another pause wildfires that have erupt Thailand's currency crisis July 1997 be matter considerable debate. But many experts cite confluence several events that have reassure jittery investors world: two successive interest-rate cuts United States, Japan's long-delayed move prop its banking system $500 billion taxpayer funds, and steady strengthen currencies Thailand, Indonesia and South Korea, first signs that investors may be prepare return. Always circumspect when it come comment publicly markets, Rubin acknowledge that last several weeks there have be number significant, positive developments. But former trader, burn 26-year career many false market rallies, warn that serious issues remain and that it will take some time world work its way out what he have repeatedly call most serious international financial disruption last 50 years. In fact, Rubin's aides be clearly nervous possibility another outbreak that could set new panic, which have make it virtually impossible many emerging-market countries borrow money world markets. Brazil and Japan be two obvious tinderboxes, say Jeffrey Garten, dean Yale School Management, who serve undersecretary commerce international affairs Clinton's first term. In Brazil, issue be whether package that be come together will really be big enough deal explode debt problem. And Japan question be whether there be real reform that go money. But spend 18 months negotiations Japanese, Rubin clearly sense that United States have little leverage Tokyo; its problems be chiefly rooted political gridlock, not lack resources. In Brazil, though, United States have good chance buying time and influence economic reform program, long it do not appear be dictate terms publicly Cardoso and his team. But demonstrate economic support will probably require tap Exchange Stabilization Fund, create Roosevelt administration help stabilize dollar. The money be Rubin's control, presidential approval, and he reach it circumvent congressional objections aid Mexico 1995. But reaction be so strong time Congress restrict tap fund international bailouts that Rubin have be extraordinarily cautious ever since. He commit $3 billion second line defense emergency aid programs Indonesia and South Korea last year, no money be ultimately dispersed either country. U.S. officials say that South Korea not need extra help, and that collapse Suharto government Indonesia so change political scene there that it would be too risky offer direct U.S. aid. In bailout Russia whose economy collapse President Boris Yeltsin abandon agreement reform economy and dismiss leading reformers United States offer no direct help. Those events set panic exit investors all emerge markets, and greatly worsen Brazil's troubles. so far, brazilian officials have successfully calm market constantly talk forthcoming aid program IMF, convincing speculators that it would be dangerous bet country. But same time, brazilian officials have maintain pose that they do not really need cash and be certainly no hurry get it. U.S. officials and top officials IMF be clearly nervous, worry that long negotiations drag on, great will be risk Brazil be catch another market turmoil. The Brazilians want everyone think that it's all control, say investment banker involve talks. But fact be that there's still real risk that sometime next 18 months government be go be force devalue its currency, which be peg dollar, adjusts 7.5 percent year carefully control fall. To prevent sudden devaluation, brazilian government have have raise interest rates more 50 percent, choke credit most companies. Meanwhile, country be slip recession. The aid would buy time Brazilians, it be contingent Cardoso's success persuade legislature end huge deficits, chiefly unpopular cuts social spending. The first deputy manage director International Monetary Fund, Stanley Fischer, spend Friday Brazil review country's austerity plan, which be expect be announce Sunday's elections international package, avoid appearance that global lender be dictate conditions Brazil. Brazil have do lot, Fischer say last week leave his trip. In return, I expect international community will make large contribution. Leaders 19 latin american nations, Spain and Portugal put finish touches Saturday ibero-american summit declaration warn global recession unless action be take stabilize international financial system. The draft declaration say recent financial market turmoil show that adjustments must be make quickly keep difficulties affect few become crisis all. The declaration address world's seven rich nations. The Group Seven be compose United States, Japan, Britain, Germany, France, Italy and Canada. The final declaration will be approve Sunday's summit this port city northern Portugal. Brazilian President Fernando Henrique Cardoso say Saturday that Brazil and China, two world's large economies, have become dikes resistance global recession. protect their economies spread economic turmoil, which be affect more countries any time early 1980s, be key world economic stability, he said. Brazil be Latin America's big economy and eighth-largest world, and its economic collapse could take rest continent it. To halt Brazil's slide recession, Cardoso be prepare austerity measures include spending cuts, tax hikes and low interest rates. The reforms would help Brazil qualify International Monetary Fund rescue package estimate dlrs 30 billion. The IMF have put together bailout packages total dlrs 137 billion financial crisis strike Thailand 15 months ago and then spread Asia Russia. U.S. President Bill Clinton's administration, aware impact that latin american recession would have United States, have actively push IMF and World Bank support Brazil it be hit investor flight. There's no such thing free lunch any long Brazil, President Fernando Henrique Cardoso be tell government workers. No haircuts or phone calls, either. Eager bolster sag economy, Cardoso want slash dlrs 19 billion budget deficit, and he's begin par perks more 2,000 workers presidential palace Brasilia, capital. Sure, it's not much when compare deficit some dlrs 65 billion, or 7 percent economic output. But Cardoso ready package spending cuts and tax increases, he clearly want show Brazilians that economy start home. so goodbye afternoon courtesy snack sandwiches, fruit and juice, palace tradition.

Cardoso himself have promise travel less and more cheaply. On trip summit Portugal this month, he take delegation just eight, half usual number. The savings palace could come nearly dlrs 145,000 month, say Nilson Rebello, chief administrator president's office. Cardoso, pressure repair economy batter world financial turmoil, be expect unveil full scope his deficit-cutting plan next week. It be believe include spate new taxes fuel, income, personal fortunes and bank transactions. The plan be part deal International Monetary Fund rescue package estimate dlrs 30 billion. The money would strengthen and, hopefully, restore investor confidence world's ninth-largest economy, now center financial crisis buffet develop nations more year. Brazil already have agree annual targets sharply reduce its deficit year 2001. On Wednesday, newspapers publish joint statement Brazil and IMF, although final agreement hasn't be reach yet. Despite Cardoso's efforts, many Brazilians be less impressed palace penny-pinching. The leftist Workers Party say government be make big deal insignificant savings while it fail cut other dubious projects, such dlrs 800,000 moat be build Congress keep protesters easily enter building. The Globo tv network also suggest there still be plenty fat cut, cite government expenses run shoes, persian carpets and gold cufflinks, intend presents visit dignitaries. Cardoso be count help friendly state governors control spending. But governors, some face runoff elections Sunday, be promise pay raises and public work projects that could sink austerity plan. In Brasilia, Joaquim Roriz have promise civil service raises, bonuses and new jobs that his opponent estimates would cost some dlrs 1 billion. Roriz hasn't explain where money would come from. In powerful Minas Gerais state, government will almost certainly have lay workers state payroll consume 78 percent budget.

The Commerce Department Tuesday provide concrete measure effects global economic downturn american economy, reporting that nation's trade deficit widen $2.2 billion August $16.77 billion. That be wide gap government recalculate way it measure trade flow 1992. It result decline american exports and sharp increase what this country buy abroad. so far this year, trade deficit be run roughly 50 percent last year's levels and be project $170 billion year, gap that be expect widen further. One senior administration official who deal economic issues, speak condition anonymity, say Tuesday that internal projections suggest that trade deficit 1999 could reach $300 billion, figure that he say will certainly cut growth, and could well become major political problem. Trade deficits carry them good and troubling signals economy. The current flood imports be help contain inflation some low levels decades. And while sales American aircraft, computer chips and other goods be suffering, weaken dollar world markets recent weeks may provide end-of-the-year boost american exporters. But this moment global upheaval, big problem face american companies be inability many nations and some large companies Asia and Latin America simply borrow money make ordinary purchases. The result be such freeze economic activity that empty ship containers be stack American piers. And effects be hurt everyone Midwest farmers who can no longer send wheat impoverish Russia, East Coast fishermen who be discover that Japan's appetite salmon and lobster have be ruin bank crisis. Among most surprising elements Tuesday's report be that more third August's deficit be one country that so far have manage ward bad effects global troubles: China. Despite continued growth Chinese economy, exports China have slow dramatically and import Chinese-made goods have exploded, country desperately seek sell here goods that would ordinarily be sell elsewhere Asia. That increase monthly deficit Beijing $5.9 billion, levels previously only see trade Japan. The Chinese besiege floods, deeply troubled state-owned industries and incipient banking crisis have signal United States recent weeks that they have little interest any swift moves open their markets far return entry World Trade Organization. That amount major setback President Clinton, who three years have be use negotiations China's entry world body centerpiece his effort open China economically and politically. ostensible progress this area have be cite administration recently one successes administration's China policy, now officials say privately that progress be evaporating. The decline exports will trim growth american economy, and it be one factor Federal Reserve's decision low interest rates two times recent weeks. So administration officials be go out their way Tuesday portray numbers another warn sign, not crisis. While United States remain strong and sound, troubled condition global marketplace continue strongly influence U.S. trade balance, Commerce Secretary Williams Daley say statement Tuesday. After China, big deterioration american trade balance August come Mexico, where peso have weaken markedly economic contagion have spread Latin America. Exports Mexico have remain unchanged. But imports Mexico have increase markedly chiefly automobiles and automotive parts and telecommunications equipment american manufacturers have take advantage weaken currency. In contrast, America's trade surplus Brazil, late focus concern administration and International Monetary Fund, barely budge same period year ago. Normally, that would be cite sign continue demand american products latin America's large economy, there be fear it might be imperiled. The news come United States and IMF complete bailout package $30 billion or more Brazil, intend help it stave kind economic troubles that have sweep Asia, Russia and several other nations. Tuesday IMF and Brazil reach agreement country's fiscal targets this year and next, sign that aid will likely be announce elections Brazil this weekend. But all these potential problems, rise trade deficit have barely cause ripple Capitol Hill. Because rise level imports do not appear be trigger any unemployment here, subject have barely come races House and Senate country. The only exception have be regions where steel industry be strong. The major steel companies have charge recent weeks that asian nations be dump products american market prices well their costs. The Commerce Department have begin inquiry. The Commerce Department's numbers show that deficit rise 15.3 percent $16.77 billion August, revise figure $14.55 billion July.

The north korean representative United Nations, Kim Chang Guk, say last week that United States could inspect site condition that when it be confirm not be nuclear facility, United States should pay compensation slander and defame my country. U.S. intelligence agencies fear that build complex, North Korea may have decide abandon four-year-old agreement United States which North Korea pledge give its nuclear weapons program exchange billions dollars aid.

We've expect that this would be difficult, and we tell North Koreans, we've say before, that verbal assurances, they be wont give, be simply unacceptable. U.S. officials have say construction underground site may not have technically violate accord, because there be no evidence that North Korea have begin pour cement new reactor or reprocessing plant convert nuclear waste bomb-grade plutonium. But if United States determine that North Korea have revive its nuclear program, Rubin said, it would go entire letter and spirit objectives agreement, and it would affect viability agreement. The administration have express grow concern North Korea's intentions several provocative acts, include underground construction Yongbyon and test firing last August missile Japan. last week Clinton name former Defense Secretary William Perry review U.S. policy North Korea. Administration officials say Perry be be ask study ways salvage 1994 nuclear agreement North Korea, which have be administration's proud achievements foreign policy. north korean news media Thursday say communist nation's military be full alert war United States if dispute nuclear inspections come blows. The North's official korean Central News Agency report that north korean soldiers and people all walks life be full alert war. North Korea typically send out belligerent rhetoric, especially when it enter high-stake talks washington. The United States and North Korea be set resume talks Friday inspections underground north korean site suspect be use produce nuclear weapons. KCNA broadcast brim anti-american saber-rattling.

A congressman who visit remote parts North Korea last week say Saturday that food and health situation there be desperate and deteriorating, and that millions North Koreans might have starve death last few years. The congressman, Tony Hall, D-Ohio, who have have longtime interest world hunger, pass Tokyo his return United States and show photograph he have take north korean children patchy hair, protrude bones, open sores and other signs severe malnutrition. Hall also bring back bag what officials call substitute food be distributed government food station: dry leaves and straw, so coarse that cattle would normally turn away. They grind it powder and make it noodles, Hall said. The noodles have no nutrition and be indigestible, leave people hold their aching stomachs, he said. North Korea have admit that it be face serious economic difficulties, there have be sharply diverge assessments how serious these are. Some visitors United Nations and other organizations have say that food situation seem be bite better now year or two ago. Hall say that divergence might have arise because north korean capital, Pyongyang, life seem be slightly better his three previous trips North Korea. But rural areas where foreigners be not allow visit, he added, overall situation be bad ever. base visits four hospitals, Hall also emphasize that public health care have decline sharply. In one hospital, assistants be hold patient while surgeons conduct stomach operation electric lights or anesthesia. Ordinary North Koreans be suffering, part, because their government's hard-line policies have alienate would-be donors and aid agencies. The United Nations have repeatedly appeal relief aid North Korea, late appeal have raise less one-third target. In September, Doctors Without Borders announce that it be pull its staff 13 North Korea because it fear that its aid be go politically connect rather most needy.

Hall say he think that overall least 1 million people have die and that total be probably closer 3 million. In indication seriousness which professional demographers view situation, U.S. Bureau Census recently publish estimates suggest that North Korea's population peak 1995 21.55 million and have fall 21.23 million this year. That would be decline 320,000 three years, period when North Korea's population would have be expect grow 925,000 people, base population growth rate early 1990s. Nicholas Eberstadt, American specialist north korean population figures, say that there simply be not enough hard information him estimate death toll famine. But he note one political tidbit: North Korea's constitution stipulate that there should be one delegate country's people's assembly every 30,000 citizens. This year's assembly not expand previous ones did, rather have just 687 delegates, same previous assembly hold 1990. While Eberstadt counsels caution, that could mean that North Korea's population, eight years which it have be expect add several million people, be now back 20.6 million people or fewer. The United States have be supply grain North Korea, strains be grow secret underground complex North that some experts worry may be heart new nuclear weapons program. The United States warn last week that agree framework that be basis its relations North Korea will be jeopardy unless north lets american experts visit underground complex and resolve their doubts. North Korea have say that it will show complex only if Washington promise that if complex be not nuclear one, it will pay vilify us and impair our prestige. Washington refuse pay, and North Korea be warn that standoff could lead agreement fall apart. Their shameless and wicked demand be open infringement our sovereignty and wanton interference our internal affairs, declare North Korea's lead newspaper, Rodong Sinmun. A South Korean lawmaker say Friday communist North Korea could be produce plutonium and could have more secret underground nuclear facilities already feared. Without name his source, Rep. Kim Deog-ryong Parliament's Foreign Affairs Committee say he have information that two underground facilities capture U.S. spy satellite photos may be nuclear plants. He say Parliament session that one them be believe already be produce plutonium and other would be able produce enough 10 nuclear bombs start 2004. If true, assertion paints worse picture suspect north korean nuclear activity already make public. Kim say he ask government's Unification Ministry issue earlier this week and be suspicious its answer. It be not sufficient or sincere, so I come suspect that government be try hide truth, Kim say seven-page press release. U.S. and south korean officials say August they have detect huge underground construction site mountainside 40 kilometers (25 miles) northeast Yongbyon, country's main nuclear complex. The United States have say it suspect construction be nuclear-related, though it have no evidence. North Korea have deny it. Kim, lawmaker main opposition Grand National Party, say there may actually be two underground facilities not far yongbyon complex. It be activity Yongbyon that prompt United States negotiate 1994 accord promise development two light-water reactors and fuel-oil shipments if North Korea would halt nuclear weapons development. At time, North Korea be believe have make enough plutonium one or two atomic bombs. The Yongbyon complex, which houses 500-megawatt laboratory nuclear reactor, have be frozen 1994 accord. Kim say Friday that one new facility be already operate and other be construction and will be operational four six years. We estimate that reactor will go on-line 2002 or 2003, enable production enough plutonium build one nuclear weapon six 12 months, Kim said. North Korea would be able make sufficient plutonium make eight 10 nuclear weapons every year that. North Korea have say underground construction be civilian use and not nuclear-related. It have offer open facility U.S. inspectors, say Washington must pay compensation if facility be be proven be civilian use.

So we be not expect walk one day and be able have access next. The trip be announce signs grow relative warming relations United States and North Korea. Representatives United States, China and two Koreas meet recently Geneva and agree steps reduce tension Korean Peninsula. In September United States pledge provide additional 300,000 tons grain North Korea, which have years be cripple severe food shortages. In addition White House disclose that United States would provide more heavy fuel oil promise North Korea 1994 agreement, concerns that North Korea may intend revive its nuclear program. american officials have say activity Yongbyon may not have technically violate accord, because there be no evidence that North Korea have begin pour cement new reactor or reprocessing plant convert nuclear waste bomb-grade plutonium. This city have always keep unwritten list foreign leaders dictators, unfriendly authoritarians and consistently annoy allies who it think can make enormous contribution peace, security or America's agenda take early retirement, minimum. In 1950s, leftist leaders Iran and Guatamala make Top 10, '60s it be populate Diem and Sukarno and other Southeast Asians. President Richard M. Nixon and his advisers infamously agree secret meeting '70s that best way deal government Salvador Allende Gossens Chile be make economy scream. Diplomatic etiquette, though, have discourage shout America's enemies list White House rooftop. After all, foreign policy isn't personalities, right? But last week, driven frustration, or anxiety, or perhaps lure sound tough cameras, Clinton administration pip up, twice. In very different situations, corners world, United States speak loudly because it can't find stick. Sunday, hours he call attack Iraq, Clinton finally volunteer obvious, that focus U.S. policy Iraq be removal President Saddam Hussein what Clinton call support forces change Iraq. No matter that covert efforts do just that have fail miserably. The big surprise come Monday, when polite-to-a-fault Al Gore use his visit Malaysia Asian economic summit meeting throw U.S. support protesters call reformasi, code word streets Kuala Lumpur dump Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamed. He have long be burr Washington's side, denounce America, its currency traders and its Jews. He recently imprison his western-thinking finance minister, Anwar Ibrahim, who have suddenly become Asia's most visible jailed dissident. But Mahathir be no Saddam, not long shot. Gore's aides insist that his speech be call reform, not demand that Mahathir step down. But it wasn't interpret that way. The New Zealanders call it megaphone diplomacy. The malaysian government call it disgust and interference internal affairs. Predictably, executives several U.S. companies that have flock Kuala Lumpur tell Malaysians that Gore be rude, while assure Washington that he have utter words that need be said. Whatever wisdom Gore's words, they raise question what it take these days world's most powerful nation begin publicly suggest that it's time nettlesome leader go. Because there be no official list, there be no real criteria get it. Some leaders mysteriously escape mention, Kim Jong Il North Korea. President Clinton be spend weekend Korean Peninsula, star demilitarize zone dangerous state that everyone suspect be attempt break out its 1994 agreement freeze its nuclear weapons projects, return billions Western energy aid. Yet Washington have never call starve North Koreans revolt Kim's repressive regime. His government, take page out Saddam playbook, suggest last week that if United States really want look mountain tunnel that Pentagon believe be nuclear installation making, it should write check another $300 million. No one call Kim's removal when, few months ago, he lob three-stage missile Japan just show he know how. The rules call end regime be pretty murky, say Richard Feinberg, professor University California San Diego who serve Clinton administration's first term. When they really want push someone out, it be because that country be part large strategic concern time. But country itself doesn't have great strategic weight it's another matter call change leadership Beijing or Moscow and it help if there be some kind domestic opposition that we can point to. Clinton's call Saddam's ouster last weekend create barely ripple because, all, he be proven murderer and avid stockpiler anthrax and plutonium (even if Brent Scowcroft, who be President George Bush's national security adviser, insist last week that Saddam nowadays be simply irritant, annoyance, pest and problem, not threat region moment). Mahathir, however, be far more complex case. He's prime example how opposing Washington's political and economic agenda interconnect world can move leader list authoritarians whom Washington tolerate list authoritarians who have outlive their usefulness. Like other asian strongmen Ferdinand Marcos Philippines and Suharto Indonesia come mind he be useful when fear be that Malaysia would become communist domino. But he also seem eminently tolerable long Cold War be over. He have never be accuse enormous corruption. He turn his country model competitiveness, and Malaysia become exemplar big emerge markets that Clinton's Commerce Department tout things go sour last year. Sure, he be always prickly. But he be no terrorist or killer U.S. companies have flock his country, and say they want stay and his iron control political discourse be no strong neighboring Singapore. Just this summer, U.S. Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin pay him ostensibly friendly, if strained, visit and make no reference human rights. That all change when Ibrahim be arrest and beat jail. He have long be advocate western-style solutions economic turmoil more openness, more freedom and protest movement Mahathir only surface once he be jail. Gore leapt that opportunity particularly striking because, case Indonesia earlier this year, it take administration months come conclusion that President Suharto have go. He went.

50,"It be surprise scene three months ago when Dennis Rivera, one New York City's most left-leaning labor leaders, be sing praises Sen. Alfonse M. D'Amato. Rivera, president large union New York City, praise D'Amato persuade Trent Lott, Senate majority leader, support legislation that finance health coverage hundreds thousands uninsured children. It look if Rivera's politically potent union might endorse D'Amato or very minimum stay neutral this year's U.S. Senate race New York. But Monday, Rivera's 150,000-member union, 1199, National Health and Human Service Employees union, endorse Rep. Charles E. Schumer, D-N.Y., and thereby risk D'Amato's wrath. The endorsement be risky, labor leaders acknowledge, because anger this powerful senator could make him far less responsive labor's needs when unions turn him help future if he be re-elected. Although it may seem illogical, two words go far explain why Rivera's union back Schumer: Monica Lewinsky. Largely result Lewinsky scandal, Democrats say they suddenly fear that Republicans will gain filibuster-proof, 60-seat majority Senate, where Republicans have 55 seats democrats' 45. For labor leaders Rivera, notion strong Republican majority be nightmare. That fear have help push other New York unions Schumer's column, though D'Amato have long court them. Those unions include teamsters' joint council New York City and District Council 37, umbrella group represent 120,000 municipal employees. labor leaders say they fear that filibuster-proof Republican majority, Senate would push anti-union legislation, recently defeat republican proposals curb labor's political spending and cut financing National Labor Relations Board. We be worried legislation that will not allow labor movement survive next century, Rivera said. Alarmed that Democrats will lose Senate seats California, Illinois, Wisconsin, Nevada and South Carolina, Rivera's union conclude that it be worth back Schumer. The decision, Rivera emphasize repeatedly, be not personal be base national considerations. Unfortunately, leadership Republican Party national level person Newt Gingrich and Trent Lott be not necessarily same culture Republicans Northeast, he said. They're far more conservative, far more anti-labor, far more anti-worker, far more pro-business. We fear that Democratic Party face irrelevance United States Senate if we go 41 seats. Trying avoid rupture D'Amato, Rivera praise him effective senator. The endorsement could be boon Schumer. Rivera's union and teachers' union have labor's strong political operations New York. In addition, Schumer will get thousands dollars local well use its renowned phone banks, which can make 50,000 political calls day. A spokesman D'Amato said, Al D'Amato's proud that he's be endorse 100 union federations and locals, represent more that 400,000 work men and women, and he'll continue his efforts behalf work middle class families. His labor endorsements include New York City Patrolmen's Benevolent Association and New York State Building and Construction Trades Council. Besides back 1199, Schumer also receive endorsement 1199's parent union, Service Employees International Union, which have 350,000 members New York State. Rivera who not support D'Amato last time he run either announced endorsements found convention New York State Council service employees union. The convention pack Town Hall, and new group aims make service employees power be reckon bring together dozen union locals forge common political and legislative strategy. Earlier this year, 1199 merge service employees, and part that agreement, Rivera become head service employees New York State. nearly 60 years times, House vote Friday condemn nazi-soviet nonaggression pact 1939. The measure, nonbinding resolution, be bring floor Rep. John Shimkus, R-Ill. He be lithuanian descent, have pocket Lithuanians his hometown Collinsville and want try highlight his support Baltic states' efforts soviet repression. Shimkus' measure be example how members Congress be spend their time they stand idle and wait Republican leaders reach agreement spending bills White House, thus avoid government shutdown and allow them go home and campaign November elections. With time their hands, many Republicans be use House floor their personal stage elicit vote topics that they can boast folks back home. most these matters have little chance find their way law, members hope turn them their advantage Election Day. There be plenty other items whose sponsors hope will not attract attention. These tend be special-interest matters that members hope will escape scrutiny rush leave town. The sponsors these measures now have add advantage impeachment inquiry, which have be preoccupy Congress, news media and public and give them cover move their pet cause quietly gigantic omnibus package that Congress will eventually present Clinton signing. These quiet measures include one propose Mississippi's two senators, Trent Lott and Thad Cochran, Republicans. They want agriculture export credits buy chickens Russia, which have buy chickens cannot pay them. The chickens be Mississippi. Democrats have little influence republican-controlled Congress. But some Democrats be close enough Republican leaders, and Republican goals, that their measures be take seriously. These include Rep. John Murtha, D-Pa., rank Democrat national security subcommittee Appropriations Committee, who be push measure increase military pensions. perhaps best example attempt force vote political advantage be measure that would require minors notify their parents if they be seek contraceptives federally fund family plan clinics. House leaders allow measure be bring floor way appease more conservative members, who believe they have be shortchanged budget process. It pass House vote 224-200 have almost no chance become law. The Senate do not plan take it up, and Clinton would almost certainly veto it. But Rep. Tom Coburn, R-Okla., say that vote these be important because they put their sponsors' ideological foes record oppose something that sound reasonable, and that opposition can be use them Nov. 3 election. It be not voice mail message that Dr. Marilyn Rymer, neurologist Kansas City, Mo., would routinely delete, registered Democrat. Speaker Newt Gingrich's office, it said, be call discuss national leadership award. Dr. Rymer have win acclaim director prominent stroke-treatment center, this proposition seem particularly grand. When she return call, she say she be tell she would also be name honorary chairman elite committee advise Gingrich legislation. Too good be true? Well, Dr. Rymer would have pay her way if committee should actually meet, and honorary committee chairman, she discovered, she would be member committee compose entirely honorary chairmen. And oh, speaker want donation $500 $1,000 help our efforts, accord transcript similar chat another doctor, elect big republican majority House Representatives. With approach midterm elections next month, it turn out that National Republican Congressional Committee, which support candidates House, have be sponsor similar calls tens thousands small-business owners, include doctors. With this and other fund-raising programs, committee say it have amass $62 million elections. But campaign finance watchdogs say solicitations mark new departure political fund raising, one they call akin practices market companies Publishers' Clearing House that hook consumers visions million-dollar windfalls induce them subscribe magazines. By cite speaker and promising celebrity and influence, they say, calls be bait-and-switch scheme seize attention people who might otherwise hang up. Dr. Rymer say she be incensed. So be Dr. Stanley Turecki, child and family psychiatrist New York who vote independent and be also called. I be absolutely outraged, he said. anybody else who would do that would fall category consumer fraud. Kenneth Gross, Washington lawyer who specialize election law and represent democratic and republican clients, said, I have never hear that particular device. But it doesn't appear illegal, he said, adding, It's fund-raising gimmick get attention. Fred Wertheimer, president Democracy 21, nonprofit, nonpartisan advocate campaign finance reform, said, This be new version caveat emptor buyer be damn instead buyer beware. When businesses do it, he added, Congress orders investigations. But this isn't go be investigate because it's members Congress who be do it. Todd Harris, spokesman National Republican Congressional Committee, say that he have not hear any complaints and that there be no intent deceive. The national leadership award be part what we call donor and member fulfillment, Harris said. It's part bring them process. It's important that they be recognize support they give party. There's no quid pro quo that people solicit could receive awards contributions, he added. What most peeves Drs. Rymer and Turecki be message left secretaries and answer machines invoke Gingrich's office and propose award. They say they envision senior aide telephone speaker's chambers Capitol Dome. The calls, however, be not place aides Gingrich, any his offices or anyone Washington. They be make people headsets and computers home InfoCision Management Corp., telemarketing firm and Congressional committee client Akron, Ohio. On its Web page, InfoCision say its 1,400 employees operate 1,584 telephone lines and 9 phone centers. Every word script be approve our clients, company say its Web site. Every conceivable objection be script powerful rebuttal. Besides telemarketing businesses, say Jamie Blair, supervisor center, we specialize help Republican Party and conservative political groups. however far they be gingrich, telemarketers be instructed answer return call with: Republican Congressional Committee, Newt Gingrich's office. May I help you? A doctor Kansas City, Mo., who be register Republican and who decline be named, dial Gingrich number (888-484-1644) left answer machines and secretly record ensue discussion, which be legal Missouri. We be ask contact you behalf speaker, say woman who pick call and identify herself Nancy. He be right now aggressively push legislation cut taxes much half, and he's also interested legislation cut capital gains single rate 15 percent. To assure passage legislation, speaker want increase his republican majority, she says, adding, To help us do that, speaker be pull together group individuals such yourself and be invite you be honorary chairman his advisory council. Nancy continues: There will be correspondence speaker, such conference calls. It's great way that he can get your input and thoughts legislation that do concern you. Or maybe surveys or questionnaires. Later, Nancy says: As member his committee, you would be receive speaker our national leadership award, which be really quite honor. And be honest, he will be ask each our chairmen if they could help our efforts increase our majority one-time contribution $500 or $1,000. now that would be use nationwide media campaign that Newt have undertake target those seats we really need. And someone who i'm sure would also benefit this, could I tell speaker he could count your help? The doctor demurs. I be registered, you know, republican Kansas, she tell Nancy. Probably if I be do something it would be go my representative. then doctor tries ascertain where Nancy be located. be this congressman Gingrich's office that I'm talk to? doctor asks. The speaker's office, say Nancy. This be speaker's office. That I'm talk to, say doctor, double-checking. uh-huh, Nancy replies. The law prohibit political fund-raising call federal offices. Vice President Al Gore be Justice Department investigation fund-raising call he allegedly make his office 1996 presidential campaign. But calls can be make just anywhere else, include campaign offices. Harris say calls be no way relate speaker's OFFICIAL office. He added: What be more important be not where call get routed. People be more interested award speaker's good name it whether call get rout Washington or Ohio. Turecki disagrees. I see it basic sleaze, he said. The last time George Voinovich run office, he win re-election Ohio's governor 72 percent vote, stun his most optimistic supporters and set 20th-century record victory margins Ohio politics. This year, Voinovich, Republican who be bar seek third term, be run again, this time Senate seat hold John Glenn, Democrat who be retiring. And while there be few who expect Voinovich repeat his electoral benchmark four years ago, politicians parties generally acknowledge that he be well positioned increase Republican majority Senate. That have not prevent Voinovich's democratic opponent, Mary Boyle, undertake vigorous campaign. Ms. Boyle, former commissioner Cuyahoga County, which encompass Cleveland, be crisscross nation's seventh-most populous state what she describe grass-roots campaign that, while operate comparative shoestring, have nonetheless attract her side nationally know Democrats President Clinton foremost them campaign trail. Glenn, former astronaut who be prepare return space this month age 77, have not make endorsement Senate race. Like many candidates this year, Ms. Boyle, 55, be campaign hard issue education, seek portray Voinovich, 61, lackluster steward who allow state's schools decline. He promise be education governor, say Ms. Boyle. But seven and half years he have fail students this state. Her role campaign, she said, be remind people state Ohio that George Voinovich make promise and that he didn't deliver it. Specifically, she discuss decision last year Ohio Supreme Court that cite wide disparities quality state's schools and rule unconstitutional formula funding them. She have also attack her republican opponent support proposal raise state's sales tax one percent. Under that plan, half additional funds would have be use school improvement remainder earmark reduce property taxes. That statewide ballot initiative last May prove be wildly unpopular, 80 percent voters oppose it. While topics taxes and education be hot ones this political season Ohio, it be not clear that Ms. Boyle's emphasis them have help her campaign. Despite some narrowing opinion polls, she be still trail Voinovich 15 percentage points some polls and much 20 points others. There be also sharp fund-raising disparity. Ms. Boyle, who be run her first statewide race and have widespread union support, have raise nearly $2 million so far, far less nearly $7 million Voinovich have take in. Also, Voinovich, former lieutenant governor, have be statewide ballots five times last 20 years and thus be better-known candidate. The electoral dynamics Ohio be also aid Voinovich. The northern half state, its history industrial, unionized cities, have tradition vote largely democratic candidates, while southern tier state be consider more conservative and typically lean Republican. But Voinovich and Ms. Boyle share same home terrain, deprive Ms. Boyle geographic advantage that accompany democratic candidates. Indeed, boy, Voinovich once deliver newspapers Boyle home working-class Collinwood section Cleveland. And Voinovich, former mayor Cleveland, have develop reputation moderate Republican who work well Democrats. Voinovich, while campaign vigorously himself, be keep full schedule official duties, assume role experienced, elect official. If I get senate, I will probably know more domestic policy any member Senate, he say interview Wednesday Canton, sandwich ribbon-cutting ceremony and fund-raising reception vacuum clean museum. As mayor, I have my nose rub problems urban America and be fairly successful deal them. And, governor, I have deal problems Medicaid, welfare and education. I'm only person United States who have be president National League Cities and chairman National Governors Association. To his opponent's charge his record education, Voinovich be dismissive. I'm probably only Republican United States who have be endorse Ohio Education Association and National Education Association, he said, add that Ms. Boyle be member state Legislature period cite Supreme Court ruling. Mary Boyle be vice chairman Ways and Means Committee and member democratic leadership those years, Voinovich said. They nothing fix buildings, they nothing technology and urban school districts. Ms. Boyle, who have not begin run campaign commercials television, say her status underdog have allow me be more focused, more intense. Pausing campaign fund-raising breakfast former democratic Sen. Bill Bradley New Jersey here Wednesday, Ms. Boyle said: This have be marathon and it's be pretty much uphill. But now, we're last three miles. It's tough race. In cocoon loyal and wealthy supporters, President Clinton say Friday that he must live consequences his mistakes, although he contend that Democrats should take pride achievements his presidency and take heart its possibilities. Clinton have stop apologize his conduct Monica Lewinsky, he have take make glancing, times humble, references it, move attack Republican Congress indifferent Americans' needs. He so Friday series fund-raisers. In one deft sentence, he acknowledge his personal pain while claim credit country's economic strength, make compact appeal sympathy and support appearance earlier day Cleveland. After thank gathered donors very kind personal things they have say him, president declared, If I have do it all again, every day, I would do it heartbeat, see America where it be today compare six years ago. As applause die away, Clinton continued, I want you understand, too, that we all have live consequences our mistakes life. He add chuckle: most us don't have live it quite such public way. But nobody get out life free. To music saxophone and hammer dulcimer, Clinton raise $200,000 lunch private home Cleveland Democratic Senate candidate Ohio, Mary Boyle. then he fly Philadelphia raise half million dollars democratic Party. By midsummer, president's aides be delight have persuade him condense his fund-raising remarks just 10 minutes policy points and partisan jabbing. But his troubles have grow and mid-term elections have approached, his free-form remarks have become longer. In Cleveland Friday, he speak 26 minutes and here Friday even he speak almost 20 minutes. These fund-raising visits have fall pattern Clinton's videotape grand jury testimony Aug. 17. He be lauded, applauded and embrace his hosts and donors. Mr. President, these be your friends here today, say Tony George, host Cleveland event, offer refrain those who have play similar role. But Cleveland elsewhere, protesters who be scatter president's motorcade route be reminders call his resignation and impeachment, and mockery some be heap his presidency. At rally president city hall here Friday night group Teamsters chanted, two more years. Clinton's motorcade route be line downtown hundreds people, some them carry supportive or condemnatory signs. After impromptu shopping trip, which he be greet shout We love you, Clinton tell some donors begin impassioned reprise his Cleveland speech: I didn't mind protesters, that's american way. But, he added, he prefer it when they be minority, and that seem be case. As he ride Cleveland, Clinton pass billboard local radio station, WNCX. Lovin', touchin', squeezin', it read, words superimpose cartoon president his arm Ms. Lewinsky's shoulders, Washington Monument them. The president leave it his aides Friday respond directly late gusher grand jury disclosures Washington. Instead, his remarks, Clinton speak pride his record and urgency address international economic crisis and need struggle farmers and schoolchildren. As he typically do now such partisan audiences, he also walk his political calculation mid-term elections. Clinton say Cleveland that Republicans have brag privately him their prospects. They tell me, `Oh, we're go do very well, Mr. President, these mid-terms because we have so much more money you do,' and because Democrats who turn out re-elect Clinton would not return polls off-year. That argument, course, would also insulate Clinton any blame depress democratic vote. But he go far that, say that his predicament could actually help Democrats. Lower-income Democratic voters, he said, might not bother vote typical election. The people that be good enough serve you here this event today, they've get lot hassles their life, he said. But, he said, adversity be our friend, because it can overcome apathy and focus us what be issue here. What should be issue, Clinton said, be his achievements and agenda and Republicans' record, which he describe harshly. What have they done? he ask Cleveland. They kill minimum wage increase 12 million Americans. They kill campaign finance reform. They kill tobacco reform legislation. White House officials and gay Democrats, concern that nation's large gay and lesbian political organization be endorse Sen. Alfonse D'Amato re-election, be intensely lobby group try shift its support democratic challenger, Rep. Charles Schumer. Publicly, officials organization, Human Rights Campaign, say they be still deliberate their position closely watch race, consider tight nation. They say they would probably make endorsement Friday. But privately, organization officials and gay activists parties who have be monitor debate say group be most likely endorse D'Amato, Republican seek his fourth term. They also raise possibility that group would endorse candidates, or remain neutral. If group endorse D'Amato, say officials who speak condition anonymity, endorsement would be base three major factors: The group tend favor incumbents, have be search allies Senate Republican majority and considers D'Amato's recent record gay issues be quite strong. An endorsement group, which be hold high regard many gay and lesbian voters, could prove important swinging voters D'Amato tight race. It would also be major symbolic victory senator, who have seek recast himself centrist recent years and could use endorsement build his stand moderate swing voters. A D'Amato endorsement would also weaken Schumer's efforts portray incumbent right-wing extremist and would signify many voters fray traditional democratic coalition that have include black and gay voters, women and labor unions. The intensity debate surround endorsement underscores importance New York Senate race Democrats nation, who see defeat D'Amato one their best opportunities prevent Republicans gain 60 seats Senate enough stop Democratic filibuster. The Republicans currently hold 55-to-45 majority. There be sentiment community that if Republicans get 60 votes, that Trent Lott will basically be charge politically next two years, say David Mixner, close friend President Clinton's who be gay. He be refer Senate majority leader, who have call homosexuality sin and liken it kleptomania. Saturday, Schumer pick his endorsement New York's large gay and lesbian political organization, Empire State Pride Agenda. Although Human Rights Campaign be bipartisan, it have be very close Clinton administration, have many Democrats its board and receive much its money democratic contributors. largely because group's strong democratic ties, gay Democrats, New York liberals and White House officials be infuriate that it be endorse D'Amato, who also run right Life and Conservative Party lines and receives high ratings Christian Coalition, which typically oppose legislation civil rights gay people. Although organization have be think be inch D'Amato endorsement months, lobby campaign Schumer have pick intensity last two weeks, drive partly grow sense that race be now closer ever. Democrats and advocates parties who support rights gay people say that Vice President Al Gore, Hillary Rodham Clinton and Secretary Health and Human Services Donna Shalala have make personal appeals Human Rights Campaign officials urge them not endorse D'Amato. White House officials say they not know whether three have make such appeals, and Human Rights Campaign officials decline comment. Schumer meet privately group's top officials last week make one last pitch endorsement. Clinton administration officials have also be buttonhole group's board members every opportunity, cocktail parties fund-raisers, raise concerns D'Amato endorsement. Some New York advocate civil rights gay people have flood organization phone calls, e-mail messages and letters. democratic officials have be encourage group's major donors express their opposition D'Amato. People involve lobby efforts say that best, they be hop group will endorse candidates, or make no endorsement all. Chuck Schumer have be strong supporter issues that be important gay communities, say senior White House official who speak condition anonymity. The last thing that they should want do be hurt candidacy someone who have be so supportive their agenda. The Human Rights Campaign be consider most influential gay and lesbian organization Washington, national membership 250,000 and annual budget more $13 million. The group be create early 1980s large part counter rise Christian right and Ronald Reagan. Paradoxically, D'Amato be first elect Reagan landslide 1980 and remain strong supporter President Reagan. For D'Amato, who have aggressively court gay voters, endorsement would represent crown achievement his efforts reposition himself moderate. Since 1993, senator have back right gay citizens serve military, sponsor legislation prevent job discrimination gay workers and oppose his leadership's attempts block nominations two openly gay men positions Clinton administration. To gay supporters D'Amato, endorsement Human Rights Campaign would signify political maturation gay electorate and help organization insulate itself accusations that it be too close democratic Party. Those who support D'Amato endorsement, include top officials Human Rights Campaign, contend that current political climate, where Congress be almost certain remain republican control November, gay people must build alliances moderate Republicans. Human Rights Campaign officials also say their standing policy be support friendly incumbents, when their challengers have good voting records gay issues. That be case New York, where Schumer's rating Human Rights Campaign have be consistently better D'Amato's. Both men, however, have anger advocates rights gay people vote legislation that allow state not recognize gay marriages. In precedent widely cite D'Amato supporters, organization endorse Sen. John F. Kerry, Democrat, Republican challenger, William Weld, 1996 Massachusetts Senate race, though Weld's record gay rights be consider stronger. The move anger gay Republicans, who now contend that snub D'Amato would prove that group be bias Democrats. But there be clearly large number Human Rights Campaign contributors and board members who strongly feel that endorse D'Amato will permanently damage group, particularly women. They fear that abortion rights supporters will quit group droves because D'Amato have never waver his opposition abortion 18 years Congress. many New York gay activists would also be deeply upset if group endorse D'Amato, whom they blame instal state Senate majority leader, Joseph Bruno, whom they consider be strongly anti-gay. Matt Foreman, executive director Empire State Pride Agenda, cite D'Amato's role architect state Republican Party major reason group endorse Schumer. While he have criticize fellow Republicans Washington their intolerance, here home, his party's blatant discrimination be still order day, Foreman said. For that reason, some White House officials say they think Human Rights Campaign endorsement D'Amato will be almost meaningless gay voters. They contend that it might hurt senator his conservative base. I don't think anybody will vote Al D'Amato because HRC endorsement, say White House aide who speak condition anonymity. But I think some people Right Life Party and some upstate people be go say, `who be this guy and why should we vote him?' White House officials and gay Democrats, concern that nation's large gay and lesbian political organization be endorse Sen. Alfonse D'Amato re-election, be intensely lobby group try shift its support democratic challenger, Rep. Charles Schumer. Publicly, officials organization, Human Rights Campaign, say they be still deliberate their position closely watch race, consider tight nation. They say they would probably make endorsement Friday. But privately, organization officials and gay activists parties who have be monitor debate say group be most likely endorse D'Amato, Republican seek his fourth term.

He be refer Senate majority leader, who have call homosexuality sin and liken it kleptomania. Saturday, Schumer pick his endorsement New York's large gay and lesbian political organization, Empire State Pride Agenda. Although Human Rights Campaign be bipartisan, it have be very close Clinton administration, have many Democrats its board and receive much its money democratic contributors. largely because group's strong democratic ties, gay Democrats, New York liberals and White House officials be infuriate that it be endorse D'Amato, who also run right Life and Conservative Party lines and receives high ratings Christian Coalition, which typically oppose legislation civil rights gay people. Although organization have be think be inch D'Amato endorsement months, lobby campaign Schumer have pick intensity last two weeks, drive partly grow sense that race be now closer ever. Democrats and advocates parties who support rights gay people say that Vice President Al Gore, Hillary Rodham Clinton and Secretary Health and Human Services Donna Shalala have make personal appeals Human Rights Campaign officials urge them not endorse D'Amato. White House officials say they not know whether three have make such appeals, and Human Rights Campaign officials decline comment. Schumer meet privately group's top officials last week make one last pitch endorsement. Clinton administration officials have also be buttonhole group's board members every opportunity, cocktail parties fund-raisers, raise concerns D'Amato endorsement. Some New York advocate civil rights gay people have flood organization phone calls, e-mail messages and letters. democratic officials have be encourage group's major donors express their opposition D'Amato. People involve lobby efforts say that best, they be hop group will endorse candidates, or make no endorsement all. Chuck Schumer have be strong supporter issues that be important gay communities, say senior White House official who speak condition anonymity. The last thing that they should want do be hurt candidacy someone who have be so supportive their agenda. The Human Rights Campaign be consider most influential gay and lesbian organization Washington, national membership 250,000 and annual budget more $13 million. The group be create early 1980s large part counter rise Christian right and Ronald Reagan. Paradoxically, D'Amato be first elect Reagan landslide 1980 and remain strong supporter President Reagan. For D'Amato, who have aggressively court gay voters, endorsement would represent crown achievement his efforts reposition himself moderate. Since 1993, senator have back right gay citizens serve military, sponsor legislation prevent job discrimination gay workers and oppose his leadership's attempts block nominations two openly gay men positions Clinton administration. To gay supporters D'Amato, endorsement Human Rights Campaign would signify political maturation gay electorate and help organization insulate itself accusations that it be too close democratic Party. Those who support D'Amato endorsement, include top officials Human Rights Campaign, contend that current political climate, where Congress be almost certain remain republican control November, gay people must build alliances moderate Republicans. Human Rights Campaign officials also say their standing policy be support friendly incumbents, when their challengers have good voting records gay issues. That be case New York, where Schumer's rating Human Rights Campaign have be consistently better D'Amato's. Both men, however, have anger advocates rights gay people vote legislation that allow state not recognize gay marriages. In precedent widely cite D'Amato supporters, organization endorse Sen. John F. Kerry, Democrat, Republican challenger, William Weld, 1996 Massachusetts Senate race, though Weld's record gay rights be consider stronger. The move anger gay Republicans, who now contend that snub D'Amato would prove that group be bias Democrats. But there be clearly large number Human Rights Campaign contributors and board members who strongly feel that endorse D'Amato will permanently damage group, particularly women. They fear that abortion rights supporters will quit group droves because D'Amato have never waver his opposition abortion 18 years Congress. many New York gay activists would also be deeply upset if group endorse D'Amato, whom they blame instal state Senate majority leader, Joseph Bruno, whom they consider be strongly anti-gay. Matt Foreman, executive director Empire State Pride Agenda, cite D'Amato's role architect state Republican Party major reason group endorse Schumer. While he have criticize fellow Republicans Washington their intolerance, here home, his party's blatant discrimination be still order day, Foreman said. For that reason, some White House officials say they think Human Rights Campaign endorsement D'Amato will be almost meaningless gay voters. They contend that it might hurt senator his conservative base. I don't think anybody will vote Al D'Amato because HRC endorsement, say White House aide who speak condition anonymity. But I think some people Right Life Party and some upstate people be go say, `who be this guy and why should we vote him?' In other election years, Reps. David Price and Julia Carson would have have little common other that they be Democrats relatively safe seats. Price be centrist who have represent this high-tech district North Carolina all 2 last 12 years, political scientist who have teach Duke and Yale. Mrs. Carson, fairly liberal, be House freshman who work her way politics grass roots, have be rear poverty. But party officials who open this election year high hopes recapture House be begin worry that democratic incumbents Price and Mrs. Carson share something else: greater-than-expected peril Election Day. As many congressional races, big variable be White House scandal, which have inject fear and uncertainty campaigns country. other democratic incumbents who republican officials cite locked contests that be more competitive expect include Reps. Corrine Brown Florida, Vic Snyder Arkansas, Lois Capps and Ellen Tauscher California, Martin Frost Texas, Melvin Watt North Carolina, John LaFalce New York and Sander Levin Michigan. here North Carolina's 4th Congressional District, Price, acknowledge that his polls show him tight race, said: This be swing district that be sensitive any tide or trend. It's something you think lot connection president's troubles. The efforts Price and Mrs. Carson contain Lewinsky debacle and their opponents' attempts capitalize it offer important clues suggest how Clinton's problems be influence conduct races country. many Democrats be straddle line that seem shift bit every new scandal-related disclosure: they do not want appear close president whose conduct embarrass them, and yet, sense possibility public backlash Republicans, they be weigh their words carefully and be wary hop any impeachment bandwagon. And while publicly these Democrats express confidence that scandal will have little impact them, their campaigns be prepare bad place great emphasis ever behind-the-efforts prod their core constituencies vote. In reflection uncertainty that Clinton scandal have cast Republicans, challengers Price and Carson districts be political novices seek office first time have differ strategies: Tom Roberg, computer executive Raleigh who be take Price, have broadcast television commercial exploit scandal. Tom Roberg have call Bill Clinton's resignation, narrator says. This be not time be silent, Price. Where do you stand? But Indianapolis, Gary Hofmeister, conservative jeweler challenge Mrs. Carson Indiana's 10th Congressional District, be take more subtle approach: rather mention scandal directly, he note he can that Julia vote Clinton almost 100 percent time. ask why he be not much raise scandal directly, Hofmeister said: Don't murder somebody when they're process commit suicide. There would be danger if we go overboard. The best evidence discomfort Price and Mrs. Carson be that when ask separate interviews whether they would want Clinton campaign their districts, say it would be impossible this late date White House schedule visit. What if there be sudden schedule change? Both paused, squirm bit and muster answers that be hardly affirmative. Given president's popularity, I doubt it will hurt me, Mrs. Carson said. And Price? I don't think that would be such good idea, he said. I've never have president campaign here, and I wouldn't want start this time although he be eagerly welcoming Erskine Bowles, president's chief staff and popular native son North Carolina, stump him here this Sunday.) Making strategy stump be far complicate anecdotal evidence that run counter democratic fears and Republican hopes. In three days campaign stop here North Carolina and Indianapolis, scandal be rarely raise any voter be court candidates either party. When reporter ask it, many voters say that appal they be Clinton's behavior, they have hard time relate it their decision which way vote congressional elections five weeks. As Hofmeister walk park lot gun and knife show Indiana National Guard Armory Indianapolis last Sunday, Billy Derringer, 57-year-old machinist who be retire disability, call him express outrage millions dollars that have be spend investigate Clinton. It's pathetic spend all our money, say Derringer, who identify himself independent. It shouldn't have get this far. Hofmeister try his best make Republicans' case. There have be rule law, he said. Mrs. Carson say she hop that Democrats and swing voters alike would become so fed Lewinsky inquiry that issue might help her. To that end, she proudly inform audiences that she vote make public report deliver House Kenneth Starr, Whitewater independent counsel. I be one 63 members Congress who vote put all that filth Internet, she said, add that Starr's inquiry have be cruel hoax terms fiscal responsibility and accountability. The Carson campaign be count voters Timothy Daly, 38-year-old real estate executive who vote Republican two years ago now favor Mrs. Carson. I'm pull democratic ticket because I'm tire it: right side Republican Party be play politics, Daly said. We'd see them go people's business. Back here 4th District, Price have some reasons be worried. He be first elect House 1986 but, four-term incumbent, be oust republican sweep 1994 (only win his seat back two years later). In addition, district be redrawn last year include large Durham section where voters do not know him well. determine not be midterm casualty Clinton once again, Price say he be wag most vigorous get-out-the-vote ground campaign his career. Rather engage Roberg Clinton scandal, Price have begin broadcast television commercial that emphasize his central issue: education. The congressman's advisers say they intentionally produce advertisement that appear decidedly nonpolitical it feature school children play effort break television clutter scandal. But Price campaign also have weapon it be hold reserve, event Roberg appear be rid Clinton scandal advantage: incumbent's advisers say they would not be timid run commercials underscore that he earn divinity degree get his doctorate political science. At coffee voters wealthy enclave Raleigh other night, Roberg open his remarks assert that Clinton have lose moral authority lead. Yet none those assemble ask him scandal; they be more concerned state's plans build highway their neighborhood. The last time George Voinovich run office, he win re-election Ohio's governor 72 percent vote, stun his most optimistic supporters and set 20th-century record victory margins Ohio politics. This year, Voinovich, Republican who be bar seek third term, be run again, this time Senate seat hold John Glenn, Democrat who be retiring. And while there be few who expect Voinovich repeat his electoral benchmark four years ago, politicians parties generally acknowledge that he be well positioned increase Republican majority Senate. That have not prevent Voinovich's democratic opponent, Mary Boyle, undertake vigorous campaign. Ms. Boyle, former commissioner Cuyahoga County, which encompass Cleveland, be crisscross nation's seventh-most populous state what she describe grass-roots campaign that, while operate comparative shoestring, have nonetheless attract her side nationally know Democrats President Clinton foremost them campaign trail. Glenn, former astronaut who be prepare return space this month age 77, have not make endorsement Senate race. Like many candidates this year, Ms. Boyle, 55, be campaign hard issue education, seek portray Voinovich, 61, lackluster steward who allow state's schools decline. He promise be education governor, say Ms. Boyle. But seven and half years he have fail students this state. Her role campaign, she said, be remind people state Ohio that George Voinovich make promise and that he didn't deliver it. Specifically, she discuss decision last year Ohio Supreme Court that cite wide disparities quality state's schools and rule unconstitutional formula funding them. She have also attack her republican opponent support proposal raise state's sales tax one percent. Under that plan, half additional funds would have be use school improvement remainder earmark reduce property taxes. That statewide ballot initiative last May prove be wildly unpopular, 80 percent voters oppose it. While topics taxes and education be hot ones this political season Ohio, it be not clear that Ms. Boyle's emphasis them have help her campaign. Despite some narrowing opinion polls, she be still trail Voinovich 10 percentage points some polls and much 18 points others. There be also sharp fund-raising disparity. Ms. Boyle, who be run her first statewide race and have widespread union support, have raise nearly $2 million so far, far less nearly $7 million Voinovich have take in. Also, Voinovich, former lieutenant governor, have be statewide ballots five times last 20 years and thus be better-known candidate. The electoral dynamics Ohio be also aid Voinovich. The northern half state, its history industrial, unionized cities, have tradition vote largely democratic candidates, while southern tier state be consider more conservative and typically lean Republican. But Voinovich and Ms. Boyle share same home terrain, deprive Ms. Boyle geographic advantage that accompany democratic candidates. Indeed, boy, Voinovich once deliver newspapers Boyle home working-class Collinwood section Cleveland. And Voinovich, former mayor Cleveland, have develop reputation moderate Republican who work well Democrats. Voinovich, while campaign vigorously himself, be keep full schedule official duties, assume role experienced, elect official. If I get senate, I will probably know more domestic policy any member Senate, he say interview Wednesday Canton, sandwich ribbon-cutting ceremony and fund-raising reception vacuum clean museum. As mayor, I have my nose rub problems urban America and be fairly successful deal them. And, governor, I have deal problems Medicaid, welfare and education. I'm only person United States who have be president National League Cities and chairman National Governors Association. To his opponent's charge his record education, Voinovich be dismissive. I'm probably only Republican United States who have be endorse Ohio Education Association and National Education Association, he said, add that Ms. Boyle be member state Legislature period cite Supreme Court ruling. Mary Boyle be vice chairman Ways and Means Committee and member democratic leadership those years, Voinovich said. They nothing fix buildings, they nothing technology and urban school districts. Ms. Boyle, who have not begin run campaign commercials television, say her status underdog have allow me be more focused, more intense. Pausing campaign fund-raising breakfast former democratic Sen. Bill Bradley New Jersey here Wednesday, Ms. Boyle said: This have be marathon and it's be pretty much uphill. But now, we're last three miles. It's tough race. Sen. Alfonse D'Amato, New York Republican who be run re-election, go Manhattan's Grand Central Terminal other morning accept award mass-transit advocates. But reporters who have gather there show little interest shiny train car senator's back. Instead, they repeatedly ask him how he would vote impeachment President Clinton. Look, I'm not go make any comment respect that subject matter, D'Amato responded. I be not just citizen. I be citizen-senator who may be call make decision. But D'Amato be something else well: candidate what may be tight Senate race nation. And variations his elliptical response can be hear Senate races country, where Republicans and Democrats be encounter similar questions. All which suggest that House vote Thursday authorize impeachment inquiry, this year's 34 races U.S. Senate have become, what they already were, electoral equivalent jury selection. If House vote impeach Clinton, matter go Senate, which must decide two-thirds majority whether convict him and, thus, remove him office. As result, Monica Lewinsky matter have suddenly inject new disruptive force Senate contests. Voters, those who support Clinton, expect their political leaders, Republican or Democratic, renounce Clinton's behavior, and candidates have be do that. But impeachment be another matter; most polls show nation be it. The danger Senate candidates be that impeachment now real possibility, debate may move president's behavior which there be little disagreement more problematic issue whether he should be remove office. For most strategists involve races, there be little guidance how handle impeachment issue. Advisers candidates parties say interviews last week that they be perplex and worried, unsure what they can or should do issue gain advantage or guard harm. I can't tell how this one be go go, say Mike Russell, spokesman Republican Senatorial Campaign Committee. This be very surreal environment. Of 34 Senate seats play, 18 be hold Democrats and 16 Republicans, who now hold 55 seats all. Republicans would have win 28 34 races produce 67 votes necessary conviction, assume such vote be go party lines. only electoral catastrophe Democrats, which seem almost unthinkable, could produce such huge loss. Jennifer Duffy, who follow Senate races Cook Political Report, nonpartisan newsletter, say that so far, least, none Senate candidates have make explicit appeal votes base how they would vote presidential jury. But she and be wonder if this may be change. This be difficult ground measure. One central questions this political year have be how clinton's dealings Ms. Lewinsky might affect turnout. For long time, politicians assume that dispirited Democrats would stay home rebuke Clinton, just many Republicans November 1974, three months President Richard M. Nixon resigned. But now some analysts wonder if partisan fight Congress last week might have effect some Democrats. That's problem, say Stuart Rothenberg, editor independent political newsletter Washington. It's not that we don't know, and that politicians don't know, where general public stand impeachment. The problem be that we don't know where electorate stands impeachment. And ask voters think ahead impeachment proceed they cast their ballots Senate race is, words Stuart Stevens, Republican consultant, double bank-shot. such strategies, he said, tend work only small number single-minded or sophisticated voters. Against that complicate backdrop, prevail thinking be that use impeachment issue will vary race race, state state and week week, depend circumstances candidates and composition electorate. If Democrats try turn image Clinton dock their advantage, it would be states democratic edge or sizable numbers black voters, who overwhelmingly support president. In contests those, it might well prove be interest democratic candidate to, one consultant put it, sit front camera and tape advertisement which candidate denounces president's behavior solemnly pledge vote impeachment. Strategists parties believe that kind approach could prove effective. This be issue where there be huge disconnect elites and public, say Fred Yang, Democratic consultant clients Wisconsin and Carolinas. That kind democratic strategy might emerge California, New York, Illinois, Wisconsin, Washington and perhaps Arkansas. By contrast, Democrats South Carolina, Georgia and Nevada would be less likely oppose Clinton's impeachment. On other side, republican consultants be tell their candidates stress Clinton's misdeeds and stay away talk impeachment. The last thing party want be turn Senate elections referendum whether Clinton should be force office. The White House might think overall public numbers that maybe they would make this referendum election, say Ed Goeas, Republican pollster who be work Senate races this year. Republicans certainly aren't go let that happen. D'Amato respond questions Clinton language that republican consultants have be suggest their candidates. When and if that matter come Senate, I will decide facts that be present me that time, D'Amato said. It would be very premature me suggest any course action it be referred. Because, indeed, we may be call act jury some kind. But Schumer, member House Judiciary Committee, which be conduct impeachment investigation, virtually embrace issue. In live telecast hearings, he say president deserve less punishment, such censure or reprimand. And Schumer plan campaign New York Monday Clinton his side. Schumer's media adviser, Hank Morris, seem suggest last week that impeachment will grow issue. Senator D'Amato claim he do not want share his opinion people New York, Morris said. And if he doesn't have opinion, he's only New Yorker who doesn't have opinion. ask if Schumer would raise issue television commercial, Morris responded: We don't talk what we're go do. I wouldn't rule it and I wouldn't rule it out.

In this case, it appears, serbian vengeance be visit Delijajs. Survivors clan say they have fear assault their collection mud and brick homes line rocky dirt track directly village Likovac, Serbs' base just mile away. The Serbs have push rebels out Likovac August and guerrillas have establish new headquarters Bajince, six miles east Obrinje. As Serbs sweep nearby Cicavica Mountains, and road that run Pristina Klina, it be clear that Obrinje would be target. Most women and children area have move Apple Valley, where more 10,000 refugees have gather outdoors, seek safety numbers. But Imer Delijaj, 38, say he decide that ravine his family compound would be good hide place. He say he believe women, children and elderly would be spar if Serbs find them. As Serbs approach foot Saturday morning massacre, last person flee compound itself be Bashkim Delijaj, 21, young son 94-year-old Fazli. Bashkim Delijaj say he have stay look his bedridden father. The shelling start again 7 a.m. Saturday and I saw tank convoy approaching, infantry tanks, Bashkim Delijaj recall interview. I be smoke cigarette when grenade fell roof and hole gate I saw soldiers come 30 meters away. They be brown army uniforms, have huge knives or small axes. many have beards. Bashkim Delijaj say he be unable carry his father safety, and not have courage tell him what be happening. I tell him I be get animals out barn, he said. He say he ran, hid, run some more, and eventually receive shelter farmer, all time hear shoot and shelling. When firing have die Monday morning, he return compound and run Imer, still wear his guerrilla uniform. They go one houses and find Imer Delijaj's brother, Adem, 33, shot dead, his body sprawl ground rain, and burn torso Fazli. I look window our house and saw only bones my father, which look what we learn biology class, he said. Together, two men go find out what have happen ravine. There they find bodies. First, Ali, 65, who, Imer Delijaj said, have be cut neck his tobacco cut knife. then Pajazit, who have be decapitate makeshift tent, his brain place two foam mattresses. then Hava, 65, who be sprawl tent. They move find jeton, Imer's 10-year-old son, and Imer's mother, Hamide, 60, not far away. Imer's sister-in-law, Luljeta, who be seven months pregnant, have be mutilated, he said. A little further ravine, Imer say he saw his wife, Lumnije, 30. He open his wife's coat and find his 6-week-old baby girl, now 3 months old and recover relative's home Likovac. He say he try clean baby and then put her his jacket and walk few feet further find bodies his 4-year-old daughter, Menduhije, and two other young children, Donieta, 5, and Gentiana, 7. The corpses other family members be find woods and two old men, Habib, 51, and Hysen, 53, be find next morning, Imer said. On Oct. 3, bodies two miss teen-age girls, Mehane, 16, and Antigua, 13, be find bushes side road abandon serbian police compound. Later month, body Hajriz be find pushed well, close ravine. One uncle, Sharif, who be ravine, be still missing, presume dead. Human Rights Watch, which have be document Delijaj massacre, have describe it most vicious pattern attacks civilians Serbs Kosovo conflict. (To less extent, Albanian guerrillas also attack serbian civilians, force them their homes, and allegedly carry out least two massacres.) The evidence strongly indicate that Gornje Obrinje killings be follow conscious mutilations carry out victims be killed, come report Human Rights Watch says. Delijaj family members have tell Human Rights Watch monitors and that they saw ethnic albanian police officer accompany serbian police officers fighting. They believe that police officer, who be post nearby Glogovac police station, be use serbian special police officers guide Obrinje area. This police officer, who be apparently one small group ethnic Albanians officers who have remain loyal Serbs, could be important witness criminal investigators war-crimes tribunal The Hague, accord human rights experts. The ethnic Albanian policeman could be important witness identify police and army units responsible atrocities, say Peter Boueckhart, researcher Human Rights Watch. It be vital that those who carry out these atrocities be prosecute Hague tribunal. At burn Delijaj compound last week, Imer Delijaj have be act host wake which, Albanian tradition, will last several weeks and begin family members return their hiding places woods. Color photograph young members family, and Imer's mother and grandmother, have be mount glass table gate. A 30-year-old faded black and white picture Fazli double-breasted suit stand apart, sign ultimate respect. An outsized albanian flag black double-headed eagle red field be drape table. Imer Delijaj's face seem tense and his words be spare he describe his family's death. He not express direct remorse allow his family use hide place so close family compound, which all practical purposes be informal base fighters. His lawyer, Bajram Krasniqi, who say he be eager be helpful investigators Hague tribunal, say Pristina that he believe Imer Delijaj felt guilty faulty decision. Whether tribunal will closely examine case remain unclear. Slobodan Milosevic, Yugoslav president, have issue only handful visa investigators tribunal. Two investigators who be Kosovo time massacre leave six days later visit site or contact Krasniqi killings. Would Imer Delijaj seek revenge? As he sit floor his living room group male visitors, he replied: It's easy answer. If I can see eye eye men I will fight them. But only men uniform and fair fight. If I see children them, I will treat them children all world. Children be children. american and allied forces Bosnia Wednesday arrest Bosnian Serb general who be charge genocide international war crimes tribunal recent secret indictment. Maj. Gen.

Louise Arbour, chief prosecutor International Criminal Tribunal former Yugoslavia, call Krstic very significant military leader and say she be delighted arrest. The general be only indict Oct. 30, tribunal officials said, indictment be keep secret so there would be good chance successful arrest. NATO Secretary-General Javier Solana warn that other war crimes suspect still large should realize that they, too, will be bring justice.

Srebrenica be dark part our history and people don't talk it, official said. But everyone believe it be anti-terrorist units that be send do killing.

Ivo Daalder, former Bosnia expert National Security Council, now Brookings Institution, say arrest show new and promising coordination Tribunal and NATO troops, give rapid arrest Oct. 30 indictment. He also say that arrest serve officer important war crime would send important message. Srebrenica be key town Bosnian conflict. It be where United Nations first make stand March 1993, when commander U.N. troop personally lead convoy trucks surround town and promise bosnian Muslims there that Srebrenica would be safe area and United Nations would protect them. But July 1995, United Nations not protect Srebrenica air strikes, and peacekeeping troops watch Serbs march in, separate Muslim men and women and march men off.

At London conference later July, NATO agree defend Gorazde and remain safe areas massive air strikes if necessary. After mortar attack Sarajevo marketplace late August, NATO air strikes began, signal last chapter war and lead american-brokered Dayton Accords.

Mucic's conviction be first international court basis command responsibility post-world War II tribunals convict Nazi and japanese superiors crimes their subordinates. Mr. Mucic be clearly derelict his duty and allow those his authority commit most heinous offenses, take any disciplinary action, say preside Judge Adolphus Karibi-Whyte Nigeria.

Jelisic plead guilty October murder 12 Muslims and Croats and Serb-run Luka camp set Brcko, northern Bosnia, May 1992. By try him genocide, prosecutors will be able call evidence background Jelisic's murders, include involvement more senior Serbs. The trial also will give survivors his kill spree chance tell their story court.

Jelisic will be convict those murders and sentenced end his trial, which be expect last well 1999. He face maximum sentence life imprisonment. We will never be able fix exact number victims, Bowers said. But if we be believe small percentage totals which Goran Jelisic claimed, then his victims certainly number well 100. As trial began, judges be read excerpts psychological report which state that Jelisic be mentally fit stand trial suffer borderline personality disorder. Wearing strip sweater and black jeans, Jelisic bring laptop computer court and take notes. When he wasn't writing, Jelisic sit slightly slump his chair, his head still, look impassively courtroom. Jelisic's campaign murder stand out tribunal set deal exclusively atrocities its cold-bloodedness. Once Goran Jelisic decline assistance guard, note that he be still `good form' though he have kill 60 people, Bowers tell judges, cite statements make witnesses due testify later trial. To victims Brcko, face genocide be face Goran Jelisic, he said. Bowers tell judges that Jelisic, who hold no official rank, be release bosnian Serb authorities jail, where he be serve three years fraud, and send Brcko murder Muslims. He tell investigators that his arrival town, which be strategic importance bosnian Serbs, he be give list Muslim targets and order kill many possible. Jelisic, Bowers said, seem relish task. Witness testimony will also establish that Goran Jelisic be not reluctant tool genocide who be be compel Serb authorities act his will, U.S. prosecutor said.

Erekat stay time, sit clan elders arab headdresses and teen-age nephews american-style athletic shoes, then slip away meet connection President Clinton's visit begin this weekend. It's be very difficult, he say later, ask carry his negotiate duties such time. I have great sense sorrow and sadness, feeling such loss. I hope God will enable me use my grief strengthen my determination peace. The scene Erekat home, Arab village Abu Dis Jerusalem's eastern outskirts, drive home central truth israeli-palestinian conflict: sides divide, political be also deeply personal. And that inescapability go heart quarrel's intractability. In glare world attention, it be easy forget that there be few people live Israel and Palestinian land combine there be New York City. In small and jostle confines what few here choose call Holy Land, conflict touches all. everyone have stake it. Israelis fret daily soldier sons dangerous patrol West Bank and Gaza Strip, or shudder when they pass sidewalk cafe once rip Islamic militant's suicide bomb. palestinian families struggle keep alive memories fathers and brothers languish Israeli prisons, and chafe checkpoints and gunsights Israeli troops. On sides, young soak fear and anger their ABCs. And elders' memories half century still rise trouble collective sleep: shadow Holocaust Israelis, trauma exile and dispossession Palestinians.

I have try strictly adhere position United States that we would not take position any final status issue. He say he be travel Gaza recommendation of, others, Netanyahu. The prime minister want me go there and want us all make this pitch, he said, add that he would ask palestinian National Council support peace and renounce idea animosity and opposition existence state Israel, and instead embrace path not only peace cooperation. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu Sunday accuse Yasser Arafat make farce Wye River accords and say he would not agree further troop withdrawals halt anti-israel violence. Netanyahu, interview The Associated Press, say Palestinians be embolden foment street riots and threaten declare statehood because they believe they have Clinton administration their back pocket. The Palestinians be make farce out Wye River accord. They think they have United States their back pocket, say Israeli leader. As long that be case, they will not change their behavior. Netanyahu say he not believe United States be side Palestinians, his sharply word remarks send strong signal that he would President Bill Clinton intervene and low palestinian expectations prior his Dec. 12-15 trip. Palestinians claim it be Israel that have violate summit agreement reach October not free jail political activists, confiscate West Bank land roads and allow jewish settlers seize hilltops expansion.

Palestinians see Clinton trip implicit recognition their struggle statehood, though Clinton have specifically say interview air Israel's Channel 2 television that it should not be read that way. Netanyahu make clear that he would be annoy if Air Force One land newly open palestinian airport Gaza, which aides say would be view strong symbol support Palestinian demand sovereignty. We will be very disappointed if that be case. We've say United States that we don't think that be necessary, Netanyahu say reports that Clinton's plane would land Gaza. He say travel motorcade would be quick and more politically considerate. Unless somebody want put thumb our eye, I think there be good ways travel, Netanyahu said. In interview, Netanyahu stress that he oppose palestinian statehood and demand that Arafat stop threaten declare independence May 4, 1999, when Palestinians maintain Oslo accords expire. What must be be that Yasser Arafat retract this open and incipient violation Oslo and Wye River accords and recommits himself negotiate we get white smoke, we get solution. That's only way we'll get real peace Israel and Palestinians, Netanyahu said. In conciliatory speech Sweden weekend, Arafat stress that he seek negotiate settlement and not mention May 4 deadline. He also say any palestinian state would not make alliances states hostile Israel one Netanyahu's key concerns. The israeli leader be also demand that Arafat drop claims that Netanyahu promise Wye release 750 Palestinians jail anti-israel attacks that result bloodshed, rather free car thieves and petty criminals. Each side have different interpretation understand prisoners. Netanyahu maintain he never agree free those blood their hands. It's high time that Yasser Arafat admit this be agree and that he's not go make demands Israel, include incitement violence,...on trumped-up charge, he said. Israel never promise release murders Wye, and it won't release them. The issue have be focal point new wave violent protests and demonstrations West Bank and hunger strike that begin Saturday 1,700 Palestinian inmates. Israel be also upset statements that nearly 600-member Palestinian National Council will not reaffirm vote that anti-israel clauses palestinian charter have be deleted. Netanyahu maintain that only 25 members out hundreds who live abroad have be invite so far. Netanyahu quote Clinton tell him that purpose his visit be personally make sure that they actually rescind this charter that call Israel's destruction.

The most problematic moment Clinton visit will be his address Monday Palestine National Council, Palestinians' parliament-in-exile, and other palestinian groups, Gaza City. Under Wye agreement, PNC be reaffirm this session Arafat letter Clinton which declare clauses PLO found charter call Israel's destruction revoked. Israel insist vote be take show hands, while Palestinians say only approval acclamation be required. Netanyahu say Thursday he will not settle anything less vote, if Clinton declare PNC session success it. It be Israel which determine issues connect its future, Netanyahu say when ask Israel radio whether he would be ready enter showdown Clinton issue. It be unlikely U.S. president would side Israel such dispute because it would mean that main purpose his visit, usher next stage Wye agreement, have failed. immediately PNC session, Israel be transfer five percent West Bank its sole control joint jurisdiction. Netanyahu say last week he be freeze pullback what he claim be systematic palestinian violations peace accord. He reiterate Thursday that he would not change his decision unless Arafat publicly drop plans unilaterally declare palestinian state May.

In recent weeks Palestinians again constantly, systematically and intentionally violate all their commitments. We be not entitled, not able and not prepared forgo fulfillment those commitments. Netanyahu, who be face political turmoil his hard-line coalition government, say he could not accept phony peace paper which be not honor practice. Since Clinton preside its sign Washington October, land-for-security agreement have hit one snag another. Israel freeze implementation accord altogether, accuse Arafat violate deal and incite violent street protests. Clinton say United States shares Israel's concerns security. Peace be not simply option many only choice that can avert still more years bloodshed, apprehension and sorrow, he said. That be why I'm here. He say sides now must face challenge implement Wye.

Prodi's center-left government, Italy's second-longest World War II, be threaten collapse defection its Communist ally. The premier will address Parliament Wednesday, follow perhaps Friday vote confidence that will determine whether 2 1/2-year-old, center-left alliance stands or falls.

After his meetings French leaders, Prodi warn that political difficulties threaten progress country be make clean its public finances. Prodi's government have hold together this long large part because widely share desire see Italy qualify 1999 debut Europe's common currency, euro. It qualify earlier this year leave disparate allies so clear reason stay together. As it is, Prodi have outlast all Bettino Craxi, who serve 3{ years two back-to-back stints 1983 1987. Prodi's be Italy's 55th government World War II. Three days collapse Premier Romano Prodi's center-left government, Italy's president begin call political leaders Monday try reach consensus new government. Following talks, which be expect last several days, President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro could ask Prodi try again new majority. He could also name new premier, or appoint government technocrats. If Scalfaro feel no candidate be capable muster majority, he could call early elections. Because president cannot dissolve Parliament last six weeks his term, elections would have be schedule December. Scalfaro have name Prodi caretaker premier interim. Prodi's far-left ally, Communist Refoundation, provoke crisis when it withdraw support government 1999 deficit-cutting budget, which it say not do enough stimulate job creation. Despite help breakaway faction Communists, who Sunday form new party, Prodi lose Friday's vote confidence single vote. Prodi have say he won't take job back unless his new government could stick policies its old one, unlikely scenario give divide Parliament. An alternative Prodi could be Massimo D'Alema, leader Democrats Left, large party Prodi's coalition. In case so-called technical government, names Treasury Minister Carlo Azeglio Ciampi and Foreign Minister Lamberto Dini have be circulated. A government technicians would get Italy volatile period approve 1999 budget and launch common european currency, euro, January 1999. Prodi preside cost cuts that get Italy debut European Monetary Union, outlast all one other post-world War II italian government process. By one vote, Premier Romano Prodi's center-left coalition lose confidence vote Chamber Deputies Friday, and he go presidential palace resign. President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro must now decide whether call early elections or ask Prodi or someone else try forge new majority. The vote low chamber Parliament 313 confidence motion bring government 312 favor. I'm not bitter, Prodi say immediately his government go down. The swing vote come Prodi's coalition, defect deputy Foreign Minister Lamberto Dini's tiny italian Renewal party. The Communist, 6th graf prv By one vote, defector its ranks, Premier Romano Prodi's center-left coalition, Italy's second-longest serve government World War II, lose confidence vote Friday Chamber Deputies. Prodi immediately offer his resignation President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro, who ask him stay caretaker premier while head state decide whether call early elections or ask someone else be premier. The vote, 3rd graf prv Italy's Communists Sunday vote withdraw support Premier Romano Prodi's 2 1-2-year-old coalition, move expect trigger collapse one country's longest-lived postwar governments. Prodi have say he would call confidence vote if Communists yank support. The coalition have majority Communists Senate, have depend them passage key legislation Chamber. MORE italian politics have long be enliven baroque feud and shift alliances. And that time-honored tradition may have win embattled government Prime Minister Romano Prodi momentary reprieve. A leader Italy's hard-line Marxist faction, know Communist Refounding Party, resign Monday protest his party's decision reject government's 1999 budget and imperil Prodi's slender majority Parliament. Prodi must realize that his majority no longer exists, say Armando Cossuta, chairman Communist Refounding Party, fringe group that break mainstream Communists they overhaul party collapse Soviet Union 1991. Nevertheless we should do everything possible, last minute, this government and avoid this crisis. Cossuta be clearly unwilling join most hard-line wing his party withdraw support Prodi and risk be brand have torpedo first leftist italian government 50 years. But leader Communist Refounding Party Parliament, Fausto Bertinotti, seem have no such compunctions. On Friday, he tell journalists that he be not worried force new elections that could return right power. sometimes you have take one step back order take two steps forward, he say shrug. Until now, however, communist rank and file have disagree that view. When Bertinotti force Prodi offer his resignation last year propose budget cuts, rank and file protested, and he be force backpedal. Prodi meet Monday President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro and coalition leaders devise strategy. He be expect go Parliament Wednesday open debate crisis and seek enough votes budget. Without it, italian central bank be unlikely cut its key lending rates, something Italy must do get line Germany and other big european neighbors introduction Jan. 1 single european currency, euro. But if he gather enough votes pass budget, Prodi could still be leave majority. After two and half years office, his government be second-longest postwar era. But fragile center-left coalition have hold together mostly because Italians be unite last two years effort reduce spending, inflation and government borrow meet requirements membership euro plan. once that goal be achieve last spring, dissension quickly revived. Prodi's backers be hop that enough members Communist Refounding Party will break ranks and follow Cossutta coalition. If not, Prodi be face two unappetizing choices. He can resign and seek new elections, which carry risk bring opposition power. Or he could seek form new majority Communists seek alliance small center-right party Francesco Cossiga. Cossiga's party come Prodi's rescue June, when hard-line leftists refuse back Prodi NATO expansion. But Prodi have repeatedly say he will govern only center-left majority that elect him 1996. Cossiga also suggest reporters Monday that he would not welcome any invitations join coalition lead Prodi. We wouldn't want this majority get stain Monica Lewinsky's dress, he said. By only one vote, center-left prime minister Italy, Romano Prodi, lose confidence vote Parliament Friday and be topple power. The collapse his government two and half years, second-longest tenure World War II, suggest that chronic political instability that mark Italy decades have spring back life. Though oblige tender his resignation, Prodi will remain charge caretaker prime minister new government be formed. He may get second chance form new majority, if he does, negotiations that end could take days and weeks, cloud decisions such urgent issues crisis Kosovo. NATO military planners prepare possible air strikes Yugoslavia have expect use key air bases Italy. In his weakened position, Prodi will have difficulty persuade Parliament approve NATO strikes. He will have similar problems pass 1999 budget, which be necessary Italy can cut its lending rates, requirement join single european monetary unit, euro, Jan. 1. Immediately Friday's vote 313-312, tense and times raucous session, Prodi meet President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro submit his resignation and discuss his options. In coming days Scalfaro will consult dozens other leaders ascertain whether Prodi have enough linger support try form new government. If not, president be expect turn another political leader. If no compromise be found, Italy could be plunge early elections. But parties all political stripes may be reluctant push things that far, opinion polls suggest that voters be no more enamored center-right opposition parties they be govern majority. Prodi, economist, be admire his western allies down-to-earth leader who vow tame Italy's bloat economy and reckless government borrowing and actually live his pledge. By raise taxes, lowering interest rates and reduce deficit, Italy meet requirements membership euro last spring, feat that only year be consider impossible german and french economists. Prodi be help healthy global economy and rare consensus industrialists, labor unions and taxpayers, who fear that exclusion euro would condemn Italy Third World status. But his fiscal discipline be not follow reform political system that be inherently fragile. There be more 40 parties Italy, and government's efforts amend constitution introduce two-party system failed. Unless Italian political system changes, Italy be condemn political instability, say Sergio Romano, former diplomat and political science professor. The country need stability and credibility, and that will never happen long government be hang thread. In 1996 Prodi win patchwork quilt center-left factions mostly make Catholic moderates and leftists. He rely fringe Marxist group, Communist Refounding Party, majority low house. And that alliance, fragile beginning, finally fray break point this week. The hard-line leader Communist Refounding, Fausto Bertinotti, say his party would vote 1999 budget and would also end its 28-month-old pact center-left coalition. That position drive moderate wing communist Refounding, worry that vote Prodi would open doors center-right government, split away. But 20-odd deputies who defy Bertinotti be not enough squeeze Prodi through. I be not bitter, Prodi say moments his defeat. even today I receive lot support. In end coup de grace be deliver one his own, member coalition. They have win treachery one single person, Sergio Mattarella, deputy Prodi's coalition, angrily tell reporters, refer Silvio Liotta, member italian Renewal Party. Foreign Minister Lamberto Dini, who head that party, say Liotta would be expelled. Prodi have say he would not govern any other majority center-left one that elect him 1996. But throughout his tenure, he be force seek temporary alliances push major policy decisions. He struggle last try keep his original majority intact. On Thursday, effort woo more moderate Communists his side, prime minister, staunch ally United States, warn that he would oppose NATO strike aim stop serbian violence Kosovo unless U.N. Security Council approve attack. Washington maintain that NATO do not need new U.N. resolution order strike. Premier Romano Prodi say Monday he would appeal directly Parliament Italy's second-longest government World War II, threaten collapse defection its Communist ally. The address Parliament be expect Wednesday, follow perhaps Friday vote confidence that will determine whether Prodi's 2 1/2-year-old, center-left alliance stands or falls. Prodi's far-left ally, Communist Refoundation Party, provoke crisis withdraw its support weekend and say it would not vote his deficit-cutting 1999 budget, which be key Italy's participation European common currency. Prodi have say he would call confidence vote if he lose Communists' support. I've always act coherence, Prodi say morning meeting President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro crisis. I've never change strategy and I don't want do political gymnastics. The break Prodi's government divide Refoundation. Armando Cossutta, leader moderate wing, resign party president Monday. He say party's desertion Prodi be wrong and dangerous, same time promise follow party line. We be very complicated political crisis which could lead early elections, Cossutta tell reporters Monday. And divisions left, this would mean victory right. If crisis come confidence vote and Prodi loses, he would offer his resignation. once he do that, it be Scalfaro decide what do. He could ask Prodi or someone else form new government or he could call elections 2 1/2 years early, something most analysts think unlikely. Working Prodi's favor be fact that few parties think they would stand gain early elections, include communist Refoundation. There be speculation Prodi would reopen negotiations that would win back communists' grudging support, he have manage do past. Prodi's government have hold together this long large part because widely share desire see Italy qualify participation 1999 debut Europe's common currency, euro. That happen earlier this year leave disparate allies so clear reason stay together. Prodi lead Italy's 55th government World War II. He have outlast all Bettino Craxi, who serve 3{ years two back-to-back stints 1983 1987. Refoundation be not part Prodi's center-left coalition, government need its 34 votes muster majority lower house. It have be difficult ally outset. It break Prodi NATO expansion earlier this year and send troops Albania last year. Prodi be force resign year ago bitter battle spending cuts link euro. The crisis be resolved, and Prodi return work, he make steep concessions and promise 35-hour work week. By one vote, Premier Romano Prodi's center-left coalition lose confidence vote Chamber Deputies Friday, and he go presidential palace resign. President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro must now decide whether call early elections or ask Prodi or someone else try forge new majority. The vote low chamber Parliament 313 confidence motion bring government 312 favor. I'm not bitter, Prodi say immediately his government go down. The swing vote come Prodi's coalition, defect deputy Foreign Minister Lamberto Dini's tiny italian Renewal party. The Communist, 6th graf prv It be autumn Italy, birds be go south, and so it seem could italian government, bonds compromise and political opportunism that bind small leftist party government come undone Sunday. The late threat government Prime Minister Romano Prodi come delegate two-day conference Communist Refounding Party vote reject government's propose 1999 budget, imperil future center-left coalition. Officials prime minister's office say Sunday night that Prodi would meet Monday President Oskar Luigi Scalfaro discuss political turbulence, though not offer his resignation. If communist Refounding's parliamentary deputies abide resolution, which pass vote 188-112, it will destabilize Italy's government time when outcome recent election Germany have already inject note uncertainty future european economic and fiscal policy. Mauro Zani, spokesman Democratic Party Left, main party Prodi's coalition, call decision Communist Refounding misfortune entire country. passage budget, he said, be essential avoid disaster. Prodi's coalition be loose alliance former Communists, known Democratic Party Left, and Prodi's moderate Catholic-oriented followers. It be support communist Refounding, fringe group hard-line leftists who break mainstream Communists they overhaul party collapse Communism Eastern Europe. Despite frequent shocks, alliance have hold 1996, glue together mainly desire meet fiscal requirements allow Italy adopt single european currency. As Jan. 1 date approaches introduction new money, euro, Italy must cut its key lending rates bring them line those big european neighbors, Germany. A rate cut italian central bank be generally think hinge passage budget bill. If bill be not passed, negative signals would be send global financial markets that be already upset because financial crises Asia, Russia and Latin America. On Sunday, Prodi's backers be still hop that sufficient number Communist Refounding deputies would break ranks and back budget when it come vote Parliament later this week. If that fails, centrist group that rescue Prodi June similar circumstances and that be lead former President Francesco Cossiga announce it would support budget, thus least assuring parliamentary passage. communist Refounding and its mercurial leader, Fausto Bertinotti, have push Prodi brink twice before. The party force him offer his resignation last year propose budget cuts, then backpeddled party's rank and file protested. In June, hard-line leftists again refuse follow prime minister, that time Parliament vote NATO expansion, government muddle help Cossiga's party.

1001,"The institution explore apartheid's horrors will issue report that find african National Congress shares blame human rights violations it struggle overcome white rule. The 3,500-page report Truth and Reconciliation Commission culminate more two years nationwide hearings. South african media release preliminary findings Monday, three days its official release Thursday Pretoria, capital. The release document be milestone South Africa's transformation white minority rule democracy. The commission, which have power grant amnesty, be task promote reconciliation lay bare what and why apartheid-era atrocities. With ANC now power and facing election mid-1999, condemnation commission could prove damage its electoral chances and moral standing. There have be no doubt that report's overwhelming blame would be lay white governments and their security forces years scrutiny, 1960-1994. Indeed, news reports Monday say Truth Commission would declare apartheid crime humanity and acknowledge that ANC and more radical Pan Africanist Congress be conduct legitimate struggle former apartheid state. But preliminary findings send parties last month, commission also say two movements be morally and politically accountable gross rights violations, South African Press Association and South African Broadcasting Corp. said. The preliminary finding say that ANC policy kill civilians, line military and civilian targets have be blurred, SAPA said. It condemn plant landmines rural areas, execution enemy agents, torture and mistreatment ANC members its exile camps and kill political opponents. It say party must accept responsibility activities ANC Women's League president Winnie Madikizela-Mandela, Nelson Mandela's former wife, and her Mandela United Football Club, accuse killings, torture and kidnappings. The commission also say PAC be guilty deaths civilians its strategy 1993 drive white farmers their land so it could be reclaim blacks. Justice Minister Dullah Omar, meeting journalists Pretoria, would not comment news reports condemnation ANC. I do expect various responses (to report). I do not expect everyone agree. It will lead healthy debate, he said. He say that if commissioners recommend prosecutions anyone abuses, it will be national director prosecutions decide whether proceed. The director be appoint government. The commission's work be design help us establish rule law South Africa, and establish principle accountability, Omar said. The ANC already have prepare ground negative finding, say weeks ago that commission have warn that harsh judgments be offing. The ANC be nervous enough report request meeting commissioners earlier this month. The panel refused, avoid appear biased. On Monday, it reject contempt suggestions ANC officials themselves have leak findings. Constand Viljoen, leader tiny right-wing Freedom Front, say ANC have do so give commission credibility make it more even-handed. Publicly, party have long defend its actions those committed just war. F.W. de Klerk, last apartheid-era president, meanwhile, plan ask court prevent Truth Commission report implicate him cover state-sponsored terror. Obviously we will comply rule court, Omar said, add he would regret any court-ordered delay. face court challenge, Truth and Reconciliation Commission say Wednesday that it would withhold, least temporarily, parts its final report that implicate South Africa's last apartheid-era president, F.W. de Klerk, illegal acts. De Klerk, 62, who help negotiate end South Africa's white supremacist government and share 1993 Nobel Peace Prize President Nelson Mandela that work, have object find commission that he be accessory fact bombings headquarters church group and labor federation 1980s. The chairman 17-member panel, Archbishop Desmond Tutu, say that although he take such action great reluctance, commission need time prepare fight legal challenge. He say it would take de Klerk's name out 3,500-page report avoid delay its release Thursday. It upset me deeply, he say statement. We have be scrupulously fair de Klerk, and we reject contention that we have be engage vendetta him. De Klerk's challenge be only part storm criticism prompt leaks report last few days. Within hours commission decision withdraw its findings de Klerk, it be face possibility new suit this time rule african National Congress. The ANC also want block commission findings its conduct liberation struggle. A spokesman party, Thabo Masebe, say party would seek injunction morning report be officially hand Mandela. While commission's report be expect lay overwhelming blame former white government atrocities, it have also find ANC responsible human-rights violations, include torture and kill spy suspects, bombings civilian areas and kill political enemies, include members rival zulu-based Inkhata Freedom Party. The decision de Klerk seem certain damage commission's credibility. The panel, create way put South Africa's brutal rest expense and political divisiveness trials, have cause controversy start. It have hold more 160 hearings throughout country, listen victims and perpetrators seek amnesty. But many whites say commission be witch hunt aim humiliate former government officials and Afrikaners general. De Klerk have once force commission officials court and win apology them call him liar. Some political analysts say wednesday's events would only far belief that panel lack impartiality. The withdrawal findings can't help be see lack certainty their side, say Sampie Terreblanche, economist and political analyst University Stellenbosch, who have support commission. Whether we it or not, whole report get knock this. De Klerk's spokesman, David Steward, say former president be very confident that he would win when case go trial March. He be very happy be courts now rather deal Truth Commission, Steward said. The fact that they agree withdraw creates definite impression that they specifically concoct case involve Mr. de Klerk negative finding. The ANC have accuse commission try criminalize liberation struggle. Whatever efforts besmirch our struggle denounce it gross violation human rights, congress say statement. The ANC and millions people who be part this struggle will always be proud what they insure that, process destruction vile system, they not themselves resort vile methods struggle basis that mean justified end. There be probably few subjects that get south Africans more excited issue Truth Commission and whether it be worthy cause or waste money. The events last few days have only add debate. For some, Pal Martins, 34, former member ANC's arm wing, fact all sides political spectrum be uproar be good thing. The mere fact that everyone be complain means that Truth Commission have do its work, he said. But say that too many questions be be raise panel's competence. The whole affair be pale, mockery justice, say Roboy Vonholdt, 56-year-old sheep and ostrich farmer who believe that commission have be theatrical act. We should all turn our backs and move forward. We need them and they need us. Let's all make money and let good economic conditions prevail. The commission's report be suppose be broad and detailed summary South Africa's human rights history, 1960 1994, when elections open all races end white minority rule. It will parcel out moral condemnations and recommend individual prosecutions. While de Klerk be alone court Wednesday challenge commission, Tutu say Wednesday that other threaten legal challenges have lead few individuals be name rights violators originally planned. Tutu say that more 400 people have be notify that they would be implicate give them chance respond. Some 15 successfully argue themselves out report or could not be reach and be therefore deleted report, he said. The commission be require law give advance notification anyone it intend implicate its report. The commission have be expect say that although de Klerk not order bombings, he subsequently come know that former Law and Order Minister Adriaan Vlok and Police Commissioner Johan van der Merwe have be involved, failed report his knowledge police. This could open him criminal prosecution. De Klerk have not apply amnesty this matter or any other. de Klerk have say that when he learn bombings, Vlok and Van der Merwe be already process apply amnesty, and he not think it be necessary report matter. A panel investigate apartheid-era atrocities say Wednesday it will not implicate last apartheid president, F.W. de Klerk, human rights abuse he threaten court challenge. De Klerk say he would sue block long-awaited final report Truth and Reconciliation Commission, which be due release Thursday. The man who help negotiate end apartheid object find commission that he be accessory fact bombings 1980s headquarters church group and labor federation. Former Archbishop Desmond Tutu, truth panel's chairman, say commission need time prepare fight legal challenge, and would excise de Klerk's name report avoid delay its release. It upset me deeply, Tutu said. We have be scrupulously fair Mr. de Klerk and we reject contention that we have be engage vendetta him. But we must and will respect courts and his rights constitution. We fight hard those rights and we can be proud South Africa that Mr. de Klerk now shares them, he say statement. All we be do be postpone deal matter, Tutu later tell The Associated Press. The name will eventually appear all hoo-ha have die down. De Klerk, reach London, say he could not comment speak his lawyers because matter be courts. The commission be charge promote reconciliation lay bare apartheid's horrors. It have hold hearings country more two years, listen victims and perpetrators seek amnesty. The release 3,500-page report represent milestone South Africa's transformation white minority rule democracy. De Klerk's challenge be only part storm criticism prompt leaks report. The African National Congress, liberation movement that help defeat apartheid and now run country, Tuesday angrily reject find that it too be guilty human rights violations its arm struggle. The report will be broad and detailed summary South Africa's human rights history, 1960 1994, when all-race elections end white minority rule. It will parcel out moral condemnations and recommend individual prosecutions. other threaten legal challenges have lead few individuals be name rights violators planned, The Star Johannesburg report Wednesday. In comment newspaper report, Tutu say that more 400 people have be notify they would be implicate give them chance respond. only 15 successfully argue themselves out report, he said. Criminal prosecutions atrocities commit war white rule could drag least six years, top prosecutor say Monday. Key figures implicate human rights abuse Truth and Reconciliation Commission already be investigation, official, Jan d'oliveira, tell reporters. They include two unnamed generals apartheid state's security apparatus, President Nelson Mandela's ex-wife Winnie Madikizela-Mandela and officials African National Congress, he said. The remarks d'oliveira, who recently be appoint deputy national director prosecutions, be clear signal that criminal cases would be bring figures accuse commission gross human rights violations. The commission release its report Oct. 30. It chronicle human rights abuses commit apartheid governments and their operatives well African National Congress and fight racist system. The issue continue prosecutions be significant. many feel that drag criminal reckonings horrors apartheid era will only prolong bitterness and delay reconciliation. But supporters prosecution feel that deny justice victims be bad evil. On practical level, highly public prosecutions ANC figures could have impact national elections next year, when party will seek consolidate its hold power. The panel's chairman, Archbishop Desmond Tutu, have call two-year time limit prosecutions; d'oliveira call period wholly impractical. The prosecutor not name other targets. We have always work principle that we will prosecute high rank, he said. The commission have ability grant amnesty those who admit their misdeeds and be find have act political motives. The report say individuals who have not seek amnesty should be prosecuted. Madikizela-Mandela have not seek amnesty. The commission find her accountable human rights violations commit her bodyguards, who report say kill and torture suspected opponents. Madikizela-Mandela be convict 1991 kidnapping and be accessory assault four young men. She be sentence six years jail, pay dlrs 3,200 fine appeal. The ANC official be most prominent anti-apartheid activists. The two generals be implicate Truth Commission testimony. Prosecutors be ready move forward pending amnesty application one. Torturers and bombers who carry out atrocities defend or fight apartheid need counsel ensure they do not repeat their crimes, expert South Africa's reconciliation body say Thursday. Addressing local and international experts, Charles Villa-Vicencio, research head Truth and Reconciliation Commission, say ignore psychological needs those who carry out human rights abuses could alienate potentially dangerous sector society. We must give attention heal perpetrators, not just sake perpetrators, sake nation whole, he said. The conference, organize Medical Research Council, be examine mental health issues raise Truth Commission, which be charge probe crimes commit all sides anti-apartheid struggle. As commission prepares hand its final report end month, South Africans be examine its painful and traumatic exploration their bloody past. With power grant amnesty many who tortured, bomb or maim innocent civilians, process have some stage anger people nearly all walks life. many whites see panel favor black liberation movements, while many blacks accuse it be too soft former state officials, especially top rank ministers. However, Villa-Vicencio appeal tolerance deal all those who have commit crimes, say that potential wrongdoing exist everyone. We all, entire human race, carry us capacity evil, he said. many Thursday's speakers touch figure police death squad leader Eugene de Kock, who be give jail terms total more 200 years kill spree that cost dozens lives. De Kock have apply amnesty his crimes. Dan Stein, specialist neurobiology and stress disorders, say de Kock typify many killers all sides conflict his sheer banality evil. many people have find him interviews be ordinary, likeable person, he say man whom subordinate dub Prime Evil. Ginn Fourie, physiotherapist whose student daughter be gun black activists 1993 attack Cape Town bar, say it be necessary help those whose circumstances compel them do wrong. struggle control her tears, Fourie tell delegates she have attend amnesty hearings her daughter's killers and support their successful bid be free long jail sentences. After describe how she hug three members black nationalist pan-africanist Congress and urge them seek counsel together their victims, Fourie earn stand ovation 50-strong audience. We must take initiative understanding and start process reconciliation and heal our broken land, she said, her voice shake emotion. The New York Times say editorial Sunday, Nov. 1: The 3,500-page report South African Truth and Reconciliation Commission, release Thursday, be most comprehensive and unsparing examination nation's ugly that any such commission have produced. Drawing commission's investigations and testimony hundreds applicants amnesty and 20,000 victims, report be detailed look crimes apartheid era, and blames successive white governments vast majority. It have fulfil its mandate telling full truth possible, which be one reason that every political party South Africa have denounce it. Besides accuse government assassinations and bombings, report criticize Inkatha Freedom Party its massacres and collaboration security forces, and blames African National Congress murder civilians and other crimes. It single out former President P.W. Botha, Chief Mangosuthu Buthelezi, Inkatha leader, and Winnie Mandela, others, detail treatment their roles political crimes. One major flaw report be absence section accuse F.W. de Klerk, last apartheid president, know several bombings fact and keep silent. It be excise because de Klerk be sue commission. The ANC also sued, unsuccessfully, stop publication. The lawsuits be disappoint sign that South Africa's political parties be not interested honest look their past, nor free flow information. The controversy have add widespread complaints that commission have not help process reconciliation. This be wrong. True reconciliation which occur when society be no long paralyzed and people can work and live together cannot be base silence. No society can be restore health paper much pain South Africans have suffered. A noisy and informed debate complicity crimes apartheid era be necessary, if uncomfortable. The report be only part Truth Commission's contribution heal process. The hearings themselves, which allow victims human rights violations tell their stories public, help country heal and open eyes many whites unpleasant truth apartheid. The amnesty process, while permit many important criminals escape justice, be allow families know exactly what happen their loved ones dozens cases that would likely have never go trial South Africa's fragile judicial system. The process help victims scholarships and other necessary aid go on, although it will not be enough. No commission can transform society twist South Africa's was. But Truth Commission be best effort world have seen, and South Africa be better it. The deal that South Africa's Truth and Reconciliation Commission offer be simple enough: Confess your crimes, apply amnesty and you will go free. If you don't come forward, you will be prosecuted. After more two years hearings apartheid-era atrocities, commission last week unveil 3,500-page report name dozens people it believe be their elbows gore never apply amnesty. So prosecutions should begin soon, right? not so fast. The study be barely hands President Nelson Mandela talk new amnesty deals have begun. It seem that nearly all South Africa's political parties include rule african National Congress have key officials who could end dock because report. Suddenly, there be lots talk how country can't withstand politically divisive trials, and many political analysts here be bet that agreement mutual benefit be offing. Already, three major political parties be call some kind new amnesty, and ANC isn't close door. ANC spokesman Thabo Masebe say it be premature talk general amnesty, he acknowledge that party be discuss amnesty specifically tailored violence black South Africans other blacks that litter KwaZulu/Natal province bodies late '80s and '90s. In choose truth commission rather Nuremberg-style trial which close out its brutal past, South Africa hop idealistic reconciliation. People would come clean and receive true forgiveness. Society would then be able move on, its wounds cleanse and healed. It be model watch closely world other societies wonder how disentangle themselves grudges brutal past. But give chance, hundreds South Africa's perpetrators not come forward. Commission officials themselves say they be frustrate lack cooperation, however exhaustive their report may seem. It be perhaps too late, however, press more. Today's South Africa have urgent new problems deal unemployment, crime, white flight, too few schools and hospitals. So it may wind settle more pragmatic reconciliation one that give amnesty unrepentant simply because it's more practical all concern move on. In recent years, truth commissions have gain popularity many places, notably Chile, Argentina and El Salvador. But South Africa's big and most powerful, able grant amnesty and subpoena witnesses be suppose be real test. Certainly commission force nation see gruesome details its past, sobbing survivors and stone-faced torturers tell smash genitals and suffocations. And commission's work add much knowledge what happen South Africa 1960 and 1994. But it will be years effect commission can truly be judged. Has anyone really forgiven anyone else? Will vendettas persist? No one can answer. One thing seem clear, however: Four years South Africa hold its first non-racial elections, grow number South Africans want be do past. Raymond Louw, publisher respect weekly newsletter, Southern Africa Report, say new amnesty proposal could come February session Parliament, time remove issue next year's election campaigns. You simply can't have this country tear apart prosecutions, he says. everybody be go be howl amnesty. They already are. even Archbishop Desmond Tutu, commission's chairman, deliver report, he seem be anticipate push new amnesty and argue it. He say such move would be highly unfair those who come forward. He suggest instead that there be two-year time limit, which anyone not indict would effect get amnesty. To be sure, there will be opposition any proposals limit prosecutions. more dozen human rights and victims advocacy groups have already band together condemn such proposals unconscionable. The idea Truth Commission emerge compromise long negotiations that bring South Africa's peaceful transition white supremacist state non-racial democracy. During talks, white National Party government push blanket amnesty, and ANC refused. In end, only 250 former police officers come forward, most them foot soldiers. And only two high National Party officials, former Law and Order Minister Adriaan Vlok and Police Commissioner Johan van der Merwe, confess roles order bombings. In its report, commission call apartheid state primary perpetrator gross human rights violations and hold such high rank former officials former President P.W. Botha, his former army chief, Georg Meiring, and former intelligence chief, Niel Barnard, responsible. These men, and low rank, have not apply amnesty For ANC, most embarrassing prospect be possible prosecution Mandela's former wife, Winnie Madikizela-Mandela, who be accuse report take part number assaults and abductions. lesser-known officials could face charges too. The ANC be hold responsible least 76 deaths KwaZulu/Natal. The ANC's problems be far complicate its efforts make peace largely zulu-based Inkatha Freedom Party. Virtually no one that party come forward ask amnesty. Yet report find that Inkatha, work white government, be responsible widespread slaughter KwaZulu/Natal and townships Johannesburg. Inkatha's leader, Chief Mangosuthu Buthelezi, and many key party officials stand accuse foment wide range abuses. But prosecute Chief Buthelezi could lead new warfare KwaZulu. Part reluctance go forward prosecutions may be result still another factor: The judicial system be already overwhelmed rise crime and evidence apartheid era be old. so why spend time and money? At moment, only one political party be oppose any form new amnesty tiny influential democratic Party, liberal group that be not involved violence. Its head, Tony Leon, say new amnesty would only prove that more thuglike your behavior, more you get away with. But he concede that his be lonely voice. At this point, he says, there be little enthusiasm anything close book past. A panel probe apartheid-era abuses have accuse African National Congress human rights violations, include torture and bomb attacks, state broadcaster say Monday. The ANC, which lead struggle white rule and now be power, previously have acknowledge it be tell expect implication right violations. The Truth and Reconciliation Commission will release its final report 2 1-2 years investigation Thursday. The report be expect place overwhelm blame era's abuse white governments and their brutal security services. President Nelson Mandela's office receive advance copy Monday ahead handover ceremony, when retire Archbishop Desmond Tutu, who chair comission, will present Mandela report. South African Broadcasting Corp. radio say it have be leak preliminary document which condemn ANC politically and morally responsible gross human rights violations and fall apartheid. An ANC spokesman, Thabo Masebe, say he believe news report refer commission letter send advance inform us its intention implicate ANC gross human rights violations. Commission officials could not immediately be reach comment. Justice Minister Dullah Omar tell journalists Pretoria he have hear news report, would not comment. Former President F.W. de Klerk, meanwhile, plans ask court prevent Truth Commission report implicate him cover state-sponsored terror. Obviously we will comply rule court, Omar said, add he would regret any court-ordered delay. The ANC be nervous enough report request meeting commissioners earlier this month. The panel refused, avoid appear embarrassed. The party say accusations it likely would center plant land mines border farms, abuse its military camps Angola and bombings. Omar say he expect report's conclusions set debate add it would lay basis reconciliation. President Nelson Mandela acknowledge Saturday African National Congress violate human rights apartheid, set him odds his deputy president report that have divide much South Africa. The disagreement stem Thursday's release report Truth and Reconciliation Commission horrors commit apartheid. Rather act salve and aid reconciliation, report have cause divisiveness, former comrades-in-arms who fight apartheid. As expected, report call apartheid crime humanity. But it also blame ANC gross human rights violations its anti-apartheid struggle, say group torture suspected spies and dissidents and kill innocent civilians land mines and bombs. Some suspected traitors be kill ANC's camps abroad. Mbeki who become ANC president last year and will likely be elect South Africa's next president 1999 when Mandela retire take hard line Saturday report, and indicate all ANC members must do same. No member, 5th graf, 1st ld-writethru follow be excerpts final report issue South Africa's Truth and Reconciliation Commission Thursday: PRIMARY FINDING On basis evidence available it, primary find Commission be that: The predominant portion gross violations human rights be commit former state its security and law-enforcement agencies. Moreover, South african state period late 1970's early 1990's become involved activities criminal nature when, amongst other things, it knowingly planned, undertook, condone and cover commission unlawful acts, include extrajudicial kill political opponents and others, and South Africa.

From nation Tuesday, gay leaders stress that campus homophobia be not restrict college towns Rocky Mountain West. last year, survey almost 4,000 Massachusetts high school students, 22 percent gay respondents say they skip school month because they felt unsafe school, and 31 percent say they have be threaten or injure school year. These percentages be five times great percentages heterosexual respondents. The survey be conduct 58 high schools Massachusetts Department Education.

The study be conduct this year Karen Franklin, forensic psychologist who be researcher University Washington. Surveys gay college students conduct late 1980s Yale University, Oberlin College, Rutgers University and Penn State find that 16 percent 26 percent have be threaten violence, and that 40 percent 76 percent have be verbally harassed, say National Gay and Lesbian Task Force, lobby group base Washington. last year, student group Des Moines, Iowa, call concerned Students, record hallway and classroom conversations five high schools 10 homophobia record day.

His death, announce Poudre Valley Hospital here, fan outrage that follow word last week's attack, spawn nationwide vigils, produce call federal hate-crimes legislation President Clinton and fuel debates such laws host western states, include Wyoming, that have resist them. From Denver University Maryland, people turn out honor The slight, soft-spoken 21-year-old Shepard, freshman University Wyoming, who become overnight symbol anti-gay violence he be find dangle fence passerby. Two men and two women have be charge case. The men be charge attempt murder and be expect face first-degree murder charges that could bring death penalty. There be incredible symbolism be tie fence, say Rebecca Isaacs, political director National Gay and Lesbian Task Force Washington. People have liken it scarecrow. But it sound more crucifixion. Gay leaders hope and christian conservatives fear that Shepard's death will galvanize Congress and state legislatures pass hate-crime legislation or broaden exist laws. Conservatives generally oppose such laws because they favor one group's rights another. In last two decades, 21 states and District Columbia have pass laws that increase penalties crimes that be commit because person's race, religion, color, national origin, and sexual orientation. Another 19 states, include Colorado, do not include sexual orientation their hate-crime laws. Ten states, include Wyoming, have no hate-crime laws all. In Washington, Clinton respond news Shepard's death urge Congress pas federal Hate Crimes Protection Act, which would make federal offenses crimes base sex, disability and sexual orientation. Wyoming have be one nation's holdouts, reject three hate crimes bills 1994, most recently February. But Monday, Shepard's death, Gov. Jim Geringer appeal lawmakers reconsider their opposition. I ask collective suggestion anti-bias, anti-hate legislation that can be present Wyoming Legislature their consideration January, Geringer said. The governor meet Monday morning Dennis Shepard, slay student's father, and say that elder Shepard not want his son's death become media circus and that we should not use Matt further agenda. Geringer say that Shepard's father also said: Don't rush just pass all kinds new hate-crimes laws. Be very careful any changes and be sure you're not take away rights process race this. Leaders gay rights groups interview Monday say they would respect family's privacy not attend burial Casper, Wyo., Saturday. But they add that they hop death would have impact legislators nation. Matthew's death, I hope, will bring good and deep understand hate crime laws, say Elizabeth Birch, executive director Human Rights Campaign, lesbian and gay rights group that have 250,000 members. Matthew's death may lead awaken Wyoming and United States Congress need this legislation. In 1996, 21 men and women be kill United States because their sexual orientation, accord Southern Poverty Law Center, Alabama group that track violence minorities. accord FBI, sexual orientation be factor 11.6 percent 8,759 hate crimes record 1996. But Christian conservatives warn that gay leaders want use Shepard's death expand hate rights laws and curtail freedom speech. Hate crimes laws have nothing do perpetrators violent crime and everything do silence political opposition, say Steven Schwalm, analyst Family Research Council, Washington group dedicate defend faith, family and freedom. It would criminalize pro-family beliefs, Schwalm said. This basically send message that you can't disagree political message homosexual activists. Agreement come John Paulk, who be feature this summer series advertisements how he and his wife, Anne, overcame homosexuality religious conversion. We have every right speak out agenda that be contrary Biblical norms, say Paulk, who describe himself homosexuality specialist Focus Family, Christian group Colorado Springs, Colo. Because we be stand and oppose homosexual agenda, we be be look advocate violence homosexuals, when we categorically reject violence homosexuals. last Thursday, Family Research Council unveil series television advertisements that preach heal homosexuality religious conversion. Gay leaders charge that these advertisements help create hostile climate homosexuals, climate that can lead violence. Hate crime laws that be books 40 states have not impinge freedom speech, say Brian Levin, criminal justice professor who direct Center Hate and Extremism Stockton College, Pomona, N.J. Instead, he said, hate crime laws send clear message that society do not tolerate attacks minorities. We want deter broken windows and simple assaults they escalate, he said. refer murders homosexuals, he added: These crimes be preventable. Offenders get embolden if they be not punish first time. Levin say that his research indicate that homosexuals suffer high rates violent crime population large. He also say that roughly half people who attack homosexuals be male, age 22 or younger. The two men charge kill Shephard be white, Russell Henderson, 21, and Aaron McKinney, 22. With other crimes, violence be mean end. With hate crimes, violence become unstoppable goal, Levin said. Shepard suffer dozen cuts head, face and neck, well massive blow back his skull. Because their social stature society, gays be view appropriate targets, Levin added. cite need hate crime laws send clear message gay bashers, Levin said: The discourse society leave many these people believe that what they be do be socially acceptable. While some gay leaders saw crucifixion imagery Shepard's death, saw different symbolism: Old West practice nail dead coyote ranch fence warn future intruders. This University Wyoming student be beat and leave die, tie fence animal because he be honest and open be gay, Beatrice Dorhn, legal director Lambda Legal Defense and Education Fund, say Monday, Matthew Shepard's horrible suffering and death cannot be dismiss simply fault deranged, isolate individuals. His attackers be millions Americans who constantly hear message that gay people be not worthy most basic equal treatment, Ms. Dorhn said. On same day Americans learn last week that Matthew Shepard, 5-foot-2, 105-pound gay college student, have be tortured, strung animal and leave die fence Laramie, Wyo., Family Research Council be co-hosting press conference washington. It be late salvo six-month campaign religious right, tacit, explicit, approval Republican leaders, demonize gay people political gain this election year. This particular press conference be announce new barrage ads tv follow-up summer print campaign which allege former homosexuals who have change implore do likewise power Jesus Christ. The commercials, gooey style, end slogan: It's not hate ... It's hope. But it's really stir fear that produce hate. If these ads be truly aim gay people, they wouldn't be broadcast extravagant cost wide general audience reach TV, and they wouldn't be trumpet Washington, insure free national exposure, three weeks Election Day. The ads themselves, sugar-coating hope, ooze malice. In one them, homosexuality be link drug addiction and certain death AIDS; all them implicitly posit that homosexuality be itself disease need cure. Matthew Shepard have now be cured, that's sure. As his uncle, R.W. Eaton, tell The Denver Post, 21-year-old Matt, who aspire career diplomacy and human rights, be small person big heart, mind and soul that someone try beat out him. Of his nephew's shatter body Eaton said, It's something you might see war. And war it is. Go Family Research Council's Web site and you will find proud description its readiness wage war homosexual agenda and fight maintain traditional meaning `family.' The head Family Research Council be Gary Bauer, GOP power broker and putative presidential candidate, who disingenuously go talk shows say that his organization hat no one and deplore violence. But if you wage well-financed media air war which people innate difference sexual orientation be ceaselessly brand sinful and diseased and un-american seekers special rights, ground war will follow. It's story old history. Once any group be successfully scapegoated subhuman threat normal values propaganda machine, embolden thugs take over. Two weeks James Byrd be savagely drag his death pickup truck Texas June, I write column ugly incident GOP state convention Fort Worth, where mob threaten group gay Log Cabin Republicans who be protest discriminatory treatment their party. The gay-bashers have be directly precede steady saber-rattling Republican politicians: Sen.

Gay leaders hope and christian conservatives fear that Shepard's death will galvanize Congress and state legislatures pass hate-crime legislation or broaden exist laws. Conservatives generally oppose such laws because they favor one group's rights another. In last two decades, 21 states and District Columbia have pass laws that increase penalties crimes that be commit because person's race, religion, color, national origin, and sexual orientation. Another 19 states, include Colorado, do not include sexual orientation their hate-crime laws. Ten states, include Wyoming, have no hate-crime laws all. In Washington, Clinton respond news Shepard's death urge Congress pas federal Hate Crimes Protection Act, which would make federal offenses crimes base sex, disability and sexual orientation.

Hate crime laws that be books 40 states have not impinge freedom speech, say Brian Levin, criminal justice professor who direct Center Hate and Extremism Stockton College, Pomona, N.J. Instead, he said, hate crime laws send clear message that society do not tolerate attacks minorities. We want deter broken windows and simple assaults they escalate, he said. refer murders homosexuals, he added: These crimes be preventable. Offenders get embolden if they be not punish first time. Levin say that his research indicate that homosexuals suffer high rates violent crime population large. He also say that roughly half people who attack homosexuals be male, age 22 or younger. With other crimes, violence be mean end. With hate crimes, violence become unstoppable goal, Levin said. Shepard suffer dozen cuts head, face and neck, well massive blow back his skull. Because their social stature society, gays be view appropriate targets, Levin added. cite need hate crime laws send clear message gay bashers, Levin said: The discourse society leave many these people believe that what they be do be socially acceptable.

Erez open talks various party leaders Monday. He get support center-right leader Mesut Yilmaz, who say his party support Erez long he have Ecevit's backing. As long our sensitivity secular, democratic regime be take account, we will do our best help form new government and ensure it get vote confidence, Ecevit say his talks Erez. Turkey's strongly secular military be oppose any deal that would bring Virtue power. It pressured Virtue's predecessor, Welfare Party, out power last year. Erez be suppose talk Tuesday center-right Tansu Ciller and Deniz Baykal, who lead center-left party. I be more and more optimistic every meeting, Erez tell reporters meet party leaders. Turkey have be try form new government coalition government lead Yilmaz collapse last month allegations that he rig sale bank. Yilmaz be now act premier. A week turkish government fell corruption scandal, President Suleyman Demirel Wednesday ask veteran left-wing politician know his personal honesty, Bulent Ecevit, form new government. Ecevit, who serve prime minister three times 1970s, say he would immediately begin work fashion government that could command majority faction-ridden Parliament. He also suggest that although Parliament have set April 18 date new election, he might seek remain power longer period. It be wrong see this government simply election government, he said. There be problems that will not wait election. Military commanders, who hold ultimate power Turkey, have quietly tell senior political figures, include Demirel, that they do not want quick election. They fear it will produce Parliament just divide present one, perhaps Islamic-oriented Virtue Party large bloc. The commanders be also hop exclude two country's lead politicians, outgo Prime Minister Mesut Yilmaz and former Prime Minister Tansu Ciller, neither whom they trust, posts new government. Ecevit must now try build government that include their center-right parties not them individuals. In meeting this week country's senior policy-making body, National Security Council, which military officers have strong say, set three priorities come months. It say that government emerge forthcoming negotiations should dedicate itself fight religious fundamentalism, Kurdish nationalism and criminal gangs that have infiltrate state apparatus. Among Ecevit's immediate challenges will be resolve political crisis Italy that break out last month when Kurdish rebel leader Abdullah Ocalan be arrest Rome and then ask political asylum there. Turkey want Ocalan send here trial, Italy say it cannot extradite him long Turkey retain death penalty. Ecevit (pronounced EH-che-vit) be few senior turkish politicians who favor abolition capital punishment. Together Demirel, Ecevit be cite Turks who complain continued dominance geriatric political elite here. He be 73 and have be politics most his adult life. Early his career Ecevit emerge spokesman Turkey's downtrodden masses. perhaps more any other figure, he legitimize social democratic ideology climate where leftist sympathies be consider subversive. At same time, however, he have show himself be fierce nationalist. He be prime minister when Turkey send troops occupy northern Cyprus 1974 and be still consider hard-liner Cyprus. He be also uncompromising his opposition Kurdish nationalism. During his terms prime minister 1970s, Ecevit successfully undermine efforts move Turkey membership European Union, then call european Economic Community. He consider it instrument capitalist exploitation. Ecevit have also disturb United States flirt anti-western ideologies. In early 1990s, interval when he work journalist, he travel Iraq and write series articles favorable Saddam Hussein. He recently call good relations Turkey and Iraq, and maintain some anti-imperialist positions and suspicion capitalism that he develop 1960s. The democratic Socialist Party, which Ecevit heads, be closely hold family fiefdom. He and his wife carefully screen applicants membership and veto those whose personal loyalty Ecevit be suspect. During his terms prime minister '70s, Ecevit not appear be consensus builder, say Ilter Turan, professor political science Bilgi University Istanbul. It seem that nowadays he be more accommodating, so that perspective he may not be bad choice. On many issues that turkish society be encounter now, he represent orientation which do not seem be totally tune times, Turan said. That would include his position issues privatization, integrate Turkey more fully international system, and devolution central authority. He have fail grasp where world be heading. He look and analyzes world categories that be no longer useful or appropriate. Almost alone turkish politicians, Ecevit live modestly and have avoid any hint personal or financial scandal. He speak fluent English, and his reading tastes run poetry and intellectual journals such The New York Review Books. He have translate works T.S. Eliot Turkish and publish several volumes his poems. Opposition parties lodge no-confidence motions Wednesday Prime Minister Mesut Yilmaz allegations he interfere privatization bank and help businessman link mobster. Yilmaz' minority government could go if the small, center-left Republican Party, which give him majority he need parliament, votes him. The leader Republicans, Deniz Baykal, urge Yilmaz resign. But premier vow Wednesday stay on, say he be victim conspiracy. This be plot and it can't be reason resignation, Yilmaz said, add that he intend continue struggle organize crime. Afterward, Baykal say Republicans would support no-confidence motion. The leader democratic Turkey Party, Husamettin Cindoruk, say his party might withdraw govern coalition. He say party would announce its decision Thursday. The political turmoil send Istanbul stock market plunge 14.9 percent. Premier-designate Bulent Ecevit say Thursday he would persist difficult task convince key party leader join forces secular coalition. Ecevit, who be ask form new government Wednesday, desperately need support 99 deputies ex-premier Tansu Ciller's center-right party. Ecevit, veteran leftist, already have support another center-right party lead Mesut Yilmaz, whose government collapse last week weight mafia scandal. Mrs. Ciller have not say if she would back ecevit-led government and her long-standing rivalry Yilmaz make Ecevit's job coalition-building difficult. I don't give that easily, neither do I lose hope that easily, Ecevit tell his parliamentary group Thursday. Mrs. Ciller could lose grassroot support if she stand way new government, political columnist Ertugrul Ozkok write Thursday daily Hurriyet. This could put her odds her classic support base. Ecevit be expect meet Yilmaz Thursday, and other party leaders Friday. Turkey's secular parties be pressure join forces keep Islamic Virtue Party out power. Virtue be large party Parliament, all-powerful military be fiercely opposed islamic-led government. President Suleyman Demirel appear likely turn some widely trust lawmaker form Turkey's next government, veteran politician abandon efforts Monday persuade bicker political leaders support him pro-secular coalition. Bulent Ecevit Democratic Left Party fail 3-week-old attempt form government that could command majority votes parliament. It be now clear that no party leader can form government that can win vote confidence, former Premier Mesut Yilmaz say talks Demirel. We have tell president that we will not hamper appointment deputy Parliament. With party leaders unable overcome differences, new premier-designate would most probably be affiliate party be trust enough other parties follow independent line. Parliament Speaker Hikmet Cetin have be suggest likely candidate. The new appointment would be make days, Yilmaz tell reporters. Demirel consult Turkey's party leaders immediately Ecevit give up. Most declare themselves favor government lead lawmaker. only center-right leader Tansu Ciller say she want government lead party leader, and make clear she be willing take task. Turkey's parliament be split longstanding animosity its center-left and center-right parties.

Kopp, accord police records and abortion rights groups, have move country series protest abortion clinics, and have be link underground manual that describe methods kill or maim doctors who perform abortions. Denise O'Donnell, U.S. attorney western district New York, say Kopp be not consider suspect this time be believe have information material case. She decline give details what evidence be be seek Kopp, describe it only information that be contain sealed affidavit whose disclosure would compromise ongoing investigation. Ms. O'Donnell say that federal law allow arrest warrant material witness when person have information that be important case. If Kopp be found, he would be arrested, bring Buffalo and order provide require evidence, Ms. O'Donnell said. Then, most likely, individual would be released. Slepian, 52, be shoot sniper fire his home Oct. 23, shortly return even service his synagogue. He be stand his kitchen his wife and one his four sons when bullet crash back window. He die two hours later. Law enforcement officials say Wednesday's announcement material witness warrant be part attempt underscore potential danger anti-abortion violence advance Remembrance Day, Canadian holiday that fall Nov. 11 and that authorities have associate some anti-abortion crimes. At same time, Justice Department and FBI be try find ways step federal response violence abortion clinics aftermath slepian killing. The officials say that Attorney General Janet Reno would soon announce that Justice Department, aim heighten visibility federal role cases that cross state and local jurisdictional boundaries, would revive national investigative effort focus abortion clinic violence. Ms. Reno and senior FBI officials, include Robert Bryant, deputy FBI director, have meet physician and abortion rights groups recent days discuss ways enhance federal investigative efforts and coordination local agencies. Federal authorities first organize abortion clinic task force 1995 kill Florida doctor. The unit, which be charge investigate whether national conspiracy existed, spend nearly two years study abortion clinic violence. The unit disband uncovering national conspiracy. Law enforcement officials say that unit's operation help reduce violence abortion clinics and that, part, decision re-establish it be prompt Ms. Reno's desire send renew message anti-abortion extremists that government would aggressively investigate these crimes. Slepian's murder fit pattern four early sniper attacks abortion doctors Canada and western New York, date 1994. none attacks have be solved. Bernard Tolbert, special agent charge FBI Buffalo, say news conference here Wednesday that investigators have not determine whether there be link five killings. There's possibility they could be linked, certainly no information, he said. Tolbert give little information subject material-witness warrant, say that Kopp's black 1987 Chevrolet Cavalier, Vermont license plate BPE216, be see Slepian's home begin several weeks murder. We don't have any idea where he is, Tolbert say Kopp. We be look him every place we can, every place he might be. A photograph Kopp take January 1997 have be distribute law enforcement agencies United States and Canada. The National Abortion Federation have send out advisory clinics country search Kopp, say Melinda DuBois, assistant director Womenservices, clinic where slepian worked. She say name Kopp material witness case have not bring relief nurses and other workers clinic. I don't think it make me or anyone else clinic feel differently, she said. I don't want anybody relax and say, `oh God, they get guy.' That's easy happen. I still want people be very vigilant. The clinic be last Buffalo area that be perform abortions. Slepian be one only handful doctors Buffalo who be still willing perform procedure face pickets, protesters and threats. Since his death, doctors Buffalo have come clinic continue provide abortion services. Rosina Lotempio be stand abortion clinics here Operation Rescue storm town 1992 rowdy Spring Life rallies, which hundreds be arrested. She be there Lambs Christ demonstrators come town 1993. She be sidewalk Buffalo GYN Womenservices morning Oct. 23, 12 hours Barnett Slepian, clinic doctor, be fatally shot his home. And she be there Friday, brown rosary beads her hands, small gold cross chain her neck, quietly pray abortions stop. I'm heartbroken when I have come here, Mrs. Lotempio, 58, say she stand cold, wear small black earmuffs and white turtleneck adorn tiny silver pin baby feet. It's very difficult out here; I depend God, she said, pray several moments decide whether talk reporter. The bombings, fiery rhetoric abortion opponents and posters bloody fetuses may capture attention news media, people Mrs. Lotempio be foot soldiers abortion battle. They call themselves street counselors and come clinic whenever they believe abortions be be performed. They pray and they talk women, hop change their minds. Some scream profanities. Others, Mrs. Lotempio, denounce not only violence doctors and clinics, also block doors and shout ugly epithets clinic workers and patients. For approximately 80 abortion opponents here, their protest be more job political activity. There be schedule. People count them show up. Mrs. Lotempio, mother three and grandmother six, connect her involvement conversation 1970s which she help friend decide abort unwanted pregnancy. Two decades later, she be haunt her question: whether fetus be male or female. I just felt horrible and I felt guilty, she said, tears her eyes. I think that if I be clinic do something, I could make that baby's life. During Mrs. Lotempio's 8 a.m.-to-10 a.m. shift Friday, dozen people circle area front Buffalo clinic, say Hail Mary. Others take her spot Tuesdays and Wednesdays. She return Saturdays, when 40 people crowd sidewalk. Similar bands protesters march front abortion clinics throughout United States, and local protesters be join bands people who roam country. At clinic Main Street, north downtown Buffalo, there be odd sense community. Local protesters greet Dick, security guard, name. They sometimes see enemy abortion-rights volunteers who escort patients and out clinic supermarket or soccer field. Robert Behn, one protest leaders, spend two hours talk abortion breakfast last year Slepian. And several say they cry when they hear Slepian's death. Most protesters, include Mrs. Lotempio, be thousands people arrest here 1992, height anti-abortion activity Buffalo. But if Operation Rescue returns, planned, Spring Life reunion April, Mrs. Lotempio said, she will not be there. Instead, she plan stay church and pray, avoid militancy she say she find uncomfortable. Glenn Murray, lawyer Womenservices clinic, said: When people out town show up, that be when we feel most danger. The local people be know quantity. We know most local people name. Buffalo have be handful hot spots abortion protesters last decade. It be heavily Catholic city where thousands protesters country demonstrate two weeks 1992. They fail close abortion clinics, 500 people be arrest rallies that snarl traffic and draw national headlines. Those rallies, well earlier protests and continue sidewalk vigils, have have impact, people sides abortion issue say. The number clinics perform abortions Buffalo area have drop one three. And Slepian's death and retirement this week another doctor, there be only two doctors area whom abortions form significant part their practices. The daily demonstrators count this progress. But their perch clinic mean they witness far more what they believe be murders what they call rescues. About 30 women day might go clinic. After eight years, Mrs. Lotempio can count eight women who change their minds and not get abortions while she be clinic. Inside clinic, protests just make hard job harder, many clinic workers say. While some demonstrators simply repeat rosary, other protesters call out patients they drive park lot building, or walk fortresslike front. They ask questions do you know what your baby look like? or be it boy or girl? sometimes they accuse people murder and torture and sin, or threaten them damnation. Federal law bars protesters come 15 feet clinic entrances, and leaning signs its walls. Some push limits, frustrate clinic workers and guards. The rules protect people physical harassment, because distance, they turn what could be quiet conversations catcalls and taunts. When patient go clinic, protesters take different persona, say Melinda DuBois, director Buffalo clinic. They scream and yell and call us names. They lie. Some days we're immune it, other days it's just too much. Linda Palm, 51, march clinic Friday, say she identify clinic patients. When she be 23, she said, she struggle difficulties be unmarried and pregnant herself, decide have her child, and marry father. She begin protest 1990, attend abortion protest march Albany. While veterans and civic leaders devote Wednesday's national holiday honor fall soldiers, Remembrance Day have become chill vigil Canadians front lines abortion-rights movement. There be immediate fear, because anti-abortion gunman be believe be large. And there be long-term anxiety, because this country where abortions be legal and publicly funded, women may find access diminishing. There be speculation sniper's timing be link Remembrance Day because some anti-abortion activists use day commemorate abort fetuses. Three times 1994, sniper have use this time year fire home Canadian doctor who perform abortion, each time wound target. The attacks be spread Canada Ontario, Manitoba and British Columbia. U.S. and canadian investigators now believe those attacks be link two shootings abortion-providing doctors upstate New York, include Oct. 23 slay Dr. Barnett Slepian his home Buffalo. An american anti-abortion activist, James Kopp, be want question shootings. Police say they don't know which side border he be on, fuel uneasiness clinics and hospitals throughout Canada. You must realize Canada have large undefended border world, say Keith McCaskill, police inspector Winnipeg, Manitoba, and spokesman investigation. many women's clinics have tighten security, and doctors who provide abortions have be urge take precautions. I would suggest they be extremely aware their day-to-day goings on, whether their business day or hours, say Toronto Detective Rick Stubbings. Across Canada, there have be reports obstetrician-gynecologists modify their practices or decide stop performing abortions. Some wear bulletproof vests and hang sheets windows their homes. Abortion-rights groups say most doctors be not back down. There's great deal sadness, say Susan Fox, director clinic Edmonton, Alberta, that provide abortions. But there's also feel determination that we won't be deter or scar these actions. Marilyn Wilson, executive director canadian Abortion Rights Action League, see long-term threat because fear violence may intimidate young doctors enter field. There be almost no doctors who have stop perform these procedures, current reign terror, she said. But young doctors families wouldn't necessarily want do this. They may not be willing put their lives risk. The abortion debate be only one several factors contribute shortage obstetrician-gynecologists Canada. The national society that oversee speciality say there be 1,400 doctors field, shortfall 600, and most be their 50s or 60s. The society say long hours and limits fees pay public health-care system be cause burnout and deter medical school graduates they choose specialty. Another problem be that few canadian medical schools offer train abortion. Women Canada's big cities generally have adequate access abortions. Those rural areas face long journeys, and province Prince Edward Island prohibit abortions its six hospitals, force women there travel New Brunswick or Nova Scotia. Abortion-rights groups say situation would improve if RU-486 abortion pill be available Canada. No drug company have apply permission market pill, either fear boycott or doubt its profitability. The government have be urge make public appeal drug companies, health department say this can't be done. It would be conflict interest, say Bonnie Fox-McIntyre, department spokeswoman. As regulator we have stay arm's length, so we can judge application impartially. Abortion be illegal Canada 1988. now there be no abortion law any sort, 100,000 abortions be perform annually, and polls indicate roughly three-quarters Canadians favor pro-choice policies. Yet public support doesn't spare doctors fear. Dr. Henry Morgentaler, who lead efforts overturn old abortion law and whose Toronto clinic be bomb 1993, say he and his colleagues be sacrifice personal freedom they reluctantly increase security measures. Unfortunately, doctors who be commit provide these services will have accept certain diminishment their enjoyment life, he said. In aftermath last month's deadly sniper attack obstetrician upstate New York, Attorney General Janet Reno announce last week that she be set new investigative unit examine possibility that doctor be victim broad anti-abortion plot. The unit, National Clinic Violence Task Force, will include dozen Justice Department lawyers and involve several law-enforcement agencies. But main work look shoot Dr. Barnett Slepian his suburban Buffalo home and how it fit large pattern organize violence will be do FBI, which have jurisdiction domestic terrorism. For many FBI, that's problem. In contrast old image gung-ho FBI agents turn their surveillance machinery political groups, number senior FBI agents privately express misgivings attorney general's late task force, second she have order begin broad investigation conspiracy involve anti-abortion violence. FBI officials fear that expand investigation could drive agency ill-defined boundary that separate inquiries criminal activity those political causes and unpopular ideas. Today's agents be eager disassociate themselves old J. Edgar Hoover days trample civil rights political dissidents guise serious investigations. They do not want agency drawn middle bitter ideological war anti-abortion groups and abortion rights advocates, who have long assert existence organize campaign clinics and doctors. Many those call government help be once themselves subject fbi interest anti-war and civil rights activists. Senior agency officials, include Director Louis Freeh, be start their careers early 1970s and watch dismay FBI be shake revelations Cointelpro, counterintelligence program that allow agents spy on, burgle, wiretap and infiltrate anti-war and civil rights groups Students democratic Society and Student Nonviolence Coordinating Committee. Some officials be dubious that conspiracy exists kill doctors who perform abortions. They come empty hand when Reno order first federal inquiry 1994 kill Florida doctor and his bodyguard. The Justice Department conduct two-year grand jury investigation; agents pursue some anti-abortion activists use surveillance teams. But investigators never find specific plot abortion clinics and staff members. Violence abortion clinics be only part problem. The FBI have recent years find itself thrown minefield politically tinged cases involve volatile worlds anti-government militias, environmental and christian extremists, white separatists, animal rights activists and Islamic fundamentalists. The FBI be very quick jump investigate crime investigate political association, say David Cole, law professor Georgetown University. When you move investigate crimes investigate groups, that all-important nexus criminal conduct get lost, focus get broad and broad and you start sweep all kinds lawful political activity. In response terrorist attacks bomb World Trade Center 1993, Oklahoma City federal building 1995 and Olympic park Atlanta 1996, agency have increase efforts deter such incidents major prevention program. In such cases, Justice Department, FBI and other law enforcement agencies say they operate domestic security guidelines that require investigators find reasonable indication that group be plan break law they can open inquiry organization. Before authorities can use such intrusive tactics wiretapping or property searches, they must have specific evidence. Yet FBI agents throughout country have quietly evaluate threat pose variety extremist groups its links local authorities and informal interviews leaders some groups. Their conclusion be that most these groups pose little real danger. much more difficult investigate be lone terrorists inflame oratory extremist ideology who belong no group, drift society's fray margins, grid, some agents describe it, usual ties family, friends or work. The profile fit Eric Robert Rudolph, fugitive want bombings Atlanta Olympics, gay nightclub and two abortion clinics. He have keep his beliefs mostly himself, although acquaintances hint that he be familiar religious extremism and hate groups. In contrast, James Charles Kopp, who be be seek material witness kill Slepian, leave trail clues his motives. He be early follower Randall Terry, leader Operation Rescue. Later, Kopp be associate Lambs Christ, another militant anti-abortion group. One law-enforcement official say that government should do what it do best. We should investigate violations, he said. We shouldn't investigate groups. everyone who know Dr. Barnett Slepian know that slight, gray physician endure measure stress that would exhaust, break, most people. There be strangers who paw garbage cans his home and growl murderer they pass him grocery store aisle. Demonstrators assail his pregnant patients they arrive his office their checkups, call him baby killer. Outside clinic where he perform abortions two days week, pickets shout epithets pig his face. Slepian, obstetrician and gynecologist training and abortion doctor principle, rarely acknowledge strain. He might crack occasional joke expense protesters who shadow him work and weekends. then he would do something unexpected, invite anti-abortion leader breakfast or stop and chat familiar demonstrator clinic. so when he be kill Oct. 23 sniper's bullet fire kitchen window his home Buffalo, N.Y., suburbs, furtive execution that fit pattern four early attacks abortion providers western New York state and Canada, friends and relatives wonder not so much that Slepian's work could arouse such murderous violence. He have predict much himself. Instead, they wondered, once again, that he persist that work, long other Buffalo doctors have surrender pressure abortion opponents. He be incredibly fatalistic person who think that if your number's up, it's up, and there be nothing you can do it, say H. Amanda Robb, doctor's 32-year-old niece. And he be incredibly stubborn. He say that women have right comprehensive health care and he be women's doctor, he be go provide it them. slepian be third doctor be kill last five years bombings and shootings that have kill 7 people and wound 17 abortion clinics nation. To his tormentors, he be simply abortion doctor. To members abortion rights movement, he be martyr their cause. But Slepian be far either. In interviews friends and family members, he emerge more one-dimensional abstract conservative who advocate old-fashioned values self-reliance, shy man who have rare flashes anger, doctor who perform abortions have no more patience women who have multiple abortions women who have multiple children they not want or could not support. He be kill because he perform medical procedure that have become emotional and politicized. Yet there be nothing his life suggest he be crusader either politics or medicine. Rather, he be obstinate, unassuming man who remarkable thing. Out contrariness and out conscience, say those who know him, he refuse allow anyone dictate what kind doctor he should be, and that, he pay his life. The clues Slepian's flinty brand commitment lie, part, his upbringing. His be family that take success grant it teeter edge poverty. To earn money medical school, he shovel muck ranch and drive taxi. He make few friends, those he have be friends life. When their wives be sick, he call repeatedly. When they be lonely, he fly their side. Slepian, who be know Bart, use tell people that he choose obstetrics because it be specialty that expose doctor least suffering, and that he perform abortions because it be legal and alternatives be so much worse. Slepian express exasperation women who come him abortion abortion. Don't they get it? his clinic staff recall him say more once. He have same impatience women those he remember his residency inner-city Buffalo, who have child child and no means support. He have contempt that somebody who have pull himself his bootstraps and make it world, Ms. Robb said. He believe that ban abortions or, just shameful his view, stop teaching young doctors how perform them, would not correct human imperfections that he find so irritating. There be 1.5 million abortions perform this country, his niece said, and he just felt we're not equip handle 1.5 million unwanted children. When he be killed, age 52, Bart Slepian own impose red brick home quiet suburb Amherst, complete swim pool piped-in music and assortment time-saving gadgets he adored. Slepian's trajectory that comfortable doctor's life have be unconventional. His grandfather, russian Jewish immigrant who start out sell shoelaces pushcart Boston, propel all five his sons Harvard time when few Jews meet university's blue-blood standards. His father, turn, decreed that his three sons would be doctors or earn Ph.D's. We grow home where there be tremendous, tremendous, tremendous respect education, say Serena Robb, Slepian's sister, who be four years old him. If you get A, it be ok If you get B, you get yell at. The family's mean not match its expectations. Slepian's father, Philip, have join his father's business manufacture leather soles shoes. Soon Bart be bear 1946 Boston, company failed, so money, father move his family six his in-laws' apartment McKeesport, Pa., and then Rochester, N.Y. Once settled, Slepian's father set himself freelance writer, crisscross country his old Studebaker, researching origins prominent citizens Library Congress and write their stories small-town newspapers. He sell articles hundreds, and be still write his death nine years ago age 93. The success that be expect Bart Slepian not come easily. As child, he be so shy that he cry when anyone look him, his sister recalled. An unexceptional student, he go local community college transfer University Denver, where he major zoology. Rejected medical schools United States fate two out three applicants late 1960s he study one year Belgium and then enrol Autonomous University Medicine Guadalajara, Mexico. His friends remember him funny and obstinate, thin young man glasses and recede hairline who beat all comers arm-wrestling and pool. Bart have certain beliefs, strongly held, say Richard Schwarz, old classmate who be internist Long Island. He always say you shouldn't sit whine things, Schwarz said. He would say, `Go what's yours and what's right.' Bart Slepian's determination surface quirky ways. He once insist go top World Trade Center, cripple fear heights. To get window, he crawled, inch inch. I said, `you don't have do this,' recall Schwarz, who be him time. And he said, `I want do it.' Bart make it count. He felt alive. Forced drop out school every few semesters work, he live Reno his sister Serena, widow who be struggle take care two young daughters. She work waitress and blackjack dealer, share her tips him while he drive cab, clean barns ranch and work laboratory assistant local Veterans Administration hospital. After graduation, he move Buffalo his medical residency. There he marry Lynne Breitbart, register nurse 10 years his junior, and scrap together money buy obstetrics practice doctor who be retire. He have soothing, unhurried manner. When patient his, Patti Durlak, be diagnose diabetes, slepian refer her specialist call every few days months help her overcome fear needles she have use her insulin injections. The other doctor said, `just deal it,' Mrs. Durlak recalled. not Dr. Slepian. In most ways, he be typical suburban family man, work six days week and spend his free time Little League games and county fairs his four sons. But late 1980s, he and other abortion doctors Buffalo be siege. In one notorious 1991 incident record videotape, Rev. Paul Schenck, one fieriest Buffalo's anti-abortion leaders, throw himself front doctor's car he pull clinic driveway. Slepian park street. As he push his way crowd chant demonstrators, Schenck cup his hands his mouth and lunged, shouting, Slepian, you pig! Slepian's attempts separate abortion conflict his private life be futile. The protests follow him home and man who have be so bashful boy find himself, uncomfortably, center controversy and attention. Once, he show his anger. In 1988, when demonstrators jeer him sidewalk front his home he open Hanukkah presents his children, doctor come out brandish baseball bat. He deny he hurt anyone, town judge order him repair one protester's smash van window and pay portion another's medical bills. The outburst surprise his family and friends. It be not Slepian's style make public fuss, much less acknowledge stress be taunt protesters. Stress? his old brother Paul respond gruffly when ask doctor's mood. I never hear word use my family, engineering term. He say it be nuisance. Mrs. Slepian not respond requests interview. She express rage The Buffalo News shortly shooting. She say that whoever have kill her husband deserve death penalty and that she would be happy administer lethal injection herself. She also speak out Schenck's brother, Robert, another anti-abortion leader who frequently confront Slepian, send bouquet flowers. Mrs. Slepian denounce him hypocrite. After confrontation 1988, slepian turn civil harassment lawsuits, letters and levity deal protesters. In 1993, when man active anti-abortion effort be arrest rifle doctor's garbage cans home, slepian tried treat incident lightly. They hopefully get bags full dirty diapers, he joked. He try engage his critics local newspaper. He tell The Buffalo News that abortion protesters should turn their energies help women avoid unwanted pregnancies birth control and counseling. In letter editor he warn that repeatedly call him murderer, his critics be incite violence. Slepian accept that opponents abortion act out moral conviction, his friends said, resent personal attacks. He think it tend demonize and dehumanize him and increase danger, say his lawyer, Glenn Edward Murray. So slepian take step that few nation's beleaguer abortion clinic doctors dared. He insist that if he try hard enough, he might cut venom. To dismay staff members who fear his safety, Slepian begin year ago stop and chat protesters he recognize Womenservices abortion clinic Buffalo, where he work two days week. He surprise gather protesters who be prepare what they euphemistically call house call, or demonstration doctor's home, and invited protest's organizer, Rev. Robert Behn, breakfast. Their hourlong conversation next morning be inconclusive, Behn said, dismiss Slepian's gesture attempt get people him. He ask slepian how performing abortions affect him spiritually. In response, he recalled, doctor said, I'm fine spiritually. Slepian, meanwhile, focus more time away home his family. He plan take cruise next spring. He buy time-share apartment Disney World Florida. He have so many plans, say Ellen Fink, close friend couple 15 years. He wasn't done. He wasn't do live yet. Still, sometimes most casual conversations, shadow would appear. When his wife give him gray african parrot birthday gift, Slepian joke that bird would probably outlive him so he would teach it his eulogy. He would talk funeral he wanted, Mrs. Fink said. He say he didn't have lot friends and want all them come separate cars, one each car, so he'd have long procession. In week his death, Slepian have reasons be preoccupy thoughts mortality. A medical checkup have reveal blockage his heart, Mrs. Fink said, recount conversation Mrs. Slepian day slaying. A blockage be sign probable coronary artery disease. He be have more tests week. I said, `lynne, just relax, it's go be OK,' Mrs. Fink recalled. That same day, National Abortion Federation send fax Womenservices clinic warn pattern sniper attacks abortion doctors that occur early November. Marilynne Buckham, clinic director, send it Slepian. He definitely take it seriously, she recalled. Typically, doctor not share any concerns he might have felt. It be normal day, say Tammi Latini, his office assistant. We be horse around.' That evening, Slepians go synagogue mark ninth anniversary death Slepian's father. shortly they return home, sniper's bullet smash kitchen window, kill slepian he chat his wife and sons. The protesters return clinic five days later, first day it reopened. Mrs. Buckham, director, say Slepian would not have be surprised. They have their routine. so he. He never want day end bad note, she said. At end day, I would always say, `Thank you coming.' And he would always turn stupid grin and say, `Thanks have me.' The slay Dr. Barnett Slepian his home last week eliminate mainstay only abortion clinic here, it have not eliminate women's access abortion. That be because availability abortion Buffalo area, much United States, be complex reality, one affected class and education, medical training and personal convictions individual doctors. Knowledgeable middle-class and affluent women here who find themselves unwanted pregnancy can obtain abortion their private gynecologists, or if gynecologist have personal objection procedure, referral colleague. Women who be poor, young or uneducated and have no such regular relationships doctors have rely specialize clinics one slepian work in, or hospitals. It be this group whom unplanned pregnancies be far more common prosperous women that face shrink universe possibilities result fear set Slepian's killing and slayings five other doctors and clinic workers 1993, medical experts said. If you're well and well connected, you can get your abortion, say Dr. Stephen Wear, co-director center clinical ethics University Buffalo, which train doctors Buffalo area's hospitals. For everybody else, it's less and less available. The number abortions United States have be decline steadily first years Supreme Court's Roe vs. Wade decision legalize abortion 1973, accord Alan Guttmacher Institute, which studies reproductive issues. They now number roughly 1.5 million year, accord reports Guttmacher, or 1.4 million, accord National Right Life Committee, nation's large anti-abortion group, which calculate its estimate partly Guttmacher figures. The number providers who identify themselves perform abortions part their practice be diminish well. A 1994 Guttmacher study, last one published, find that number have decrease 18 percent 1982 and 1992, 2,380 2,908. Moreover, study said, only 12 percent nation's residency programs routinely offer train abortions first trimester, though many do offer elective courses. Laura Echevarria, director media relations National Right Life Committee, contends, however, that most teaching hospitals do train gynecologists procedures treat miscarriages that be similar those used perform abortions. only cosmopolitan and comparatively liberal cities New York do availability abortions continue steady level, experts say, though these locales there be concern decrease number young doctors who emerge residencies fully train perform abortions. The Guttmacher Institute, which keep nation's most precise statistics, say that 1992, last year which it have figures, there be 142,410 abortions New York that be do just 151 providers, include 61 hospitals and 44 clinics. Still, that provider figure greatly understate number private doctors who perform them their offices, medical experts say. many obstetricians and gynecologists Manhattan provide abortions part their palette services, and have many years, say Dr. Richard Hausknecht, medical director plan Parenthood. Rich and middle-class women have always have access abortions, and they always will. The major threat availability city be less result anti-abortion violence medical training. The bottom line be that we're face impending shortage physicians who be adequately trained and willing do procedures, say Dr. John Choate, chairman New York State division American College Obstetricians and Gynecologists. But lack train programs be also result political pressures hospitals and universities antagonists abortion and same climate fear. Physicians tend lie low, Choate said. They don't publicize fact that they do them. If they do them, they do it quietly out fear their practice and their lives. One development horizon that be expect change outlook abortions substantially be final federal approval, expect next year, RU-486 pill, drug that end early pregnancy need surgery. When pill be introduce France and Edinburgh, Scotland, Hausknecht said, number surgical abortions plummeted. In July 1988, when Randall Terry drive night his home Binghamton, N.Y., Atlanta start series anti-abortion protests that would finally put his new hard-line group, Operation Rescue, America's front pages, James Charles Kopp be van rid alongside him, accord former leaders Operation Rescue who speak condition anonymity. And, those people say, when Terry be arrest first day Operation Rescue's Siege Atlanta, Kopp follow him jail. Along more one hundred other Operation Rescue members, accord some people who be there, Kopp remain jail 40 days and adhered Terry's orders not give real name police or courts. After his release, Kopp return Operation Rescue's Binghamton headquarters, and be there work alongside Terry group's power and influence anti-abortion movement surge late 1988 and 1989, accord former leaders Operation Rescue. Now, Kopp be be seek federal and local law enforcement authorities question material witness murder obstetrician who perform abortions Buffalo region. The authorities also say he may have information that will help solve four other sniper attacks doctors who perform abortions Canada and upstate New York. Some abortion-rights groups be seize Kopp's role Operation Rescue raise new questions connections recent anti-abortion violence and hard-line anti-abortion protest groups that burst national scene late 1980s. For years, Federal Bureau Investigation and Justice Department have look vain evidence determine whether national conspiracy might be series clinic bombings and shootings doctors and other clinic staff members that begin early 1990s. A federal grand jury Alexandria, Va., that look conspiracy allegations be ultimately disbanded find national underground. But some federal law enforcement officials say they hope that Kopp may help provide such link. In fact, announcement that law enforcement officials be look him have be make Attorney General Janet Reno have prepare revive interagency task force look once again possible conspiracies anti-abortion crimes. Federal law enforcement officials and authorities say Kopp be not now suspect sniper attack Oct. 23 that kill Dr. Barnett a. Slepian Buffalo. But they say Kopp's car be see Slepian's home Amherst, N.Y. weeks doctor be shot. One day issue warrant Kopp's arrest material witness, law enforcement officials least 10 agencies span United States and canadian border still have not locate Kopp Thursday. But law enforcement officials say they be pursue many tips, include 400 that have pour FBI's information line: (800) 281-1184. The police have go photographs abortion protesters and clinic workers Buffalo and country, and they be also review hundreds hours videotapes demonstrations search Kopp's face. At this point, officials consider shoot slepian be connect three attacks Canada and one Rochester doctors who provide abortions. The five attacks, all 1994, occur weeks lead Nov. 11, Veterans Day call Remembrance Day Canada holiday that have become important anti-abortion activists. But attacks be spread four years and 3,000 miles, Vancouver, British Columbia, Buffalo. As be case many early veterans Operation Rescue, Kopp be transform hard-core anti-abortion militant jail Atlanta 1988, accord many people who be jail him who insist anonymity. By outward appearances, Dorothy Hayes' life seem ordinary. She and her family live rambling old home shore Lake Ontario, and every morning, she give her husband, John, peck cheek he go work. She run errands, other suburban moms, and spend much her day take care her children. But one thing set Mrs. Hayes apart her neighbors. As devoted opponent abortion, 43-year-old mother nine regularly play host series travel speakers, priests and protesters many whom have come Rochester intent spread word abortion and shut clinics that provide it. She be one thousands people country loosely associate anti-abortion groups Lambs Christ who have open their homes Lambs' founder, Rev. Norman Weslin, and other itinerant demonstrators. While many include Mrs. Hayes disavow violent tactics, supporters abortion rights say that people her bear some responsibility when protesters they help blockade clinics or threaten doctors. These people who provide Father Weslin food and shelter when he come town close clinics be not innocent, say Ann Glazier, director clinic defense plan Parenthood Federation. It's just not credible say they aren't part extremist activity that be take place these clinics. They be still guilty interfere women's access.

That man, James Charles Kopp, have participate abortion protests more decade, and be house guest other members Lambs Christ. While Mrs. Hayes say she would never so much obstruct clinic's door, some those whom she have give refuge have no qualms do so. Weslin, leader Lambs Christ, be one those who have benefit Mrs. Hayes' hospitality, modern version generosity that Christ and Apostles know well. He pride himself be arrest more 60 times protests front medical clinics. And throughout 1980s and early '90s, he be active clinic rescues, which protesters try physically restrain patients try enter clinics.

They talk counsel women alternatives abortion Roman Catholic pregnancy centers, and their support anti-abortion candidates. But they also say they saw nothing wrong Weslin try block access clinics. They describe activity peaceful resistance mean stop what they see murders. Weslin and other house guests Mrs. Hayes and Mrs. Quinn come recommended friends and members local Catholic churches, they said, add that most be speakers local churches or anti-abortion events. And although they say they would never take their homes stranger want FBI, Kopp, they concede that they sometimes know little their guests. But Mrs. Hayes and Mrs. Quinn say they know lot Weslin. An Army veteran, he have be leader anti-abortion movement more 25 years, they say, and found home unwed mothers. Mrs. Hayes say that when she meet him, it be obvious he be man peace who have tremendous devotion bless Mother and basically recognize that we be helpless lambs. Barbara Fredericks, another local abortion opponent who develop ties Lambs Weslin come town, add that priest epitomize man God. I just know when I look his holy shoes and his simple coat that have be mend 50 times, she said.

For long time, you felt voice desert that wasn't be heard, Mrs. Hayes said. And then there be this horrible tragedy this doctor's death become face movement. We're save lives, she said. The FBI have not talk Mrs. Hayes, Kenny say that agents have speak him. The Justice Department say that Federal task force set this week investigate kill Slepian be look evidence connect anti-abortion violence various clinics. It's fair say that when investigate these events, we will look any connection individuals engage criminal conduct, Myron Marlin, spokesman department, said. many local Catholics associate Lambs Christ have try distance themselves kill Slepian. They be mail literature say that killer do not represent their movement. In addition, some people associate Lambs be offer other possible explanations killing. Some say they believe that killer might have be someone overcome grief personal experience abortion. Others wonder whether shooter have try wound doctor scare him or prevent him perform more abortions. The Lambs also wonder whether abortionist opponents be be blame shoot commit disgruntle patient. One idea gain currency Lambs, and prominently display their Web site, suggest that kill be result plot abortion supporters discredit abortion opponents just last week's elections. Mrs. Hayes say she doesn't know truth. There be wackos who travel and they may be front clinic because we be draw same place, she said. But you don't know everyone who show and you don't turn person next you and tell them they don't belong there. Mrs. Fredericks say that anyone who would shoot doctor who provide abortions be someone who have snapped, perhaps because importance situation. Members Lambs Christ and other opponents abortion Rochester wonder whether kill Slepian will hinder their efforts. When Weslin first arrive two years ago, he bring new focus group that have do little more counsel pregnant women and set booths college campuses, they said. In many cities, they have priest life coordinating and lead rosary marches abortion, Mrs. Quinn said. But Father Weslin come here, we could finally come together and feel we be do something sacrificial group. Mrs. Hayes say that she felt first pull movement early 1980s, when she hear women speak choice regard abortion. then she saw Silent Scream, well-known anti-abortion film that purport show footage abortion.

Norman Weslin, founder of the anti-abortion group Lambs of Christ, who travel about spreading their message and shutting down clinics.Another itinerant demonstrator, James Charles Kopp, is wanted by the FBI as a material witness in the Slepian murder.In addition to anti-abortion violence, a shortage of doctors who are trained and willing to do the procedures imperil their widespread availability.","The primary doctor at the last abortion clinic in Buffalo, NY, was shot and killed.Dr. Slepian, a stubborn man, dedicated to women's care, and an unlikely martyr.It's the 7th such death, and the 4th similar attack.James Kopp is sought as a material witness.The anti-abortion movement has local and itinerate members.Their activities go from prayers and talking to confrontations, threats and violence.After this killing, the FBI resumed a search for an anti-abortion conspiracy.Since the first few years after Roe v Wade, the number of abortions has declined, as has the number of clinics and doctors providing the procedure, especially for poorer women.","Abortion clinics continue to be targeted by anti-abortion groups such as Operation Rescue, Lambs of Christ, and Army of God.Opposition ranges from silent vigils to vocal and physical intimidation, and even murder.Dr. Bart Shepian of Buffalo's only abortion clinic was murdered in his home.Police in the US and Canada are looking for James Kopp, a known abortion opponent, as a material witness in that murder.The clinics serve poor, young, and uneducated women since the well-to-do use their established providers.AG Janet Reno has named a task force to find out if the Slepian murder, the third in five years, is part of an organized campaign of violence."

1026,"Hours Darryl Strawberry be release Columbia Presbyterian Medical Center Friday, he speak happily be able play his two young children, joke eat small amount chicken and potatoes and sound relieve be home Fort Lee, N.J., instead hospital. I'm really feel good, say Strawberry, telephone interview. It's nice be home kids and just kick back. That's all that I'm go do. This feel good. Strawberry, who undergo surgery remove cancer his colon Oct. 3, say he will remain New Jersey another 10 or 12 days return home Rancho Mirage, Calif. The 36-year old outfielder, who lose significant amount weight his 215-pound frame, say he do not have enough strength attend any World Series games and be content watch his teammates play padres television. My heart be them, say Strawberry, who speak several Yankees they win American League championship. I'm just go relax home and watch game. I'm look forward it. I may not be there, it'll feel I am. Paul O'Neill echo sentiments many Yankees saying, everything we're go be game. This be his life. any time we get some good news Darryl it's uplifting. We're all pray him. Since cancerous cells be find one 36 lymph nodes remove his abdomen operation, Strawberry say doctors tell him he will need six months chemotherapy treatment once he return California. The 36-year-old outfielder say doctors tell him he will need one treatment least one hour week. I be never scared, say Strawberry. I be more emotional anything. At time it, I have play while this. I want keep playing because I know we be go get World Series. At that point, Strawberry stop and laughed, probably because Yankees have make it World Series he expected. I want be there because that's what you play for, say Strawberry. I don't think that I be ever scared. It's something that I want deal head on. I talk Eric Davis chemo. He say it's not bad some people say. Although discovery cancer one lymph node prove that cancer have spread, Strawberry remain optimistic his future and said, It didn't worry me. I get all information doctors. One out 36 be good. It wasn't spreading. It didn't run and get crazy cancer can. When Strawberry be release hospital wheelchair Friday, few hundred fans who have congregate chanted, Darryl, Darryl. Strawberry, who struggle not cry, hug few nurses, thank everyone support him, then rise wheelchair and carefully enter car. Wow, I never think this day would come, Strawberry said. But it has. Unlike David Wells, Saturday night's starter World Series who predict Yankees would throttle Padres five games, Strawberry refuse make prediction whether he will soon be get his third World Series ring. But Strawberry, who be still hopeful return play 1999, sound very confident 1998 yankees, who be wear his number 39 back their caps inspiration. They look really good, say Strawberry. It's not go be easy, I think they're ready. The best thing make it World Series be you know you don't have go anywhere else that. You've make it that point and then you go do best you can do. That's what it's all about. As Bernie Williams start what could be his final series Yankees Game 1 World Series Yankee Stadium Saturday night, he want do it free mind. free worry his extremely uncertain future and undisclosed personal matter that have make this post-season perplexing it have be pleasing. But it be not easy keep mind uncluttered. Williams do not know if he will sign Yankees and return center field next season, because he want test free agency. There be good chance Yankees will not offer him most lavish contract, so Williams might be force decide fat paycheck and new situation baseball city his choice or pretty fat paycheck and familiar situation Bronx. Scott Boras, Williams' agent, compare his client players $10 million-a-year bracket last season, so that price tag have surely escalate Williams win American League bat title .339 average while drill 26 homers and knock 97 runs. Williams be ask if he agree theory that other teams will outbid Yankees. I do not know, say Williams, who have be aloof this post-season, have decline discuss why. And I'm think this little more I would to. I would keep my focus series. It be not issue Williams or yankees want study Saturday or come days, because team be four victories away championship. Still, it be issue that hovers Yankees ominously owner George Steinbrenner hover general manager Brian Cashman. It's tough thing, Cashman say balance excitement be World Series reality try re-sign Williams. You know ugliness future be right front you. Although Williams have be adamant not discuss future, he relent slightly Friday. When reporter ask him what reasons would be stay Yankees, Williams' answer include escape clause. Just fact that I've be here my whole career, Williams said. That have lot do it. The relationships that I've come know years, I think it would be very hard, not impossible, start scratch somewhere else. Williams continued: But I think reality game this day and age be things happen. You can't really write things stone that they're go happen. People get traded. People become free agents and go other teams. I have make decision really think all people I'm accountable for. When Williams be ask what good situation could player have be center fielder Yankees, win bat crown and be World Series, 30-year-old be stumped. Wow, that's pretty good right there, Williams said. It's funny you mention that, because I really haven't think any that. I think, some point season, I be go sit and think, wow, it wasn't bad year all. While Cashman would not discuss financial matters, another Yankee official say team will not offer Williams much $12 million year unless Steinbrenner get generous possible championship. It be more likely that Yanks would offer Williams $10 million-a-year range. I'd hate have speculate something this point, Cashman said. We'll give it our best effort sign him level that we're comfortable with. Hopefully, that will be enough. then we'll have marriage. If not, we'll have divorce. While Williams have earn right become free agent and pursue contract he want city he wants, he have interesting choices make. When reporter ask Williams how he would respond someone who suggest that he accept less yankees remain city where he be popular, where he like his teammates and manager, and where team have be post-season four straight years, he not hesitate answer. My response that would be it's not time right now start think that, Williams said. If I start think that, it'll distract me what I need do World Series. Williams then talk how Yankees be end remarkable season and how he not want his situation disrupt that. But, Williams' status uncertain, he be ask if next four seven games would be bittersweet, he could be end 13-year association Yankees. I don't want talk that, Williams said. I'm go have lot fun out there. I'm go go all out. then Williams walk away interview. The New York Times say editorial Saturday, Oct. 17: It be fit that this most memorable baseball seasons should conclude World Series that open Saturday night Yankee Stadium, age still grand cathedral sport. Bedecked bunting and banners, revere ballpark always elevate game its aura history and accomplishment. That make it perfect venue part championship series that will determine whether 1998 Yankees be one great teams modern era, or just talented squad that own regular season fold World Series. New Yorkers be boisterous, boastful bunch, and patter city this week have be loud and arrogant, or so it must seem anyone venture here San Diego root Padres. The word sidewalk and subways be that Padres don't measure Yankees. Sure, they have lethal start pitchers Kevin Brown and Andy Ashby, and one game's best closers Trevor Hoffman, not mention prolific hitters Tony Gwynn and Greg Vaughn, who be hobble still dangerous. But how be that match Yankees' World Series start rotation David Wells, Orlando Hernandez, David Cone and Andy Pettitte, bullpen flamethrower Mariano Rivera, deep bat order baseball? Yet truth be that Yankees fans be terrify team will crumple. Baseball fans, Yankee fans, can spend lifetime wait see home team historic caliber, and this Yankee team will not reach that sanctified status unless it end its record-setting season win World Series. The doubts keep creep up. The team be pitiful plate most playoffs. Tino Martinez, top run producer, have be numb slump. Bernie Williams, American League bat champ, hit well pennant series Cleveland Indians, have seem distracted personal matters. Shane Spencer, rookie slug sensation September, hasn't turn out be new Mr. October. Pettitte have be struggle August. The curious thing this team, which win more games regular season any team American League history, be how quiet and unobtrusive it can be. It sports no dominant superstar, no swaggering clubhouse leader, no one who seem belong New York. So when Yankees start drift field, fans tend fear team might simply fade away. Until Indians surge temporarily ahead playoffs, Yankees have face no serious test resiliency all season. New Yorkers can already taste that ticker-tape parade Broadway. But every mighty cheer stadium Saturday night will lurk fear that when curtain fall season, unheralded and unlegendary team San Diego will be one that be remembered. The last time they be see field Yankee Stadium, they be inadvertently influence outcome game that send Cleveland Indians home and Yankees World Series. That's not say umpires will mess World Series, they have show they be eminently capable interfere natural progression postseason games. All right, so Ted Hendry won't be World Series; umpires' collective bargaining agreement leagues do not allow umpire work league championship series and World Series. Joe Brinkman won't be here either, though agreement do allow umpire work division series and World Series. The three American League umpires who be six-man World Series crew work first playoffs. One them, Richie Garcia, will be crew chief and plate Saturday night's opener Yankee Stadium. Gene Budig, AL president, Friday call Garcia, 24-year veteran, one league's most respected umpires. But Saturday night, Garcia will move right field Sunday night Game 2. now why do that combination sound familiar, Richie Garcia and right field? Ah yes, last time Garcia work post-season series Yankee Stadium, he be umpire Game 1 league championship series two years ago when young fan New Jersey no name, please; he have be over-glorified enough reach fence and caught Derek Jeter's fly ball just Tony Tarasco, Baltimore's right fielder, prepare catch it. Garcia rule no interference, that it be home run, then say oops watch television replay clearly show interference. Too late. The call help Yankees win first game and set tone series. even though he make mistake, you know you have best out there, baseball official, speak condition anonymity, said. That knowledge come small consolation Orioles. Budig, too, acknowledge that umpires, players and managers, aren't perfect. Major league umpires be skilled what they do, they be human, he say telephone interview. Day and day out they do very good job Major League Baseball. Rounds one and two have be difficult, that happen time time. The umpires be so human American League playoffs that it happen time time time time. The Cleveland Indians suffer brunt fallibility umpires. We have highlight reel umpires get knock baseballs, general manager John Hart say Indians' final game Yankees. The umpires didn't lose game us, we have our share controversies two playoff series umpires. In division series Boston, Brinkman, plate umpire, be so bad his calls pitches and plays plate that he immediately provoke disputes that lead his eject Mike Hargrove, Indians' manager, three pitches Game 2, and Dwight Gooden, their starting pitcher, 19 pitches later. Hendry be right or wrong, depend one's point view, his noncall interference Travis Fryman 12th inning Game 2 ALCS. That rule go favor Indians. Little else did. In Game 4, Jeter be steal second fifth inning when on-target throw Sandy Alomar Jr. hit Jim McKean, who jump try get out way instead kick ball right field. A bat ball, Omar Vizquel's line drive, strike Hendry Game 6. But bad call Game 6 be Hendry's force play second base. Hendry call Bernie Williams safe, rule that Vizquel's foot come base he catch ball. Members Yankees indicate Friday that they, too, think call be wrong. I don't know, Williams say when ask what he thought, I'll take it. It be big play. But he think he be out? I'd rather not comment that, he said. It will stir lot controversy. I don't want get that. When player believe he be safe, he say so and doesn't worry any subsequent controversy. If Williams be imply that he think he be out, another member Yankees say he have no doubt that Williams be out. I wasn't sure first, this uniformed member team said, when I saw it be Hendry, I say uh-oh. I also think Omar be so smooth you'd think he wouldn't come bag. then I saw replay. He be out. The game today be faster it use be, this observer said. The umpires have be sharper. Maybe Garcia, Dale Scott and Tim Tschida American League, and Jerry Crawford, Dana DeMuth and Mark Hirschbeck National League, will be sharp 18th century french guillotine these four seven games. Leonard Coleman, NL president, say he think his umpires be first-rate division and league series and add that he have three splendid umpires work World Series. Budig said: The World Series crew be prove and first-rate. We have total confidence them. The umpires should let players make errors and managers bad decisions. then everyone will talk players and managers and not umpires. A strong sign that this city be go bonkers Padres come Friday morning when 680 fans agree shave their heads radio promotion raffle return 1-in-680 chance skybox tickets post-season play. This be more show support team it be one ticket, say Tommy Sablan, producer Jeff and Jer show. It be symbolic efforts bald padres Tony Gwynn, Wally Joyner, Greg Vaughn, Jim Leyritz. About thousand people show men, women and children. We have 10 barbers and 20 hairdressers and it take six hours lines either get buzz or straight-razored. We be shock turnout. But this be bandwagon town. `buy ticket day concert' type public. You'll see big bandwagon Monday when they've win and then hopefully we play Yankees and it's real World Series. After Padres beat Braves, 3-0, Game 2 National League Championship Series Thursday night Atlanta take two-game lead four-of-seven-game series, San Diego fans begin gear shot World Series more traditional ways. It would be team's first World Series appearance 1984, and downtown business district Friday, marquees and banners read Go Padres and lunch-hour rally be attend several hundred fans. The Padres set attendance record 2,555,901 this season, half-million last year and nearly million and half three years ago. It stem part effort John Moores, Padres owner, and Larry Lucchino, team's president, put family entertainment park they buy team December 1994. This be more diversified group fans I saw Atlanta, Lucchino said. Their crowd seem yuppified. We're proud our three generations families who come games. Donna McMahon, 63-year-old homemaker La Jolla, have be fan she be 10 and Pacific Coast League Padres play Lane Field harbor. She would take streetcar school meet her father, and he would buy bleacher seats. Later, she bring her four children Jack Murphy Stadium National League Padres when 2,500 people be crowd. Now, she bring her grandchildren sold-out Qualcomm Stadium. There be different groups stands, she said, upper class, middle class, business person, beer-drinking fan, children, all mexican fans border. We be true fans all us. San Diego Mayor Susan Golding agrees, while also give credit balmy weather. Padre fans be cross-section all county, she said. Downtown, suburban, rural, east, north, ranchers and farmers high-tech engineers, yuppies new kids x generation. A lot border. The Padres be extremely popular Tijuana. We do have perfect weather long baseball season. Playing World Series October have get be good New York. Carlos Carrion, who be bear San Diego and have be baseball fan 25 years, bring his 10- and 8-year-old sons stadium. This be great chance let my children see players work, Carrion said. They can look these guys and understand their character and their work ethic. The Padres ticket office estimate that average, more 15,000 fans 65,000-seat stadium be latin Americans San Diego, Baja California or state Sonora. The Padres have first major league baseball souvenir store Tijuana. A new shipment bats arrive Tino Martinez Friday, and he massage handles make sure they be thin enough, knock barrels and listen certain sound and swing them slowly again and again. Martinez be so excited fresh bats, he react little Leaguer who be wield aluminum bat first time. You be save World Series trees now, right? Martinez say representative bat company. These be World Series trees, aren't they? Martinez could joke bats be specially design World Series because Yankees begin their quest second title three years when they play host San Diego Padres Game 1 Yankee Stadium Saturday night. Major leaguer players who be watch television could not imitate David Letterman and joke World Series wood. Even though Martinez have struggle numerous bats post-season, he could joke because Yankees be still alive title. Martinez be still alive. For now, Martinez, power hitter who have mostly be miss action, could joke around. For now. You always get fresh start post-season because it's game game, say Martinez. If you win, you've get another game next day so you forget bad at-bats. It's easy do that post-season because your next at-bat could be big at-bat season. Normally, have Martinez plate big at-bat season would be please sight Yankees. But not when calendar flip October. Martinez have experience another frustrate post-season. He be 5 30 10 strikeouts, no homers and only 1 run bat hitting-starved team that have bat .229 while still win 7 9 post-season games because superior pitching. Can Yankees continue win if Martinez, their most valuable run producer, be sometime singles hitter? We've just gotten two good series, say Paul O'Neill. The Yankees win those series. You don't focus one guy. You focus winning. The whole team won. As much Joe Torre talk Martinez need one line-drive hit get him groove, 30-year-old first baseman be career drought post-season. Since join Yankees, Martinez be 20 107 (.187) one homer and 4 RBI 29 post-season games. Those be puny statistics, especially player who have drive 381 runs 455 regular season games last three years. I would guess that Tino would have great series, O'Neill said. Baseball have way even things out. You have bad series, you come back and have great series. In season, that's easy do. In post-season, it get tougher. It cannot get much tough Martinez, who be drop fifth sixth order American League Championship Series Cleveland Indians and will remain that spot far notice. Martinez have blame his paucity production impatience and try do too much. He have sometimes flail poor pitches hitter's counts 3-1 and 2-0, instead work count, and he have admit that his previous failures post-season have cause him pursue obviously unattainable five-run homer. Actually, Martinez have already make some alterations, and he have reach base 7 times his last 10 plates appearances double, single, hit-by-pitch and 4 walks. It be not enough pacify George Steinbrenner, it be something him cling to. Until last night, anyway, when Martinez have face Kevin Brown, nasty right-hander who have retire him 30 34 career at-bats. If I be get good pitches and miss them, then I'd say I have bad swing working, say Martinez. But I've be swing bad pitches. Right now, I've just get be patient and wait. The Yankees will wait him. They have to. In 1996 World Series, Torre start Cecil Fielder Martinez first game 3, 4 and 5. It be difficult decision because Martinez have pace team RBI while Fielder not join Yankees July 31. But Yankees grab all three games so it worked. Torre do not have such attractive replacement this season Luis Sojo. So Yankees will stay Martinez, better or worse, while he try stay positive and finally produce. It's World Series, say Martinez. You get go out there and have fun it. Big games be all big games. You want go out there and enjoy that game and try do your best win that game. You don't think that you might lose that day. Chuck Knoblauch and Tino Martinez be popular squeegee men week ago, speculation rampant that one or other or might be exile if Yankees' historic year crumble post-season. Two big hits midst big inning change all that Saturday night Game 1 World Series. The Yankees trail San Diego, 5-2, seventh inning, Knoblauch hit three-run home run tie score, and five batters later, Martinez smash grand slam. The seven-run explosion rocket Yankees 9-6 victory opener four-of-seven-game series, 56,712 Yankee Stadium. Orlando Hernandez will pitch Andy Ashby Game 2 Sunday night Stadium. Beyond seize advantage series, Yankees be able neutralize Padres' ace, Kevin Brown, drive him mound seventh. Brown, see many San Diego's best hope World Series upset, will not pitch again Game 4, earliest. Brown be pitch three-run lead top fifth, when Tony Gwynn and Greg Vaughn bang back-to-back homers. One out seventh, however, Jorge Posada hit single, and Brown walk Ricky Ledee. Brown, who have throw whop 64 pitches first three innings, go out, and reliever Donne Wall come face Knoblauch. This be what Yankees have do all season, force starter game middle innings, exploit middle reliever. Knoblauch, course, have earn notoriety his gaffe Game 2 American League Championship Series Cleveland, stand and wait interference call ball roll stop him and decisive run scored. The Yankees come back win series, however; Knoblauch get reprieve and talk how much experience have help him. face Wall one-ball, no-strike count, Knoblauch have duck runaway fastball. Two balls, no strikes. Wall have throw strike, Knoblauch swing hard and lifted high fly left-field line. Off bat, it not look much. But it keep carrying, Vaughn drift back left and look up, see ball disappear stands. Tie game. Yankee Stadium shook. Knoblauch round bases, cross home plate and thrust arms air, yell crowd, hype Olympic weightlifter who have just successfully hoisted half-ton. He stomp dugout, his helmet on, teammates bang him happily. When Derek Jeter singled, nobody really noticed. Wall leave game, and Mark Langston take over. Paul O'Neill flied out, and Jeter advance wild pitch, Bernie Williams be intentionally walked. Chili Davis draw walk. Bases loaded, once more, Martinez come plate, exactly one run bat in his first 76 career at-bats league championship and World Series games. With count two balls and two strikes, Langston throw pitch corner that he think should have be strike. Instead, Garcia call it ball. Langston glared, snap return throw. Langston and Martinez and everyone field now understand that bases load and 3-2 count, Langston would have throw what players refer cookie tasty pitch middle. Martinez ate this cookie. The ball soar upper deck right field, lift three years post-season misery back Yankees' first baseman, grand slam. The crowd call out Martinez dugout again. Like Knoblauch, Martinez pump arms, and later crowd would chant his name, and Martinez would wave his cap. San Diego's lead be long gone. The Yankees have take 2-0 lead Brown second inning, force him throw 32 pitches second. They load bases single and two walks, and Ledee, rookie leave fielder who be play because none Torre's leave fielders have be hitting, pulled sink fastball right field line two outs. The fans foul line stood, some wave push ball fair body English, and ball land line, skip wall two runners scored. The Yankees have early edge, they have jump Brown, and they have their best pitcher mound. San Diego's Chris Gomez lead second inning blooper shortstop, ball fall single. Quilvio Veras flied right, Gwynn ground out and Gomez take second, bring Vaughn plate. David Wells get ahead count, no balls and two strikes, change-up and fastball, try run fastball Vaughn, who hit 50 home runs regular season. Vaughn attack pitch: line drive that land second deck, foul all way, frighten mistake. Jorge Posada, Yankees' catcher, jog mound re-think strategy, perhaps remind Wells conventional wisdom: you must pitch Vaughn outer edge plate. Posada return plate, call fastball, Wells threw. Vaughn's swing be short and quick, ball make click sound bat, well-struck golf ball, carry wall right-center field. Tie game. Wells retire first two batters fifth inning, jamming Veras fastball. Veras' bat snap contact, it be enough send looper short center field, single. Gwynn step in, have hit single his first two at-bats, and look sign third base coach Tim Flannery. With runner first, he like try pull ball right side infield. Wells fire fastball, Gwynn turn pitch and rip it, line drive that crash face upper deck right field. The Padres jump dugout, celebrating, Wells turn away, disgusted, ask new baseball. He get one, deliver another fastball, and Vaughn slug this deep leave field stands. Two pitches, two home runs, first back-to-back home runs allow Wells April 30. San Diego led, 5-2, and Yankee Stadium be silent. It would not stay that way. The moment truth Chuck Knoblauch come bottom first inning when his name be announce Yankee Stadium first time he neglect chase that memorable loose ball last Wednesday. There be no boos. It be very warm ovation. They like him. They really like him. Knoblauch exhaled. Knoblauch have emphasize game that he be concerned winning and rumble World Series, not fans. But it surely make Knoblauch feel home when he realize that fans have forgive him. Victories, more time, have heal malice Knoblauch and he could play second base earplugs. When Yankees defeat Indians, 9-5, Game 6 Tuesday night advance their second World Series three years, Knoblauch be easily most relieved player field. The awful mistake that he have make Game 2 would be forgotten. The Yankees have win pennant, and Knoblauch be celebrate much anyone. To have them act that me be tremendous, say Knoblauch, response that he received. It be great feeling, and it really help me out. Knoblauch be wear cap that declare Yankees champions American League 1998; Champagne drip brim he spoke. He not look up, continue talk how he have learn lot be vilify make mistake that little Leaguers be expect not make. Just face things and take it man and answer all questions, although they're tough, Knoblauch said. You see what you're make when you have bounce back something that. That's basically what I learned. If Yankees have lose ALCS, some Knoblauch's teammates have say that he would be brand villain fail pursue ball that glance Travis Fryman's back while he be run baseline. Knoblauch have argue umpire while go ahead run score first and Indians won, 4-1. now Knoblauch can watch television and read newspapers again get queasy. That's huge him, David Cone said. That's huge me. I let them back game, and that would have be tough one if they would have come back and beat us. And Knobbie, I'm sure he's feeling lot better now. Knoblauch, who have two hits five at-bats, be work his second bottle Champagne five minutes reporters be allow clubhouse. He flash sort smile that he have not show too much recently and, now that Yankees be World Series, Knoblauch should expect be tease his mistake. maybe if we go all way, we'll do that, Derek Jeter said. I don't know what I'll say, I'll think something good. YANKEES pitch The start pitching enable Yankees advance Cleveland American League Championship Series. David Wells be 7-1 his career postseason and he should have additional edge Padres' lineup that be generally less effective left-handed pitching. Orlando Hernandez have four terrific pitches, pitch seven shutout innings pivotal Game 4 ALCS and earn start Game 2 this series. David Cone should benefit six days' worth rest when he start Game 3, well be able pitch warm Southern California. Mariano Rivera's stuff might be good it have be all year, and Mike Stanton continue be dominant postseason pitcher. Reasons concern: erratic Andy Pettitte, who need home-plate umpire call strikes pitches low and away, and Jeff Nelson, who lose his command his last brief outing. offense There be signs ALCS that offense be come out its collective slump Chuck Knoblauch be get base consistently, Derek Jeter be back drive ball right field and middle, Bernie Williams have three hits Game 6, and Scott Brosius have be consistent force bottom lineup. But Yankees do have holes: Chili Davis will be hard-pressed catch fastballs Kevin Brown and Andy Ashby, and Tino Martinez's postseason funk be problem. The Yankees could use contribution Jorge Posada, who will start Games 1 and 2 and may get chance drive pitches low strike zone, where he can hit power. Defense The Yankees have best defense baseball, excellent middle Jeter and Knoblauch, and third Brosius. Nobody's really take advantage fact that Williams have poor arm center field, rest assure that Ken Caminiti, Steve Finley and Greg Vaughn will try. The Indians expose fact that Yankees' pitchers have trouble prevent baserunners steal second third base. baserunning The Yankees run well they take extra bases, particularly Paul O'Neill, Brosius, Jeter and Knoblauch go first-to-third; Williams can make mistakes. The Yankees probably won't be able steal Kevin Brown, who have effective slide step, they could be aggressive Andy Ashby, or combination Sterling Hitchcock and Jim Leyritz. PADRES Hitting Except Jim Leyritz, no one San Diego lineup be particularly hot or particularly frightening moment. Tony Gwynn hasn't be consistent he is, Ken Caminiti and Greg Vaughn have be streaky. But Padres be veteran team capable put ball play, get runners base and then move them along, and so long they be get exceptional pitching, that's all they really need. Quilvio Veras, leadoff hitter, be adept draw walks and Steve Finley, who have become more pull conscious last two years, could try take aim right field stand Yankee Stadium. Vaughn's power could be factor if yankees' pitchers don't jam him enough keep him lean plate. Pitching Kevin Brown be best pitcher this series, capable win three games if necessary, should Padres manager Bruce Bochy choose start him game 1, 4 and 7. But some point, San Diego will need big out either Andy Ashby or Sterling Hitchcock. When Ashby's right, he's hit corners his sink fastball and his slider, and when his command be suspect, he get pounded. Hitchcock use his split-fingered fastball great effectiveness right-handed batters first two rounds playoffs, Yankees' left-handed hitters may cause him some concern. San Diego's middle relief be weak aspect team, Randy Myers and Mark Langston leave side (the stuff each have waned). But if lead can be deliver hands closer Trevor Hoffman, he'll keep it. Defense They mostly catch ball and avoid mistakes, though they be unspectacular. Shortstop Chris Gomez and second baseman Veras be adept turn double plays, and Caminiti win Gold Glove third base last year; Wally Joyner have good hands first; center fielder Steve Finley be extremely quick track base hits and return ball infield. Tony Gwynn's range be well right field line, not nearly good balls hit gaps. The Yankees will be able run arm Vaughn leave field. Baserunning Veras can steal bases (24) this year, and Finley can tight spot, well. In general, however, Padres be slow, plod team, though Caminiti and Vaughn be good go first-to-third, and Gwynn won't make mistakes bases. PITCHING TO THE PADRES Quilvio Veras: A switch-hitter who have more power right-handed; should try pitch him down-and-in breaking balls when he's hit right-handed, jam him fastballs when he's bat left-handed. Steve Finley: A left-handed hitter who like pull ball. Left-handers David Wells can beat him break balls low and outside. Tony Gwynn: When he's hot, he's impossible. When he's not hit well, he can be anxious early count, and he should be feed break balls out strike zone. Greg Vaughn: Big-time power anything high and plate. Because he like pull ball, you must pitch him outer edge, occasionally jam him keep him honest. Ken Caminiti: more power right-handed, better hitter left-handed. These days, he's good lowball hitter and can be beat fastballs zone. Wally Joyner: With runners base, he'll try jump fastball early count. be not strong hitter and can be jammed. Chris Gomez: Like Derek Jeter, like hit pitches out, right field and middle. He can hit power if you make mistake break ball. Ruben Rivera: An impatient hitter who will chase pitches out strike zone. Carlos Hernandez: Looks first-pitch fastball upper half strike zone. Can struggle break balls. Jim Leyritz: No apparent holes right now, can hit fastballs and away. Best bet be get ahead count and try get him chase break balls. pitching TO THE YANKEES Chuck Knoblauch: Hard throwers jam him fastballs because he stand top plate, which be why he get hit so often. Derek Jeter: Sometimes he have tendency chase pitch his feet, if you don't get ball far enough, he can hammer ball wall right. Paul O'Neill: The Yankees' best pure hitter, he sometimes will chase fastballs and away, particularly there be one strike. Bernie Williams: A switch-hitter who have trouble resist chest-high fastballs. When he lay them, he be much good hitter, and he this last game Cleveland series. Chili Davis: Has great eye and will work pitcher deep count, he can be overpower fastballs his belt. Cheats some now get his bat started, make him vulnerable off-speed pitches. Tino Martinez: Nothing seem right moment. be anxious and chases pitches out strike zone when he fall count, and isn't take advantage mistakes when they're made. Scott Brosius: A great break ball hitter, he can also drive fastball long way when he anticipates, Cleveland's Charles Nagy now knows. Jorge Posada: When bat left-handed, he fare very poorly splitters, curveballs and sliders. Ricky Ledee: Like all young hitters, he have tendency expand strike zone and chase pitches out strike zone fall count. Kevin Brown likely will attack him aggressively. SATURDAY'S PITCHERS Kevin Brown: Best sink fastball game (91-93) mph, four-seam fastball 95-97 mph throw high strike zone, slider that breaks and away right-handed batters, and forkball that dive 88-89 mph. Holds runners well. David Wells: Aggressive, aggressive, aggressive, challenge hitters fastballs. His curveball can be exceptional, and his changeup have improved. Throw strikes: Allowed many home runs (29) walks (29), have not allow three-run homer or grand slam all year. Talk high expectations. It's not just man Tampa who have them anymore. know their baseball well they do, everybody Joe Torre family pass tickets divisional series and league championship series just so much parsley plate life. The pressure be get World Series, so I can see all those people, Torre, Yankees' manager, be say New York go out play here-we-are, let's-go-for-it San Diego Padres Stadium Saturday night. now that Yankees be Series, their florida-based owner and their fans and they themselves can see nothing more appropriate four more victories. Anything less 125 would feel emptiness. But why should yankees be any different six teams that already fell bus this World Series? The gloom and doom six other cities will not compare letdown that would grip New York and owner's insatiable little heart should yank come short. The three-tiered playoff system have practically turn baseball football, where survival-of-the-fittest mentality produce one exalt Super Bowl champion and league full chumps and losers, condemn nether world Parcells-like demons kick them their sore spots eternity. The World Series use be short and sweet reward excellence, that be when there be eight teams league, and winners meet daylight early October. even if Yankees club my poor Brooklyn Dodgers submission once again, well, there be always next year. But 1969, baseball begin league championship series, and 1995 it begin two-layered playoff system. The World Series be still different, which be why we should all resist babble post-season records fling us hyperactive computers and hyperactive broadcasters dozens different networks that carry baseball. The World Series be still competition one league that encourage pitchers be athletes and another league relatively devoid strategy. Somehow playoffs leave just everybody feel inadequate. Think it. The Houston Astros be go feel they cannot perform post-season. The Texas Rangers be sulk because they have best hit league and could hardly touch Yankee pitch when it counted. In Chicago, glory win special playoff wild-card spot and Sammy Sosa's 66 home runs have be pre-empted. The very city that beat Cubs 1969 eastern title hold parade Sosa Saturday canyons where Lindbergh and John Glenn and 1969 Mets be once hailed. speak indignity, there be Red Sox, whose occasional qualification playoffs be merely signal that nothing good can come it. In Atlanta, team '90s have win exactly one World Series, and now it be management keep repeat that: The main goal be get Series. This be record announcement. This be record announcement. This be record announcement. In Cleveland, fans have live phrase Nineteen forty-eight! be chant Indians Bronx Yankees put Indians out misery. That leave padres only team virtually nothing lose. This can be good, or it can be bad. Bruce Bochy, manager, reserve 1984 San Diego World Series team, have said: A lot players that team said, look back, we wish we would have have little different attitude instead just saying, `hey, we be World Series.' And this year, I think you will see players out there play win. Torre recall be underdog 1996, he say his Yankees felt they could beat Braves. I be sure that be way Padres feel right now, that maybe other people aren't predict lot them, I be sure they be themselves, Torre said. I think get here be where pressure is, Torre added. You want win, get World Series be so tough playing 162 games and get post-season and then have fight, bite and scratch and everything else get here. Torre continued: You don't think spring training that we want go and win World Series. You want get World Series. then you get there, well, you have play well enough and win enough games, then course, we want win. As far legitimize our season I hate think negative terms, if San Diego happen win World Series, sure it take little bit luster what we have accomplish get here, I think that be our goal, initially. The key word that sentence be initially. The Yankees build insatiable demand more victories and World Series tickets Torre family. While they're it, Yankees have better win whole thing. They be victim their excellence.

1031,"top-level budget negotiators congressional Republicans and White House conclude another bargaining session late Sunday afternoon plans resume talks Monday morning and probably extend their midnight Monday deadline another day or two. Both sides be amiable they emerge two-hour session, they have little report and indicate that their relatively early departure, compare last three nights, should not be interpret sign crisis or imminent peace budget talks. Sunday's discussions focus education and President Clinton's request $1.1 billion hire 100,000 teachers, aides say bargainers not delve much detail and nothing be resolved. I think we make some real progress today, we still have significant difference area education, say Erskine Bowles, Clinton's chief staff and top negotiator, Sunday's meeting. We're go try plow that next two days. ask how far apart two sides be education, Rep. Dick Armey Texas, Republican majority leader, replied: I don't know. We're not together. He say two sides have make some progress, not enough. The talks come another day escalate political confrontation congressional Democrats and Republicans, painfully aware that they have three weeks Election Day, try take advantage static budget situation. Congress have pass only six 13 required spending bills and be negotiate now White House final omnibus package that will contain remain seven bills and major issues include how conduct census year 2000, how much money provide International Monetary Fund and what conditions it should be provided, and how much emergency money provide items increase security U.S. embassies world and American farmers. also be resolve be host issues that have little do finance and more do ideology, include environmental matters, contraception and national student testing. Republicans say president have be disengage process, and they be irk what they say be his swoop 11th hour and push his education agenda apparently successful portrayal himself guardian that popular topic. Democrats counter that Republican-led Congress have do nothing all year, and cast Republicans extremists block president's plea more money hire teachers and modernize schools. In fact, Republican bargainers say Saturday night that they would provide money if local governments, not Washington, could decide how money would be used. Armey be one many who castigate president apparent disengagement, indirect reminder that Clinton have be steep sex scandal and be face impeachment inquiry House. The scant number congressional Republicans who not leave town weekend use House floor press this same message. What president? ask Rep. Tom DeLay Texas, majority whip. Maybe Martha's Vineyard? Aspen? Camp David? Where be president? I bet american people don't know that he spend 152 days out 283 days this year fund raising, travel and vacation. Republicans say that Clinton have participate 98 fund-raising events so far this year and that two events Monday New York, support Senate campaign Rep. Charles Schumer, would bring him 100. Clinton say White House that he be prepare do it take reach resolution spending bills, and dispatch his aides Capitol Hill. He also say he would postpone Monday morning Monday afternoon his departure his fund-raising tour New York, and he cancel fund-raising appearance Florida. But high-level budget bargaining conclude Sunday afternoon, sides agree they would need extend their deadline midnight Monday, when temporary financing government expire third time Oct. 1 start fiscal year. congressional Democrats strike back Republicans, say they have hold slack schedule themselves. Rep. George Miller, D-Calif., say Congress have be session only 108 days so far this year, unusually abbreviated period and one consume more month drive hold impeachment hearings president. most Americans, Miller said, have work more 225 days. They say, `Where be president?' Miller said. The president have be wait budget. This be first Congress 1974 that have no budget, he said, refer broad blueprint that be suppose guide spending. This be Congress that can't pass seven its appropriations bills, he said, largely because divisive splits conservative and moderate Republicans. Struggling meet their fourth deadline federal budget, congressional Republicans and White House officials wrestle Tuesday their differences education, most politically high-stakes element budget battle. Negotiators end late-night session resolve disagreements not just education, census and contraceptives. These be big issues that still separate two sides each tried formulate message take home voters Nov. 3 elections. On education, issue that President Clinton have propel forefront and which Republicans do not want appear recalcitrant, sides have agree spend more $1 billion not how spend it. The president insist that money be spend hire 100,000 teachers country so that average class can be reduce 18 students. Republicans, rail Beltway bureaucrats, say that local school districts should decide how money be spent, whether it be teachers or computers. As two sides break Tuesday night, White House chief staff Erskine Bowles, president's top negotiator, emerge session saying: We don't have deal. We make some good progress. The big issue, still, be 100,000 teachers. He added: There be still some open issues which no agreement have be reached, he sound optimistic session schedule Wednesday morning. I think we've get chance wrapping tomorrow, he said. The two sides remain apart several ideological matters, include whether allow federal health plans cover contraceptives and whether allow those few plans religious affiliations refuse cover contraceptives not only religious grounds moral grounds well. They be also split how conduct census 2000, which be one thorniest issues. It be not one that move voters, it be vital parties because it help determine their relative strength Congress. House Speaker Newt Gingrich and Bowles meet much day speaker's office, shuttling and out ante-rooms their lieutenants give few clues nitty-gritty details their talks. They have give themselves another deadline midnight Wednesday wrap $500 billion worth spend items, they could easily extend that deadline another day or two. They miss have spending bills place Oct. 1 start fiscal year, provide temporary financing federal government Oct. 9, then Oct. 12, then Wednesday. Some other central issues, finance International Monetary Fund, be all nail down, neither side be ready declare final deal all other elements budget package be place. We're split infinitives, House Majority Leader Dick Armey say approve money IMF. As they work several issues, republican leaders appear be calculate differences their party that might sour final deal when it arrive House floor more concern Senate floor because Senate have few differences its Republicans and White House. Some conservative Republicans say they be concern emerge shape final package, particularly elements deal family planning and emergency spending. They say president's proposals emergency spending, such items peacekeeping mission Bosnia, fix year 2000 computer bug and provide relief american farmers, will break limits last year's balanced-budget agreement. The administration say such money would come correspond cuts elsewhere budget, conservatives say it come raid surplus. If republican leaders cannot count their conservatives, they will need support Democrats pass final package. And Democrats Tuesday express concern some White House positions, issues census and apparent compromise Republicans aid farmers. Rep. David McIntosh, R-Ind., leader House conservatives, say he believe republican leaders be cede too quickly White House. He say that president appear be get his way some issues that what he really seem be win be war public relations. The president be get what he wants; he's control situation, McIntosh lamented. When Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott appear television, McIntosh said, it's reaction president. Nonetheless, McIntosh suggest that he could vote final accord. most conservatives be hold out better deal we're hearing, he said, we'll probably give them vote because we don't see much better alternative happen if it go down. Others be distressed, particularly two contraceptive issues. One would require federal health plans cover contraceptives. The other would bar overseas family-planning organizations lobby change abortion laws other countries. Rep. Tom Coburn, R-Okla., say he want see final language health plan measure. As it pass House and Senate, it allow health plans religious affiliation decline offer contraceptive coverage; Coburn want plans be able refuse such coverage moral grounds well. The plan cover five specific types contraception. Coburn say he want two those Depo-Provera and intrauterine devices be eliminate coverage because he say they interfere fertilization and be therefore consider cause abortions. Democrats Rep. Nita Lowey, D-N.Y., who introduce contraceptive plan House, say she strongly object Coburn's position. She say that health plans base their decisions what offer profits, not morals. The question be whether White House will insist keep contraceptive coverage final package and will oppose moral exception. If administration allow moral exception, it could alienate some House Democrats. House Democrats be also worried direction talks be take census. This have always loom one big issues separate Democrats and Republicans. The results census help determine future power two political parties. But fact that two sides be finally talk it now indicate that they be cover full range budget matters that need be resolved. The White House have propose buying time matter finance Commerce, State and Justice departments only five months. The Commerce Department contain Census Bureau. White House officials say this would put nettlesome issue while allow resolution entire spending package, House Democrats worry it would be prelude give Republicans road. Republican leaders idea postpone decision say that financing should be restrict only Census Bureau. On several touchy environmental issues that have prompt repeat veto threats White House, two sides appear be opt compromise confrontation, several disputes resolved. But few particularly difficult issues remain negotiation. A compromise be struck White House and alaskan lawmakers log Tongass National Forest. But compromise still elude them question build road wilderness refuge connect two communities alaska. A sticking point White House and congressional budget negotiators have be issue how 2000 census will be conducted, and White House be find itself negotiate issue much House Democrats it be House Republican leaders. On Monday, White House negotiators, lead chief staff Erskine Bowles, try determine whether Democrats would accept deal finance six months departments State, Justice and Commerce, which oversee Census Bureau. The deal would put next March contentious issue whether next census would use statistical sample supplement traditional methods count people. Bowles tell group Democrats that House Republicans be willing give number outstanding issues that be stall final agreement budget, that they be dig their heels when it come finance census six months. The Democrats meet office Minority Leader Dick Gephardt. The rationale half-year financing be that next March Supreme Court be expect rule whether use sampling be legal or constitutional. The Supreme Court have already agree review two low court rulings that say sample would violate federal law. Oral arguments cases be set November. But House Democrats balk idea six months' finance census, argue that if Supreme Court allow sampling, Republicans would be no obligation approve money census that include sampling. The general feeling many Democrats be that if we win case, there would be lot less leverage March, especially if it be only issue leave be debated, say House democratic official who insist anonymity. Democrats contend that now be time press Republicans, while they want complete work budget and go home campaign. Rep. Lucille Roybal-Allard, D-Calif., who attend meeting Monday, said, It was, sort of, this be where we are. We've be able accomplish great things, what do you think? We make it very clear that unless census be included, some other issues, school construction, deal wouldn't be acceptable. Statistical sampling would allow Census Bureau estimate populations that be difficult count, and would have large effect count african-americans cities and blacks and Hispanics rural areas, groups that be traditionally undercounted standard means. Republicans fear, and Democrats hope, that method would raise count people live traditionally democratic areas, give party advantage when new boundaries election districts be drawn 2000 census. At Monday's meeting, Democrats remind administration officials that Clinton have promise that he would veto any legislation that restrict Census Bureau's ability conduct accurate census. I can't think any way that restrict census more not fully fund it, say Rep. Carolyn Maloney, D-N.Y. The willingness House Democrats, include Gephardt, press president issue represent realization their leverage Clinton, who will need all their support come impeachment inquiry. Gephardt be major player now, and irony be we help make him that, say Rep. Christopher Shays, R-Conn., who support use sample census. The Democrats' position also indicate how little trust many have White House this issue. The proposal finance departments Commerce, Justice and State six months be similar one reach last November Bowles and House Speaker Newt Gingrich. The idea then be that hold all three departments hostage census fight would place maximum pressure all sides work out their differences sampling. But House Democrats be not consult that agreement be strike and later grumble it. At meet democratic caucus Tuesday, Ms. Maloney brief lawmakers dealings White House and declare that Clinton have promise that he would hold firm census and that she believe him, participant said. The statement be greet laughter. There be certain level suspicion because there have be times when we have be cut out,said House democratic official. But I have say, there hasn't be much evidence that, this time. struggle meet their fourth deadline federal budget, congressional Republicans and White House officials wrestle Tuesday their differences education, most politically high-stakes element budget battle.

But few particularly difficult issues remain negotiation. A compromise be struck White House and alaskan lawmakers log Tongass National Forest. But compromise still elude them question build road wilderness refuge connect two communities Alaska. House and Senate negotiators agree Thursday require most federal health plans cover prescription contraceptives women, give unusual victory Capitol Hill advocate abortion rights. But future measure be doubt because it be attach spending bill that include controversial provision Federal Election Commission. That provision could scuttle spending bill, which would finance Treasury Department and Postal Service and which still must be approve House and Senate. The contraceptive measure would require federal health plans, which affect 1.2 million female federal employees who be child-bearing age, cover five methods contraception that have be approve Food and Drug Administration use this country birth control pills, diaphragms, inter-uterine devices, Norplant and Depo-Provera. Currently, only 19 percent federal health plans cover those methods. The House and Senate approve contraceptive measure earlier this year. But opponents abortion be furious approval and persuaded Republican leaders have negotiators reopen discussion matter. The cost contraceptives have drive out-of-pocket cost health care women. And many male members Congress seem persuaded support coverage contraceptives women, almost all 285 federal health plans cover Viagra, male impotency drug. Thursday, pressure build resolve spending bills Oct. 9, when temporary financing government expires, negotiators agree include contraceptive measure their conference report $13.4 billion bill Treasury Department and Postal service. Rep. Nita Lowey, D-N.Y., who push contraceptive measure House, hail Thursday's agreement first major accomplishment abortion rights advocates Republicans take control Congress 1994. She say negotiators have agree include measure because election year they not want be perceive oppose contraception or be see reject measure that have pass House and Senate. But many Democrats say be upset that bill contain provision that be see interfere independence Federal Election Commission. That provision would require four-vote majority seven federal election commissioners every four years retain general counsel and staff director. The provision be aim get rid Lawrence Noble, current general counsel, who have investigate campaign finance practices groups Christian Coalition. The contraceptive measure be one four related matters that have help stall four spending bills. The three other bills that be stall part because abortion-related matters include agriculture bill, which there be dispute whether federal Food and Drug Administration should use taxpayer money approve drugs RU-486, which induce abortions. The foreign operations bill be also stall whether finance international family planning programs that may also promote abortion, while labor and health bill be delay because provision that would block access minors contraception. Addressing measure insurance coverage contraceptives, Helen Alvarez, spokeswoman National Conference Catholic Bishops, say that bill be bad policy. She say contraception have fail stem number abortions, teen-age pregnancies or out-of-wedlock births. Public-relations-wise, it's good tactic them, she conceded, terms social policy, this be failure. For first time decades, Congress and White House negotiate tax and spending legislation this year budget surplus. The result be chaos. The lawmakers be never able agree budget resolution framework which all tax and spending bills be suppose fit. This have not happen congressional budget procedures be establish 1974. Then, discipline such overall plan, Senate and House could not pass eight 13 spending bills need keep government running. So lawmakers have stay session more week longer they have hoped. Finally, they lump all eight bills together this week and announce agreement. But only way they could get this far be resort gimmicks. One be designate $20 billion emergency expenditures so that programs not have be cut elsewhere offset new spending. This will use more one-quarter anticipated budget surplus current fiscal year. Another gimmick extend tax break Individual Retirement Accounts couple incomes $100,000 $150,000. This will actually raise small amount revenue next five years period cover budget accounting it will make picture considerably worse later years. As hard it be negotiate budget bad old days budget deficits, say politicians involved, it be exponentially more difficult this year. At least years past, there be common goal. As much they disagree policy and principle, they be all aim reduction deficit. This year, some members Congress want use surplus big tax cut. Others want pay national debt. Others want spend part it medical research, schools and weapons Pentagon. Others want spend large sums highways. still want continue cut government spending. And that be just Republicans. The Democrats have their ideas budget, and President Clinton lay his marker save surplus way be find shore social Security system. In budget terms, say Robert Reischauer, former director congressional budget office, this be end Cold War. There be other differences well way things be negotiated budget surplus. In 1990, 1993 and 1995, when politicians stake their careers strike budget deal low deficit, fundamental question be how divide bitter medicine more taxes and less spending. Republicans, most part, oppose tax increases and favor cut spending social programs. Democrats want raise taxes, especially rich, and protect social spending. In end, balances be carefully drawn. But plenty politicians President George Bush, name one lose their jobs process. This year, Democrats and Republicans alike claim victory, burn issue be how parcel out candy. Democrats get more money education and farm assistance. Republicans get more money military and extension popular tax breaks businesses. Some $20 billion that will eat surplus really will go emergencies, relief victims Hurricane Georges. But much money, $90 million that will pay six new helicopters national police Colombia use drug interdiction, be designate emergency spending simply because there be no other way get it budget. For politicians, new way be more fun. It be hard imagine that anyone will be vote out office because this year's budget. But that not make it easy reach agreement. The other big difference be that principal fights this year be not money all. They involve delicate policy issues needle exchanges, contraception, global warming, immigration and census. In Congress, there be no consensus these matters. so only way policy could be set be wrap them giant spending bill. It may be more pleasant debate policy money. But it be probably harder find way split difference. As long surplus lasts, lack discipline that characterize budget-writing this year be likely continue. This be distress those devote controlling government spending. The temptation, say L. Ari Fleischer, spokesman House Ways and Means Committee, be grab loot and spend it. Some conservatives sound notes discord Friday federal spending agreement, they also say they would probably vote $500 billion package because it boost defense spending and provide aid farmers. However, no one can vote package just yet, because it be not finished. The deal that President Clinton and Republican leaders hail Thursday be broad outline areas agreement final portion $1.7 trillion budget, not write document. That be now be craft chairmen spend committees and their aides, who say Friday that there be still dispute that need be resolve and that final document could run more 3,000 pages. For example, still unresolved be dispute whether airlines can create peanut-free zone protect passengers who be allergic peanuts. House Speaker Newt Gingrich and other members Georgia, major peanut-producing state, be fight proposal, which would force airlines ban peanuts three rows someone allergy. Congress give itself midnight Tuesday vote final bill, agree President Clinton fifth extension temporary financing keep government open. The budget be due Oct. 1, start new fiscal year. The vote be initially expect Friday, bill be nowhere be written. only handful top-level bargainers include Gingrich, Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott and White House chief staff Erskine Bowles be room final deal. Excluded be committee chairmen and heads appropriation committees, who now must write language that will put deal law. Almost everyone Capitol Hill expect budget pas eventually, big defections come conservatives who object $20 billion take surplus address so-called emergencies and package's failure offer voters serious tax cut. The lag time bill be officially close be make some conservatives nervous that more members will try add provisions that will further expand bill they already consider overly bloated. And some worry that once hometown pork that be stuffed bill be publicly revealed, voters could put pressure members not support it. The elections be Nov. 3. But several conservatives say that these problems, they expect support bill anyway. Rep. Mark Souder, R-Ind., said: `Most my friends, who be predominantly activist conservatives, be split 50-50. If tax cuts be your primary thing, then you're unhappy, many conservatives have mix agenda. My position is, hold nose and vote yes. We have no tax cuts and far too much spending that I oppose, that's nature compromise. Every member have little different focus. Souder say he like extra money defense spending, and he like price supports farmers. Hog farmers his district, whose big customers be Japan and China, have be hit hard collapse Asian markets. several Republicans say that bill seem skewed favor Democrats. They cite two reasons: Clinton need curry favor Democrats shore support if House vote impeach him, and republican leaders fear that if they have stand Clinton, they might have force government shutdown and Republicans would be blamed. Clinton be buy votes, say Rep. David Hobson, R-Ohio. He be suck liberal Democrats so they would support him impeachment. Rep. W.J. (Billy) Tauzin, R-La., say leaders seem motivated desire avoid political damage they incur partial government shutdowns 1995 and 1996. He also cite president's need placate leave add costly domestic programs. The combination lessons learn three years ago and scandal president's side yield inevitable result, budget that lean way left, Tauzin said. Still, he say he would probably support bill. It won't be enthusiastically, he said. It won't be hold my nose either. I would have prefer spend more this money tax cut. I think we would have get tax cut, scandal. If president have not be catch scandal, he probably would have follow Dick Morris strategy and move center. Gingrich say he recognize that some conservatives be wary agreement. But he seek reassure them that package serve their interests. He cite $9 billion increase defense spending. And he note that Republicans have block several items, include needle-exchange programs District Columbia, national education test and U.S. contributions United Nations program that pay family planning China, which many Congress object because China have policy coerce abortions and force sterilization. Gingrich say agreement be best that could be achieve when you have conservative Republican Congress and liberal Democratic president. Some conservatives who have be especially critical be more understanding Thursday. Rep. David McIntosh, r-ind., leader conservatives House, have denounce bill earlier Great Society type big-spending program. Friday, meeting Republicans, he said, Our leadership find themselves bad situation and good job. A few remain outright hostile bill, much hasty way which it be cobble together what it contained. Rep. Joe Barton, R-Texas, said: `I'm voting `no' unless something revolutionary happens now and Tuesday. I think it's process that give president ability stonewall very end and then hold us ransom. The republican leadership House and Senate good job limit highway robbery, it's still go too far spend caps. also angry rush endgame be Rep. Gene Taylor, D-Miss., who take House floor and say he could not support final bill. I'm go urge my colleagues vote `no,' Taylor said. We have stay here this long. We can stay little bit longer. And I be go encourage my colleagues continue vote no we be give adequate time study measure that be bring us. Voting mainly party lines question that have become touchstone debate development and preservation wilderness, Senate Thursday approve gravel road remote wildlife habitat Alaska. The road, barely 30 miles long, would slice edge wildlife refuge and wilderness area Aleutian Peninsula, where it would connect isolated village call King Cove long-range air strip town Cold Bay. Without road, its backers say, 700 residents king Cove must continue use unreliable air and boat service emergencies, risk dangerous winds and seas they seek medical evacuation Anchorage. Opponents road call project unjustifiable precedent that threaten seasonal breed grounds protected migratory birds, and they say that improved air or sea service would be good alternative. The vote Thursday, 59-38, be victory state's congressional delegation. But President Clinton likely veto measure, final outcome may depend whether its sponsors can insert road proposal huge spending bill that be likely emerge just Congress head home Nov. 3 elections. Three Republicans vote bill, and six Democrats vote it. The Clinton administration have repeatedly warn that it will veto big spending bill if it contain array anti-environmental provisions that be consideration. Indeed, White House seem be itch partisan fight environmental priorities. But while many Republicans Congress still appear reluctant engage that broad fight, they be willing Thursday cast their lot Senate's two powerful Alaskans, Ted Stevens and Frank Murkowski, Republicans. A companion bill House, sponsor Rep. Don Young Alaska, also Republican, have not come floor. even Sen. John Chafee Rhode Island, leader Republican environmentalists, vote road. last February Chafee's staff have assemble score environmental lobbyists his office plan strategy oppose road, environmental advocates say Thursday. They speculate that senator have change his position out deference power Stevens, who chairman Appropriations Committee exert tremendous influence time when dozen spending bills be their final stages. A Chafee aide say Chafee vote reluctantly road Alaska's senators convince him its merits. Stevens say angry tones Thursday that two-thirds Alaska's land be limits development and that vital health services be be deny his state's residents. We can't use it permission some bureaucrat who be compel extreme environmentalists, he said. They be so extreme that they say this 330,000-acre Izembek refuge, small wilderness Alaska, be so sacrosanct that it can't move its border 60 feet. But Sen. Dale Bumpers, D-Ark., call road project dangerous precedent. Building road wilderness Alaska, no matter how short or how long, would be first time nation we have vote deliberately authorize road wilderness area, Bumpers said. And once you go that road, nobody know where it be go end. struggle meet their fourth deadline federal budget, congressional Republicans and White House officials wrestle Tuesday their differences education, stag events demonstrate support what have become most public and politically high-stakes element budget battle. Negotiators meet night hash out their disagreements aid schools, census and contraceptives. These be big issues that still separate two sides each tried formulate message take home voters Nov. 3 elections. On education, issue that President Clinton have propel forefront talks and which Republicans do not want appear recalcitrant, sides have agree spend more $1 billion disagree how spend it. The president insist money be spend hire 100,000 teachers country so that average class can be reduce 18 students. Republicans, rail Beltway bureaucrats, say that local school districts should decide how money be spent, whether it be teachers or computers. The two sides remain apart several ideological matters, include whether allow federal health plans cover contraceptives and whether allow those few plans religious affiliations refuse cover contraceptives not only religious grounds moral grounds well. And they also be split how conduct census year 2000. This be one thorniest issues. It be not one that move voters, it be vital parties because it help determine their relative strength Congress. House Speaker Newt Gingrich and Erskine Bowles, president's chief staff and top negotiator, meet much day speaker's office, shuttling and out ante-rooms their lieutenants give few clues nitty gritty details their talks. They have give themselves another deadline midnight Wednesday wrap $500 billion-worth spending items, they could easily extend that deadline another day or two. They miss Oct. 1 start fiscal year, provide temporary funding federal government Oct. 9, then Oct. 12, then Wednesday. Some other central issues, such financing International Monetary Fund, be all nail down, neither side be ready declare final deal all other elements budget package be place. We're splitting infinitives, Rep. Dick Armey Texas, Republican majority leader, say approve funds international fund. As they work several issues, republican leaders appear be calculate differences their party that might sour final deal when it arrive House floor more concern Senate floor because Senate have few differences its Republicans and White House.

","Whether to use the 1st surplus in decades for a tax cut, to pay off the national debt, or for new initiatives made the 1998 federal budget negotiations chaotic.The Oct 1 start of the fiscal year was extended 5 times.Major issues were census statistical sampling, federal health plan coverage of contraceptives regardless of religious affiliation, and school aid decisions by the federal gov't or local jurisdictions.Other issues included a Federal Election Commission provision, a road through an Alaskan wildlife refuge, and an airline peanut ban.Committees crafted the budget document after broad agreement was reached when 8 bills were lumped together.","In 1998, for the first time in decades, the US budget negotiators faced a surplus.Both sides said this was harder than a deficit situation, but they finally spent $1.7 trillion.The last seven spending bills were the most difficult and finally were merged into one package.Controversial issues included health insurance paying for contraception, control of new education allocations, an Alaskan wilderness road, whether the 2000 census would include statistical sampling, and establishing an emergency fund.Conservatives felt the results favored the liberals, but both sides were satisfied and glad to finish before Election Day and avoid a government shutdown.","Budget negotiations between the White House and House Republicans were delayed on several issues.At issue were provisions that included requiring Federal Health Insurance providers to provide contraceptives to women as Well as a provision to build a road across a wildlife preserve in Alaska.The contraceptive issue faced an uncertain future while Clinton likely will veto the road.There is disagreement also on how to spend the funding on education.This year's budget discussions also have been hampered because it is the first time since budget procedures were established in 1974 that there has been a surplus, preventing agreement on a budget resolution.","After several deadline extensions, Congressional leaders and the White House agreed on an omnibus spending package, the final portion of the $1.7 trillion budget.It includes more money for education and defense, business tax breaks, and farm aid, as well as funds for Colombia to use in drug interdiction.To offset the new spending, the surplus will be tapped for $20 billion, to the ire of conservatives.This year, without the common goal of reducing the deficit, reaching agreement was very difficult.Policy provisions involving the 2000 census, contraception, and the Alaskan wilderness were also tied to the spending package and were hotly debated."

Yoffie Harvard business school, quote Microsoft executive say that only third version Microsoft's browser be it integrate Windows. Microsoft hurry its first browser offerings market, book says, its race catch Netscape, then take more ambitious approach Internet Explorer 3.0, which be introduce August 1996. In that version it change its software design use program modules, or components, that could be put together and rearragned building blocks. In book, Ben Slivka, Microsoft general manager, be quote saying, IE 3.0 be key thing because we componentized browser, He added, We really make Internet Explorer part Windows platform. The timing could be legally significant because its suit government cite evidence requests August 1996 personal computer makers that want load Netscape's browser their machines instead Microsoft's browser. Microsoft deny requests, insist its browers and Windows be single, integrate product. Microsoft's legal team obtain early manuscript new book last month, issue subpoena Netscape executive who be give confidential copy authors review. Microsoft have also seek transcripts 44 current and former Netscape employees interview authors. A federal judge Boston last week deny Microsoft access that research materials, company may appeal ruling. The new book, publish Free Press imprint Simon &AMP; Schuster, be be hurry print so it can be ship days start Microsoft trial Oct. 19. But already, few quotes netscape executives have leak out. The authors decide send complete manuscript The New York Times and three other news organizations Monday, so that material could be read context. Microsoft intend use material book evidence that Netscape's troubles result largely its missteps rather any alleged predatory practices Microsoft. The book do detail where Netscape stumbled, shift its strategy too and run obstacles its software development efforts. In private antitrust suits, argument that competitor be his bad enemy be establish defense. But legal experts say that defense may well be far less effective federal case which government be seek court-mandated changes Microsoft's business practices rather monetary damages that be goal plaintiffs private cases. It seem me that this debate Netscape's mistakes be total sideshow, say Robert Litan, former senior official Justice Department's antitrust division, who be now Brookings Institution. But Microsoft have big legal team, and it seem they be work every defense they can find. The book quote former Netscape executive, Ram Shriram, say company bungle chance win sizable share browser business America Online Inc. But that be second-chance do deal America Online, lead online service. The government's case focus early deal March 1996, when America Online choose Internet Explorer its preferred browser; that bargain Microsoft agree place startup icon online service main Windows desktop screen prime real estate computing. For book entitle Competing Internet Time, it be intrigue that one its central themes be that Netcape get too wedded notion that Internet revolution would change everything quickly. Microsoft, contrast, stick its three-year planning horizon that enable company, authors write, mesh its short-run tactical plans broader strategic view how win war. The book quote Steve Ballmer, Microsoft's president, saying, The fact matter be that customers can't take cataclysmic change every three months. The organization also can't. You can ship products quickly. But you can't say, `oh, we have radically new strategy' every three months. The government's antitrust scrutiny Microsoft, world's large independent software company, have span Republican and democratic administrations and involve hundreds government lawyers and investigators. But it have no means be example consistent, coordinate public policy. Nor, all accounts, politics. Instead, software industry itself, government's pursuit Microsoft have take leaps, hit dead ends and evolve ways no one could have control or predict back when it start 1989. It be November that year, hot afternoon computer-industry convention Las Vegas, Nev., that Bill Gates, Microsoft's chairman, look he'd be drag news conference senior executive IBM which time dominate Microsoft and entire computer industry. The two companies IBM, then lead maker personal computers and Microsoft, leader pc operate system software be collaborate design and market new operating system call OS/2. But Microsoft be also begin sell compete product, Windows. The industry trade press be full worried articles: which system be go become new standard? With Gates stand uncomfortably his side, James Cannavino, IBM divisional president, say that two companies want clear air. OS/2 be future, he said. As Windows, he added, it would remain niche product under-equipped computers. Windows, he asserted, would never receive all advanced features os/2. gate certainly not look happy. But he not disagree. The news conference get little attention, just few articles deep newspapers and trade publications. But few weeks later, Norris Washington, senior antitrust lawyer Federal Trade Commission, happen read one those articles, Byte magazine. IBM and Microsoft have now define their unified vision graphical operating environments, article said, and it look sort U.S. economic model, divide lower-, middle- and upper-class products. As Washington saw it, IBM and Microsoft be collude divide operating-system market potential violation antitrust law. Soon FTC staff open investigation Microsoft and IBM And that small first step, Microsoft have be unrelenting scrutiny federal antitrust investigators constantly evolve series allegations and charges, month month, year year, last nine years. now come antitrust trial schedule begin Monday, multiplicity charges weave threads draw more dozen different investigative inquiries that nine-year span. Microsoft, today most fear company software business and carry stock-market value nearly $234 billion, presents huge and highly visible antitrust target. Yet, while company's allies ask, What be Clinton administration's political agenda go Microsoft? answer seem be there be none. In interviews, more dozen current and former senior antitrust officials whether friends government or Microsoft all say Justice Department's antitrust suit be natural outgrowth previous investigations. As politics, all officials agree that antitrust division operate independent administration's political considerations. Charles Rule be assistant attorney general who head antitrust division Bush administration, and he be now Washington lawyer who serve adviser and advocate Microsoft. When I be there, Rule say his Justice days, White House be punctilious terms never get involve we decide do. There be no communication antitrust and other branches government. ask if he believe that policy have change Clinton administration, he said: not really. I've see nothing suggest it. Joel Klein head antitrust division now, and interview deal his division's role Clinton administration's technology policy, not specifically relate Microsoft case, he said: There be no statutory restriction, practical matter, civil and criminal prosecutions be invariably carry out any political contact. Klein said, way examples, that he might discuss merger cases involve military or aviation industries Defense Department or Transportation Department. But never White House, he said. For significant case, we might call White House and say `an hour now we be go hold press conference.' The last time there be any interference, he added, be Dita Beard-ITT case. Mrs. Beard, lobbyist ITT Corp., be accuse 1972 have write memo say that $400,000 donation Republican National Convention have go long way settle antitrust suits bring company Nixon administration's Justice Department. The authenticity memo be never proved, and Mrs. Beard always deny write it. In any case, Klein says, Watergate, it's be immaculate. In case Microsoft, neither President Clinton nor Vice President Al Gore have ever volunteer comment. In answer question news conference May, just suit be filed, Clinton said: I have take view that I should not comment matters Justice Department. At this time, I do not think I should depart that policy this case, though it obviously will have big impact important sector our economy. But I have say, base what I know date, I have confidence way antitrust division Justice Department have handle matter. Since then, Clinton have say nothing else case, publicly least. And Gore, who generally represent administration technology issues, have never comment all. In Rule's opinion, administration would be foolish involve itself, if it be politically acceptable do so. It would be little odd administration push Justice Department this suit, he said. It would be policy mistake and political mistake. I would be hard press explain why they would do that. Taking sides highly charge technology world be dangerous, particularly Democrats rely Silicon Valley companies political donations and support. In fact, present and former government officials all say suit be simply natural extension inquiries conduct last nine years. They begin FTC. Soon Washington read that article Byte, FTC staff open investigation Windows-OS/2 question. But have happen so years, turns market make initial inquiry irrelevant. Microsoft abandon its agreement IBM, and Windows quickly grow be industry standard, while OS/2 remain cipher. But that issue faded, once government investigators begin look Microsoft they find other things that trouble them. In 1991 Washington, who still work FTC, inform Microsoft that investigation be be expanded. The agency, his letter said, be now try determine whether Microsoft be use its dominant position operating-systems software stifle competition other areas. That general idea lie heart present suit. One former senior FTC official say commission staff have confidence case realize that Reagan-era commissioners, who have approve any suit, might have different view. We know commission might have difficulty monopolization case, former official said. They hadn't bring case years. And fact, 1993 commission vote 2-2 question whether file formal charges. The deadlock serve dismissal. Then, few months later, Justice Department decide pick case. It be far most cases we got, recall Robert Litan, former senior official Justice Department's antitrust division who be now Brookings Institution. Usually case would be two or three people complain and few documents, he said. But this be fully research record. They give us files and brief us what they have done. The Justice Department lawyers pick same thread. The general idea our inquiry, Litan said, be that they should not be allow use their monopoly operate systems cement monopoly other areas. In 1995, Microsoft and government reach consent agreement which company promise stop forcing pc makers buy one copy Microsoft operating system every computer sell instead one every computer which operate system, MS-DOS or Windows, be installed. The company also agree stop tying sale one software product sale another. The charges present suit be similar many ways. even agreement, government investigations continued. That same year, Justice Department investigators show offices Netscape Communications Corp. first time ask questions their next line inquiry. America Online have be complaining, senior Netscape executive recalled, because Microsoft be bundle Microsoft Network, compete online service, Windows. once more, market forces overtake investigation. The Microsoft Network never grow particularly popular while America Online prosper and grew. But, not surprisingly, new complaints fill void. In May 1995, Anne Bingaman, assistant attorney general who head antitrust division, remarked: We get complaints Microsoft all time. We have become kind microsoft complaints center. And we take them very seriously. In 1996, Netscape's first complaint arrived. In letter Justice Department, Netscape say that Microsoft be use its dominance personal-computer operate systems force or persuade computer makers favor Microsoft's browser, use explore World Wide Web, one market Netscape. The next year Justice Department formally charge Microsoft violate consent agreement tie sales Windows installation company's Web browser new computers. It seem slam-dunk violation consent decree, natural extension that case, recall Litan, who have leave department then. A Federal District Court judge agreed, Appeals Court panel overturn that rule this summer. In meantime, last May Justice Department and 20 state attorneys general file their new suit Microsoft, which be schedule trial Monday. It contend that Microsoft have engage bundling, tie and other predatory behavior similar many ways numerous previous allegations and investigations last nine years. A good part this case be just Round II case we deal Round I, early 1990s, Litan said. Or, former senior FTC official put it, there's certainly common thread that run all way here. But years that thread have be twisted, pull and spun hundreds different hands. The case United States vs. Microsoft Corp., government's most aggressive move monopolist almost 25 years, be play out century antitrust laws so broadly worded and court rulings so ambiguous that sides be cite same rulings support their opposing arguments. Whatever outcome trial, schedule begin Monday U.S. District Court Washington, almost certain appeal will leave Supreme Court task bring legal order 100 years clash antitrust doctrines. The case focus Microsoft's Windows, operate system that control 90 percent all personal computers sell today. The government say its objective be curb illegal monopolistic business practices that threaten render large parts economy vulnerable vicissitudes single company. Microsoft assert that case be intend give government control which feature can be add Windows. however grand economic stakes, legal dispute be narrow. The government say that Microsoft's contracts computer manufacturers and companies that provide access Internet illegally stifle competition. The contracts prohibit manufacturers substitute Netscape Communications Corp.'s Navigator browser Microsoft's Internet Explorer. They also prohibit them remove Windows main screen, or desktop, links sit World Wide Web run Microsoft or its partners. Microsoft's contracts companies that connect people Internet and businesses that sell goods and services Web require favored treatment Internet Explorer Navigator exchange links Windows desktop. In wake lawsuit, Microsoft have voluntarily drop some these requirements, though it could reinstate them will. Microsoft say that its contracts be legal because they produce tangible benefits customers, include easy Internet access. The Justice Department say that bundle Explorer Windows 95 and inclusion browser part windows 98 amount tying, illegal practice that force customers one product purchase another. The contracts manufacturers and Internet services be illegal, government says, because they be intend not only create monopoly browser market protect Microsoft's exist monopoly operate systems. The latter threat be key, accord Justice Department. Browsers have potential, operate system, act software platform which other programs run. so contracts intend drive browsers out market would also insulate Windows monopoly. Many antitrust experts say problem facing Justice Department be that courts have provide no clear definition tying and no clear guidelines determine when contracts be illegally exclusionary. Professor Lawrence White New York University, who be chief economist Justice Department's antitrust division early 1980s, say that courts treat tie unusual practice when fact it be ubiquitous. No one, he said, would challenge right manufacturers tie erasers tip pencils, tires automobile or buttons shirts. His point, share widely economists, be that some tie benefits consumers if, example, it results products that be easy use or enables company recover development costs. But tying can be bad if it lock monopoly power. The courts, White says, have not offer enough guidance distinguish good tying bad, which be nub legal dispute. Microsoft say it need only show that bundle Windows and Explorer pass what might be call gross consumer benefits test that it offer immediate benefit, whether or not it cause long-term damage competition and, therefore, ultimately consumers. The Justice Department say that Microsoft's practices must clear high hurdle: yield net consumer benefits that be immediate and large enough balance possible long-term harm competition. So which test consumer benefits satisfies antitrust laws? The simple answer be that no one know sure, which be why sides can reasonably cite same cases fear embarrassment. Consider 1985 case, Aspen Skiing Co. vs. Aspen Highlands Skiing Corp., and 1951 case, Lorain Journal Co. vs. United States. In first, Aspen Skiing, owner three major ski run Aspen, Colo. monopolist have years sell ticket cooperation Aspen Highlands, competitor, that give skiers access companies' runs. When Aspen Skiing unilaterally cancel agreement, its rival's revenues shrivel and rival sued. The Supreme Court rule that Aspen Skiing have violate antitrust laws because there be no evidence its action help consumers. In Lorain Journal case, only local newspaper Lorain, Ohio, refuse sell advertising companies that advertise new radio station. Here, too, Supreme Court rule that exclusionary practice nothing benefit consumers. Indeed, Aspen Skiing, court force monopolist do business its rival, precedent that augur well Justice Department, which seek force Microsoft install Netscape's browser alongside its own. But Charles Rule, legal consultant Microsoft, say that cases courts throw out exclusionary practices only because they offer no consumer benefit. The courts, he argues, never pounce practices that result low prices or good products or service. Nor courts either case call balance immediate benefits hypothetical long-term harm. Rule argue that Microsoft's practices produce demonstrable consumer benefits. Besides, he says, actions take The Lorain Journal or Aspen Skiing, Microsoft's contracts do not prevent consumers instal Netscape's browser or use Web sites Microsoft's rivals. In truth, though, neither case answer what consumer benefit test should apply product design. In Jefferson Parish Hospital District no. 2 et al. vs. Hyde, another case cite sides, Supreme Court 1984 recognize that surgeons and anesthesiologists provide integrate service. Yet, court said, hospital monopoly power would still not be allow force surgical patients use its panel anesthesiologists if consumers want purchase two services separately. That principle could undercut Microsoft's defense that functional interdependence Windows and Explorer require bundling. But Microsoft will point strong concur opinion that call tough standard government meet when it allege tying. Microsoft will also draw support several court rulings that allow IBM change design its computers ways that make it hard vendors attach peripheral equipment. But perhaps Microsoft's best argument be that nowhere have government identify single case which court explicitly call throw out tied product basis balance test. The courts, Microsoft will emphasize, steer clear redesign technically sophisticated products. The Justice Department's rejoinder be note that sole purpose antitrust law be protect consumers, so it make no sense bless practices that provide dollar's worth benefits today but, stamp out competition, drive prices $1,000 tomorrow. The Justice Department will ask court least insist that monopolists use least exclusionary means possible achieve services they provide customers. Experts agree that courts will subject Microsoft's restrictive contracts Internet companies balance test. But exactly how court will decide whether consumers be help or hurt be grabs. A balancing test would have courts weigh immediate benefits consumers one-click access Internet sites and features bundle windows-explorer package harm time diminish competition markets browsers and operate systems. But test that make good sense theory can prove fiendishly difficult use practice. Balancing tests be impossibly difficult and arbitrary, say Rep. Thomas Campbell, R-Calif., who be former law professor Stanford University. The practical effect balancing be hand defendants Microsoft almost certain victory. Microsoft argues and many antitrust experts agree that courts have fact gravitate away balance test simpler predation test exclusionary contracts. Under this standard, contract be illegal only if it be intend drive out competition and thus pave way monopolist raise prices later. Microsoft will have easy time defend itself charge predation, which amount victimize its customers, it would defend itself charge that its bundled product do consumers slightly more harm good. The antitrust record, say William Baxter, who head antitrust division President Reagan, be litter contradictory, ambiguous and sometimes nonsensical verdicts. He and other legal experts agree that if nothing else, that record leave plenty legal leeway Supreme Court, should it hear Microsoft case, stiffen spine antitrust law. The legal tool that government be use its assault Microsoft Corp. Sherman Antitrust Act 1890 be brief, vague and malleable. The combination have mean that this bedrock statute antitrust policy have be turns toothless and powerful years, depend politics and economics day interpret courts. Sponsored Sen. John Sherman, Ohio Republican who be young brother Civil War general William Tecumseh Sherman, act be pass nod popular backlash rise industrial trusts oil, steel and railroads. Farmers, laborers and small-business owners sizable vote groups resent trusts vehicles concentrate power. But trusts, large national hold corporations, be view many engines modernization and industrialization. Economists time oppose Sherman Act, and law that Congress pass be vaguely word compromise. No one know what impact it would have, one senator, quote Matthew Josephson's The Robber Barons, explain that nearly everyone agree that something must be fling out appease restive masses. The act's two key provisions, Sections 1 and 2, mention conspiracy, restraint trade and attempt monopolize. yet while Sherman Act be now interpreted Magna Carta competition, it never use term. After it be passed, critics trusts deride impenetrable language Sherman Act and call it Swiss Cheese Act. But early 1900s, political climate have changed. The grow antagonism trusts, especially income gaps widened, be tap avowed trustbuster, Theodore Roosevelt, who become president 1901. The Sherman Act have always be elastic piece social legislation, use attack perceive exploitation and aggregation power, say Eleanor Fox, professor New York University Law School. The model trust and principal target trustbusters be Standard Oil. Shrewdly, Roosevelt make distinction good trusts, which thrive because their superior efficiency, and bad trusts, which grow not result inevitable economic forces because unfair business practices. Throughout 1880s and '90s, Standard Oil's rivals have complain company and business practices its founder, John D. Rockefeller. But those years, price kerosene burn light nation's homes decline steadily. so standard Oil, it could could reasonably be argued, be enterprising monopoly. In early 1900s, though, Standard Oil raise prices United States prop its profits time it be engage price war Royal Dutch/Shell Europe, where Standard Oil face genuine competition. When consumers be hurt Standard Oil monopoly, popular support antitrust action company swelled, encourage Roosevelt and his successor, William Howard Taft. The federal suit Standard Oil be file 1906, and Supreme Court approve breakup company 1911. Standard Oil and Microsoft case, historians observe, have some common themes. Both be dominant companies their day, and Bill Gates, Microsoft chairman, have be call modern Rockefeller. But there be no presidential involvement and there be no real consumer dissatisfaction Microsoft case, say Ron Chernow, author Titan, best-selling biography Rockefeller. And Rockefeller, Chernow added, never go kind honeymoon period widespread public adulation and favorable press coverage Bill Gates have had. In summer 1995, whiff revolution be air Silicon Valley. The Internet offer new deal computing, fresh opportunity entrepreneurs try break Microsoft Corp.'s firm grip personal computer software business. lead challenge be Netscape Communications Corp., whose software browse World Wide Web have ignite Internet boom. Netscape chairman James Clark speak boldly attack Microsoft head-on. He borrow imagery movie Star Wars, refer Microsoft Death Star and Netscape leader rebel alliance. Microsoft answer vengeance. It dispatch hundreds programmers work compete browser and pour many millions dollars market it. It prod computer makers and distribute its browser, fold browser its industry-dominant Windows operating system and give browser away free campaign intend cut their air supply, senior Microsoft executive describe it. But not only competitors Netscape have encounter Microsoft's force. Microsoft's partners, its corporate customers and professional investors who finance new ventures have all collide it. A close look Microsoft's no-holds-barred push Internet software business offers window ways company use its market muscle influence behavior virtually every player industry. Some cases recount here figure prominently suit bring Justice Department and 20 states, schedule go trial this month, charge that Microsoft times go too far and violated antitrust laws. Regardless legal outcome, previously unreported details incidents suit and other examples provide more complete picture Microsoft action. When Compaq Computer Corp. consider load Netscape's browser instead Microsoft's its personal computers, Microsoft threaten stop selling its Windows operating system Compaq. The company quickly change its mind. After Spyglass Inc. begin supply Microsoft its early browser technology, Microsoft announce that it would give away its browser free. The timing come rude surprise its partner Spyglass. The company lose most its revenues almost overnight, technology, which it have also be license companies Microsoft, suddenly become available free. When America Online Inc., which compete fiercely Microsoft's online service and electronic commerce divisions, go shop browser technology, Microsoft make offer that be too good pas up: If America Online use Microsoft's browser main one its millions subscribers, Microsoft would give America Online prime placement desktop screen all personal computers use Windows. When Intel Corp. begin develop its Internet software, Microsoft complained. Intel, lead maker microprocessors that serve electronic brains most personal computers run Windows, pull back. The chip maker decide that its lucrative hand-in-glove partnership Microsoft take priority. Microsoft's reach computing have become so pervasive that nearly every year now, Silicon Valley's top venture capitalists meet privately team top Microsoft executives learn company's plans. The goal, one venture investor observed, be stay out way steamroller. Microsoft adamantly deny that it have break any laws these or similar situations. The company play game business hard, and its executives acknowledge that apology. Yes, Microsoft says, rivals may suffer and partners may be irritate occasionally. But company insist its actions be guide its main corporate goal bring new technology inexpensively and conveniently millions people who use its software. most people computer industry say that live Microsoft's world mean routinely make accommodations it. Microsoft's power emanate its near-monopoly market personal computer operate systems, master control programs that run computers. Because it own operate system, Microsoft be essential utility information age, say James Moore, president Geopartners Research Inc., technology consult firm. It act kind gatekeeper pipeline compute innovation, sit there and decide whether help some innovation or slow it down. For months, Microsoft and Netscape have talk and off, circle each other warily. But event that would define them unflinching rivals be meet June 21, 1995, second-floor conference room Netscape's headquarters Mountain View, Calif. That meeting, accord Justice Department and 20 states sue Microsoft, be high-tech equivalent storied gatherings smoke-filled railroad cars that inspire passage nation's antitrust laws century ago. On that day, they say, Microsoft make Netscape illegal offer divvy market Internet browse software, collusion pact that Netscape rejected. Microsoft replies that prosecutors be misinterpret routine meeting software business and that company have never try divide browser market. Bill Gates, Microsoft's chairman and principal strategist, not attend Mountain View gathering, he consult telephone Microsoft team. Two people who attend that June meeting have be name witnesses trial schedule begin next week: Netscape president James Barksdale and Daniel Rosen, Microsoft's general manager new technology. In trial, government will contend that Microsoft present Netscape all-or-nothing offer, accord people who have be question federal investigation. rely heavily notes take meeting Netscape executive vice president Marc Andreessen and testimony Barksdale, prosecutors be expect assert that Microsoft proposal have several elements, incentives and requirements. Microsoft, accord people questioned government, would invest Netscape, take 15 20 percent stake, give Netscape technical information and fine-tune Microsoft's operate systems so that Netscape's software would run good Windows. In return, people say, Netscape would give Microsoft seat its board, license its technology Microsoft, give Microsoft advance knowledge its product-development efforts and not make browser next generation Microsoft operate system, Windows 95, which be ship two months June 1995 meeting. And Microsoft, people added, what it have always deny it do used access its technology powerful lever business negotiations, offering Netscape preferential access Windows application program interfaces, or APIs, link that enable other companies' programs run smoothly Windows operate system. By turn deal, Netscape, they say, would not have that preferred access Microsoft technology threat that Microsoft fiercely deny making. Barksdale, Netscape's 55-year-old chief executive, tell colleague that encounter Microsoft June 1995 be damned meeting I've ever attend 35 years business. have Netscape accept Microsoft's offer, it would have have Microsoft's money and its endorsement. Netscape would have also be free sell its browser use earlier versions Windows and use other operate systems Apple's Macintosh and Unix, powerful system use mainly corporations and research labs. But if we have license our technology Microsoft and step aside, best we could have hop be become company sales $100 million or so and hop be buy out Microsoft, say Clark, former computer scientist Stanford University who found Silicon Graphics Inc., computer graphics pioneer, start Netscape. We didn't start Netscape that. For any company, meeting Microsoft be charge affair. Every computing device keyboards disk drives, and every software program games browsers, must mesh smoothly Microsoft's Windows operate system. This be necessary make computers reliable and easy use, it also give Microsoft its role industry's gatekeeper. And Microsoft itself make all manner software products operate system, other companies be put uneasy position require Microsoft's cooperation be able compete it. And software industry, where every program be render digital code 1's and 0's, lines that divide competition and cooperation be blurred. The talk that line Microsoft-Netscape meeting focus division operate system platform, computer terms and application programs, sometimes call solutions, that run top operating system. The government suit state that swear testimony, Chris Jones, Microsoft manager who attend meeting, admit that Microsoft `absolutely' intend persuade Netscape not compete. Microsoft reads Jones' testimony very differently, evidence mainly company's clarify its position. If Netscape stay applications or solutions side operate system, two companies could be partners, Microsoft said. But if Netscape try become player platform space, they would compete. Microsoft release portions Jones deposition September evidence that government have quote Microsoft manager out context. Q. Do you recall any discussion desire anybody part Microsoft who be participate be able persuade or influence Netscape not compete? A. Absolutely. But again, persuade sense force or persuade sense of, hey, we think we can have great business relationship together. Later deposition, Justice Department lawyer ask Jones whether any Microsoft executives intend suggest that there would be any consequences Netscape or its business if Netscape choose go platform direction you've describe earlier opposed solutions direction. Jones replied: The conversation be something following: `we're platform business. We're go invest heavily this part platform because we feel it's critical our technologies. That's do deal.' And we're ask them: `What be your business? be your business platforms or solutions? If it's platforms, we're platforms business. We're competing.' Microsoft portrays such comments innocuous statements fact. But Netscape, same remarks could be take warning, if not threat. This be because Internet browse software have potential become alternative platform Windows operate system. The browser, sit top operating system, could supplant Windows main desktop screen users' machines and main layer program start other software applications. In addition, Netscape's browser could serve powerful platform distributing and run Java, Internet program language develop Sun Microsystems Inc., Microsoft rival. In technical terms, Netscape's upstart platform could replace Microsoft's APIs essential utility computing. Indeed, Andreessen have boast public Netscape's ambition relegate Microsoft's Windows so much software plumb browser. By June meeting, Microsoft certainly view Netscape serious potential challenger Windows, corporate crown jewel. On May 26, 1995, internal memo, The Internet Tidal Wave, Gates wrote: A new competitor `born' Internet be Netscape. Their browser be dominant 70 percent usage share, allow them determine which network extensions will catch on. Netscape's strategy, Gates wrote, be move key API browser commoditize underlie operate system. THE BROADER INQUIRY: GOVERNMENT SEES arm-twisting The federal government and states have recently broaden their allegations Microsoft add evidence that it try bully Intel, Apple Computer Inc. and other companies squelch competition. They say that Netscape meet new evidence fits pattern behavior Microsoft, which have repeatedly try limit competition strong-arming competitors and partners. One episode that fit pattern, prosecutors contend, be effort Microsoft pressure Intel shelve development multimedia and Internet software and limit its cooperation Netscape. Intel's main business be make microprocessor chips that act electronic brains most computers that run windows operate system. Indeed, fortunes Intel and Microsoft be so closely align that two companies be sometimes referred single, powerful entity, Wintel. But Intel also employ hundreds software engineers, mainly its Intel Architecture Labs Hillsboro, Ore. And while Intel and Microsoft be partners, they have also have their conflicts, typically direction and pace which certain innovations should be introduce personal computer industry, which they dominate together. Federal and state investigators have focus Microsoft's strong reaction work be do Intel's software engineers sentiment express no uncertain terms meet Intel's Santa Clara, Calif., headquarters Aug. 2, 1995. The contentious session be attend several executives Intel and Microsoft, include Gates and Intel chairman Andrew Grove. An internal Intel memo state that Gates make vague threats support Intel's competitors and that he be livid Intel's investments Internet and want them stopped. Later, Intel pull back its multimedia and Internet software development. Steven McGeady, Intel vice president who attend August 1995 meeting, be schedule appear witness government. Microsoft reply that government's accounts meetings those Netscape and Intel be fanciful distortions, create use biased selection documents and witnesses. The government's case, Microsoft asserts, betrays utter failure accept computer-industry reality that Microsoft routinely meet companies make sure their software and equipment will work well Windows. Sometimes talks, Microsoft says, go include further levels cooperation license technology or Microsoft investment, company discuss Netscape. In trial, Microsoft be expect argue its advance browser market be result its business acumen and Netscape's missteps. To document Netscape's errors, Microsoft issue subpoena last month and obtain unpublished manuscript new book, compete Internet Time: Lessons From Netscape and Its Battle With Microsoft, which be base hundreds interviews current and former Netscape executives. The book do chronicle mistakes make Netscape. But its authors, Michael Cusumano Massachusetts Institute Technology's Sloan School Management and David Yoffie Harvard Business School, think Microsoft be hardly blameless. Microsoft's take-no-prisoners strategy backfired, all invite retaliation competitors, government and customers, Yoffie said. emphasize that he be offer no legal judgment, Yoffie added, I think Microsoft could have achieve 90 percent what it cross line much it did. THE SPYGLASS LINK: REWARDS AND PERILS OF A PARTNERSHIP On April 6, 1994, Gates and 20 Microsoft executives gather daylong retreat not far company's headquarters Redmond, Wash. The subject be Internet and how it might revolutionize computer software business. Few concrete plans be make that day, Microsoft executives insist that direction be set. Our vision outset be unite two worlds Windows desktop and Internet, say Steven Sinofsky, Microsoft executive who attend meeting. yet Microsoft badly trail Netscape browser field. To hasten its entry, Microsoft license its early browsing software Spyglass Inc. Naperville, Ill. The first meeting two companies be initiate Spyglass April 1994. At time, it be tiny company and eager do deal Microsoft. Spyglass be select commercial licensee browser technology develop National Center Supercomputing University Illinois. In summer 1994, Douglas Colbeth, president Spyglass, meet Clark Netscape O'Hare International Airport Chicago. The two men talk United Airlines Red Carpet Room, reserve business-class passengers, and Colbeth recall Clark tell him, We're go take Microsoft head-on. At time, Colbeth recall think himself, Great, now Microsoft will really want license me. Today, he noted: Remember, we be company couple dozen people and almost no money bank. Netscape have Jim Clark, his money and reputation, and big-time venture capital back Silicon Valley. Netscape have very different agenda. By July 1994, Microsoft have become quite interested Spyglass technology, Colbeth says, and two companies sign their first licensing agreement December. Microsoft, Colbeth recalls, always tell him that it would eventually fold browser technology its operating system, its timing be accelerate Netscape's rapid rise. Microsoft be initially hop charge browser, Colbeth said. But Dec. 7, 1995, Gates declare that Microsoft would not only deeply integrate its browser Windows would give it away. The announcement catch industry, Colbeth, surprise. At time, Spyglass have license its technology 82 other companies, include IBM and Digital Equipment, use their software products license revenue stream $20 million year. As result Microsoft's move, Spyglass saw those revenues vanish year, small Internet software companies go out business and big customers shift Microsoft's free browser. Spyglass slash its payroll and scramble new niches software industry replace its lose sales, which it succeed do eventually. Whenever you license technology Microsoft, you have understand it can someday build it itself, drop it operate system and put you out that business, Colbeth said. THE NONOPTION COMPAQ: SUDDENLY SEES THE LIGHT Well 1996, Netscape's share browser market continue rise, while Microsoft make little headway, though its browser be free. Industry analysts and trade magazines agree that Netscape's browser be clear technical leader. In April 1996, Netscape's Navigator be use 87 percent people browse Web, compare 4 percent use Microsoft's Internet Explorer, accord Zona Research. So big personal computer maker, Compaq, think it make sense give customers Netscape's browser instead Microsoft's. But Microsoft would not stand that and Compaq have no choice give in. In June 1996, Compaq want not only load more popular Netscape browser its machines also remove icon Microsoft's Internet Explorer, which be deliver computer maker windows 95. Microsoft inform Compaq that if it remove Internet Explorer, computer maker would lose its license Windows, say Stephen Decker, Compaq's director software procurement, testimony federal investigators. The ultimatum Microsoft be deliver bluntly letter headed, Notice Intent Terminate License Agreement. Faced be deny essential operating system, Compaq quickly reverse course and keep Internet Explorer icon. Microsoft assert that Windows and Internet Explorer be single product and that Microsoft alone define what be product. nothing its contracts, Microsoft adds, prohibit computer makers include compete technologies. While cutoff letter Microsoft send Compaq seem unnecessarily hardball tactic when deal its large corporate customer, Microsoft chief operate officer Bob Herbold insist that take one letter here or one snippet e-mail there try portray Microsoft arrogant company be unfair. note that Compaq executive be witness Microsoft, Herbold said, We be totally dependent tremendous relationships key companies Compaq. At Netscape, however, Compaq episode be watershed. That be singular act that get me go Justice Department, Barksdale recalled. Barksdale say he regard Microsoft's tactic forcing Compaq buy its browser condition obtain essential product, Windows operate system, illegal act and absolute proof that Microsoft be monopolist. After investigate incident, Justice Department and states agree Barksdale that Microsoft be illegally tie sale one product another. Microsoft reply that it have long history add new features its operating system. And outset, Microsoft says, it intend that Windows and its Internet Explorer browser would be seamlessly integrated, they be now windows 98. Thus, Microsoft insists, there be no product-tying violation antitrust laws. In separate case, federal appeals court side Microsoft, uphold principle that company could put it want its operating system and declare it single product. But June 1996, when Compaq want offer Netscape product instead Microsoft's browser, most industry experts view browser and operate system two different software programs. It take long time integration strategy play out, say former senior Microsoft researcher. Back then, integration be basically bolt browser Windows. THE `BALANCING ACT': AMERICA ONLINE TOSSES IN TOWEL America Online chairman Stephen Case refer deal Microsoft delicate balance act. That balance swing sharply fall 1995 spring 1996, when Microsoft use lure give America Online feature place Windows desktop ultimate bargaining chip. To gain access computing's most coveted real estate, America Online agree make Microsoft's Internet Explorer main browser its online subscribers, who now number more 13 million. Yet throughout 1995, Microsoft prepare introduce Windows 95, most significant improvement ever its operating system, Case be knock door Justice Department. His complaint be that Microsoft be go place its new online service, Microsoft Network, direct competitor America Online, prominently desktop screen Windows 95, which be introduce August. This bundling tactic use industry-dominant operate system market Microsoft Network, or MSN, Case argued, give Microsoft unfair advantage young fast-growing online business. The Justice Department listen and investigated. But ultimately, government decide take any action. At America Online's headquarters Vienna, Va., Microsoft be fear and loathe time. America Online have designate Microsoft watcher, young M.B.A. who track its adversary's every move. Above desk his small, windowless office be picture Gates. Beneath picture, large block letters, be words THE ENEMY. Though America Online be clear leader online services business, it have ample reason worry all-out assault rival rich and aggressive microsoft. When he have visit Microsoft headquarters couple years earlier, Case recalled, Gates have bluntly assess Microsoft's options say he could buy 20 percent America Online, all it or enter online business his and bury you. A threat or merely statement facts? A bit both, Case say recently. But he be mainly articulate what everybody that meet kind intuitively understood. Yet 1996, Microsoft and America Online find they have reason cooperate. With explode popularity Internet's World Wide Web, conventional online companies, America Online and Compuserve, have provide their customers Internet access well their services. America Online have its browser, keep pace rapidly advance technology it make sense do deal Netscape or Microsoft. For software companies, deal America Online, which have 5 million subscribers time, could mean big surge browser use and market share. Netscape seem natural partner America Online, companies be Microsoft rivals. On March 11, America Online announce that it would buy Netscape technology, it be standard licensing deal base payment-for-use formula. The next day, America Online announce more significant deal Microsoft make its browser default technology browser America Online subscribers would use unless they specifically ask Netscape's Navigator. To win deal, Microsoft offer give America Online start-up icon Windows desktop precisely kind equal treatment main Windows screen that Case have ask Justice Department require Microsoft. After we agree its Internet Explorer browser, Microsoft allow us be bundle Windows desktop, Case said. It be example Microsoft's pragmatic side. The pragmatic decision be that paramount corporate goal be increase browser market share protect mainstay software business. As result, its new online service, MSN, would have sacrifice important marketing advantage its main rival, America Online. It be Bill's decision, say former MSN general manager Russell Siegelman, refer Gates. He send me e-mail it. He say he didn't think it would hurt MSN that much. I disagree him. To other Microsoft executives, Gates express different view likely impact MSN. He tell senior vice president Brad Silverberg that put America Online Windows desktop would amount put bullet MSN's head, accord deposition take Justice Department. In antitrust suit, government assert that America Online deal show how Microsoft use power its Windows monopoly give it edge browser war Netscape. David Colburn, senior vice president America Online who take part browser negotiations Microsoft, be witness government. Today, Microsoft have overhaul its Internet strategy focus mainly build popular special-interest Web sit fields travel, personal finance, automobile retailing and news. And it be put these sites, e-mail and search features, all-in-one site that use name MSN.com. I still regard Microsoft primary threat, Case observed. Microsoft have history get it right long run, and there's no reason think it won't this business well. We will always be Microsoft's cross hairs. THE LESSON: DON'T CONFRONT A STEAMROLLER At Netscape's headquarters Silicon Valley, strategy today be one avoid head-to-head competition Microsoft whenever possible. Don't do something that be Microsoft's path that's lesson learned, observe Clark, Netscape chairman. Silicon Valley's venture capitalists, investors who finance so many nation's high-tech startups, generally follow Netscape formula these days. Yet that still leave ample room prosper. For while compete directly Microsoft be dangerous, software industry whole be engine wealth creation, job generation and technical innovation. And there be ambivalent side venture community's relationship Microsoft. For if start-up cannot steer clear Microsoft entirely, favor option be be buy out Microsoft, which have scoop many fledgling companies way acquire promise technology and people. Microsoft understand start-up innovation and how co-opt start-up innovation better any other high-tech company, say James Breyer, manage partner Accel Partners, venture capital firm. As Microsoft have grown, it have come be see not merely competitor force nature that shape business environment, weather front. Microsoft be incredibly pervasive, say Stewart Alsop, partner New Enterprise Associates, venture capital firm Menlo Park, Calif. At board meetings companies which his firm have invested, two issues always come up, he said: One be price company's stock, and other be what Microsoft be go do. In last few years, Microsoft have offer its guidance almost yearly meetings senior Microsoft executives and lead venture capitalists. The meetings be part Microsoft's effort improve its sometimes prickly relations Silicon Valley. We work hard provide clarity where we're go and where we're not going, say Greg Maffei, Microsoft's chief financial officer. last year's conference take place October Quadrus office building Sand Hill Road Menlo Park, Wall Street high-tech venture investing. Maffei lead team five Microsoft executives who appear group 40 venture capitalists, one whom stand and ask question that seem be minds many his peers: How do I invest company that stay out way steamroller? Maffei, recall one person who attend meeting, stood and deliver brief lecture businesses that Microsoft be likely avoid. His list include specialized software manufacturing, human resources management, computer-aided design and others. But, this person noted, broad swaths industry appear be designate limits include new software platforms that might compete Microsoft's personal computer operate system. At one point, Ruthann Quindlen, partner Institutional Venture Partners, lean Vinod Khosla, co-founder Sun Microsystems and partner venture capital firm Kleiner Perkins Caufield &AMP; Byers, and say quietly, I guess that leave us wash machines and toasters. Following be text first two sections Sherman Act, pass Congress 1890. As foundation which federal antitrust law have be built, act have be amend several times elevate crime felony, increase fines and prison terms individuals and set fines corporations convict violate it. In case Microsoft, government have invoke Sherman Act file civil suit that seek change company's business practices, not criminal suit that seek financial penalties. An Act Protect Trade And Commerce Against Unlawful Restraints and Monopolies: Section 1. Every contract, combination form trust or otherwise, or conspiracy, restraint trade or commerce several States, or foreign nations, be hereby declared be illegal. Every person who shall make any such contract or engage any such combination or conspiracy, shall be deem guilty misdemeanor, and, conviction thereof, shall be punish fine not exceed five thousand dollars, or imprisonment not exceed one year, or say punishments, discretion court. section 2. Every person who shall monopolize, or attempt monopolize, or combine or conspire any other person or persons, monopolize any part trade commerce several States, or foreign nations, shall be deem guilty misdemeanor, and, conviction thereof, shall be punish fine not exceed five thousand dollars, or imprisonment not exceed one year, or say punishments, discretion court. Will it matter consumers that Bill gate isn't nice guy? Until last week, most Americans think Gates, chairman Microsoft Corp., genius and innovator. A nerd perhaps also self-styled visionary who almost single-handedly unlocked power personal computer. Monday, however, Washington courtroom, Justice Department begin paint different, darker portrait Gates. In antitrust suit bring department and 20 states, man whose company command 97 percent share market personal computer operate systems be be depict nixonian schemer who will go almost any length crush his competition. Product innovation, suit argues, be not sufficient weapon Gates. Flashing back and forth snippets Gates' videotape deposition and e-mail messages he have send that contradict his testimony, government seek establish pattern threats and offer payments Microsoft chairman. It also seek cast Gates obsess man who fear tiny Netscape Communications Corp. and its potential threat his domination market Internet browsers, software use navigate World Wide Web. Gates be portray Justice Department litigator David Boies schoolyard bully who rid roughshod computer industry crudeness that be stark contrast his popular image benevolent dictator and high-technology guru. accord document present Boies, example, Gates ask America Online executives 1996: How much do we need pay you damage Netscape? This be your lucky day. The implication, Boies said, be that amount be irrelevant, and that Microsoft, its deep pockets and market dominance, make many offers you can't refuse needed achieve its goals. Microsoft officials be closely watch market surveys any hint that new image bare-knuckled Gates might be detract company's world-famous brand name, they insist that public will continue draw distinction allegations anticompetitive business tactics and company's software. Despite what you're read press, people judge us our products, say Mich Matthews, head Microsoft's corporate public-relations office. Our experience be that people vote their pocketbooks. so far, consumers be cast positive votes. last week Microsoft report quarterly profits $1.52 billion, stun 58 percent increase level year earlier. Despite record profits, some marketing experts say that if public come view gate rockefeller-style robber baron, his company and its brand name may suffer. When you have company such visible chief executive, CEO be really driver brand, say David Aaker, brand marketing expert Haas School Business University California Berkeley. There be no question this be go affect Microsoft's brand recognition. Already there be early warning signals, political cartoons newspapers country bash Gates last week. One show him hold globe and saying, If you don't play my way, I'll take my ball and go home; another portray Microsoft chairman stand next henchman dangle someone window while Microsoft secretary say caller, I'm sorry, Mr. Gates be busy teach competitor Windows. But some industry analysts believe new view Bill Gates who know how play hardball may not be such bad thing his company. The he-said, she-said e-mail messages be drag out court cases Washington and Silicon Valley, where Microsoft be lock legal battle its archrival, Sun Microsystems Inc., be view some little different exaggerated trash talk that go professional sports. It's take what Charles Barkley and Michael Jordan say each other ball court and turn it something more sinister it really is, say Paul Andrews, co-author Stephen Manes Gates (doubleday, 1993). Indeed, there be evidence that darker view Gates and his company have so far take root only District Columbia and Silicon Valley, where computer industry have long felt impact Gates' tactics, and where bitterness and distrust Microsoft be deep. In rest country, Gates continue enjoy great popularity. Two weeks ago, while speak crowd almost 7,000 students Indiana University, questioner who ask Justice Department's suit be roundly booed. BILL GATES, WHIPPING BOY c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service Is Bill Gates high-tech Machiavelli, Public Enemy no. 1 or threat know universe? All three, judge numerous political cartoons that pop newspapers country last week. From Chattanooga Boston, cartoonists take delight demonize Gates, who be face unexpected public relations challenge Microsoft's antitrust trial unfolds Washington. other cartoons run gamut predictable (a worker, point aquarium which large fish be gobble small ones, say some visitors, Welcome Microsoft's research and development department) weird (a dweebish man hunch front computer screen star words: Our beloved leader, Mr. Gates, be attack. Leave your possessions. Go desert. Await spaceship). And that be just week One trial. Stay tuned. A federal judge Friday push back start date antitrust trial Microsoft Corp. four days, Oct. 19, while also order company comply Justice Department's request examine Microsoft's financial records. Microsoft argue that allow army government attorneys come and make demands will make it very difficult us remain business. But win assurances government lawyers that they would make only narrow, targeted searches records, Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson U.S. District Court District Columbia order Microsoft open database perusal. Microsoft have ask that trial be delay several more months prepare defense what it say be last minute broaden case Justice Department, which have add new evidence. last month, government say that process prepare trial it have discover that Microsoft try persuade Apple Computer not market its Quicktime multimedia software Windows customers. On Thursday, Justice Department and 20 states add two new people their witness list testify Microsoft dealings Apple and Sun Microsystems. Avi Tevanian, former Apple executive, be add witness list part describe Microsoft's proposal, which Microsoft deny ever have made. The other new witness be James Gosling, Sun executive who lead development Java, Internet program language that Microsoft see potential threat company's dominance software market. The government be charge that Microsoft take illegal steps prevent Java gain wide acceptance. To counter that, Microsoft name two new witnesses Friday, Robert Muglia, senior Microsoft executive who have work Sun, and Chris Engstrom, executive who handle some Microsoft's dealings Apple. At same time, John Warden, Microsoft's lawyer, argue that new allegations have no place case. The Justice Department, Warden tell judge, be try turn this something approximate plenary monopoly case IBM case. It become clear and clear and clear each new filing that they be try turn this broad case, he said. You can't have this bait-and-switch which they file complaint allege A, B, C, and then talk whole alphabet three times over. As result, Warden said, Microsoft wanted, minimum, another two-week delay, though more normal schedule would have trial start next year. The judge not respond. instead he enter order set Oct. 19 trial date. Late Friday, Microsoft enter formal motion ask another two-week delay. A response be expect next week. The case United States vs. Microsoft Corp., government's most aggressive move monopolist almost 25 years, be play out century antitrust laws so broadly worded and court rulings so ambiguous that sides be cite same rulings support their opposing arguments. Whatever outcome trial, schedule begin Monday U.S. District Court Washington, almost certain appeal will leave Supreme Court task bring legal order 100 years clash antitrust doctrines. The case focus Microsoft's Windows, operate system that control 90 percent all personal computers sell today. The government say its objective be curb illegal monopolistic business practices that threaten render large parts economy vulnerable vicissitudes single company. Microsoft assert that case be intend give government control which feature can be add Windows. however grand economic stakes, legal dispute be narrow. The government say that Microsoft's contracts computer manufacturers and companies that provide access Internet illegally stifle competition. The contracts prohibit manufacturers substitute Netscape Communications Corp.'s Navigator browser Microsoft's Internet Explorer. They also prohibit them remove Windows main screen, or desktop, links sit World Wide Web run Microsoft or its partners. Microsoft's contracts companies that connect people Internet and businesses that sell goods and services Web require favored treatment Internet Explorer Navigator exchange links Windows desktop. In wake lawsuit, Microsoft have voluntarily drop some these requirements, though it could reinstate them will. Microsoft say that its contracts be legal because they produce tangible benefits customers, include easy Internet access. The Justice Department say that bundle Explorer Windows 95 and inclusion browser part windows 98 amount tying, illegal practice that force customers one product purchase another. The contracts manufacturers and Internet services be illegal, government says, because they be intend not only create monopoly browser market protect Microsoft's exist monopoly operate systems. The latter threat be key, accord Justice Department. Browsers have potential, operate system, act software platform which other programs run. so contracts intend drive browsers out market would also insulate Windows monopoly. Many antitrust experts say problem facing Justice Department be that courts have provide no clear definition tying and no clear guidelines determine when contracts be illegally exclusionary. Professor Lawrence White New York University, who be chief economist Justice Department's antitrust division early 1980s, say that courts treat tie unusual practice when fact it be ubiquitous. No one, he said, would challenge right manufacturers tie erasers tip pencils, tires automobile or buttons shirts. His point, share widely economists, be that some tie benefits consumers if, example, it results products that be easy use or enables company recover development costs. But tying can be bad if it lock monopoly power. The courts, White says, have not offer enough guidance distinguish good tying bad, which be nub legal dispute. Microsoft say it need only show that bundle Windows and Explorer pass what might be call gross consumer benefits test that it offer immediate benefit, whether or not it cause long-term damage competition and, therefore, ultimately consumers. The Justice Department say that Microsoft's practices must clear high hurdle: yield net consumer benefits that be immediate and large enough balance possible long-term harm competition. So which test consumer benefits satisfies antitrust laws? The simple answer be that no one know sure, which be why sides can reasonably cite same cases fear embarrassment. Consider 1985 case, Aspen Skiing Co. vs. Aspen Highlands Skiing Corp., and 1951 case, Lorain Journal Co. vs. United States. In first, Aspen Skiing, owner three major ski run Aspen, Colo. monopolist have years sell ticket cooperation Aspen Highlands, competitor, that give skiers access companies' runs. When Aspen Skiing unilaterally cancel agreement, its rival's revenues shrivel and rival sued. The Supreme Court rule that Aspen Skiing have violate antitrust laws because there be no evidence its action help consumers. In Lorain Journal case, only local newspaper Lorain, Ohio, refuse sell advertising companies that advertise new radio station. Here, too, Supreme Court rule that exclusionary practice nothing benefit consumers. Indeed, Aspen Skiing, court force monopolist do business its rival, precedent that augur well Justice Department, which seek force Microsoft install Netscape's browser alongside its own. But Charles Rule, legal consultant Microsoft, say that cases courts throw out exclusionary practices only because they offer no consumer benefit. The courts, he argues, never pounce practices that result low prices or good products or service. Nor courts either case call balance immediate benefits hypothetical long-term harm. Rule argue that Microsoft's practices produce demonstrable consumer benefits. Besides, he says, actions take The Lorain Journal or Aspen Skiing, Microsoft's contracts do not prevent consumers instal Netscape's browser or use Web sites Microsoft's rivals. In truth, though, neither case answer what consumer benefit test should apply product design. In Jefferson Parish Hospital District no. 2 et al. vs. Hyde, another case cite sides, Supreme Court 1984 recognize that surgeons and anesthesiologists provide integrate service. Yet, court said, hospital monopoly power would still not be allow force surgical patients use its panel anesthesiologists if consumers want purchase two services separately. That principle could undercut Microsoft's defense that functional interdependence Windows and Explorer require bundling. But Microsoft will point strong concur opinion that call tough standard government meet when it allege tying. Microsoft will also draw support several court rulings that allow IBM change design its computers ways that make it hard vendors attach peripheral equipment. But perhaps Microsoft's best argument be that nowhere have government identify single case which court explicitly call throw out tied product basis balance test. The courts, Microsoft will emphasize, steer clear redesign technically sophisticated products. The Justice Department's rejoinder be note that sole purpose antitrust law be protect consumers, so it make no sense bless practices that provide dollar's worth benefits today but, stamp out competition, drive prices $1,000 tomorrow. The Justice Department will ask court least insist that monopolists use least exclusionary means possible achieve services they provide customers. Experts agree that courts will subject Microsoft's restrictive contracts Internet companies balance test. But exactly how court will decide whether consumers be help or hurt be grabs. A balancing test would have courts weigh immediate benefits consumers one-click access Internet sites and features bundle windows-explorer package harm time diminish competition markets browsers and operate systems. But test that make good sense theory can prove fiendishly difficult use practice. Balancing tests be impossibly difficult and arbitrary, say Rep. Thomas Campbell, R-Calif., who be former law professor Stanford University. The practical effect balancing be hand defendants Microsoft almost certain victory. Microsoft argues and many antitrust experts agree that courts have fact gravitate away balance test simpler predation test exclusionary contracts. Under this standard, contract be illegal only if it be intend drive out competition and thus pave way monopolist raise prices later. Microsoft will have easy time defend itself charge predation, which amount victimize its customers, it would defend itself charge that its bundled product do consumers slightly more harm good. The antitrust record, say William Baxter, who head antitrust division President Reagan, be litter contradictory, ambiguous and sometimes nonsensical verdicts. He and other legal experts agree that if nothing else, that record leave plenty legal leeway Supreme Court, should it hear Microsoft case, stiffen spine antitrust law. Shortly government file its antitrust suit Microsoft Corp. May, Joel Klein, assistant attorney general charge Justice Department's antitrust division, meet Silicon Valley executive. The executive recall tell Klein that unless case go Internet browser market, it would have little effect Microsoft's power stifle competition computer industry. Klein reply that he understand computer executive's concerns. But he say time be run short and strong evidence hand involve Microsoft's battle Netscape Communications Corp. market so-called browser software use navigate Internet. This be Netscape case, executive recalls Klein saying. But five months later, case that government be bring trial Monday extend well Netscape and browser war embrace what it describe recent court file broad pattern anti-competitive conduct Microsoft. Netscape, government insists, be still prime example pattern only one several examples. The 12-person witness list Justice Department and 20 states sue Microsoft reflect new evidence add case May. James Barksdale, Netscape's president and chief executive, will appear first, he will be follow executives represent cross section nation's high-technology companies include Intel, IBM, Sun Microsystems, Apple Computer, America Online and Intuit. In bring more ambitious, complicate case trial one it file May, government have choose high-risk strategy. The law state that new evidence can be add suit it be filed, not new charges. And so, his federal courtroom Washington, U.S.District Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson could decide rule out some new evidence range too far afield original suit. But if government win its broadened case, court-ordered remedies would no doubt be far tough Microsoft. In May, government's suggest steps amount equal treatment Netscape's browser and Microsoft's browser. But government recently ask that judge hold separate hearing remedies, if it win case. The remedies consideration now include more basic changes Microsoft's business practices perhaps breakup company intend loosen Microsoft's grip computing. That would be precisely kind sweeping reform that Microsoft's foes would applaud. The government have double bet and double stakes, say David Yoffie, professor Harvard business school who be co-author book, compete Internet Time: Lessons From Netscape and Its Battle With Microsoft. Meanwhile, Microsoft camp, government's strategy be dismiss desperate act take court rule June that threaten undermine antitrust suit. That rule come separate case, involve interpretation consent decree that Microsoft sign Justice Department 1995. In June ruling, federal appeals court say that Microsoft could bundle its browser its industry-standard Windows operating system and call them one product. The appeals-court ruling would seem undercut assertion government's current antitrust case that browser and operating system be two separate products, bundle together and give away effort thwart competition browser market. With appeals-court ruling June, government lose heart its case, say Charles Rule, former senior official Justice Department, who be now consultant Microsoft. So it have take blunderbuss approach scramble throw everything it can find evidence Justice Department have have years gun barrel and see what hits. The June appellate rule shake prosecution team. But mostly it strengthen hand those Justice Department who have be urge that case be broadened, accord people who have work investigation. At same time, they say, new evidence be come investigation move ahead and prosecutors race meet accelerated trial schedule approve court. Speed be priority outset, they say. The Justice Department and states file their suit May move Microsoft's new operate system, Windows 98, be introduce June. While not seek block release Windows 98, government lawyers want get the courtroom early possible pc makers and computer users adopt this late version Microsoft's Windows operate system, which function central nervous system more 90 percent personal computers sold. The key allegations, government lawyers note, have not change May namely, that Microsoft illegally use its market power operate systems defend its monopoly position and try extend new markets. But only thing that be wrap bow time May filing be browser, say one person who work case. The real game plan be always get broad case. What be more, one person noted, prosecution team be not full strength shortly suit be filed. David Boies, renowned courtroom litigator and former partner Cravath, Swaine &AMP; Moore who successfully defend IBM its 13-year confrontation government, be name special counsel Justice Department last December. But Boies, who leave Cravath last year, not start work full-time Justice Department mid-april, because he be still finish private cases his firm, Boies &AMP; Schiller. The antitrust suit file May lean heavily Netscape story, mention Microsoft's main rival browser market some 130 times complaint and support memorandum. But it also prominently mention Microsoft's tactics Sun Microsystems, creator Java, Internet program language, and cite it example Microsoft's behavior. It be craft template that could be add much stretching, one person involve case said. And so, new evidence pile and seem fit pattern, Klein step step approve widen case, person said. And that explains, person continued, how it be that evidence that have be hands Justice Department years have be add case May; only gather new evidence it become apparent that old material fit pattern current case. For example, government have add contention that Microsoft pressure Intel Corp., big microchip maker and close partner Microsoft, curb its development efforts multimedia and Internet software because they might conflict Microsoft's plans. The government contend that arm-twisting occur meetings two companies three years ago, especially one Aug. 2, 1995, which be attend Andrew Grove, Intel chairman, and Bill Gates, Microsoft chairman. Part government's evidence intel-microsoft episode be copies handwritten notes take Steven McGeady, Intel vice president who attend meetings, and memo write him Aug. 28, 1995. The memo, still court seal, say that Gates make vague threats and be livid Intel's investments Internet and want them stopped. A handwritten note, also court seal, quote Paul Maritz, Microsoft executive, say that Netscape be their common enemy and that Intel's role should be fill stuff and Microsoft's strategy. These documents be sent Intel Justice Department's office San Francisco November 1995, response Civil Investigative Demand civil subpoena serve Intel Nov. 10, 1995. On its own, Intel material be intriguing, it become part antitrust suit only other evidence surfaced, one person close case said. The government be contend that Microsoft also try urge Apple stop sell its Quicktime multimedia software Windows market and try convince Real Networks Inc. pull back market so-called stream software. The government case have also broadened, people involve case say, more witnesses industry have be increasingly willing testify. In beginning, most people industry believe that government would lose and Microsoft would retaliate if they come forward, one person said. But strength our case be perceive improve, more people be willing come forward, and things snowballed. You get intel, it's easy get Apple and so on. ","Business rivals are seeking to break Microsoft Corp.'s monopoly on computer operating systems.The Government and 20 states have filed an anti-trust suit against Microsoft, invoking the Sherman Anti-trust Act of 1890.The suit began with a Microsoft vs Netscape battle over browser software but now extends far beyond that aiming at Microsoft's overall aggressive anti-competitive conduct.The effort is extensive but inconsistent because of the ambiguity of anti-trust laws, especially the Sherman Act.The Government is examining Microsoft's financial records and painting a dark image of its Chairman Bill Gates.An unpublished book may be crucial to the trial.","In 1998 the Justice Department filed a civil suit against Microsoft to change its 9-year pattern of anti-competitive conduct.Bill Gates appears a schemer ready to crush competitors by any means.He uses Microsoft's clout to squelch internet competition.A 1996 Netscape complaint over browsers was central to the case, which grew to include Intel, IBM, Sun, Apple, AOL, and Intuit.Microsoft was ordered to let Justice examine its records and sought a trial delay.An unpublished book provided evidence.The 1890 Sherman Anti-Trust Act centered on Standard Oil and was intended to protect consumers, but its wording is broad and rulings have been ambiguous.","The Justice Department and 20 states filed a suit against Microsoft for violation of the Sherman Act, charging it illegally tried to use its dominance as the provider of Windows, the industry standard operating system, to stifle competition in other areas.At the heart of the case are Microsoft's contracts with computer manufacturers that prohibit them from substituting Netscape's Navigator browser for Microsoft's Internet Explorer, but Justice also alleges Microsoft exhibited a broad pattern of anti-competitive conduct with numerous other software companies.Microsoft says that Windows and its browser is one tool that offers immediate consumer benefit.","The government suit against Microsoft is the most aggressive antitrust case in a quarter century.The heart of the case is the Internet browser battle between Microsoft and Netscape.Microsoft says that its Internet Explorer is an integral part of its Windows system, the industry dominant operating system.Microsoft, it is argued, has told computer manufacturers that if they want Windows, they must forgo Netscape.The Justice Department and 20 states are joined in the action brought under the Sherman Antitrust Act.Microsoft's chairman, Bill Gates, usually seen as a visionary is portrayed in much darker tones in the trial."

His wife claim two years that Liu's health be worsening. But only last month authorities grant comprehensive exam. Doctors find tumors, perhaps cancerous, 50-year-old's mouth, stomach and bowels, Liu Qing said. The timing Liu's exile and Xu's trial be most brazen string high-profile dissident releases calculate influence Western governments. Human rights groups immediately denounce Liu's release cynical and manipulative. The chinese government continue play hostage politics no true commitment international human rights standards, say Xiao Qiang Human Rights China, New york-based lobbying group that Liu Qing heads. Over two years, China try woo West, Beijing sign two key U.N. rights treaties and win praise bring its spotty legal system closer international standards. The rule Communist Party relax some controls dissent views academics. Xu Wenli and other dissidents saw opportunity more open atmosphere. Over six months, dissidents 14 provinces and cities have try use chinese laws set and register China Democracy Party.

The trials three outspoken dissidents over, Communist Party leader Jiang Zemin signal Wednesday that China will sustain crackdown dissent throughout next year. In his second hard-line speech six days, Jiang vow crush any challenges Communist Party rule and preserve social stability. He demand that officials talk politics euphemism party orders. The speech, senior law enforcement officials, use uncompromising language heard less frequently 18 months chinese leaders seek improve relations abroad. Jiang's harsh tone punctuate summary trials and convictions subversion this week three political critics who try form opposition party. To underscore party's intolerant mood, national newspapers run brief accounts Tuesday and Wednesday 13-, 12- and 11-year prison terms give Xu Wenli, Qin Yongmin and Wang Youcai.

We must strengthen ideological and political education officials and raise their awareness and resistance sabotaging acts hostile domestic and foreign forces, China Central Television quote Jiang saying. Whenever any element that undermines stability raise its head, it must be resolutely nipped bud. Jiang not exclusively target political enemies. He liken their threat that white-collar and ordinary criminals and ticked list potentially volatile problems inefficient state industries, legions laid-off workers, stagnate farmers' incomes and corrupt officials. The emphasis stability and warnings those who would disrupt it be reminiscent party pronouncements wan years Jiang's mentor, Deng Xiaoping. After Deng die 1997 and Jiang emerge victorious major party conclave, he project more confident image. Reform, not stability, be bywords year. Academic debates year be bold 10 years China's relatively control standards. Party leaders too tout efforts build more comprehensive, predictable legal system and win praise western governments sign U.N. rights treaties. Our active developments foreign affairs have reach new achievements, Jiang said. Our country's stature have rise step higher.

Wang be try subversion charges Thursday brief court session, no defense lawyer, eastern city Hangzhou. The punishment third veteran democracy campaigner, Qin Yongmin, 44, have not be announced. His trial begin central city Wuhan Thursday and may reconvene Tuesday, relatives said. A similarly long sentence be expected. Monday's sentences, which come just six months President Clinton's visit Beijing, where he publicly challenge China's leaders move quickly political reform, be harshly criticize State Department. They also appear spell effective end here China Democracy Party, which these three men, hundreds lesser-known individuals, try organize recent months. The long sentences also crush hopes many liberal intellectuals here that China's warm relations United States recent years and its signing global treaties human rights might bring significant ease political controls. Xu be try Monday morning Beijing Intermediate Court. When brief recess three-judge panel announce his 13-year sentence, Xu stand and shouted, I protest! say his wife 28 years, He xintong. Then, say Ms. He and lawyers who be present, he shout that judges be unfair and that he would not appeal his case because proceedings be illegitimate. With sentence Xu, China's Communist government have silence one its most energetic and persistent critics, one who have give his adult life cause democracy.

After learn Monday's sentences, american Embassy here, which have spend last two years build improved relations China and United States, issue strong condemnation what it term deplorable decisions. We be deeply disappointed guilty verdicts and extremely harsh sentences, statement said. No individual should be arrested, tried and sentence exercise internationally recognize freedoms, include those guarantee International Covenant Civil and Political Rights, which China have commit itself. Like Thursday's trials, which proceed no defense attorneys because prospective lawyers have be warn police or detained, Monday's proceeding show that cases involve security issues, police and courts could write their rules. accord criminal procedure law, defendants be be notify least 10 days trial, Xu be tell only four days ago that his trial would be Monday. His wife, who Monday have not be allow contact him his arrest Nov. 30, be tell three days ago. Under law, defendants also have right lawyer their choice, xu be assign lawyer court late last week.

If he receive long sentence, he tell his wife, she should go and enjoy her life. And if I die, Xu say they part that day, please plant tree me. Six months President Clinton travel Beijing and challenge China's leaders move rapidly political reform, administration's policy engage Beijing be call question Monday when chinese courts sentence three nation's most prominent dissidents long jail sentences. Critics China Capitol Hill and human rights groups say tough prison terms be evidence failure administration's policy encourage trade and diplomatic ties China hop democratic reform. The dissidents Xu Wenli, who be sentence Monday 13 years prison, Wang Youcai, who receive 11-year sentence, and Qin Yongming, who be report have receive 12 years be charge subversion. The State Department say it have receive reports sources it not identify that third lead democracy campaigner, Qin Yongmin, have be sentence 13 years prison trial last week city Wuhan. Relatives Qin China deny reports, however, and say that his trial continued. Given Clinton's effusive praise China's senior leaders his trip Beijing last summer, administration find itself defensive Monday and harshly criticize prison sentences, it continue insist that administration's policy engagement be help push Beijing democracy. James Foley, State Department spokesman, say United States deeply deplore jail terms and call immediate release dissidents. These three men appear have be involve nothing more efforts form new political party, he said. While condemn prison sentences, Foley and other american officials be careful note administration's assessment that there have be progress human rights China, some it link Clinton's meeting Beijing Chinese President Jiang Zemin. There have be improvements human rights situation China, modest improvements, Foley said. The severe prison terms and other recent instances harassment democracy campaigners China be steps backward relationship what have be improve human rights performance, he said. Critics administration's China policy note that long prison sentences be hand out less week Jiang deliver point speech Beijing which he make clear that China's economic reforms be not prelude western-style democracy. The western mode political systems must never be copied, he said, add that those who challenge Communist Party's supremacy would be crushed. Rep. Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., who have long be China's harsh critics Congress, say prison sentences hand out Xu and Wang be clear demonstration president's visit China last summer Beijing's true intentions human rights. They be pathetic, really pathetic, she say administration. The administration can say what it wants, it must know Monday that its policy China be embarrassment. What chinese have learn be that they have all latitude world. Mike Jendrzejczyk, Washington director Human Rights Group, say jail terms be proof need administration revise its China policy, which he describe almost entirely driven administration's desire encourage trade. He say that while there have be some signs progress human rights situation China last year notably, China's agreement sign international treaties civil and economic rights overall picture be bleak. On balance, he said, any progress China have make allow great openness may have be cancel out more repressive attitude. Human Rights Watch, large american-based human rights group, call administration consider postpone or cancel planned visit China early next year Commerce Secretary William Daley and high-level trade delegation protest prison sentences. That would get Beijing's attention, Jendrzejczck said. other China experts and scholars insist that administration be right continue its policy engagement China, and that there be reason believe that political reform would follow economic reform, Clinton have argued. Peter Rodman, former Nixon and Reagan administration official now Nixon Center Washington, say that United States cannot control evolution society complex China's. He say harsh prison sentences give out Monday dissidents be be expected, especially Xu and Wang have be involve try set political party challenge Communists. The pattern this regime be that every once while, they ease bit and somebody go too far and there's crisis, he said. I don't think you can blame United States this crackdown, nor can you give us credit any political reforms. On human rights, I just don't think there's much more we can do. China release respected, ail labor rights campaigner prison work camp Sunday and immediately send him exile United States. Releasing Liu Nianchun appear be attempt government blunt international criticism Monday's upcoming trial prominent dissident Xu Wenli. Xu be third lead member would-be opposition political party put trial subversion three-week crackdown that have see least 32 dissidents arrest or interrogated. Beijing police Sunday detain one Xu's China Democracy Party colleagues, Zha Jianguo, prevent him attend trial, Xu's wife said. Although pleased that Liu Nianchun be free, human rights groups decry chinese government's time manipulative. We don't want give any credit chinese government this cynical game it be playing, say Xiao Qiang, director New york-based Human Rights China. After 3 1/2 years prison, Liu be take Tuanhe labor camp outskirts Beijing, driven capital's airport and put Canadian Air flight, ultimately bound New York, his mother and brother said. Accompanying Liu exile be his wife, Chu Hailan, and their 11-year-old daughter, family said. Liu Nianchun's release follow same pattern China use free its two most famous dissidents, Wei Jingsheng Nov. 1997 and Wang Dan April. Authorities release Liu medical parole, exactly five months end his prison term, provide he go exile, say his brother and exile democracy campaigner, Liu Qing. Liu Nianchun, 50, have be ill-health least two years. In exam authorities finally agree provide last month, doctors discover Liu have tumors his mouth, stomach and bowels, Liu Qing said. Like Wang and Wei, United States and other western governments have lobby China release Liu. Chinese leaders have be force well-known dissidents exile throughout 1990s, find that once abroad they lose their influence dissidents home. In only official comment release, Xinhua News Agency report that judicial departments take account Liu's health and behavior labor camp approve his parole medical treatment. I be very happy Liu Nianchun, same time send people directly prison exile be type human rights violation and persecution, Liu Qing say telephone interview his home New York's Brooklyn borough. Liu Nianchun be one most respected figures fractured, persecute dissident community. His more 3 1/2 years prisons and labor camps be sad illustration way China's Communist Party rulers punish people they deem threat. Liu be imprison three times 17 years. His last arrest come he sign petition call labor rights May 1995. Liu be never put trial. Fourteen months pass his wife, Chu Hailan, first learn his fate and whereabouts: three-year spell labor camp frigid, remote northeast. His term be maximum police may impose criminal suspects trial. Labor camp officials later extend Liu's sentence year try escape, charge Chu claim be fabricated. Inside labor camp, Liu once start hunger strike protest his treatment. He be beat cattle prods and confine room 2 square meters (2 square yards) where he could only sit or stand. His wife endure police harassment, beatings and detentions campaign his release. Chu be drag away and hit security forces when she try hand letter U.N. human rights chief Mary Robinson Beijing hotel September. German Foreign Minister Joschka Fischer, who draw China's anger recently meet exiled dissident Wei Jingsheng, say China's sentence two dissidents Monday be unacceptable and flout international treaty country recently signed. The reaction Chinese authorities be totally unacceptable, Fischer said, call dissidents' immediate release. The accuse simply tried peaceful means exercise their right free speech and assembly, which be guarantee China's constitution, and United Nations' International Covenant Civil and Political Rights which China recently signed, Fischer say statement. chinese courts sentence dissidents Xu Wenli and Wang Youcai 13 and 11 years try organize opposition political party. His friend and political mentor be jailed, rob their budding opposition political party its most potent organizer, Zha Jianguo be not afraid. A bag pack toothbrush, toothpaste and medicine lie ready his Beijing home day chinese police take him away. He have tell police interrogators he expect be jailed, likely few years less 13 give China Democracy Party leader Xu Wenli Monday. Democracy be process, and that process small number people will be sacrificed, Zha, 47-year-old former manager computer design company and vice chairman party's Beijing branch, tell The Associated Press interview Thursday. We want use our sacrifice arouse people, and we believe that sacrifice be worthwhile. With mixture defiance and cool clarity chances success, Zha say he and other China Democracy Party members will continue organize and campaign change. His tenacity hold summary trials and harsh punishments xu, Wang Youcai and Qin Yongmin prominent party principals provinces who be sentence 11 and 12 years and threaten signs rule communist Party. Chinese President Jiang Zemin warn speech publish Wednesday that political subversives threaten what he call China's fragile social order. Whenever any element that undermines stability raise its head, it must be resolutely nipped bud, Jiang said. Zha maintain that such tactics be unnecessary. In its manifestoes, Democracy Party espouse peaceful means target undemocratic system, not political power Communist Party. We believe elections hold establishment democratic system should decide who have power, say Zha. What many world consider democracy be legally subversive China threaten communist party-led system. In month, authorities have arrest and convict Xu, Qin and Wang and detain or interrogate least 29 other party members. Police take Zha his home Sunday afternoon and hold him nearly 24 hours keep him Xu's trial. Until crackdown, China Democracy Party distinguish itself attempt opposition its openness. Organizers publicly announce their intention set party. They try register authorities. Statements be faxed foreign media and human rights groups circumvent China's state-controlled media. Now, party's members 500 Zha's count be be drive underground. Party members will concentrate increase ranks and will be more guarded use telephones and faxes and their occasional meetings, Zha said. If Xu and other two be first round, then second be very likely and it will be bigger, Zha said. In such unbalanced contest, we be force use more secretive means. The arrests Xu, Wang and Qin deprive party its more influential members, Zha said. All have prove track records, Xu and Qin dissident editors Democracy Wall era movement 20 years ago, Wang student leader Tiananmen Square democracy demonstrations 1989. But another aspect, this have strengthen resolve more party members struggle on, Zha say arrests. Zha get interested politics radical youth, Mao Tse-tung's appeals go countryside 1968. When he return Beijing 1989, he march Tiananmen protests and continue his activism. Friends introduce him Xu Wenli 1995. Having be release prison two years before, xu be still not openly involved dissident politics, he hold court his Beijing home discus China's future.
