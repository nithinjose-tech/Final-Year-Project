If Osama bin Laden ever stands trial New York bombings U.S. embassies Africa acts terror, already clear prosecutors call chief witness: One senior aides talking U.S. investigators two years. The government identified aide court papers pseudonym CS-1, saying person pleaded guilty terrorism charges secret proceeding U.S. district court Manhattan. According government, informant worked closely bin Laden 1989 1996, period prosecutors assert bin Laden ordering deadly attacks U.S. soldiers Somalia elsewhere. From court papers filed investigation embassy bombings East Africa August, clear informant provided crucial information federal investigators.

It known whether source custody somewhere, hiding government protection. As recently 11 days ago, records show, source swore 5-page affidavit New York notary summarizing allegations bin Laden. Government officials adamantly declined say anything identity CS-1, stands confidential source. But least one operative bin Laden's group East Africa concluded year ago knew identity crucial turncoat: Sidi Tayyib, businessman married one bin Laden's relatives. The operative's concerns inflamed report British newspaper Tayyib cooperating Saudi U.S. authorities. In August, 1997 article, The Daily Telegraph said Tayyib custody Saudi Arabia May given intelligence officials details bin Laden's bank accounts businesses. The news Tayyib's possible defection, East African operative wrote report apparently intended group's commanders, almost made explode. An important man close links bin Laden seems fallen enemy's hands, take appropriate security precautions that, operative, Haroun Fazil, wrote summary security concerns. Fazil charged embassy attacks remains large. The report typed computer seized last year Kenyan authorities, according government filing last week U.S. district court Manhattan. Thus far, U.S. prosecutors charged least six members bin Laden's organization terrorist activities conspiracy. In one recent filing, said case part based testimony confidential source, suggesting informant agreed testify trial bin Laden associates. The arrangement appears resulted plea bargain source cooperating hopes receiving lesser sentence. There indication source sentenced seems likely sentencing would take place investigation ensuing trials complete. In affidavit prepared last week, source acknowledged pleading guilty terrorism charges United States said stemmed attacks U.S. targets, specifically identified. The source described taking oath allegiance follow bin Laden's orders, gave detailed account bin Laden's group, including history inner workings. The source told private statements bin Laden al Qaeda members, encouraging attack U.S. troops citizens stationed Middle East Africa. I either heard statements myself, source said, I read learned al Qaeda members. The government also said court papers source helped identify bin Laden's signature 1996 document urging Muslims kill Americans. Tayyib's whereabouts unknown could reached comment. The Taliban's chief justice accused United States Wednesday looking excuse launch another missile attack war-shattered homeland. And excuse Osama bin Laden, man Washington calls Enemy No. 1 blames Aug. 7 bombings U.S. embassies East Africa, Justice Noor Mohammed Saqib said interview The Associated Press. On Aug. 20 United States retaliated firing Tomahawk missiles suspected terrorist camps eastern Afghanistan, killing 26 people. According U.S. intelligence sources, camps used train members bin Laden's al Qaeda terrorist group. America looking excuse fire rockets dear Afghanistan excuse bin Laden, Saqib said. Washington, posted dlrs 5 million reward bin Laden's arrest, ruled attacks Afghanistan. Saqib, heads judicial inquiry established Taliban investigate terrorism charges bin Laden, says United States become insecure. America fears shadow ... every part world afraid sees every danger connected bin Laden, said interview Afghan capital Kabul. In Afghanistan, bin Laden considered honored guest Taliban hosts. They cite Afghan tradition, demands host guarantee guest protection. So far Saqib says evidence bin Laden's involvement terrorist activities. The Taliban refused turn bin Laden United States, say evidence try Islamic law. In 90 percent Afghanistan ruled Taliban harsh brand Islamic justice imposed, including death penalty. We want good relations United States Muslim non-Muslim countries, respect ways, said. Saqib said inquiry wind Nov. 20 evidence bin Laden case closed  least Taliban. Bin Laden sinful man ... America silent ... given evidence, said. It shameful America seen world reason go bin Laden. The man accused orchestrating U.S. embassy bombings Tanzania Kenya declared free man Friday Afghanistan, lived years permission hard-line Islamic Taliban militia. The Taliban, control 90 percent Afghanistan, Friday closed three-week inquiry allegations Osama bin Laden waging war terror United States. It's over, America presented evidence, Afghanistan's chief justice, Noor Mohammed Saqib, told The Associated Press interview Supreme Court building Afghan capital, Kabul. Without evidence, bin Laden man sin. ... He free man. The Taliban told bin Laden, however, political activity banned agreed respect that, Taliban information minister said statement Friday. The minister, Amir Khan Muttaqi, also disputed U.S. assertions bin Laden rich man, saying Saudi dissident foreign assets frozen, claim immediately corroborated. One clear unstated objectives last August's raid Afghanistan kill Osama bin Laden many lieutenants possible, administration officials acknowledge. According officials, White House lawyers conducted secret review months attack concluded operations legal U.S. international law. The officials said raid timed 70 cruise missiles would hit bin Laden's camps moment Central Intelligence Agency believed would meeting chief operatives. A 1976 executive order bars anyone working U.S. government plotting carrying assassinations. But officials said White House legal opinion drafted Afghan strike asserts president authority target infrastructure terrorist groups attacking Americans. A top U.S. counterterrorism official said week infrastructure bin Laden's group mostly human. As said time Aug. 20 strike, objective disrupt training, organization infrastructure bin Laden terrorist network Khost camps, said David C. Leavy, spokesman National Security Council White House. Targeting infrastructure, officials acknowledged, also mean destroying leadership terrorist group. Command control enemy justifiable target, Leavy said. Senior administration officials said never discussed killing bin Laden planning sessions. His death, said interviews attack, would simply side benefit. U.S. intelligence officials say believe bin Laden camp day attack, appears left unscathed missiles hit. Officials said reports least one senior lieutenants may died attack, total casualties complex 50 100. Administration spokesmen drawn distinction attempting kill specific person bin Laden attacking group people command terrorist organization. Administration officials denied August raid intended kill bin Laden, Saudi exile charged federal prosecutors leading global war U.S. interests. He linked Aug. 7 bombing two U.S. embassies East Africa. But less subtle explanation offered Oct. 13 Defense Secretary William Cohen, said visit Saudi Arabia United States going bin Laden colleagues. We quite successful, Cohen continued, sent message. Kenneth Bacon, Pentagon spokesman, said secretary retracted statements. The Los Angeles Times recently reported administration believed legal right use deadly force terrorist leaders. Bin Laden's organization significant concern Clinton administration bombing U.S. embassies East Africa. Last spring, officials said, U.S. intelligence considered daring raid Afghanistan capture Saudi exile. Officials said roughly time, White House drafted legal justification military attacks terrorist leadership. That review, officials said, provided legal basis August fire cruise missiles meeting believed bin Laden lieutenants would gathered. The review, National Security Council, basis saying operation violate presidential order banning assassinations. That ban imposed President Ford 1975, congressional investigators uncovered evidence CIA plotted assassinate Fidel Castro, Cuban leader, others. The order said: No person employed by, acting behalf United States government shall engage in, conspire engage in, assassination. While is, face, sweeping unqualified ban, subject interpretation intense debate years. In 1986, Reagan administration responded terrorist attack U.S. soldiers Germany bombing raid Libya. The targets included residence Libyan leader, Moammar Gadhafi. And Gulf War, U.S. forces used powerful bombs attempt kill Saddam Hussein, president Iraq. The legal review conducted White House would appear provide precedent future operations similar circumstances. \n","\n","\n","\n","NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) FBI agent week began questioning relative victim Aug. 7 US.

One clear unstated objective last August's raid Afghanistan kill Osama bin Laden many lieutenant possible, administration official acknowledge. According official, White House lawyer conducted secret review month attack concluded operation legal US. international law. The official said raid timed 70 cruise missile would hit bin Laden's camp moment Central Intelligence Agency believed would meeting chief operative. A 1976 executive order bar anyone working US. government plotting carrying assassination. But official said White House legal opinion drafted Afghan strike asserts president authority target infrastructure terrorist group attacking Americans. A top US. counterterrorism official said week infrastructure bin Laden's group mostly human. As said time Aug. 20 strike, objective disrupt training, organization infrastructure bin Laden terrorist network Khost camp, said David C. Leavy, spokesman National Security Council White House. Targeting infrastructure, official acknowledged, also mean destroying leadership terrorist group. Command control enemy justifiable target, Leavy said.

US. intelligence official say believe bin Laden camp day attack, appears left unscathed missile hit. Officials said report least one senior lieutenant may died attack, total casualty complex 50 100. Administration spokesman drawn distinction attempting kill specific person bin Laden attacking group people command terrorist organization. Administration official denied August raid intended kill bin Laden, Saudi exile charged federal prosecutor leading global war US. interest. He linked Aug. 7 bombing two US. embassy East Africa. But le subtle explanation offered Oct. 13 Defense Secretary William Cohen, said visit Saudi Arabia United States going bin Laden colleague. We quite successful, Cohen continued, sent message.

When shot take, invented new one. When one pass to, reconfigured play teammate open. Larry Bird, Indiana countryside Boston Garden, luminous exception governing rule. That why, six years retirement National Basketball Association, name basketball's prominent, beginning induction Hall Fame 7,000 Bird watchers Civic Center Friday night. Deservedly enshrined forever exceptional, becomes Bird, exception, case study contentious potentially disastrous labor war. No, really, Bird said, I asked whether troubled likelihood legendary name soon representing symbol greed unsympathetic millions. There's always player's name attached things. I know time I happy it. That would 1988, Celtics wanted compensate Bird $4.9 million bonus push back pain, go savior. Three years later, contract arbitration involving Knicks' Patrick Ewing, agent David Falk would contend NBA conspired Celtics circumvent salary cap, order satisfy Bird. Alan Greenspan, I sure, would agree salary cap convoluted enough give anyone headache, let's say cap exist team negotiating one own. The process unsealing cap re-sign particular player eventually became known making use Larry Bird exception. And stand, onetime exception become expensive rule owners want play anymore. I understand sides, said Bird, safely middle, Bird, former exception, Bird, present Indiana Pacers' coach. Without getting exception, I think important players stay place. Important, meant, franchise stability fan identification. You son 7 years old, goes 7 17 10 years played, Bird said. A lot people Boston told followed me, time young college. The Bird years numbered three Celtics championships, best player pro basketball's famous team ever had. He Magic Johnson created basketball renaissance began college title showdown Salt Lake City spread worldwide, infectious smile. They stood pass, team play, decade selflessness given way one selfishness. The NBA Michael Jordan reached greater heights anyone imagined could, league suffers sickness soul. If Larry Magic done did, might survive we're go through, said Bill Fitch, Bird's first Celtics coach, who, Bill Walton, stood night that, said, gave closure playing career. The owners, always, exaggerating misery, time, much easier root players. The president union Ewing, one day commands players boycott world championships NBA's corporate fingerprints them, next day helps television commentary work David Stern's women's annex. Ewing leads fight protect $100 million contracts 21-year-olds achieved single playoff victory, linked big payoffs agents friend Falk. The battle waged name salary cap makes exceptions unexceptional, rewards everyone Bird. I believe field allowance truly special ones, Walton said. But group small. When I growing sport, players got recognition champions, ones always made feel good game, sports. That's Larry Magic played, always dreaming special team. It hype, money. That quite case, been. Bird businessman's ball player day arrived, flannel shirts blue-collar ethic. He hired late Bob Woolf, one original heavy-hitting agents, got record rookie contract. Then went turned 29-victory catastrophe 61-victory contender. A rare Bird, honest exception rule. Despite modest encouragement new proposal delivered players owners, National Basketball Association Tuesday canceled first two weeks regular season, first time league's 51-year history lose games labor dispute. The NBA's deputy commissioner, Russ Granik, announced cancellation nearly three half hours meetings concluded Manhattan hotel. The decision cancel 99 games Nov. 3 Nov. 16 came players association proposed implementation tax system instead hard salary cap, proposal owners said would respond Friday. We tried best today try possible salvage season, said Alonzo Mourning, Miami Heat center. Unfortunately, work out. After 35,001 games blemish, NBA joins National Hockey League, National Football League Major League Baseball lost games labor dispute. Taking account three- four-week period would needed training camp free-agent signings season starts, league said would decide two weeks whether make cancellations. I'm sad disappointed, said NBA commissioner, David Stern. I consider collective failure, I honestly know else could done. I things I think best interests game. And I believe is. The decision came sides agreed substantive talks owners imposed lockout player July 1. Seventeen players, including union president Patrick Ewing vice presidents Mitch Richmond, Herb Williams, Dikemebe Mutombo Ty Corbin, attended meeting Stern, Granik five members ownership committee  Madison Square Garden president Dave Checketts owners Abe Pollin Washington, Gordon Gund Cleveland, Les Alexander Houston Jerry Colangelo Phoenix. The talks featured players association implied bevy concessions made owners felt would accommodate league's desire swing revenue pendulum back owners. The dispute involves distribution approximately $2 billion league-wide income. The main sticking point owners' insistence salary cap exceptions, implementation believe would bring player salaries' line revenue growth. While players discuss elimination Larry Bird exception  clause allows player secure amount money wants re-signing current team  address exception taxation proposal. The main points follows:  A 50 percent tax would imposed salary earned $18 million, clause would affect players exercised Bird rights. For example, player made $20 million, team would forced put $1 million fund would likely distributed low-revenue teams. There could provisions made players, said Jeffrey Kessler, chief counsel union. We want anything would encourage Chicago getting Michael Jordan back. And I think league feels way. The proposal similar luxury tax proposed union 1995 negotiations, would nearly liberal.  A salary cap credit would go effect league pays 63 percent revenues salary. Whatever figure number reduces salary cap next year. If figure $29 million salary cap, 29 teams would work salary cap $1 million less previous season. But players would assurance salary cap would go least $2 million credit goes effect.  Also, 63-percent threshold met, reduction annual 20 percent raises would take effect multi-year contracts. Players would either get raises 10 percent rate growth league revenues. The union said clearly addresses league's desire bring salaries line revenues. Since owners re-opened current agreement 57.1 percent revenue going salaries, 63-percent figure would probably come substantially owners agree proposal.  Teams would get right first refusal free agents fourth year incoming rookies, meaning player would contractually obligated team first four years deal. Currently, rookie scale three years includes clause enables player exercise Bird rights two seasons  clause Kevin Garnett parlayed astronomical $126 million deal last year Minnesota.  Finally, players agreed make marijuana banned substance. Details testing negotiated specific discussions took place testing performance-enhancing drugs, provision owners included last proposal. In return concessions, players want increase minimum salary  currently $272,500  creation average salary exception. This would allow every team salary cap able sign one free agent year average salary  currently $2.6 million. We're buoyed fact first time they've decided submit counterproposal, union's executive director, Billy Hunter, said. I know I'm optimistic, I earnestly say look ballplayers eye say made valiant effort. Asked players would finally tested financially cancellation games, Hunter added: It's us blinking. We want reach agreement. We're tired rhetoric, we're tired game-playing. Our position want accept bad deal. Granik said refunds fans would made end calendar month first refund would include monies canceled preseason games. He estimated losses hundreds millions dollars. I think serious concern whether tax system address kind needs economically, added. But there's possibility. Added Stern, We owe fans go back look notion whether tax rate might begin achieve result wanted. It look promising, we're going spend next two days see give favorable response. Though decision cancel games surprising, represent major shift prior labor stalemates. Both sides reluctantly hammered deal 1995 start training camp sole notion missing games preserving NBA's perfect record. Tuesday, could come accord. I'd think last games cancel, Granik said. But unless something else works, there's dramatic breakthrough, I think certainly season that's jeopardy. In decision almost certainly lead first work stoppage National Basketball Association history, league Monday announced cancellation 114 preseason games. Citing stalled negotiations Players Association new collective bargaining agreement, league officials said would decide next week whether cancel first week regular season games. While decision expected 10 days, nonetheless sent strong signal owners players probably willing cancel least part regular season order settle labor dispute. Both sides agree would take least three weeks hold abbreviated training camps sign 200 free agents new contracts. Privately, officials sides believe season start scheduled Nov. 3 December. Unlike Major League Baseball, National Football League National Hockey League, NBA never lost regular-season game labor strife. Since we're negotiating, conclude likely we're going miss part regular season, deputy commissioner Russ Granik said Monday night. We'll try defer decisions last minute, right look good. The two sides meet Thursday  first official bargaining session Aug. 6. Commissioner David Stern group owners walked meeting dismissing merits new proposal players. Neither Granik players association executive director Billy Hunter sounded week's meeting would go long way signing new agreement  precursor playing again. I think choice miss games point, Hunter said. In fact, I think they've intended along. They've locked us out, they've refused negotiate they've given us proposal that's ludicrous. Not sides still awaiting outcome arbitration decision due Oct. 18 - Fordham Law School dean John Feerick rule whether 200 players $800 million guaranteed contracts paid lockout  owners players also making time win public opinion test fans' loyalties canceling games. Monday 11 cities throughout country, players holding make-shift press conferences training-camp venues, NBA arenas gymnasiums. Patrick Ewing, union president, several teammates speak SUNY-Purchase Purchase, N.Y., Knicks train season. With training camp originally scheduled open Oct. 6, message players clear: owners would call end lockout, would ready play today. About 100 players expected attend, speak sign autographs fans afterward. I wish would put energies trying negotiate deal rather various things they've doing, Granik said. The dispute essentially owners players judiciously divvy $2 billion income. It began last year contention owners employees receiving fair share pot. The owners allowed terminate current agreement clause enabled player salaries reached 53.8 percent total basketball-related income. The owners say figure currently hovering 57.1 percent. Though many economic issues need resolved, main point contention labor agreement expired owners declared lockout July 1 clause allows teams pay free agents want, regardless salary-cap rules governing NBA's 29 teams. Called Larry Bird exception, created allow Hall Fame Boston Celtics forward re-sign Celtics end career. Michael Jordan exercised clause last two years Chicago Bulls, earning $30 million season  figures $5 million team allowed spend players. But exorbitant salaries paid several unproven stars last years $100 million deals sprouting routinely, owners determined swing income pendulum back enforcing restricted salary cap  hard cap  putting ceiling much one player could earn. Last year, players received $1 billion dollars salaries benefits made proposals guaranteed increase number 20 percent next four years, Granik said prepared statement. Our proposals would result average player salary $3.1 million minimum salary 10-year veterans $750,000. Unfortunately, union leadership unwilling give serious consideration offered. Hunter labeled claims optimistic projections, shot number new proposals presented players Sept. 25. If left current deal place, would gotten much anyway, added. All we're saying is, we're position accept hard cap. Monday's decision cancel preseason came less two weeks NBA indefinitely postponed training camp canceled first week exhibition games. Through tickets sales alone, Granik estimated losing exhibition season would cost league $35 million $40 million. Decisions cancellations regular season games expected made next week, added. A league official said games would canceled blocks one two weeks, depending circumstances negotiations. Thursday's bargaining session suddenly become last hope starting season time. Hurdles could overcome quickly, I reason believe Thursday, Granik said. Added Hunter: Of course expect much get done. When Russ David decide negotiations going real substantive, something happen. What they're banking players going miss paychecks cave November. It's they've ingested something pass. And passes, they'll negotiate. The first substantive talks two months opposing sides National Basketball Association's labor dispute came went Thursday hint settlement. Still, five-hour meeting described cordial league almost two bulls letting little steam players association produced another scheduled talks next Tuesday. Barring major compromise, enough time preserve full season prevent league losing first regular-season games labor strife November. Russ Granik, NBA's deputy commissioner, said league would wait next week's meeting deciding cancel regular-season games. He also discussed possibility significantly shortened season. We made determination need exact number games order representative season, Granik said. But recognize certain point can't possibly sell fans we're NBA season. Whether's 60 games, 50 games 49 53, we're yet. We months face decision. Perhaps progress involved Thursday conference room midtown Manhattan hotel question-and-answer session league's latest proposal players. Patrick Ewing, union president, vice presidents Herb Williams Dikembe Mutombo attended meeting union's executive director, Billy Hunter, union lawyers. No owners present, Granik, Commissioner David Stern league's lawyers spent day explaining intricacies two-week-old proposal players. At one point two parties broke lunch, Stern Hunter raised voices accused handling constituencies poorly, participant meeting said. But two seen shaking hands laughing meeting concluded shortly 3 p.m. There venting sides, Hunter said. We've placid respectful. Today, took coats inclined take gloves little bit. Having done that, I think kind loosened sides. Hunter added: Did anybody blink today? They're sort look us kind nuance find course negotiations might, way another, give indication we're mouthing one thing might open something else. We're looking body language, too. I think they're ready make deal. The last formal meeting sides Aug. 6 ended Stern owners abruptly marched received proposal players. In critical ruling North American National Basketball Association players' union, arbitrator John Feerick decides Monday whether 200 players guaranteed contracts paid lockout. If players win, owners liable dlrs 800 million guaranteed salaries, although vowed appeal lose. The league already sued players Feerick's jurisdiction. If win, I think emboldens spirit resolve players, union director Billy Hunter said. But I think anybody celebrating there's guarantee end lockout. It means pay 200 players, they've indicated us intent file immediate appeal take far order avoid payment. So rule favor, hollow victory. The players going get paid Nov. 15 circumstance, Hunter said. If owners win, remove last wild card players holding. The sides negotiated last Tuesday, union proposed superstar tax highest contracts. The league made counterproposal Friday, asking tax imposed much lower threshold. Hunter dismissed league's latest proposal Friday afternoon, said sides would best served awaiting Feerick's ruling. It's unlikely negotiations held week, union holding meeting NBA players agents advisory committee Las Vegas Wednesday Friday. We've got get sense players are, consider reasonable they're willing order get season commence, Hunter said. The union filed grievance Feerick lockout imposed July 1 owners' announcement June 29 would honor guaranteed deals. In six-day hearing summer, union argued owners protected liable guaranteed salaries work stoppage inserting lockout language standard player contract. The Sacramento Kings inserted lockout clause center Olden Polynice's contract 1994, approved league. The union used existence clause argue teams protected similarly. Most players due receive first paychecks Nov. 15, although dozen clauses entitling paid summer. None received paycheck. The NBA argued tenet labor law allows employers withhold pay employees lockout. The league also called former union director Simon Gourdine testify. He said understanding negotiated old labor agreement 1995 players would paid owners chose reopen agreement impose lockout. More 220 National Basketball Association players guaranteed contracts find Monday whether paid management lockout, long-awaited arbitrator's decision may affect leverage league's dispute players major ramifications American sports-labor law. But neither players owners counting ruling arbitrator, John Feerick, speed negotiations, especially Feerick finds favor players, award could approach $800 million salaries. NBA attorneys indicated union decision goes management, seek vacated appealing U.S. District Court Manhattan then, necessary, 2nd U.S. Circuit Court Appeals, process could prevent players getting paid several months. The NBA already canceled first two weeks regular season labor dispute. The league litigation pending U.S. District Court Manhattan. If players win ruling, NBA intends renew motion disqualify Feerick. The motion brought last summer grounds collective bargaining agreement existed and, therefore, jurisdiction hear matter. If rules favor, I think emboldens spirit resolve players, said Billy Hunter, union executive director. But understand end lockout. It means pay 200-some players. And still litigation alive may take resolve. At most, hollow victory. Feerick taken full 30 days render decision. Whatever decides, ruling watched carefully. There precedent locked-out athletes paid. During NBA summer lockout 1995, players missed paychecks file grievance. Neither National Hockey League players locked first three months 1994-95 season. The union argued owners protected inserting clauses non-payment lockouts strikes individual player contracts. In support arguments, union pointed clauses individual player contracts contained language precluding payment lockout. The league relying basic tenets labor law, hold employees paid strikes lockouts. A ruling union would significant future negotiations players owners. The deterrent factor lockout employees subject collective bargaining agreement get paid agreement expires unable reach new agreement. If Feerick finds favor players, economic incentive guaranteed contracts reach agreement quickly. They would essentially paid playing basketball. If Feerick finds favor owners, reality paid may spur players reach agreement quickly. But Hunter disputed notion, conference call Friday talked openly entire season's canceled players would back away ultimate goals. I'm concerned, Hunter said. There's demonstration there's going change resolve. After players saw proposals league recent posturing NBA owners, well, I two players call tell me, need be, they'd willing hock everything they've got. Another significant development may thedeparture many players Europe dispute settled, according least two player agents. I think would case-by-case basis, yes, there's already people talking that, said Bill Strickland, member union's agents advisory committee. Steve Kauffman, another member committee, said would explore possibility one client, Nets center Rony Seikaly, would sign professional team Greece. We look void deal team, Kauffman said. But would want right work temporarily could come back honor contract.' Russ Granik, NBA deputy commissioner, said league approved idea players' earning living elsewhere lockout settled. Proposals exchanged last week included concept luxury-tax system player salaries appeared reflect first signs progress negotiations lockout began July 1. But sides termed figures other's proposal unacceptable, unclear whether either side willing compromise. I think get carried away possibilities yet, Granik said. When explored idea tax system, taking players word wanted make headway. But call first proposal meaningless charitable. They proposed something impact. As stands, can't solution. The owners' goal slow growth player salaries relation leaguewide revenue next three years, players want keep earning much possible. As labor battles go, current one National Basketball Association players weird sports standards. There real possibility most, all, coming season canceled. In union battle interests best paid, make union scale, dominating discussion. And workers, management, trying make union disappear. The current arrangement produced unbalanced pay scale immense proportions. Last year players ever received union minimum, $242,000 rookies $272,000 veterans. The number players making $1 million $2 million year  middle class, NBA terms  fell sharply. But Michael Jordan made $33 million. This surprise. Sports entertainment business, movies. Big stars get millions, get union scale. Over years, NBA efforts stem rise salaries failed. The important loophole salary cap lets team sign free agent willing pay. When adopted, assumed team would pay lot rival could pay. But worked way. In current negotiation, league offered guarantee payroll rise 20 percent next four years, $1 billion $1.2 billion, says open proposals split money way players want, whether raising minimum salary guaranteeing raises veterans. The union says worried middle class, seems determined preserve free market. The league got broadcasters, NBC Time Warner's cable channels, agree pay year's television fees whether games broadcast. (They paid back later years, either reduced fees extra games show.) Owners hoped players would think management willing wait out, come terms small part season canceled. But union acting unhurried. It turned aside requests negotiations week, saying players meet first. Then issue union suicide, tactic rejected players 1995. The idea players union, would illegal antitrust laws owners collude. The sky would limit. That tactic might fail. The courts could reject union decertification vote sham, case players may fear teams would feel free offer less old union minimum. But players go route, could long time real negotiations get going. Billy Hunter, union's executive director, warned owners week prolonged lockout could destroy league's popularity. That seers said four years ago, baseball's World Series canceled labor troubles. But fan memories relatively short, baseball seems popular ever. With mind, owners players may choose battle months. In critical ruling North American National Basketball Association players' union, arbitrator John Feerick decides Monday whether 200 players guaranteed contracts paid lockout. If players win, owners liable dlrs 800 million guaranteed salaries, although vowed appeal lose. The league already sued players Feerick's jurisdiction. If win, I think emboldens spirit resolve players, union director Billy Hunter said. But I think anybody celebrating there's guarantee end lockout. It means pay 200 players, they've indicated us intent file immediate appeal take far order avoid payment. So rule favor, hollow victory. The players going get paid Nov. 15 circumstance, Hunter said. If owners win, remove last wild card players holding. The sides negotiated last Tuesday, union proposed superstar tax highest contracts. The league made counterproposal Friday, asking tax imposed much lower threshold. Hunter dismissed league's latest proposal Friday afternoon, said sides would best served awaiting Feerick's ruling. It's unlikely negotiations held week, union holding meeting NBA players agents advisory committee Las Vegas Wednesday Friday. We've got get sense players are, consider reasonable they're willing order get season commence, Hunter said. The union filed grievance Feerick lockout imposed July 1 owners' announcement June 29 would honor guaranteed deals. In six-day hearing summer, union argued owners protected liable guaranteed salaries work stoppage inserting lockout language standard player contract. The Sacramento Kings inserted lockout clause center Olden Polynice's contract 1994, approved league. The union used existence clause argue teams protected similarly. Most players due receive first paychecks Nov. 15, although dozen clauses entitling paid summer. None received paycheck. The NBA argued tenet labor law allows employers withhold pay employees lockout. The league also called former union director Simon Gourdine testify, Feerick upheld union objections prohibited Gourdine saying whether understanding negotiated old labor agreement 1995 players would paid owners chose reopen agreement impose lockout. Patrick Ewing want sound striking longshoreman demanding health benefits. I'm going try put dollars cents. But Ewing, president National Basketball Association Players Association, played public-relations game Tuesday expounding themes labor unrest: strong-willed unity short-sighted proposals. On day training camps scheduled begin, players country held news conferences 14 NBA cities proclaim ready practice regular season. We want show public we, players, want play, said Ewing, flanked five teammates. Today supposed start training camp. We want practice want season start. But unfortunately, owners locked us season postponed. The owners players scheduled hold first bargaining session Aug. 6 Thursday Manhattan. Neither side predicting progress signing new collective bargaining agreement beginning season scheduled Nov. 3. The league canceled entire 114-game preseason Monday. Next week, consider canceling first-ever regular season games league history. With wide philosophical differences $2 billion annual income distributed, sides privately said expect play regular season game December. Billy Hunter, union's executive director, offered glimmer hope. He spoke optimistically potential quick resolution. Standing feet away Ewing, said, I hope owners commissioner gotten message: we're serious deal. I'm prepared make quantum leap. I think we're far off. I think there's lot jockeying, lot rhetoric lot games played. But owners decide want deal, they'll get one. But soon after, began lambasting owners' latest proposal, includes eventual phasing Larry Bird exception  clause enables free agents earn unlimited salaries current teams. That clause represents major rift negotiations. Owners would implement restrictive salary cap would eventually put ceiling much one player earn. I know going come speedy resolution, Ewing said. They're entrenched want, hard cap. And feel hard cap, players, cannot survive. We would stupid ignorant accept deal. Said Hunter, If go proposal, joke. It's step backwards. I cannot understand it. If intent reach agreement late stage negotiate earnest, wrong way go it. League officials respond players' comments. All want fair share feel they're trying take away us, Ewing said. `There's perception we're strike. It's way around. We've locked out. Besides Ewing, Knicks included former union president Buck Williams, former vice president Herb Williams, Allan Houston John Starks. Marcus Camby also showed briefly. When media horde closed in, however, third-year forward went look late-arriving teammates practice facility. He stopped gym door, locked. They locked us out, said Rockets forward Mario Elie. Everybody's got get corrected. It's us. They're ones closed us down. The stalemate elicited talks possibly bringing mediator coming weeks, Major League Baseball 1994 help solve labor dispute. But players convinced commissioner David Stern owners set testing resolve genuine headway made negotiations. That means missing paychecks November, something Ewing said players prepared do. Both sides still awaiting outcome arbitration decision due Oct. 18. Fordham Law School dean John Feerick rule whether 200 players $800 million guaranteed contracts paid lockout. Feerick's decision could give new leverage one side. But players lose arbitration, 400 athletes  many extravagant lifestyles tremendous financial obligations  allegiances instantly tested. It's want see strong are, Ewing said. Based proposals we've received, we're strong. So far, seems though NBA dug position, Buck Williams said. I think they're concerned point making deal. He added, We're far apart Grand Canyon right now. The National Basketball Association, embroiled labor dispute players, Tuesday canceled first two weeks 1998-99 season. It first time league's 51-year history lose regular-season games. The NBA's deputy commissioner, Russ Granik, announced cancellation nearly three half hours meetings concluded Manhattan hotel. The decision cancel 99 games Nov. 3 Nov. 16 came players association proposed implementation tax system instead hard salary cap, proposal owners said would respond Friday. We tried best today try possible salvage season, said Alonzo Mourning, Miami Heat center. Unfortunately, work out. After 35,001 games blemish, NBA joins National Hockey League, National Football League Major League Baseball lost games labor dispute. Taking account three- four-week period would needed training camp free-agent signings season starts, league said would decide two weeks whether make cancellations. I'm sad disappointed, said NBA commissioner, David Stern. I consider collective failure, I honestly know else could done. I things I think best interests game. And I believe is. The decision came sides agreed substantive talks owners imposed lockout player July 1. Seventeen players, including union president Patrick Ewing vice presidents Mitch Richmond, Herb Williams, Dikemebe Mutombo Ty Corbin, attended meeting Stern, Granik five members ownership committee  Madison Square Garden president Dave Checketts owners Abe Pollin Washington, Gordon Gund Cleveland, Les Alexander Houston Jerry Colangelo Phoenix. The talks featured players association implied bevy concessions made owners felt would accommodate league's desire swing revenue pendulum back owners. The dispute involves distribution approximately $2 billion league-wide income. The main sticking point owners' insistence salary cap exceptions, implementation believe would bring player salaries' line revenue growth. While players discuss elimination Larry Bird exception  clause allows player secure amount money wants re-signing current team  address exception taxation proposal. The main points follows:  A 50 percent tax would imposed salary earned $18 million, clause would affect players exercised Bird rights. For example, player made $20 million, team would forced put $1 million fund would likely distributed low-revenue teams. There could provisions made players, said Jeffrey Kessler, chief counsel union. We want anything would encourage Chicago getting Michael Jordan back. And I think league feels way. The proposal similar luxury tax proposed union 1995 negotiations, would nearly liberal.  A salary cap credit would go effect league pays 63 percent revenues salary. Whatever figure number reduces salary cap next year. If figure $29 million salary cap, 29 teams would work salary cap $1 million less previous season. But players would assurance salary cap would go least $2 million credit goes effect.  Also, 63-percent threshold met, reduction annual 20 percent raises would take effect multi-year contracts. Players would either get raises 10 percent rate growth league revenues. The union said clearly addresses league's desire bring salaries line revenues. Since owners re-opened current agreement 57.1 percent revenue going salaries, 63-percent figure would probably come substantially owners agree proposal.  Teams would get right first refusal free agents fourth year incoming rookies, meaning player would contractually obligated team first four years deal. Currently, rookie scale three years includes clause enables player exercise Bird rights two seasons  clause Kevin Garnett parlayed astronomical $126 million deal last year Minnesota.  Finally, players agreed make marijuana banned substance. Details testing negotiated specific discussions took place testing performance-enhancing drugs, provision owners included last proposal. In return concessions, players want increase minimum salary  currently $272,500  creation average salary exception. This would allow every team salary cap able sign one free agent year average salary  currently $2.6 million. We're buoyed fact first time they've decided submit counterproposal, union's executive director, Billy Hunter, said. I know I'm optimistic, I earnestly say look ballplayers eye say made valiant effort. Asked players would finally tested financially cancellation games, Hunter added: It's us blinking. We want reach agreement. We're tired rhetoric, we're tired game-playing. Our position want accept bad deal.

Though decision cancel games surprising, represent major shift prior labor stalemates. Both sides reluctantly hammered deal 1995 start training camp sole notion missing games preserving NBA's perfect record. Tuesday, could come accord. I'd think last games cancel, Granik said.

When shot take, invented new one. When one pas to, reconfigured play teammate open. Larry Bird, Indiana countryside Boston Garden, luminous exception governing rule. That why, six year retirement National Basketball Association, name basketball's prominent, beginning induction Hall Fame 7,000 Bird watcher Civic Center Friday night. Deservedly enshrined forever exceptional, becomes Bird, exception, case study contentious potentially disastrous labor war. No, really, Bird said, I asked whether troubled likelihood legendary name soon representing symbol greed unsympathetic million. There's always player's name attached thing. I know time I happy it. That would 1988, Celtics wanted compensate Bird $4.9 million bonus push back pain, go savior. Three year later, contract arbitration involving Knicks' Patrick Ewing, agent David Falk would contend NBA conspired Celtics circumvent salary cap, order satisfy Bird. Alan Greenspan, I sure, would agree salary cap convoluted enough give anyone headache, let's say cap exist team negotiating one own. The process unsealing cap re-sign particular player eventually became known making use Larry Bird exception. And stand, onetime exception become expensive rule owner want play anymore. I understand side, said Bird, safely middle, Bird, former exception, Bird, present Indiana Pacers' coach. Without getting exception, I think important player stay place. Important, meant, franchise stability fan identification. You son 7 year old, go 7 17 10 year played, Bird said. A lot people Boston told followed me, time young college. The Bird year numbered three Celtics championship, best player pro basketball's famous team ever had. He Magic Johnson created basketball renaissance began college title showdown Salt Lake City spread worldwide, infectious smile. They stood pas, team play, decade selflessness given way one selfishness. The NBA Michael Jordan reached greater height anyone imagined could, league suffers sickness soul. If Larry Magic done did, might survive we're go through, said Bill Fitch, Bird's first Celtics coach, who, Bill Walton, stood night that, said, gave closure playing career. The owner, always, exaggerating misery, time, much easier root player. The president union Ewing, one day command player boycott world championship NBA's corporate fingerprint them, next day help television commentary work David Stern's women's annex. Ewing lead fight protect $100 million contract 21-year-olds achieved single playoff victory, linked big payoff agent friend Falk. The battle waged name salary cap make exception unexceptional, reward everyone Bird. I believe field allowance truly special one, Walton said. But group small. When I growing sport, player got recognition champion, one always made feel good game, sport. That's Larry Magic played, always dreaming special team. It hype, money. That quite case, been. Bird businessman's ball player day arrived, flannel shirt blue-collar ethic. He hired late Bob Woolf, one original heavy-hitting agent, got record rookie contract. Then went turned 29-victory catastrophe 61-victory contender. A rare Bird, honest exception rule. Despite modest encouragement new proposal delivered player owner, National Basketball Association Tuesday canceled first two week regular season, first time league's 51-year history lose game labor dispute. The NBA's deputy commissioner, Russ Granik, announced cancellation nearly three half hour meeting concluded Manhattan hotel. The decision cancel 99 game Nov. 3 Nov. 16 came player association proposed implementation tax system instead hard salary cap, proposal owner said would respond Friday. We tried best today try possible salvage season, said Alonzo Mourning, Miami Heat center. Unfortunately, work out. After 35,001 game blemish, NBA join National Hockey League, National Football League Major League Baseball lost game labor dispute. Taking account three- four-week period would needed training camp free-agent signing season start, league said would decide two week whether make cancellation. I'm sad disappointed, said NBA commissioner, David Stern. I consider collective failure, I honestly know else could done. I thing I think best interest game. And I believe is. The decision came side agreed substantive talk owner imposed lockout player July 1. Seventeen player, including union president Patrick Ewing vice president Mitch Richmond, Herb Williams, Dikemebe Mutombo Ty Corbin, attended meeting Stern, Granik five member ownership committee Madison Square Garden president Dave Checketts owner Abe Pollin Washington, Gordon Gund Cleveland, Les Alexander Houston Jerry Colangelo Phoenix. The talk featured player association implied bevy concession made owner felt would accommodate league's desire swing revenue pendulum back owner. The dispute involves distribution approximately $2 billion league-wide income. The main sticking point owners' insistence salary cap exception, implementation believe would bring player salaries' line revenue growth. While player discus elimination Larry Bird exception clause allows player secure amount money want re-signing current team address exception taxation proposal. The main point follows: A 50 percent tax would imposed salary earned $18 million, clause would affect player exercised Bird right. For example, player made $20 million, team would forced put $1 million fund would likely distributed low-revenue team. There could provision made player, said Jeffrey Kessler, chief counsel union. We want anything would encourage Chicago getting Michael Jordan back. And I think league feel way. The proposal similar luxury tax proposed union 1995 negotiation, would nearly liberal. A salary cap credit would go effect league pay 63 percent revenue salary. Whatever figure number reduces salary cap next year. If figure $29 million salary cap, 29 team would work salary cap $1 million le previous season. But player would assurance salary cap would go least $2 million credit go effect. Also, 63-percent threshold met, reduction annual 20 percent raise would take effect multi-year contract. Players would either get raise 10 percent rate growth league revenue. The union said clearly address league's desire bring salary line revenue. Since owner re-opened current agreement 57.1 percent revenue going salary, 63-percent figure would probably come substantially owner agree proposal. Teams would get right first refusal free agent fourth year incoming rookie, meaning player would contractually obligated team first four year deal. Currently, rookie scale three year includes clause enables player exercise Bird right two season clause Kevin Garnett parlayed astronomical $126 million deal last year Minnesota. Finally, player agreed make marijuana banned substance. Details testing negotiated specific discussion took place testing performance-enhancing drug, provision owner included last proposal. In return concession, player want increase minimum salary currently $272,500 creation average salary exception. This would allow every team salary cap able sign one free agent year average salary currently $2.6 million. We're buoyed fact first time they've decided submit counterproposal, union's executive director, Billy Hunter, said. I know I'm optimistic, I earnestly say look ballplayer eye say made valiant effort. Asked player would finally tested financially cancellation game, Hunter added: It's u blinking. We want reach agreement. We're tired rhetoric, we're tired game-playing. Our position want accept bad deal. Granik said refund fan would made end calendar month first refund would include monies canceled preseason game. He estimated loss hundred million dollar. I think serious concern whether tax system address kind need economically, added. But there's possibility. Added Stern, We owe fan go back look notion whether tax rate might begin achieve result wanted. It look promising, we're going spend next two day see give favorable response. Though decision cancel game surprising, represent major shift prior labor stalemate. Both side reluctantly hammered deal 1995 start training camp sole notion missing game preserving NBA's perfect record. Tuesday, could come accord. I'd think last game cancel, Granik said. But unless something else work, there's dramatic breakthrough, I think certainly season that's jeopardy. In decision almost certainly lead first work stoppage National Basketball Association history, league Monday announced cancellation 114 preseason game. Citing stalled negotiation Players Association new collective bargaining agreement, league official said would decide next week whether cancel first week regular season game. While decision expected 10 day, nonetheless sent strong signal owner player probably willing cancel least part regular season order settle labor dispute. Both side agree would take least three week hold abbreviated training camp sign 200 free agent new contract. Privately, official side believe season start scheduled Nov. 3 December. Unlike Major League Baseball, National Football League National Hockey League, NBA never lost regular-season game labor strife. Since we're negotiating, conclude likely we're going miss part regular season, deputy commissioner Russ Granik said Monday night. We'll try defer decision last minute, right look good. The two side meet Thursday first official bargaining session Aug. 6. Commissioner David Stern group owner walked meeting dismissing merit new proposal player. Neither Granik player association executive director Billy Hunter sounded week's meeting would go long way signing new agreement precursor playing again. I think choice miss game point, Hunter said. In fact, I think they've intended along. They've locked u out, they've refused negotiate they've given u proposal that's ludicrous. Not side still awaiting outcome arbitration decision due Oct. 18 - Fordham Law School dean John Feerick rule whether 200 player $800 million guaranteed contract paid lockout owner player also making time win public opinion test fans' loyalty canceling game. Monday 11 city throughout country, player holding make-shift press conference training-camp venue, NBA arena gymnasium. Patrick Ewing, union president, several teammate speak SUNY-Purchase Purchase, N.Y., Knicks train season. With training camp originally scheduled open Oct. 6, message player clear: owner would call end lockout, would ready play today. About 100 player expected attend, speak sign autograph fan afterward. I wish would put energy trying negotiate deal rather various thing they've doing, Granik said. The dispute essentially owner player judiciously divvy $2 billion income. It began last year contention owner employee receiving fair share pot. The owner allowed terminate current agreement clause enabled player salary reached 53.8 percent total basketball-related income. The owner say figure currently hovering 57.1 percent. Though many economic issue need resolved, main point contention labor agreement expired owner declared lockout July 1 clause allows team pay free agent want, regardless salary-cap rule governing NBA's 29 team. Called Larry Bird exception, created allow Hall Fame Boston Celtics forward re-sign Celtics end career. Michael Jordan exercised clause last two year Chicago Bulls, earning $30 million season figure $5 million team allowed spend player. But exorbitant salary paid several unproven star last year $100 million deal sprouting routinely, owner determined swing income pendulum back enforcing restricted salary cap hard cap putting ceiling much one player could earn. Last year, player received $1 billion dollar salary benefit made proposal guaranteed increase number 20 percent next four year, Granik said prepared statement. Our proposal would result average player salary $3.1 million minimum salary 10-year veteran $750,000. Unfortunately, union leadership unwilling give serious consideration offered. Hunter labeled claim optimistic projection, shot number new proposal presented player Sept. 25. If left current deal place, would gotten much anyway, added. All we're saying is, we're position accept hard cap. Monday's decision cancel preseason came le two week NBA indefinitely postponed training camp canceled first week exhibition game. Through ticket sale alone, Granik estimated losing exhibition season would cost league $35 million $40 million. Decisions cancellation regular season game expected made next week, added. A league official said game would canceled block one two week, depending circumstance negotiation. Thursday's bargaining session suddenly become last hope starting season time. Hurdles could overcome quickly, I reason believe Thursday, Granik said. Added Hunter: Of course expect much get done. When Russ David decide negotiation going real substantive, something happen. What they're banking player going miss paycheck cave November. It's they've ingested something pas. And pass, they'll negotiate. The first substantive talk two month opposing side National Basketball Association's labor dispute came went Thursday hint settlement. Still, five-hour meeting described cordial league almost two bull letting little steam player association produced another scheduled talk next Tuesday. Barring major compromise, enough time preserve full season prevent league losing first regular-season game labor strife November. Russ Granik, NBA's deputy commissioner, said league would wait next week's meeting deciding cancel regular-season game. He also discussed possibility significantly shortened season. We made determination need exact number game order representative season, Granik said. But recognize certain point can't possibly sell fan we're NBA season. Whether's 60 game, 50 game 49 53, we're yet. We month face decision. Perhaps progress involved Thursday conference room midtown Manhattan hotel question-and-answer session league's latest proposal player. Patrick Ewing, union president, vice president Herb Williams Dikembe Mutombo attended meeting union's executive director, Billy Hunter, union lawyer. No owner present, Granik, Commissioner David Stern league's lawyer spent day explaining intricacy two-week-old proposal player. At one point two party broke lunch, Stern Hunter raised voice accused handling constituency poorly, participant meeting said. But two seen shaking hand laughing meeting concluded shortly 3 pm. There venting side, Hunter said. We've placid respectful. Today, took coat inclined take glove little bit. Having done that, I think kind loosened side. Hunter added: Did anybody blink today? They're sort look u kind nuance find course negotiation might, way another, give indication we're mouthing one thing might open something else. We're looking body language, too. I think they're ready make deal. The last formal meeting side Aug. 6 ended Stern owner abruptly marched received proposal player. In critical ruling North American National Basketball Association players' union, arbitrator John Feerick decides Monday whether 200 player guaranteed contract paid lockout. If player win, owner liable dlrs 800 million guaranteed salary, although vowed appeal lose. The league already sued player Feerick's jurisdiction. If win, I think emboldens spirit resolve player, union director Billy Hunter said. But I think anybody celebrating there's guarantee end lockout. It mean pay 200 player, they've indicated u intent file immediate appeal take far order avoid payment. So rule favor, hollow victory. The player going get paid Nov. 15 circumstance, Hunter said. If owner win, remove last wild card player holding. The side negotiated last Tuesday, union proposed superstar tax highest contract. The league made counterproposal Friday, asking tax imposed much lower threshold. Hunter dismissed league's latest proposal Friday afternoon, said side would best served awaiting Feerick's ruling. It's unlikely negotiation held week, union holding meeting NBA player agent advisory committee Las Vegas Wednesday Friday. We've got get sense player are, consider reasonable they're willing order get season commence, Hunter said. The union filed grievance Feerick lockout imposed July 1 owners' announcement June 29 would honor guaranteed deal. In six-day hearing summer, union argued owner protected liable guaranteed salary work stoppage inserting lockout language standard player contract. The Sacramento Kings inserted lockout clause center Olden Polynice's contract 1994, approved league. The union used existence clause argue team protected similarly. Most player due receive first paycheck Nov. 15, although dozen clause entitling paid summer. None received paycheck. The NBA argued tenet labor law allows employer withhold pay employee lockout. The league also called former union director Simon Gourdine testify. He said understanding negotiated old labor agreement 1995 player would paid owner chose reopen agreement impose lockout. More 220 National Basketball Association player guaranteed contract find Monday whether paid management lockout, long-awaited arbitrator's decision may affect leverage league's dispute player major ramification American sports-labor law. But neither player owner counting ruling arbitrator, John Feerick, speed negotiation, especially Feerick find favor player, award could approach $800 million salary. NBA attorney indicated union decision go management, seek vacated appealing US. District Court Manhattan then, necessary, 2nd US. Circuit Court Appeals, process could prevent player getting paid several month. The NBA already canceled first two week regular season labor dispute. The league litigation pending US. District Court Manhattan. If player win ruling, NBA intends renew motion disqualify Feerick. The motion brought last summer ground collective bargaining agreement existed and, therefore, jurisdiction hear matter. If rule favor, I think emboldens spirit resolve player, said Billy Hunter, union executive director. But understand end lockout. It mean pay 200-some player. And still litigation alive may take resolve. At most, hollow victory. Feerick taken full 30 day render decision. Whatever decides, ruling watched carefully. There precedent locked-out athlete paid. During NBA summer lockout 1995, player missed paycheck file grievance. Neither National Hockey League player locked first three month 1994-95 season. The union argued owner protected inserting clause non-payment lockout strike individual player contract. In support argument, union pointed clause individual player contract contained language precluding payment lockout. The league relying basic tenet labor law, hold employee paid strike lockout. A ruling union would significant future negotiation player owner. The deterrent factor lockout employee subject collective bargaining agreement get paid agreement expires unable reach new agreement. If Feerick find favor player, economic incentive guaranteed contract reach agreement quickly. They would essentially paid playing basketball. If Feerick find favor owner, reality paid may spur player reach agreement quickly. But Hunter disputed notion, conference call Friday talked openly entire season's canceled player would back away ultimate goal. I'm concerned, Hunter said. There's demonstration there's going change resolve. After player saw proposal league recent posturing NBA owner, well, I two player call tell me, need be, they'd willing hock everything they've got. Another significant development may thedeparture many player Europe dispute settled, according least two player agent. I think would case-by-case basis, yes, there's already people talking that, said Bill Strickland, member union's agent advisory committee. Steve Kauffman, another member committee, said would explore possibility one client, Nets center Rony Seikaly, would sign professional team Greece. We look void deal team, Kauffman said. But would want right work temporarily could come back honor contract.' Russ Granik, NBA deputy commissioner, said league approved idea players' earning living elsewhere lockout settled. Proposals exchanged last week included concept luxury-tax system player salary appeared reflect first sign progress negotiation lockout began July 1. But side termed figure other's proposal unacceptable, unclear whether either side willing compromise. I think get carried away possibility yet, Granik said. When explored idea tax system, taking player word wanted make headway. But call first proposal meaningless charitable. They proposed something impact. As stand, can't solution. The owners' goal slow growth player salary relation leaguewide revenue next three year, player want keep earning much possible. As labor battle go, current one National Basketball Association player weird sport standard. There real possibility most, all, coming season canceled. In union battle interest best paid, make union scale, dominating discussion. And worker, management, trying make union disappear. The current arrangement produced unbalanced pay scale immense proportion. Last year player ever received union minimum, $242,000 rookie $272,000 veteran. The number player making $1 million $2 million year middle class, NBA term fell sharply. But Michael Jordan made $33 million. This surprise. Sports entertainment business, movie. Big star get million, get union scale. Over year, NBA effort stem rise salary failed. The important loophole salary cap let team sign free agent willing pay. When adopted, assumed team would pay lot rival could pay. But worked way. In current negotiation, league offered guarantee payroll rise 20 percent next four year, $1 billion $1.2 billion, say open proposal split money way player want, whether raising minimum salary guaranteeing raise veteran. The union say worried middle class, seems determined preserve free market. The league got broadcaster, NBC Time Warner's cable channel, agree pay year's television fee whether game broadcast. (They paid back later year, either reduced fee extra game show.) Owners hoped player would think management willing wait out, come term small part season canceled. But union acting unhurried. It turned aside request negotiation week, saying player meet first. Then issue union suicide, tactic rejected player 1995. The idea player union, would illegal antitrust law owner collude. The sky would limit. That tactic might fail. The court could reject union decertification vote sham, case player may fear team would feel free offer le old union minimum. But player go route, could long time real negotiation get going. Billy Hunter, union's executive director, warned owner week prolonged lockout could destroy league's popularity. That seer said four year ago, baseball's World Series canceled labor trouble. But fan memory relatively short, baseball seems popular ever. With mind, owner player may choose battle month. In critical ruling North American National Basketball Association players' union, arbitrator John Feerick decides Monday whether 200 player guaranteed contract paid lockout. If player win, owner liable dlrs 800 million guaranteed salary, although vowed appeal lose. The league already sued player Feerick's jurisdiction. If win, I think emboldens spirit resolve player, union director Billy Hunter said. But I think anybody celebrating there's guarantee end lockout. It mean pay 200 player, they've indicated u intent file immediate appeal take far order avoid payment. So rule favor, hollow victory. The player going get paid Nov. 15 circumstance, Hunter said. If owner win, remove last wild card player holding. The side negotiated last Tuesday, union proposed superstar tax highest contract. The league made counterproposal Friday, asking tax imposed much lower threshold. Hunter dismissed league's latest proposal Friday afternoon, said side would best served awaiting Feerick's ruling. It's unlikely negotiation held week, union holding meeting NBA player agent advisory committee Las Vegas Wednesday Friday. We've got get sense player are, consider reasonable they're willing order get season commence, Hunter said. The union filed grievance Feerick lockout imposed July 1 owners' announcement June 29 would honor guaranteed deal. In six-day hearing summer, union argued owner protected liable guaranteed salary work stoppage inserting lockout language standard player contract. The Sacramento Kings inserted lockout clause center Olden Polynice's contract 1994, approved league. The union used existence clause argue team protected similarly. Most player due receive first paycheck Nov. 15, although dozen clause entitling paid summer. None received paycheck. The NBA argued tenet labor law allows employer withhold pay employee lockout. The league also called former union director Simon Gourdine testify, Feerick upheld union objection prohibited Gourdine saying whether understanding negotiated old labor agreement 1995 player would paid owner chose reopen agreement impose lockout. Patrick Ewing want sound striking longshoreman demanding health benefit. I'm going try put dollar cent. But Ewing, president National Basketball Association Players Association, played public-relations game Tuesday expounding theme labor unrest: strong-willed unity short-sighted proposal. On day training camp scheduled begin, player country held news conference 14 NBA city proclaim ready practice regular season. We want show public we, player, want play, said Ewing, flanked five teammate. Today supposed start training camp. We want practice want season start. But unfortunately, owner locked u season postponed. The owner player scheduled hold first bargaining session Aug. 6 Thursday Manhattan. Neither side predicting progress signing new collective bargaining agreement beginning season scheduled Nov. 3. The league canceled entire 114-game preseason Monday. Next week, consider canceling first-ever regular season game league history. With wide philosophical difference $2 billion annual income distributed, side privately said expect play regular season game December. Billy Hunter, union's executive director, offered glimmer hope. He spoke optimistically potential quick resolution. Standing foot away Ewing, said, I hope owner commissioner gotten message: we're serious deal. I'm prepared make quantum leap. I think we're far off. I think there's lot jockeying, lot rhetoric lot game played. But owner decide want deal, they'll get one. But soon after, began lambasting owners' latest proposal, includes eventual phasing Larry Bird exception clause enables free agent earn unlimited salary current team. That clause represents major rift negotiation. Owners would implement restrictive salary cap would eventually put ceiling much one player earn. I know going come speedy resolution, Ewing said. They're entrenched want, hard cap. And feel hard cap, player, cannot survive. We would stupid ignorant accept deal. Said Hunter, If go proposal, joke. It's step backwards. I cannot understand it. If intent reach agreement late stage negotiate earnest, wrong way go it. League official respond players' comment. All want fair share feel they're trying take away u, Ewing said. `There's perception we're strike. It's way around. We've locked out. Besides Ewing, Knicks included former union president Buck Williams, former vice president Herb Williams, Allan Houston John Starks. Marcus Camby also showed briefly. When medium horde closed in, however, third-year forward went look late-arriving teammate practice facility. He stopped gym door, locked. They locked u out, said Rockets forward Mario Elie. Everybody's got get corrected. It's u. They're one closed u down. The stalemate elicited talk possibly bringing mediator coming week, Major League Baseball 1994 help solve labor dispute. But player convinced commissioner David Stern owner set testing resolve genuine headway made negotiation. That mean missing paycheck November, something Ewing said player prepared do. Both side still awaiting outcome arbitration decision due Oct. 18. Fordham Law School dean John Feerick rule whether 200 player $800 million guaranteed contract paid lockout. Feerick's decision could give new leverage one side. But player lose arbitration, 400 athlete many extravagant lifestyle tremendous financial obligation allegiance instantly tested. It's want see strong are, Ewing said. Based proposal we've received, we're strong. So far, seems though NBA dug position, Buck Williams said. I think they're concerned point making deal. He added, We're far apart Grand Canyon right now. The National Basketball Association, embroiled labor dispute player, Tuesday canceled first two week 1998-99 season. It first time league's 51-year history lose regular-season game. The NBA's deputy commissioner, Russ Granik, announced cancellation nearly three half hour meeting concluded Manhattan hotel. The decision cancel 99 game Nov. 3 Nov. 16 came player association proposed implementation tax system instead hard salary cap, proposal owner said would respond Friday. We tried best today try possible salvage season, said Alonzo Mourning, Miami Heat center. Unfortunately, work out. After 35,001 game blemish, NBA join National Hockey League, National Football League Major League Baseball lost game labor dispute. Taking account three- four-week period would needed training camp free-agent signing season start, league said would decide two week whether make cancellation. I'm sad disappointed, said NBA commissioner, David Stern. I consider collective failure, I honestly know else could done. I thing I think best interest game. And I believe is. The decision came side agreed substantive talk owner imposed lockout player July 1. Seventeen player, including union president Patrick Ewing vice president Mitch Richmond, Herb Williams, Dikemebe Mutombo Ty Corbin, attended meeting Stern, Granik five member ownership committee Madison Square Garden president Dave Checketts owner Abe Pollin Washington, Gordon Gund Cleveland, Les Alexander Houston Jerry Colangelo Phoenix.

We want reach agreement. We're tired rhetoric, we're tired game-playing. Our position want accept bad deal. Granik said refund fan would made end calendar month first refund would include monies canceled preseason game. He estimated loss hundred million dollar. I think serious concern whether tax system address kind need economically, added. But there's possibility. Added Stern, We owe fan go back look notion whether tax rate might begin achieve result wanted. It look promising, we're going spend next two day see give favorable response. Though decision cancel game surprising, represent major shift prior labor stalemate. Both side reluctantly hammered deal 1995 start training camp sole notion missing game preserving NBA's perfect record. Tuesday, could come accord. I'd think last game cancel, Granik said. But unless something else work, there's dramatic breakthrough, I think certainly season that's jeopardy. \n","Congolese rebels taken two-month campaign oust President Laurent Kabila Internet. We explain world audience we're fighting for, rebel leader Ernest Wamba dia Wamba said Friday. Besides, (Kabila) government using Internet tell side story. The 56-year-old history professor University Dar es Salaam Tanzania said supporters Congolese Rally Democracy United States created web site rebellion.

They still talk Tutsis leading rebellion. Well, I'm Tutsi, Wamba said.

Rebels eastern Congo Saturday said shot passenger jet ferrying 40 government soldiers strategic airport facing rebel assault. A Congo Airlines executive said victims civilians evacuated Kindu, 1,000 kilometers (620 miles) east capital, Kinshasa. Neither claim could confirmed independently. Stavros Papaioannou, president airline's management committee, said missile hit rear engine Boeing jet aircraft took Kindu airport. A rebel military commander, requested anonymity, said plane carrying troops, although explain knew this. He said plane shot approaching Kindu air base, rebels deployed least two surface-to-air missiles 3,500 troops preparation final assault government-held town.

We hope make clear president Milosevic people Yugoslavia extreme gravity situation, said. Under NATO threat end punishing offensive ethnic Albanian separatists Kosovo, President Slobodan Milosevic Yugoslavia ordered units army back barracks may well avoid attack alliance, military observers diplomats say. Milosevic, one hand excoriated Washington scourge Kosovo hand treated key peace Bosnia, acted European Union, NATO United Nations prepared review Monday possible military intervention. Russia stepped warnings action dispatched foreign defense ministers unusually high-level mission see Yugoslav president Sunday Belgrade. As often, Milosevic appears bowed foreign demands nick time still accomplished wanted. This weekend, foreign diplomatic observers Kosovo reported military stand-down taken place province, Milosevic's forces waged fierce offensive Albanian rebels. The observers said segments three brigades, units Yugoslav army home. The daily reports observer mission, made U.S., European Union Russian military experts, one key elements helping Washington European capitals decide whether Milosevic met demands cease-fire. By putting army back barracks, sending police units Kosovo ordering end burning looting villages, Milosevic may well avoid NATO attack, diplomats Washington said. But time, acknowledge NATO looked way, enjoyed three-month license overwhelm Kosovo Liberation Army  rebel army fighting independence Kosovo ethnic Albanian majority  terrorize rural civilian population supports it. His military operation created 250,000 refugees, Clinton administration gearing take care winter variety relief organizations. U.S. officials said expected Richard Holbrooke, U.S. envoy dealt Milosevic negotiating end war Bosnia, meet Monday discuss political plan Kosovo. The heart disagreement Kosovo Serbia, Yugoslavia's principal republic, insists keeping Kosovo province, ethnic Albanians chafed Milosevic's repression stripped province virtual autonomy 1989, seek independence. The West, fearing precedent independence Kosovo would set conflicts world, trying mediate middle course. In essence, diplomats said believed plan Holbrooke present Milosevic calls three-year interim period leading status fairly close pre-1989 autonomy arrangement. Since Kosovo conflict flared March, critics Washington's policy Milosevic argue able choreograph every move suit goal: pushing Albanian population submission impunity. The United States allies waited four months cleaned clock Kosovo Liberation Army, said Morton Abramowitz, head International Crisis Group, policy analysis organization, taken three weeks discuss military action, result 500 Albanian villages destroyed. Administration officials acknowledge NATO failed live earlier threat June strike Serbia, Milosevic took advantage indecision plunged ahead artillery tank offensive lightly armed guerrilla forces, whose bedrock popular support helped win effective control large swaths Kosovo territory, including key roads. While that, Milosevic skillfully managed key requirement Washington: made sure war spill neighboring Albania Macedonia, fragile countries traditionally volatile area. All along, biggest fear Washington Kosovo conflict would engulf neighboring countries encourage Albania ethnic Albanian population Macedonia join cause. Such possibility raised specter new Balkans conflict three years peace secured Bosnia. Milosevic catered Washington's concern conflict contained. The Yugoslav army mined Kosovo's borders Macedonia Albania, ensuring refugees could escape limiting routes arms supplies rebels. The Yugoslav leader also understood Washington unsure deal disorganized Albanian political leadership Kosovo unbending Kosovo Liberation Army, whose main chiefs hardened emigres returned Switzerland Germany. For example, Holbrooke persuaded Milosevic meet May Ibrahim Rugova, top Albanian political leader Kosovo, encounter turned little photo opportunity. For procedural breakthrough, Holbrooke recommended lifting ban foreign investment Serbia put place month before. After meeting Rugova, Milosevic stepped military operations Kosovo, forcing Washington reverse carry investment ban. In late June, Holbrooke met two self-styled Kosovo guerrilla commanders province's western town Junik broke contact. Clinton administration officials said time concerned NATO intervention would bolster separatist forces. To try put best face situation, Washington worked Moscow get Milosevic accept presence international monitors would patrol Kosovo report military action. The monitors slow getting organized. By August, Yugoslav army, backed Serbian special police, full swing rebels burning looting villages process, monitors found difficult gain access fighting. They drove roadblocks, knew something going sounds smoke, could precise. In recent days tanks artillery withdrawn, access improved, monitors say. But areas central Kosovo Likovac Gornje Obrinje monitors ruled limits land mines roads. The mines believed planted guerrillas. Gornje Obrinje site massacre 18 ethnic Albanian women, children elderly people Sept. 26. A British reporter walked fields village Sunday said 10 mortar shells, apparently Serbian police Yugoslav army, fired village early Sunday afternoon. The Yugoslav army police forces responsible vast majority atrocities Kosovo conflict, said report New York-based group Human Rights Watch, released Sunday. The report said rebels also violated laws war taking civilian hostages carrying summary executions. But violations guerrillas lesser scale government abuses, author report, Fred Abrahams, concluded. The report focused called watershed conflict  attack police forces three ethnic Albanian villages late February early March Drenica region central Kosovo. At least 83 people, including 24 women children, killed attack, involved helicopters, artillery armored personnel carriers. In Yugoslav capital, Belgrade, four-hour drive north rolling countryside Kosovo's capital Pristina, Milosevic remains politically secure. That part, domestic critics say, diplomats Holbrooke head U.N.refugee agency, Sadako Ogata, insist going see him, thus enhancing stature. The American envoy Richard Holbrooke met President Slobodan Milosevic Yugoslavia Monday night according American diplomats told take steps pull back military Kosovo Province face NATO attack. Milosevic also told, diplomats said, insure roughly 250,000 ethnic Albanian refugees forced flee homes fighting last six months allowed return home. Most refugees reluctant return many Serb police officers destroyed homes villages remain neighborhoods. After delivering sternest message far Milosevic Kosovo conflict, Holbrooke said news conference NATO's military plans attacking Serbia moving ahead serious, intense sustained basis.

Shortly Holbrooke's meeting Milosevic, Yugoslav leader issued defiant statement Serbian television said threats aggression outlined Holbrooke represented criminal act. Milosevic, rarely comments meetings foreign diplomats whose tough words cast unusually ominous tone, also said Holbrooke's position constituted support Albanian terrorists Albanian people. Milosevic apparently accusing Holbrooke supporting ethnic Albanian guerrillas Kosovo Liberation Army, fighting make Serbian province Kosovo independent nation. The Yugoslav leader added seven days skirmishes military action. An American diplomat familiar themes Holbrooke planned stress Milosevic said expectation American envoy would walk Monday night agreement. Rather, point underscore Yugoslav leader make explicit expected him. It quite ultimatum, diplomat said, matter steps taken show compliance. The essence Holbrooke's demands centered issues outlined United Nations Security Council resolution two weeks ago. The resolution ordered Milosevic withdraw extra army police forces sent Kosovo deal guerrillas send back bases military forces normally stationed province. So far, American diplomats said, Milosevic withdrawn troops field barracks. Such move essential, American diplomats said, create conducive atmosphere possible negotiations future status province. The U.N. resolution also calls political solution. Holbrooke U.S. ambassador Macedonia, Christopher Hill, discussed Milosevic political document drawn State Department calls broad autonomy Kosovo. Milosevic withdrew autonomy 1989 began campaign Serb nationalism. The countryside central Kosovo eerily silent last Thursday. The sound artillery thuds mortar rounds noticeably absent coils white smoke signified burning villages vanished green hills valleys. Police checkpoints relaxed areas sealed time last week Yugoslav army open patrols diplomatic monitors United States, European Union Russia.

But NATO Secretary-General Javier Solana told reporter Alliance believed Yugoslavia met condition demanded UN. Security Council. The reality coming u compliance place, Solana said. As far concerned, again, I tell ready. In New York, UN. Secretary-General Kofi Annan said systematic terror inflicted Kosovo civilian recent day Yugoslav force mostly responsible. But Annan said mean necessary provide independent assessment compliance required Security Council suggested 15 member may want make judgement respect. Following meeting Solana Brussels, Belgium, US. special envoy Richard Holbrooke said situation southern Serbian province bad two week ago. Holbrooke said would tell Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic extreme gravity situation. Sources speaking condition anonymity said Holbrooke arrived Belgrade late Monday afternoon expected meet Milosevic evening. BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) US. special envoy Richard Holbrooke said Monday military situation Kosovo bad two week ago. Holbrooke said explain extreme gravity situation meet Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic later Monday. Speaking meeting NATO Secretary General Javier Solana Supreme Allied Commander Europe Wesley K. Clark, Holbrooke said level fighting (in Kosovo) may abated temporarily, capacity resumption there. The situation therefore remains fully serious today week two ago, told reporter flying Belgrade. He plan meet Kosovan Albanian leader Tuesday. We hope make clear president Milosevic people Yugoslavia extreme gravity situation, said. Under NATO threat end punishing offensive ethnic Albanian separatist Kosovo, President Slobodan Milosevic Yugoslavia ordered unit army back barrack may well avoid attack alliance, military observer diplomat say. Milosevic, one hand excoriated Washington scourge Kosovo hand treated key peace Bosnia, acted European Union, NATO United Nations prepared review Monday possible military intervention. Russia stepped warning action dispatched foreign defense minister unusually high-level mission see Yugoslav president Sunday Belgrade. As often, Milosevic appears bowed foreign demand nick time still accomplished wanted. This weekend, foreign diplomatic observer Kosovo reported military stand-down taken place province, Milosevic's force waged fierce offensive Albanian rebel. The observer said segment three brigade, unit Yugoslav army home. The daily report observer mission, made U.S., European Union Russian military expert, one key element helping Washington European capital decide whether Milosevic met demand cease-fire. By putting army back barrack, sending police unit Kosovo ordering end burning looting village, Milosevic may well avoid NATO attack, diplomat Washington said. But time, acknowledge NATO looked way, enjoyed three-month license overwhelm Kosovo Liberation Army rebel army fighting independence Kosovo ethnic Albanian majority terrorize rural civilian population support it. His military operation created 250,000 refugee, Clinton administration gearing take care winter variety relief organization. US. official said expected Richard Holbrooke, US. envoy dealt Milosevic negotiating end war Bosnia, meet Monday discus political plan Kosovo. The heart disagreement Kosovo Serbia, Yugoslavia's principal republic, insists keeping Kosovo province, ethnic Albanians chafed Milosevic's repression stripped province virtual autonomy 1989, seek independence. The West, fearing precedent independence Kosovo would set conflict world, trying mediate middle course. In essence, diplomat said believed plan Holbrooke present Milosevic call three-year interim period leading status fairly close pre-1989 autonomy arrangement. Since Kosovo conflict flared March, critic Washington's policy Milosevic argue able choreograph every move suit goal: pushing Albanian population submission impunity. The United States ally waited four month cleaned clock Kosovo Liberation Army, said Morton Abramowitz, head International Crisis Group, policy analysis organization, taken three week discus military action, result 500 Albanian village destroyed. Administration official acknowledge NATO failed live earlier threat June strike Serbia, Milosevic took advantage indecision plunged ahead artillery tank offensive lightly armed guerrilla force, whose bedrock popular support helped win effective control large swath Kosovo territory, including key road. While that, Milosevic skillfully managed key requirement Washington: made sure war spill neighboring Albania Macedonia, fragile country traditionally volatile area. All along, biggest fear Washington Kosovo conflict would engulf neighboring country encourage Albania ethnic Albanian population Macedonia join cause. Such possibility raised specter new Balkans conflict three year peace secured Bosnia. Milosevic catered Washington's concern conflict contained. The Yugoslav army mined Kosovo's border Macedonia Albania, ensuring refugee could escape limiting route arm supply rebel. The Yugoslav leader also understood Washington unsure deal disorganized Albanian political leadership Kosovo unbending Kosovo Liberation Army, whose main chief hardened emigre returned Switzerland Germany. For example, Holbrooke persuaded Milosevic meet May Ibrahim Rugova, top Albanian political leader Kosovo, encounter turned little photo opportunity. For procedural breakthrough, Holbrooke recommended lifting ban foreign investment Serbia put place month before. After meeting Rugova, Milosevic stepped military operation Kosovo, forcing Washington reverse carry investment ban. In late June, Holbrooke met two self-styled Kosovo guerrilla commander province's western town Junik broke contact. Clinton administration official said time concerned NATO intervention would bolster separatist force. To try put best face situation, Washington worked Moscow get Milosevic accept presence international monitor would patrol Kosovo report military action. The monitor slow getting organized. By August, Yugoslav army, backed Serbian special police, full swing rebel burning looting village process, monitor found difficult gain access fighting. They drove roadblock, knew something going sound smoke, could precise. In recent day tank artillery withdrawn, access improved, monitor say. But area central Kosovo Likovac Gornje Obrinje monitor ruled limit land mine road. The mine believed planted guerrilla. Gornje Obrinje site massacre 18 ethnic Albanian woman, child elderly people Sept. 26. A British reporter walked field village Sunday said 10 mortar shell, apparently Serbian police Yugoslav army, fired village early Sunday afternoon. The Yugoslav army police force responsible vast majority atrocity Kosovo conflict, said report New York-based group Human Rights Watch, released Sunday. The report said rebel also violated law war taking civilian hostage carrying summary execution. But violation guerrilla lesser scale government abuse, author report, Fred Abrahams, concluded. The report focused called watershed conflict attack police force three ethnic Albanian village late February early March Drenica region central Kosovo. At least 83 people, including 24 woman child, killed attack, involved helicopter, artillery armored personnel carrier. In Yugoslav capital, Belgrade, four-hour drive north rolling countryside Kosovo's capital Pristina, Milosevic remains politically secure. That part, domestic critic say, diplomat Holbrooke head U.N.refugee agency, Sadako Ogata, insist going see him, thus enhancing stature. The American envoy Richard Holbrooke met President Slobodan Milosevic Yugoslavia Monday night according American diplomat told take step pull back military Kosovo Province face NATO attack. Milosevic also told, diplomat said, insure roughly 250,000 ethnic Albanian refugee forced flee home fighting last six month allowed return home. Most refugee reluctant return many Serb police officer destroyed home village remain neighborhood. After delivering sternest message far Milosevic Kosovo conflict, Holbrooke said news conference NATO's military plan attacking Serbia moving ahead serious, intense sustained basis. Holbrooke's mission Milosevic described American diplomat die trip, added, We're serious juncture. Shortly Holbrooke's meeting Milosevic, Yugoslav leader issued defiant statement Serbian television said threat aggression outlined Holbrooke represented criminal act. Milosevic, rarely comment meeting foreign diplomat whose tough word cast unusually ominous tone, also said Holbrooke's position constituted support Albanian terrorist Albanian people. Milosevic apparently accusing Holbrooke supporting ethnic Albanian guerrilla Kosovo Liberation Army, fighting make Serbian province Kosovo independent nation. The Yugoslav leader added seven day skirmish military action. An American diplomat familiar theme Holbrooke planned stress Milosevic said expectation American envoy would walk Monday night agreement. Rather, point underscore Yugoslav leader make explicit expected him. It quite ultimatum, diplomat said, matter step taken show compliance. The essence Holbrooke's demand centered issue outlined United Nations Security Council resolution two week ago. The resolution ordered Milosevic withdraw extra army police force sent Kosovo deal guerrilla send back base military force normally stationed province. So far, American diplomat said, Milosevic withdrawn troop field barrack. Such move essential, American diplomat said, create conducive atmosphere possible negotiation future status province. The UN. resolution also call political solution. Holbrooke US. ambassador Macedonia, Christopher Hill, discussed Milosevic political document drawn State Department call broad autonomy Kosovo. Milosevic withdrew autonomy 1989 began campaign Serb nationalism. The countryside central Kosovo eerily silent last Thursday. The sound artillery thud mortar round noticeably absent coil white smoke signified burning village vanished green hill valley. Police checkpoint relaxed area sealed time last week Yugoslav army open patrol diplomatic monitor United States, European Union Russia. These monitor, many former military officer, reported Yugoslav army stood seen virtually military action late last week. There sporadic shooting, monitor reported. But superficial calm good enough Serb military capacity resume fighting quickly, NATO military officer said Monday. The officer added cease-fire Kosovo pretty much enacted. He also said trend compliance positive. The interior ministry police must also reduce presence village refugee fled confidence return, military officer said. Some interior ministry police officer left province, enough, added. On question badly damaged KLA Yugoslav army's three-month offensive, NATO officer said, It's fair assessment KLA dismantled destroyed. Holbrooke's first stop Monday Brussels, met secretary-general NATO, Javier Solana. On Tuesday plan travel Pristina, capital Kosovo, scheduled meet ethnic Albanian leader Ibrahim Rugova present political proposal future status Kosovo. He expected back Belgrade Tuesday afternoon another session Milosevic. The United States Russia ratcheting pressure President Slobodan Milosevic, warning NATO airstrikes inevitable unless take decisive action soon end humanitarian crisis southern Serbian province.

Kim Myong Sup, 23, living hiding third country fleeing North Korea last year, Ministry Foreign Affairs Trade said. The ministry generally uses term third country avoid naming China, required treaty North Korea return defectors homeland. The ministry described Kim former athlete, said details background method escape North Korea available. About 200 North Koreans defected South Korea three years, including 60 far year. All complained severe food fuel shortages country. The Koreas divided communist North capitalist South 1945. They fought Korean War 1950-53 never signed formal peace treaty. Hunger malnutrition Cambodia reaching crisis levels comparable effects famine North Korea, U.N. World Food Program representative said Tuesday. Though North Korea suffering simple lack food, faltering economy Cambodia combined weak health care education causing similar levels malnutrition children, said Ken Davies, WFP's country director. There enough rice. The problem people poor access it. The problem poverty, Davies said. The WFP currently supporting 1.7 million hungry Cambodians  15 percent population  food-for-work direct assistance programs, Davies said fears still plenty getting enough eat every day. The problem bad little worse North Korea, Davies said. The situation much worse people recognize. According recent WFP survey, 49 percent Cambodian children age 5 stunted lack food 20 percent suffer acute malnutrition. By comparison, similar survey North Korean children 7 found 65 percent stunted 16 percent suffer acute malnutrition. Cambodia produced rice surplus export last two years expects another year, WFP statistics show 25 percent rice-growing areas account 75 percent surplus. The majority Cambodian farmers producing enough keep families fed increasingly saddled debts incurred run reserves harvest, Davies said. Money-lenders rural Cambodia typically charge 100 percent interest, must paid rice harvest time, giving many farmers handicapped start next crop season. Poor sanitation, lack health care ignorance modern child rearing  problems left mostly unaddressed under-funded health education sectors Cambodia  exacerbated food security problem, Davies said. Davies urged new government substantially increase annual expenditures health, education rural development first step long-term solution Cambodia's food crisis. The poverty getting worse right situation malnutrition children crisis, Davies said. Cambodia typically earmarks half annual budget defense security. In 1998 budget, education allocated 6.5 percent, health 4.4 percent rural development 0.2 percent. Actual disbursements three ministries 60 70 percent budgeted amount annual revenues fall short expectations, according aid workers. A 1999 budget draft proposed reduction health ministry's allotment, caused outcry September health officials U.N. World Health Program. The draft later readjusted provide unprecedented 33 percent increase health spending. North Korea entering fourth winter chronic food shortages people malnourished risk dying normally curable illnesses, senior Red Cross officials said Tuesday. The officials warned international complacency hostility North Korea food crisis stretches isolated communist country shows little willingness adopt far-reaching changes revive ruined economy. Humanitarian suffering cannot routine part world, said Margareta Wahlstrom, Red Cross' undersecretary disaster relief, returned Beijing Tuesday week inspecting aid agency's operations North Korea. She Red Cross officials saw ravages North Korea's slow-motion famine: electricity supplied half capital, Pyongyang, time; elderly looking swollen, sign long-term hunger; generation children stunted, 10-year-olds looking 6-year-olds 5-year-olds 2-year-olds. Everywhere, bakeries government ministries, people served noodles cakes made soybeans mixed acorns, grass herbs, Red Cross president Astrid Heiberg said. Heiberg likened additives cattle food noted doctors reported rise stomach illnesses mixtures. This really part daily life, said. You would give children elderly mother knowing would get cramps stomach diarrhea unless stomach moaning. Three years floods drought started 1995 devastated North Korea's collective farming planned economy, already teetering loss Soviet bloc trading partners. With goods money barter buy foreign supplies, country lacks sufficient fertilizer crops, fuel parts machinery. The Red Cross inspectors saw soldiers people harvesting cabbage, winter's main vegetable. The grain harvest finished U.N. estimates little improved last year's: 3 million tons, enough meet two-thirds needs North Korea's 22 million people. As long, harsh winter begins, doctors confirm official statistics show widespread malnutrition, tuberculosis rise hunger-weakened patients unable recover operations sickness, Heiberg said. Doctors worry respiratory illnesses common winter may take toll weakened population, said. One 10-bed hospital countryside keeping three patients time food care more, said Heiberg. The Red Cross wants focus latest dlrs 9 million appeal getting essential medicines blankets warm clothes North Korea. Food aid largely turned U.N. agencies. Despite catastrophic hunger home, North Korea plans send 317 athletes officials next month's Asian Games Thailand, South Korean officials said Thursday. It largest sports delegation communist country sent abroad recent years. North Korean Sports Minister Chang Ung said 209 athletes country compete 21 events Bangkok, hoping win medals women's judo, women's soccer, wrestling, table tennis, weightlifting boxing. Chang made remarks interview published recently Chosun Shinbo, newspaper run pro-North Korean residents Japan, said Seoul's Naewoe Press, obtained report. Chang said North Korea sending large delegation Bangkok prepare 2000 Sydney Olympics. North Korea enter last Asian Games, Hiroshima, Japan, 1994. It sent 18 athletes officials Winter Olympics Nagano, Japan, February. Naewoe run South Korea's main government intelligence agency specializes monitoring communist news media. Three years floods drought started 1995 devastated North Korea's collective farming planned economy, forcing country rely aid feed 23 million people. Famine-threatened North Korea's harvest better year last could worse, senior U.N. aid official said Saturday. North Korea needs minimum 4.5 million 5 million tons grain feed 23 million people, managed last year harvest 2.8 million tons, Namanga Ngongi, deputy head World Food Program said. Although hard figures available, prospects year harvest better, Ngongi told reporters Beijing visiting North Korea. It may worse last year. Poor harvests, economic collapse three years floods drought, produced chronic food shortages North Korea left heavily reliant foreign aid. Fertilizer lacking, fuel power tractors farm machinery, meaning planting harvesting must done hand. Every year gets worse, Ngongi said. But need food aid, Ngongi said government month ago cut number counties WFP access 171 145, reducing number people get aid 6.7 million 5.8 million. Most receiving WFP aid children aged 6 months 6 years. Ngongi said government cited security concerns  notably lack peace treaty rival South Korea  decision. The government said ban would temporary, Ngongi added. Ngongi, spent four days inspecting WFP relief efforts North Korea, said people generally looked better visit last year. But also said could see large part population weak. Everybody consuming low level. So may severely malnourished, well nourished all, said. U.S. officials toured hardest-hit regions North Korea summer said 2 million people may died famine. Ngongi said saw malnourished children said 10 11 years old, appeared 4 5 years old. About 30 percent children one primary school visited class. A lot children weak come school, said. But Ngongi said foreign food aid saved lives. A lot people alive today thanks international community's support, said. A congressman visited remote parts North Korea last week said Saturday food health situation desperate deteriorating, millions North Koreans might starved death last years. The congressman, Tony Hall, D-Ohio, longtime interest world hunger, passed Tokyo return United States showed photographs taken North Korean children patchy hair, protruding bones, open sores signs severe malnutrition. Hall also brought back bag officials called substitute food distributed government food station: dried leaves straw, coarse cattle would normally turn away. They grind powder make noodles, Hall said. The noodles nutrition indigestible, leaving people holding aching stomachs, said. North Korea admitted facing serious economic difficulties, sharply diverging assessments serious are. Some visitors United Nations organizations said food situation seems bit better year two ago. Hall said divergence might arisen North Korean capital, Pyongyang, life seem slightly better three previous trips North Korea. But rural areas foreigners allowed visit, added, overall situation worse ever. Based visits four hospitals, Hall also emphasized public health care declined sharply. In one hospital, assistants holding patient surgeons conducted stomach operation electric lights anesthesia. Ordinary North Koreans suffering, part, government's hard-line policies alienated would-be donors aid agencies. The United Nations repeatedly appealed relief aid North Korea, latest appeal raised less one-third target. In September, Doctors Without Borders announced pulling staff 13 North Korea feared aid going politically connected rather needy. North Korea release mortality figures health statistics, Hall said United Nations gathered would soon release data indicating 30 percent North Korean children age 2 acutely malnourished 67 percent children physically stunted. Hall said thought overall least 1 million people died total probably closer 3 million. In indication seriousness professional demographers view situation, U.S. Bureau Census recently published estimates suggesting North Korea's population peaked 1995 21.55 million fallen 21.23 million year. That would decline 320,000 three years, period North Korea's population would expected grow 925,000 people, based population growth rate early 1990s. Nicholas Eberstadt, American specialist North Korean population figures, says simply enough hard information estimate death toll famine. But notes one political tidbit: North Korea's constitution stipulates one delegate country's people's assembly every 30,000 citizens. This year's assembly expand previous ones did, rather 687 delegates, previous assembly held 1990. While Eberstadt counsels caution, could mean North Korea's population, eight years expected add several million people, back 20.6 million people fewer. The United States supplying grain North Korea, strains growing secret underground complex North experts worry may heart new nuclear weapons program. The United States warned last week agreed framework basis relations North Korea jeopardy unless North lets American experts visit underground complex resolve doubts. North Korea said show complex Washington promises complex nuclear one, pay vilifying us impairing prestige. Washington refuses pay, North Korea warning standoff could lead agreement fall apart. Their shameless wicked demand open infringement sovereignty wanton interference internal affairs, declared North Korea's leading newspaper, Rodong Sinmun. More five years severe food shortages near-total breakdown public health system led devastating malnutrition North Korea probably left entire generation children physically mentally impaired, new study international aid groups found. The study, first scientific nutritional survey North Korea, confirms disturbing reports international aid workers, year gained increasing access population highly isolated secretive country. Among shocking findings, researchers World Food Program, Unicef European Union found that, long-term food shortages, staggering 62 percent children 7 years old suffer stunted growth. They discovered that, huge international food aid program three years, severe malnutrition widespread toddlers crucial stages brain development, suggesting generation's physical mental abilities develop normally losses never recovered. Separately, international medical workers groups Red Cross, begun document effects food shortages severely compounded breakdown public health services. Even basic water purification systems stand idle lack essential ingredients chlorine, Red Cross workers say, leaving vast numbers people severe diarrhea unable absorb completely little food have. As North Korean dictatorship slowly, grudgingly, granted increased access international aid groups last six months, increasingly clear saddening picture hunger haas emerged result large formal study informal surveys observations foreign aid agencies. Past assessments magnitude disaster country 23 million considered flawed based interviews small number North Korean refugees fled China. And researchers aid workers ground North Korea seen evidence cannibalism starving children dying roadside  descriptions surfaced lurid refugee reports  find many ways equally disturbing: A population withering nearly decade chronic hunger, people weakened malnutrition colds stomach flus quickly turn lethal, future generation irretrievably lost. Now last hard facts  situation grave, said Judith Cheng-Hopkins, regional director Asia World Food Program, taken part research. To famine slow motion. People cope year year, probably lot drop off. But totality hard gauge. For three weeks fall, crews led foreign scientists finally permitted fan North Korea conduct first random sample nutritional survey children, providing far solid data crisis. They found 62 percent children 7 stunted growth, symptom long-term malnutrition. Thirty percent 1-year-olds suffered moderate severe malnutrition. This means high likelihood impaired mental physical development, nervous system matures dramatically essential first year. The researchers said available scientific data suggest 10 years ago, malnutrition rare North Korea. Even situation improves, unlikely improve degree country fully recover saw, said Judit Katona-Apte, senior program adviser World Food Program. People small well developed otherwise somewhat limited mental capacities. Likewise, Red Cross representatives year tested water supply 840 hospitals clinics operate, found one water suitable human consumption, said Sten Swedlund, head Red Cross delegation North Korea. But course drink  choice, said recent trip Beijing. There close relationship problems caused lack food health sector that's bad shape. Virtually children 7 malnourished also diarrhea, said. None aid groups able study issue hunger-related deaths, North Koreans released relevant figures, although experts agree probably one million perhaps many three million died prematurely food shortages began. But public health experts say number perished might difficult tally case, deaths probably quick starvation, immune systems weakened years hunger, common colds easily give way lethal pneumonia ordinary bout infectious diarrhea proves fatal. Still, disturbing clues: In one limited study conducted World Food Program groups last year 4,000 children hand-picked government, 10 percent parent dead. In fall's independent nutritional survey, 18 teams experts sent eight North Korea's nine provinces looked 1,800 rural urban children seven. In addition finding 62 percent children stunted growth, teams found 16 percent children suffering acute malnutrition underweight height, sign severely underfed time study. That figure higher country East Asia puts North Korea world's worst 10 countries terms malnutrition. While 16 percent figure quite bad India Bangladesh, worst world 18 percent malnutrition rate, experts say North Korea's number ways understates problem. In India Bangladesh, pockets severe poverty alternate pockets relative plenty, North Korea whole country degree underfed. Even war-torn countries, famine pockets, Dr. Katona-Apte said. It's hard think another country that's affected way. The survey results especially sobering researchers studied children 7, group received nearly food donated abroad. After three years food donations, many foreign aid workers country remarked children nurseries kindergartens looking better  older siblings failing. So month ago, World Food Program began providing elementary schools high nutrition biscuits children aged 7 12. We reason believe many people suffering elderly neglected age group getting weaker weaker, Swedlund said. There 100 Westerners living Pyongyang, capital city, many say long-term hunger readily apparent there. If walk street Pyongyang ask child old is, three years, Swedlund said. She may 7 looks 3 4. Dr. Katona-Apte, nutrition expert worked Bangladesh Sudan, said shocked first visited North Korean kindergarten last year. There two children sitting desk obviously severely malnourished  thin patchy hair, said. And sitting working. This accepted normal! They school, really hospitalized placed nutritional rehabilitation. If saw refugee camp, would recommend immediate intervention. But severely depleted public health hospital system, option exist, said. Many Korean doctors know diagnose treat malnutrition; seen decade. And, case, hospitals lack food proper nutritional supplements. Swedlund said hospitals lacked medicines, glass replace broken windows colder out, received coal 1994. He said hospitals, sanitation water purification systems virtually nonexistent, country lacks chlorine purification fuel run water pumps. He said next year, Red Cross would start address problems, spending $3.5 food hospital patients $1 million water treatment. With options, vast numbers North Koreans resorted eating substitute food, hard cakes noodles made mix nutritional plants, soybeans sweet potatoes, combined indigestible filler, cornstalks straw. This constitutes 40 percent food intake, Swedlund said. It's becoming regular part food basket. Doctors North Korea say many people suffer stomachaches eating partly indigestible material, said, added, If hungry, fills stomach. Although North Koreans date food problems series floods droughts mid-1990's, foreign researchers worked North Korea say medical records childhood growth patterns indicate hunger began several years linked collapse Soviet Union, long North Korea's main supplier food, fuel fertilizer. North Korea mountainous country, less 20 percent arable land. It food importer decades, mostly former Soviet Union, also China. The country come grips fact part structural problem can't blamed weather anymore, Ms. Cheng-Hopkins said. Still, praised normally rigid secretive government slowly loosening restrictions. Swedlund said three years country, international Red Cross, collaborates North Korean Red Cross, found officials increasingly responsive doctors willing share medical records bring problems. Travel still restricted. There 100 counties, home 30 percent population, aid groups access therefore refused provide food medical supplies. Still, number counties open workers increased steadily, freedom move improved. Ms. Cheng-Hopkins said half follow-up inspections unannounced, noted researchers nutritional survey allowed select villages visit enter homes random. Workers Red Cross World Food Program said observed extreme scenes people dying acute starvation believe would occurring frequently. I seen acute starvation I seen Bangladesh, Dr. Katona-Apte said. But mean can't exist. We're still really limited see. Swedlund said unlikely counties still closed foreigners markedly different open ones. And surmised closed counties might harbor pockets death devastation, said accepted North Korea's explanation excluded areas national security reasons. One thing I've learned important national security issues North Koreans, said Swedlund, retired admiral Swedish Navy. And I really think areas important standpoint, added, going map closed areas describing Western intelligence experts know military installations there. He also rejected notion North Korean military stealing donated food, charge leveled organization Doctors Without Borders, angrily pulled North Korea last summer protest many restrictions groups working there. Now aid groups say starting get somewhat better cooperation North Koreans, hope repeat nutrition survey every 6 12 months. And still analyzing tantalizing findings: Boys twice likely suffer stunted growth girls, every child whose mother dead malnourished. A generation North Korean children already scarred life, said Astrid Heiberg, president International Federation Red Cross Red Crescent Societies, interview Beijing trip North Korea. We need continue mobilize resources prevent greater catastrophe. The founder South Korea's largest conglomerate plans visit native North Korea next week gift 501 cattle, company officials said Thursday. The visit delayed month dispute 500 cattle donated Chung Ju-yung, founder Hyundai group, trip North June. North Korea claimed 71 cattle died Seoul government agents force-fed indigestible vinyl strips lumps rope shipping North. Calling North's claim nonsense, Seoul's Ministry National Unification ordered Hyundai check thousands cattle raised ranch west coast. The ministry later acknowledged lumps rope found stomachs cattle ranch, said material kill animals donated North Korea. It blamed deaths stress caused long shipment truck North. The South Korean government said would authorize second shipment cattle unless North retracted accusations. On Thursday, South Korean Unification Minister Kang In-duk said North Korea sent letter Hyundai last week, saying misunderstanding southern authorities issue dead cattle cleared. Kang said North's letter cleared stumbling block Hyundai's additional cattle donation. During visit, Chung expected reach agreement details Hyundai's plan start sightseeing tours scenic mountain North. The tours, originally scheduled begin September, delayed cost, security matters. Hyundai hopes send ship 2,000 tourists week four-day tours Diamond Mountain North's east coast beginning November. Animosity distrust two Koreas run deep. The Korean states separated communist North capitalist South 1945. They fought three-year war early 1950s. Years food shortages stunted growth millions North Korean children, two-thirds children age seven suffering malnourishment, U.N. experts said Wednesday. Several years flooding droughts coupled economic downturn heavily damaged North Korea's crop production capacity import food closed, communist nation. A survey carried September October also showed 16 percent children North Korea acutely malnourished, body weight low height. That figure, reflects ongoing shortages, exceeded Asia Bangladesh, India Sri Lanka. Eighteen teams, headed foreign official World Food Program, U.N. Children's Fund European Union, carried study. They measured weight height 1,800 North Korean children infants age seven homes randomly selected areas aid agencies access. Those areas cover 70 percent population. It first technically sound survey problem, UNICEF official Kirsi Madi told reporters. The alarming findings toddlers aged one two, 30 percent acutely malnourished. At age, malnutrition permanently impair physical intellectual growth, said Judy Cheng-Hopkins, WFP director region. Children North Korea's three largest cities  Pyongyang, Wonsan Nampo  better counterparts elsewhere, 11 percent acutely malnourished. Boys almost twice badly affected girls. Police northeastern China's Jilin province said Monday rounded least 100 North Koreans sent back endure famine reclusive country. A police official Jilin city Tonghua, North Korean border, said North Koreans forced repatriate resettled illegally China, formed criminal gangs engaged prostitution. The official, spoke condition anonymity, denied reports South Korean press Chinese disregarded requests political asylum forcing refugees back border. He said crossed China seeking food, political repression North Korea. Citing North Korean human rights group Japanese tourists visiting region, South Korea's Yonhap News Agency reported Monday 150 North Koreans sent home China, presented petitions political asylum.

Hunger malnutrition Cambodia reaching crisis level comparable effect famine North Korea, UN. World Food Program representative said Tuesday. Though North Korea suffering simple lack food, faltering economy Cambodia combined weak health care education causing similar level malnutrition child, said Ken Davies, WFP's country director. There enough rice. The problem people poor access it. The problem poverty, Davies said. The WFP currently supporting 1.7 million hungry Cambodians 15 percent population food-for-work direct assistance program, Davies said fear still plenty getting enough eat every day. The problem bad little worse North Korea, Davies said. The situation much worse people recognize. According recent WFP survey, 49 percent Cambodian child age 5 stunted lack food 20 percent suffer acute malnutrition. By comparison, similar survey North Korean child 7 found 65 percent stunted 16 percent suffer acute malnutrition. Cambodia produced rice surplus export last two year expects another year, WFP statistic show 25 percent rice-growing area account 75 percent surplus. The majority Cambodian farmer producing enough keep family fed increasingly saddled debt incurred run reserve harvest, Davies said. Money-lenders rural Cambodia typically charge 100 percent interest, must paid rice harvest time, giving many farmer handicapped start next crop season. Poor sanitation, lack health care ignorance modern child rearing problem left mostly unaddressed under-funded health education sector Cambodia exacerbated food security problem, Davies said. Davies urged new government substantially increase annual expenditure health, education rural development first step long-term solution Cambodia's food crisis. The poverty getting worse right situation malnutrition child crisis, Davies said. Cambodia typically earmark half annual budget defense security. In 1998 budget, education allocated 6.5 percent, health 4.4 percent rural development 0.2 percent. Actual disbursement three ministry 60 70 percent budgeted amount annual revenue fall short expectation, according aid worker. A 1999 budget draft proposed reduction health ministry's allotment, caused outcry September health official UN. World Health Program. The draft later readjusted provide unprecedented 33 percent increase health spending. North Korea entering fourth winter chronic food shortage people malnourished risk dying normally curable illness, senior Red Cross official said Tuesday. The official warned international complacency hostility North Korea food crisis stretch isolated communist country show little willingness adopt far-reaching change revive ruined economy. Humanitarian suffering cannot routine part world, said Margareta Wahlstrom, Red Cross' undersecretary disaster relief, returned Beijing Tuesday week inspecting aid agency's operation North Korea. She Red Cross official saw ravage North Korea's slow-motion famine: electricity supplied half capital, Pyongyang, time; elderly looking swollen, sign long-term hunger; generation child stunted, 10-year-olds looking 6-year-olds 5-year-olds 2-year-olds. Everywhere, bakery government ministry, people served noodle cake made soybean mixed acorn, grass herb, Red Cross president Astrid Heiberg said. Heiberg likened additive cattle food noted doctor reported rise stomach illness mixture. This really part daily life, said. You would give child elderly mother knowing would get cramp stomach diarrhea unless stomach moaning. Three year flood drought started 1995 devastated North Korea's collective farming planned economy, already teetering loss Soviet bloc trading partner. With good money barter buy foreign supply, country lack sufficient fertilizer crop, fuel part machinery. The Red Cross inspector saw soldier people harvesting cabbage, winter's main vegetable. The grain harvest finished UN. estimate little improved last year's: 3 million ton, enough meet two-thirds need North Korea's 22 million people. As long, harsh winter begin, doctor confirm official statistic show widespread malnutrition, tuberculosis rise hunger-weakened patient unable recover operation sickness, Heiberg said. Doctors worry respiratory illness common winter may take toll weakened population, said. One 10-bed hospital countryside keeping three patient time food care more, said Heiberg.

It sent 18 athlete official Winter Olympics Nagano, Japan, February. Naewoe run South Korea's main government intelligence agency specializes monitoring communist news medium. Three year flood drought started 1995 devastated North Korea's collective farming planned economy, forcing country rely aid feed 23 million people. Famine-threatened North Korea's harvest better year last could worse, senior UN. aid official said Saturday. North Korea need minimum 4.5 million 5 million ton grain feed 23 million people, managed last year harvest 2.8 million ton, Namanga Ngongi, deputy head World Food Program said. Although hard figure available, prospect year harvest better, Ngongi told reporter Beijing visiting North Korea. It may worse last year. Poor harvest, economic collapse three year flood drought, produced chronic food shortage North Korea left heavily reliant foreign aid. Fertilizer lacking, fuel power tractor farm machinery, meaning planting harvesting must done hand. Every year get worse, Ngongi said. But need food aid, Ngongi said government month ago cut number county WFP access 171 145, reducing number people get aid 6.7 million 5.8 million. Most receiving WFP aid child aged 6 month 6 year. Ngongi said government cited security concern notably lack peace treaty rival South Korea decision. The government said ban would temporary, Ngongi added. Ngongi, spent four day inspecting WFP relief effort North Korea, said people generally looked better visit last year. But also said could see large part population weak. Everybody consuming low level. So may severely malnourished, well nourished all, said. US. official toured hardest-hit region North Korea summer said 2 million people may died famine. Ngongi said saw malnourished child said 10 11 year old, appeared 4 5 year old. About 30 percent child one primary school visited class. A lot child weak come school, said. But Ngongi said foreign food aid saved life. A lot people alive today thanks international community's support, said. A congressman visited remote part North Korea last week said Saturday food health situation desperate deteriorating, million North Koreans might starved death last year. The congressman, Tony Hall, D-Ohio, longtime interest world hunger, passed Tokyo return United States showed photograph taken North Korean child patchy hair, protruding bone, open sore sign severe malnutrition. Hall also brought back bag official called substitute food distributed government food station: dried leaf straw, coarse cattle would normally turn away. They grind powder make noodle, Hall said. The noodle nutrition indigestible, leaving people holding aching stomach, said. North Korea admitted facing serious economic difficulty, sharply diverging assessment serious are. Some visitor United Nations organization said food situation seems bit better year two ago. Hall said divergence might arisen North Korean capital, Pyongyang, life seem slightly better three previous trip North Korea. But rural area foreigner allowed visit, added, overall situation worse ever. Based visit four hospital, Hall also emphasized public health care declined sharply. In one hospital, assistant holding patient surgeon conducted stomach operation electric light anesthesia. Ordinary North Koreans suffering, part, government's hard-line policy alienated would-be donor aid agency. The United Nations repeatedly appealed relief aid North Korea, latest appeal raised le one-third target. In September, Doctors Without Borders announced pulling staff 13 North Korea feared aid going politically connected rather needy. North Korea release mortality figure health statistic, Hall said United Nations gathered would soon release data indicating 30 percent North Korean child age 2 acutely malnourished 67 percent child physically stunted. Hall said thought overall least 1 million people died total probably closer 3 million. In indication seriousness professional demographer view situation, US. Bureau Census recently published estimate suggesting North Korea's population peaked 1995 21.55 million fallen 21.23 million year. That would decline 320,000 three year, period North Korea's population would expected grow 925,000 people, based population growth rate early 1990s. Nicholas Eberstadt, American specialist North Korean population figure, say simply enough hard information estimate death toll famine. But note one political tidbit: North Korea's constitution stipulates one delegate country's people's assembly every 30,000 citizen. This year's assembly expand previous one did, rather 687 delegate, previous assembly held 1990. While Eberstadt counsel caution, could mean North Korea's population, eight year expected add several million people, back 20.6 million people fewer. The United States supplying grain North Korea, strain growing secret underground complex North expert worry may heart new nuclear weapon program. The United States warned last week agreed framework basis relation North Korea jeopardy unless North let American expert visit underground complex resolve doubt. North Korea said show complex Washington promise complex nuclear one, pay vilifying u impairing prestige. Washington refuse pay, North Korea warning standoff could lead agreement fall apart. Their shameless wicked demand open infringement sovereignty wanton interference internal affair, declared North Korea's leading newspaper, Rodong Sinmun. More five year severe food shortage near-total breakdown public health system led devastating malnutrition North Korea probably left entire generation child physically mentally impaired, new study international aid group found. The study, first scientific nutritional survey North Korea, confirms disturbing report international aid worker, year gained increasing access population highly isolated secretive country. Among shocking finding, researcher World Food Program, Unicef European Union found that, long-term food shortage, staggering 62 percent child 7 year old suffer stunted growth. They discovered that, huge international food aid program three year, severe malnutrition widespread toddler crucial stage brain development, suggesting generation's physical mental ability develop normally loss never recovered. Separately, international medical worker group Red Cross, begun document effect food shortage severely compounded breakdown public health service. Even basic water purification system stand idle lack essential ingredient chlorine, Red Cross worker say, leaving vast number people severe diarrhea unable absorb completely little food have. As North Korean dictatorship slowly, grudgingly, granted increased access international aid group last six month, increasingly clear saddening picture hunger haas emerged result large formal study informal survey observation foreign aid agency. Past assessment magnitude disaster country 23 million considered flawed based interview small number North Korean refugee fled China. And researcher aid worker ground North Korea seen evidence cannibalism starving child dying roadside description surfaced lurid refugee report find many way equally disturbing: A population withering nearly decade chronic hunger, people weakened malnutrition cold stomach flu quickly turn lethal, future generation irretrievably lost. Now last hard fact situation grave, said Judith Cheng-Hopkins, regional director Asia World Food Program, taken part research. To famine slow motion. People cope year year, probably lot drop off. But totality hard gauge. For three week fall, crew led foreign scientist finally permitted fan North Korea conduct first random sample nutritional survey child, providing far solid data crisis. They found 62 percent child 7 stunted growth, symptom long-term malnutrition. Thirty percent 1-year-olds suffered moderate severe malnutrition. This mean high likelihood impaired mental physical development, nervous system matures dramatically essential first year. The researcher said available scientific data suggest 10 year ago, malnutrition rare North Korea. Even situation improves, unlikely improve degree country fully recover saw, said Judit Katona-Apte, senior program adviser World Food Program. People small well developed otherwise somewhat limited mental capacity. Likewise, Red Cross representative year tested water supply 840 hospital clinic operate, found one water suitable human consumption, said Sten Swedlund, head Red Cross delegation North Korea. But course drink choice, said recent trip Beijing. There close relationship problem caused lack food health sector that's bad shape. Virtually child 7 malnourished also diarrhea, said. None aid group able study issue hunger-related death, North Koreans released relevant figure, although expert agree probably one million perhaps many three million died prematurely food shortage began. But public health expert say number perished might difficult tally case, death probably quick starvation, immune system weakened year hunger, common cold easily give way lethal pneumonia ordinary bout infectious diarrhea prof fatal. Still, disturbing clues: In one limited study conducted World Food Program group last year 4,000 child hand-picked government, 10 percent parent dead. In fall's independent nutritional survey, 18 team expert sent eight North Korea's nine province looked 1,800 rural urban child seven. In addition finding 62 percent child stunted growth, team found 16 percent child suffering acute malnutrition underweight height, sign severely underfed time study. That figure higher country East Asia put North Korea world's worst 10 country term malnutrition. While 16 percent figure quite bad India Bangladesh, worst world 18 percent malnutrition rate, expert say North Korea's number way understates problem. In India Bangladesh, pocket severe poverty alternate pocket relative plenty, North Korea whole country degree underfed. Even war-torn country, famine pocket, Dr. Katona-Apte said. It's hard think another country that's affected way. The survey result especially sobering researcher studied child 7, group received nearly food donated abroad. After three year food donation, many foreign aid worker country remarked child nursery kindergarten looking better older sibling failing. So month ago, World Food Program began providing elementary school high nutrition biscuit child aged 7 12. We reason believe many people suffering elderly neglected age group getting weaker weaker, Swedlund said. There 100 Westerners living Pyongyang, capital city, many say long-term hunger readily apparent there. If walk street Pyongyang ask child old is, three year, Swedlund said. She may 7 look 3 4. Dr. Katona-Apte, nutrition expert worked Bangladesh Sudan, said shocked first visited North Korean kindergarten last year. There two child sitting desk obviously severely malnourished thin patchy hair, said. And sitting working. This accepted normal! They school, really hospitalized placed nutritional rehabilitation. If saw refugee camp, would recommend immediate intervention. But severely depleted public health hospital system, option exist, said. Many Korean doctor know diagnose treat malnutrition; seen decade. And, case, hospital lack food proper nutritional supplement. Swedlund said hospital lacked medicine, glass replace broken window colder out, received coal 1994. He said hospital, sanitation water purification system virtually nonexistent, country lack chlorine purification fuel run water pump. He said next year, Red Cross would start address problem, spending $3.5 food hospital patient $1 million water treatment. With option, vast number North Koreans resorted eating substitute food, hard cake noodle made mix nutritional plant, soybean sweet potato, combined indigestible filler, cornstalk straw. This constitutes 40 percent food intake, Swedlund said. It's becoming regular part food basket. Doctors North Korea say many people suffer stomachache eating partly indigestible material, said, added, If hungry, fill stomach. Although North Koreans date food problem series flood drought mid-1990's, foreign researcher worked North Korea say medical record childhood growth pattern indicate hunger began several year linked collapse Soviet Union, long North Korea's main supplier food, fuel fertilizer. North Korea mountainous country, le 20 percent arable land. It food importer decade, mostly former Soviet Union, also China. The country come grip fact part structural problem can't blamed weather anymore, Ms. Cheng-Hopkins said. Still, praised normally rigid secretive government slowly loosening restriction. Swedlund said three year country, international Red Cross, collaborates North Korean Red Cross, found official increasingly responsive doctor willing share medical record bring problem. Travel still restricted. There 100 county, home 30 percent population, aid group access therefore refused provide food medical supply. Still, number county open worker increased steadily, freedom move improved. Ms. Cheng-Hopkins said half follow-up inspection unannounced, noted researcher nutritional survey allowed select village visit enter home random. Workers Red Cross World Food Program said observed extreme scene people dying acute starvation believe would occurring frequently. I seen acute starvation I seen Bangladesh, Dr. Katona-Apte said. But mean can't exist. We're still really limited see. Swedlund said unlikely county still closed foreigner markedly different open one.

The planning. The strategy. The big picture. The vision. His vision brought GOP majority Congress 1994 made first Republican House Speaker 40 years. But admission, Gingrich's vision seems blurred time around, costing Republicans net five seats Tuesday's election leaving party's narrow governing majority narrower. The disappointing election results also left Gingrich open fractious challenge post speaker. Members aides said Wednesday fury speaker bubbled overnight members trying organize slate candidates replace Gingrich leadership team House Republicans convene Nov. 18 select leaders next year. As Rep. Mark Sanford, R-S.C., put it, When company's stock price goes down, CEO gets fired. Top Republican aides, speaking anonymously, blunter. People angry last night, one aide said. Today mixture seething dismay. It's ugly. And Newt knows it. His career line. Another aide said, Most people really angry Newt, one knows it. But dipping toe water seeing temperature is. A possible slate could contain names Reps. Robert L. Livingston Louisiana replace Gingrich, Steve Largent Oklahoma replace Dick Armey Texas majority leader, Jennifer Dunn Washington replace John A. Boehner Ohio conference chairman. Rep. David M. McIntosh Indiana also said run speaker, clear whether would part slate. Rep. Tom DeLay Texas, majority whip, said secure. Armey bluntly acknowledged scramble going wings oust leadership. Told Nightline Republicans head, Armey replied: They're welcome they're big enough take it. Publicly, Gingrich expressed confidence keeping job speaker. But grim-faced last 24 hours closeted Wednesday top strategists making calls shore support members. He looks victim accident, said Rep. Peter King, R-N.Y., supports Gingrich. He's somber tone. The question, always Gingrich, many members prepared rebel leadership. In past, couple dozen members openly expressed dissatisfaction him, coup attempt last year fizzled lack support. I'm hoping people understand need serious reassessment year, said Rep. Charles T. Canady, R-Fla., said hoped challenge speaker 1996 elections, Republicans also lost seats. The reality this: Our majority keeps shrinking, Canady said. If shrinks more, gone. But Gingrich built support moderates, perceived election repudiation conservatives. Rep. Sherwood L. Boehlert, R-Utah, said results showed right direction party. To maintain majority, we've got moderate views, Boehlert said. Thomas Mann, Congressional scholar Brookings Institution, said moderates supported Gingrich part appealing alternative emerged. They know sees broader world prepared moderate makes sense, Mann said. Newt's gone way support moderates. He's nurtured relationship them. But Mann said anger building Gingrich several reasons, including signing budget deal last month seemed capitulate President Clinton, offering clear legislative agenda Republicans communicating clear political message. We defined hate said Rep. Mark Souder, R-Ind. But voters sophisticated that, Republicans better something say we're going. The anger grew last days speaker approved $10-million anti-Clinton advertising campaign allowed Democrats turn election referendum Gingrich, never nearly popular public Clinton been. As slowly absorbing implications loss, speaker seemed unable news conference Wednesday morning pinpoint party suffered net drop five seats House. As late Tuesday afternoon, predicting net pickup 10 30. Until look better, I frankly understand things happened yesterday, said, I'm sure anybody else country either. But said Republicans maniacally focused basic message cutting taxes, saving Social Security preventing drug abuse, campaigned aggressively themes. He contrasted lack focus year Contract With America proved successful 1994. People thought stood something pretty big, said. But Gingrich also seemed aware mounting concern leadership, repeatedly casting election results victory leadership team Republicans stayed majority three elections row first time 70 years. He also suggested would challenge little support. The people normally quoted people would fact take party narrower base, Gingrich said, referring periodic eruptions concern conservatives leadership. I'd see plan confident last 60 days would successful share it. An intense struggle control House underway, Rep. Bob Livingston conducting telephone campaign replace Rep. Newt Gingrich speaker Gingrich fighting counter-campaign given members pause ousting him. At time, small band Republicans vowed Thursday would vote re-elect Gingrich circumstances, move that, Republicans' shrunken House majority, could tie party knots months could throw speakership Democrat. Rep. Matt Salmon, R-Ariz., said: I personally made decision I cannot vote Newt Gingrich speaker January, six told feel way, seven people not, takes six deadlock vote. Fury speaker boiled Tuesday's elections, Republicans suffered net loss five seats House. They blamed Gingrich, party's chief strategist. But many already angry said failure articulate clear message party going elections messy budget process gave President Clinton political edge contradicted Republican principles fiscal conservativism containing massive amounts pork spending. House Republicans meet Nov. 18 vote secret ballot leaders. Whoever wins party's nomination speaker stands election full House January. Even Gingrich wins secret ballot, could denied re-election speaker January Salmon least five refuse vote him. Because Republicans control House 12 seats, would take six votes Gingrich deny majority allow Democrats potentially elect one speaker. With chaotic unacceptable prospect looming, Livingston told Gingrich step aside good party, according Republican officials. The officials said Livingston spoke Gingrich shortly disastrous election returns also election, reflecting Livingston's earlier displeasure speaker budget process. Several Republicans said Livingston, chairman Appropriations Committee one members stature stand speaker, Gingrich working phones Thursday struggle votes. Livingston said nothing publicly challenge Gingrich, several members aides said Thursday would announce intentions, possibly soon Friday, determined could win. He 'til ducks row, right lot people still loyal speaker, said aide Republican who, many others, trying straddle line fealty speaker may retain power encouragement challenger offers salve embattled party. Stunned Democratic resurgence mid-term elections, congressional Republicans tore Wednesday blame failure make traditional opposition party gains off-year election. The soul-searching recriminations  possibility congressional leadership challenges  came election results showed Republicans unable increase 55-45 hold Senate Democrats picked five seats House. The Democratic surge marked first time 1934 president's party gained seats midterm election, whittled Republican House majority mere six votes. The Democratic victories remarkable political year marked months-long scandal President Clinton's affair Monica Lewinsky. The Republicans' new 223-211 majority (assuming Democrat leading Oregon holds win), one independent, amounted smallest congressional majority Republican-controlled Congress 1953, last time Republicans controlled House captured 1994. With attention shifting House Judiciary Committee impeachment inquiry, Rep. Henry Hyde told fellow Republicans panel conference call Wednesday witness Republicans likely call would independent counsel, Kenneth Starr. Hyde, chairman, told lawmakers hoped committee vote possible articles impeachment Thanksgiving, act would take issue hands put Gingrich's. Committee Democrats declined comment Wednesday could discuss Hyde's plan themselves. Trying put best face results, Speaker Newt Gingrich said Marietta, Ga., Republicans still held House three elections row first time election 1932. But furious rank file Republicans burned phone lines other, discussing whether mount leadership challenges chambers next weeks. We've got reach southern white males running Washington Republican Party, said Rep. Joe Scarborough, conservative Florida. He said Republicans year left accomplishments run on. We need agenda first all, said. We went entire calendar year agenda. Rep. Chris Shays, moderate Connecticut called election devastating loss said simply, There going major changes leadership. All segments party want see change. At White House, Clinton called election results vindication party's policies. If look results, said, clear unambiguous. The American people want business, concerns, children, families, future addressed here. That's messag e election was. One first difficult questions facing Congress proceed impeachment inquiry face public resistance removing Clinton office, Republican majority slim almost certain 218 votes required impeachment cannot assembled. In public statement released Wednesday, Hyde said The Committee continues clear constituional duty complete work fair expeditious manner. Our duty changed becasue constitution changed. But Sen. Robert Torricelli, D-N.J., said election results guaranteed impeachment fail. I think serious effort remove President Clinton office effectively over, said. It simply Newt Gingrich Trent Lott decide exit strategy. From side aisle, Rep. Rick Lazio, Long Island Republican, said, The inquiry wrapped expeditiously, fairly ought resolved immediate future. For year, Republicans struggled keep control House 228-207 majority find consensus party's competing factions. With numbers reduced, Republican leadership need carry tortuous balancing act unite hard-core conservative faction wants aggressive social agenda bloc moderates want party return center. Any small Republican faction enormous leverage. The new arithmetic House may lead Democrats' moderate Republicans' forming ad hoc majorities issues, taking control away Republican leaders. Already seeing possibilities, Rep. Peter King Long Island, N.Y., said northeastern Republicans would strengthened. It gives us much leverage leadership makes easier protect New York, said. It's going weaken position strident conservatives anti-northeast conservatives. Just two weeks ago, Gingrich foreseen election gains ranging 10 seats 40.

Stunned Democratic resurgence mid-term elections, congressional Republicans tore Wednesday blame failure make traditional opposition party gains off-year election. The soul-searching recriminations  possibility congressional leadership challenges  came election results showed Republicans unable increase 55-45 hold Senate Democrats picked five seats House. The Democratic surge marked first time 1934 president's party gained seats midterm election, whittled Republican House majority mere six votes. The Democratic victories remarkable political year marked months-long scandal President Clinton's affair Monica Lewinsky. The Republicans' new 223-211 majority (assuming Democrat leading Oregon holds win), one independent, amounted smallest congressional majority Republican-controlled Congress 1953, last time Republicans controlled House captured 1994. With attention shifting House Judiciary Committee impeachment inquiry, Rep. Henry Hyde told fellow Republicans panel conference call Wednesday witness Republicans likely call would independent counsel, Kenneth Starr. Hyde, chairman, told lawmakers hoped committee vote possible articles impeachment Thanksgiving, act would take issue hands put Gingrich's. Committee Democrats declined comment Wednesday could discuss Hyde's plan themselves. Trying put best face results, Speaker Newt Gingrich said Marietta, Ga., Republicans still held House three elections row first time election 1932. But furious rank file Republicans burned phone lines other, discussing whether mount leadership challenges chambers next weeks. We've got reach southern white males running Washington Republican Party, said Rep. Joe Scarborough, conservative Florida. He said Republicans year left accomplishments run on. We need agenda first all, said. We went entire calendar year agenda. Rep. Chris Shays, moderate Connecticut called election devastating loss said simply, There going major changes leadership. All segments party want see change. At White House, Clinton called election results vindication party's policies. If look results, said, clear unambiguous. The American people want business, concerns, children, families, future addressed here. That's message election was. One first difficult questions facing Congress proceed impeachment inquiry face public resistance removing Clinton office, Republican majority slim almost certain 218 votes required impeachment cannot assembled. In public statement released Wednesday, Hyde said The Committee continues clear constitutional duty complete work fair expeditious manner. Our duty changed constitution changed. But Sen. Robert Torricelli, D-N.J., said election results guaranteed impeachment fail. I think serious effort remove President Clinton office effectively over, said. It simply Newt Gingrich Trent Lott decide exit strategy. From side aisle, Rep. Rick Lazio, Long Island Republican, said, The inquiry wrapped expeditiously, fairly ought resolved immediate future. For year, Republicans struggled keep control House 228 seats find consensus party's competing factions. With numbers reduced, Republican leadership need carry tortuous balancing act unite hard-core conservative faction wants aggressive social agenda bloc moderates want party return center. The Democrats held 206 seats, one held indepenndent. Any small Republican faction enormous leverage. The new arithmetic House may lead Democrats' moderate Republicans' forming ad hoc majorities issues, taking control away Republican leaders. Already seeing possibilities, Rep. Peter King Long Island, N.Y., said northeastern Republicans would strengthened. It gives us much leverage leadership makes easier protect New York, said. It's going weaken position strident conservatives anti-northeast conservatives. Just two weeks ago, Gingrich foreseen election gains ranging 10 seats 40.

A week White House congressional Democrats disavowed war Speaker Newt Gingrich, James Carville, President Clinton's former campaign strategist chief defender, put forth new battle cry Wednesday: He muzzled. Not that, Carville went customary denunciations Gingrich Republicans and, interview, trained fire leaders party sufficiently aggressive four weeks Election Day. My sense frustration I believe Democrats much better chance much better anyone expects, Carville said. And I think anyone's emerging try pull together. Everybody ought pushing, leadership Congress, White House, DNC. We ought hammer Gingrich every day. How take Congress back make case people running it? I never heard strategy that. Sounding increasingly agitated, went on: The people left activated election Democrats. The right wing, they're bouncing walls. They're going vote. Rep. Dick Gephardt, minority leader, complained Erskine Bowles, White House chief staff, Carville appeared NBC News program Meet Press Sept. 27 declared, Cpl. Cue Ball Carville rolling battle Newt Gingrich. The concern House Democrats, one expressed White House officials well, Carville's vitriol would make Democrats appear overly partisan could especially damaging Democrats marginal districts want appear easy president. But Wednesday, Carville anything timid. If Gephardt people think they've quieted down, said, I'm quieted. Carville said told officials White House, Don't waste breath calling telling say this. Carville insisted would rather battle Republicans fellow Democrats. If want fight me, can, said. I'm going fight Republicans. Yet could help ridicule party. Asked describe Democrats' strategy election, Carville said, If one, one's shared me. Just four years ago, good bet Newt Gingrich would pivotal figure U.S. politics turn millennium. Seemingly overnight taken moribund minority party turned pumped-up, issue-driven House majority. With promise balance budget, end welfare represent conservative social values, appeared rearranged political map Congress Ronald Reagan done presidency. But Gingrich's leadership shaky maintains hold speaker's office, danger marginalization. A change dramatic suggests something far profound miscalculation election tactics. What looked one major realignments U.S. political history might turn nothing temporary shift. The Gingrich revolution fueled anger, revolt white working-class Americans perceived Democratic bias favor blacks minorities, middle-class rejection politics big government big deficits. They resentments Ronald Reagan exploited successfully. But old political habits moribund Republican leadership allowed Democrats retain control Congress throughout 1980s, turned Reagan's economic program undisciplined tax-cutting spree created prosperity huge budget gaps. Gingrich's attention-grabbing rhetoric, energy talent political organization finally took Reagan's formula success congressional elections 1994. But power, ran head Bill Clinton, whose political instincts better. The president co-opted parts Contract With America, particularly balanced budget welfare reform. He adapted Republican social message call things school uniforms television rating systems, symbolized responsibility parental control supporting government intrusion private lives. The Republican right's genuine contempt Clinton based part well-known flaws president's character. But mainly reaction ease diverted supposed flood tide revolution. They expected genuine successes Gingrich's first year office would lead still larger victories minimal government taxes, unfettered free enterprise return conservative Christian values. But public happy led another direction, focus concerns aging baby boomers health care Social Security. The government seen enemy issues budgetary looked potential ally. Back 1994, parties stunned sudden change congressional fortunes may overestimated meant. In particular may realized quickly good economic times, drop crime national welfare reform could blunt power race U.S. politics. The Democrats become literally minority party white voters resentfully identified policies cities, blacks immigrants. But last week union workers Catholics returned Democratic fold. Without race wedge issue, solid black Democratic vote became powerful advantage key states. Blacks, women Latinos angry Republican anti-immigration initiatives winning coalition California, North Carolina New York. The speaker right say election expected. There may indeed Republican majority America, appears resemble Republicanism Dwight Eisenhower rather Newt Gingrich  pro-business, wary debt inherent distaste bringing messy social issues abortion. The Republicans begun talking compassionate conservatism politics inclusion may peddling political mush, peddled victory Tuesday. The congressional Republican Party's long sojourn wilderness House minority may left accustomed opposition figure for, attached politics anger make sense nation mood moderation. Gingrich suggested mistake let Republicans drift politics impeachment almost maniacally focused things tax cuts. But looking maniacal got trouble first place. Winning control Congress many years tough Gingrich 1994. But ten times tougher forge politics depend rage. House Speaker Newt Gingrich, orchestrated Republican revolution recent years overseeing impeachment inquiry President Clinton, driven office Friday party swiftly turned unexpected losses Tuesday's midterm elections. Catching virtually everyone Capitol Hill surprise, Gingrich announced Friday night two conference calls Republicans would seek re-election Speaker Nov. 18 vote would leave Congress altogether term expires January. This give us chance purge poison system, Gingrich said, according party aide listened one calls. Gingrich's resignation stunning reversal one combative personally confrontational politicians America. He made name decade ago bringing one Democratic speaker, Jim Wright, continued assaultive style Tuesday's elections last-minute commercials reminding voters Clinton scandal. His reflexive pugilistic response evident Friday night. In second conference call, according several people listened, Gingrich blamed House conservatives downfall. Although revolutionary zeal harnessed take control Congress 1994, become bitter critics last two years tumultuous speakership. Friday night called cannibals blackmailed quitting. Rep. Michael P. Forbes, R-N.Y., said: Newt said marginalized Republican Party engaged cannibalism. He said, `Refer clips.' He's blaming others. Another Republican described conference call way: He started statesmanlike, could see anger building. When someone asked leaving, said, `A handful members blackmailed conference.' He said, `They're hateful.' And said, `They're cannibals.' Gingrich announced move hours Rep. Robert L. Livingston Louisiana announced running speaker, putting forward pragmatist manager. After Gingrich calls, Rep. Bill Archer Texas announced run speaker. Livingston Archer chairmen two powerful committees House. In statement Gingrich said, The Republican conference needs unified, time move forward. He said hoped colleagues would pick successor reconcile discipline, work together communicate effectively. Referring wife, told colleagues resigning Congress Marianne I tired. We need time get know again. He also acknowledged knack bringing negative attention party. If I stay, told colleagues Friday night, controversial nature would overshadow successes might have, understatement recalled suggestion two years ago forced shutdown government miffed sit back Air Force One trip President Clinton. According another Republican took notes, Gingrich said resignation: There lot bitterness amongst members. So long I around, I always target news media, would mean would never able get message out. Clinton said: Newt Gingrich worthy adversary leading Republican Party majority House joining great national debate best prepare America 21st century. Despite profound differences, I appreciate times able work together national interest, especially Speaker Gingrich's strong support America's continuing leadership freedom, peace prosperity world. Many Republicans took opportunity portray Gingrich visionary. Rep. Sherwood Boehlert New York said first conference call, shock surprise strong expressions appreciation leading us Promised Land. His supporters said Gingrich votes win election nominate speaker, conducted secret ballot. But, agreed, party's slim, six-vote majority meant every vote would battle. Kenneth Duberstein, former official Reagan administration, said, I doubt votes speaker, I'm sure votes govern. He said deep rifts party, Gingrich would able implement plans. In unusually biting reaction, Rep. Dick Gephardt Missouri, Democratic leader, said hoped Gingrich's resignation would clear fierce partisan air fostered. I hope whoever succeeds Newt Gingrich speaker immediately begin process repairing damage wrought institution last four years, Gephardt said. House Republicans predicted Gingrich's resignation would set wide-ranging hectic scramble replace anticipated. There lot pretenders throne test waters, said Boehlert, supported Gingrich re-election speaker. There shortage candidates. The presidential campaign 2000 began Wednesday, not. The millennial election fought political playing field whose rough outlines, exact boundaries, drawn voters Tuesday's elections, delivered crushing disappointment giddy hopes Republicans unexpected elixir recently ailing Democrats. President Clinton called astonishing triumph issues investigations said Democrats many major victories clear message. Republicans agreed. Of course next 18 months bring many surprises many reversals fortune. But election results offered important guidelines. Tuesday great day Vice President Al Gore, least three reasons. He worked furiously successfully last ten days balloting persuade Democratic loyalists stay home sulk, appearing behalf fewer 224 candidates, according office. A moderate spectrum party, watched moderates win crucial elections, notably California gubernatorial race, Lt. Gov. Gray Davis, cautious pragmatist Gore, smashing victory. The returns  break Senate Democratic gain five House Representatives  also made impeachment President Clinton less likely. And better shape Clinton term ends, better chance Gore, sidekick six years now, stands presidential nomination process and, ultimately, election. But California voters also complicated nominating process set Gore strategists work tactics uncomplicate it, consider state absolutely central presidential aspirations. In referendum 1996, California adopted primary system Republicans, Democrats independent voters would receive ballot, candidates parties listed. That violates rules major parties, measure ballot Tuesday, Proposition 3, would rescinded 1996 change. But failed, raising possibility California's March 7 primary mere political popularity poll, convention delegates chosen caucus convention  nightmare. Tuesday bad day Republican right. High-profile right-wingers lost country, Attorney General Dan Lungren California governor's race Sen. Lauch Faircloth, denied re-election North Carolina, Rep. Mark Neumann Wisconsin, failed Senate race huge spending advantage Sen. Russell Feingold, Ellen Sauerbrey Maryland, proved unable second try prevail unpopular Democratic governor, Parris Glendening. Both conservatives moderates party said Republicans get back basics. Even Speaker Newt Gingrich conceded results sober every Republican called new strategic thinking. If make referendum president 67 cent approval rating, tried do, surprised election goes you, said Gov. Tom Ridge Pennsylvania, moderate whose promoters mention weekly possible vice-presidential nominee. Sen. John McCain Arizona, conservative tends steer away divisive social issues, re-election 68 cent vote. He studying possibility presidential race, Republican nominee hope win, said interview Wednesday, congressional Republicans leaders need learn lessons. I hope debacle wake-up call people, said. You've got something  smaller government, better education, something. We're seen party that's everything. Polls taken late year's campaign bore McCain out. They showed Republicans longer identified issues electoral bread butter, low taxes law order. Tuesday also fresh demonstration, anyone needed one, political utility pitching tent big enough almost everyone. Black politicians North Carolina, Maryland California reported fears indifferent black turnout proved groundless. Black votes proved indispensable considerable number hard-pressed Democratic candidates, especially felt interests directly threatened. The figures Hispanic voting, assembled exit polls candidates' precinct analyses, showed dramatic differences. In California, outgoing Republican governor, Pete Wilson, played anti-immigration card vengeance, major Democratic candidates  Davis Sen. Barbara Boxer, re-election trailing early polls  cleaned Hispanic voters. He took 78 percent, 72. But Bush brothers, Jeb Florida George W. Texas, took half Hispanic vote highly successful gubernatorial campaigns. So McCain. Jeb Bush married Hispanic woman, brother speak Spanish fluently frequently, Senator McCain long espoused Hispanic causes. Both George W. Bush McCain draw strength, decide run, proven ability appeal Hispanic voters, well general electoral strength. George W. Bush took 69 percent vote Texas, Democrat sat governor's chair four years ago, second-largest bloc electoral votes. Florida fourth-largest. Governor Bush Texas uttered rallying cry moderates. A leader compassionate conservative, said victory speech, erase gender gap open Republican party new faces new voices. But figures right saw things differently. James Dobson, leading religious broadcaster, said Republicans fared poorly Gingrich Sen. Trent Lott Mississippi, majority leader, caved president budget de-emphasized social issues abortion flag desecration. He called explicitly ouster Gingrich. Likewise, millionaire publisher Steve Forbes, another probable candidate 2000, said leadership lot answer for. Tuesday proved potency education issue, suggested emerge major theme 2000 campaign. Clinton, limited involvement campaign, Gore, extensive participation, stressed Democratic programs build schools hire teachers. Almost quarter California voters  almost twice many voters California state  named education pressing concern. Elsewhere, Democrats governorships Alabama South Carolina odds, partly emphasizing rivals' opposition lotteries help pay schools. In Iowa, Democrat elected governor first time 1969 platform featured dilapidated condition state's schools promise remedy it. Tuesday demonstrated overriding importance money modern American politics. Feingold, one principal backers campaign-finance reform, survived fight another day, opponents reform. And returns House races, showing six 401 members sought re-election won, underlined hard is, present system, challenger raise enough money compete effectively. The difficulties raising money may doom many would-be presidential candidacies. Gore needs, Bush, Forbes former Gov. Lamar Alexander Tennessee. But many will? Finally, Tuesday delivered indecisive message impeachment. Close two-thirds voters nationwide told exit pollsters intended send message Clinton, made clear response questions disliked House inquiry president's alleged misdeeds wanted see end. In two states, Kansas Nebraska, majority voters say favored congressional censure Clinton, much milder form punishment advocated many Clinton backers. Some Republicans said privately hearings Clinton matter, Democrats began talking deal, equivalent plea bargain would bring matter early close. Nevertheless, Republican members House Judiciary Committee said needed press ahead Constitutional process House set motion. Among taking view Rep. Bob Barr Georgia, fierce foe president, Rep. Mary Bono California, whose tone muted. But Rep. David Dreier California, incoming Rules Committee chairman, said election played role ensuring one us desire drag out. Stunned Democratic resurgence mid-term elections, congressional Republicans tore Wednesday blame failure make traditional opposition party gains off-year election.

Asked whether Tuesday's election results could cost speakership, Gingrich said, I'm particularly concerned. Republicans close said expected anger dissipate. In Senate, leadership races take place early December, Republicans talking mounting challenges mid-level leadership figures. Several senators expressed particular pique re-election chairman, Senator Mitch McConnell Kentucky, poured party dollars much time trying defeat Democratic champion campaign finance overhaul, Russell Feingold Wisconsin. Feingold close race. Some lawmakers Wednesday approached Sen. Chuck Hagel Nebraska see would replace McConnell. Hagel confirmed talked eight senators, whether challenge McConnell. Hagel lambasted Republican leadership election outcome. This big loss us, said. We squandered historic opportunity last night. To break loss. Most incumbents coasted victory Tuesday night. But returning. Five House Republicans defeated: Vince Snowbarger Kansas, Bill Redmond New Mexico, Jon Fox Pennsylvania, Mike Pappas New Jersey, Rick White Washington. One Democrat also lost re-election bid  Rep. Jay Johnson Wisconsin. The new House members include 17 Republicans least 22 Democrats. David Wu, Democrat leading Molly Bordonaro, Republican race one House seat Oregon, final victory announcement expected Friday absentee ballots counted. Unlike self-proclaimed revolutionaries Republican class 1994, many newly elected members career politicians rose ranks local state government. Three Democrats sons former lawmakers, Mark Udall Colorado, son Morris Udall represented Arizona; Tom Udall New Mexico, son Udall brother, Stewart, former congressman secretary Interior, Charlie Gonzalez, Texas seat father, Henry. A struggle control House way, Rep. Robert Livingston conducting telephone campaign could lead running Newt Gingrich speaker. But Gingrich's counter-campaign given members pause ousting him. At time, small band Republicans vowed Thursday would vote re-elect Gingrich circumstances, move that, Republicans' shrunken House majority, could tie party knots months. Rep. Matt Salmon, R-Ariz., said: I personally made decision I cannot vote Newt Gingrich speaker January, six told feel way, seven people not, takes six deadlock vote. Fury speaker boiled Tuesday's elections, Republicans suffered net loss five seats House. They blamed Gingrich, party's chief strategist. But many already angry said failure articulate clear message party going elections messy budget process gave President Clinton political edge contradicted Republican principles fiscal conservativism containing massive amounts spending local projects. House Republicans meet Nov. 18 vote secret ballot leaders. Whoever wins Republican nomination speaker must stand election full House January. Even Gingrich wins secret ballot, could denied re-election speaker January Salmon least five refuse vote him. Because Republicans control House 12 seats, would take six votes Gingrich deny majority. With chaotic unacceptable prospect looming, Livingston told Gingrich step aside good party, Republican officials said. The officials said Livingston spoke Gingrich shortly election returns also election, reflecting Livingston's earlier displeasure speaker budget process. Several Republicans said Livingston, chairman Appropriations Committee one members stature stand speaker, Gingrich working phones Thursday struggle votes. Livingston said nothing publicly challenge Gingrich, several members aides said Thursday would announce intentions, possibly soon Friday, determined could win. Rep. Peter King, R-N.Y., one several members spoke Livingston Thursday. He told he's making number phone calls, he's gotten positive response running speaker, he'll decide next 48 hours, King said. He till ducks row, right lot people still loyal speaker, said aide Republican who, many others, trying straddle line fealty speaker may retain power encouragement challenger offers salve embattled party. Many Republicans immediately blamed Gingrich party's losses Tuesday. Talk quickly emerged next day slate candidates oppose Gingrich lieutenants. The list possible candidates leadership positions included Rep.e Steve Largent Oklahoma, talked Livingston Thursday challenging Gingrich, Republican officials said, speaking condition names reported. Those officials said Largent told Livingston wanted run ticket would challenge Rep. Dick Armey, majority leader. But, officials said Livingston challenge Gingrich, Largent would run speaker instead. Other names floated Wednesday leadership posts. They included Reps. David McIntosh Indiana speaker Jennifer Dunn Washington conference chairman. Added mix Thursday name Rep. Christopher Cox, California conservative. As sign uncertainty prevailing House members Thursday, Rep. Henry Hyde, chairman Judiciary Committee one House's venerable members, rebuffed chance endorse Gingrich speaker. Hyde said Gingrich bore responsibility party's losses Tuesday. Leadership takes credit things go right, said. They ought take blame things go wrong. Asked Gingrich remain speaker, Hyde said: I rather think will, remains seen. The energy many vented publicly Wednesday anger Gingrich seemed devoted Thursday intense internal political calculations whether Livingston could succeed toppling Gingrich whether succeed. While many support veteran understands House shown shrewd political skills managing massive federal budget, reviving images Louisianan hot-head gave party bad name government shutdown two years ago tends arm-flailing heated moments. One conservative leader said allies reservations Livingston obsessed trying keep social issues budget process. The budget, said, vehicle conservatives years add restrictions federal money abortion things can't get Senate presidential veto. If Livingston challenger, I doubt cause rallying real conservatives Congress. Some moderates said prepared support him. Rep. Marge Roukema, R-N.J., said, I would amenable Livingston. Still, cautioned, I'm Newt. But wrong sit seriously look options. Ken Johnson, aide Rep. W.J. (Billy) Tauzin, R-La., said boss emblematic confusion broad base House Republicans. Billy loyal Speaker Gingrich Dick Armey, he's still loyal them, also wants hear say committing next election, Johnson said. Everyone asking question: Can refocus message re-energize base re-aligning leadership? Salmon said refusal support Gingrich matter based Gingrich's track record one failed strategy another, including impeachment process pork-laden budget. With challenge way, Gingrich trying show members responsive concerns. After election night portrayed Republicans victorious lost seats, next day took responsibility losses. In another move, Gingrich indicated willing cede control party's congressional campaign committee, allowing whole House select members. Gingrich also making strong personal appeals Republicans. Said one top House aide: He'll get support. How much? Only vote-counters know. \n","\n","\n","\n","This Newt Gingrich supposed well. The planning. The strategy. The big picture. The vision. His vision brought GOP majority Congress 1994 made first Republican House Speaker 40 year. But admission, Gingrich's vision seems blurred time around, costing Republicans net five seat Tuesday's election leaving party's narrow governing majority narrower. The disappointing election result also left Gingrich open fractious challenge post speaker. Members aide said Wednesday fury speaker bubbled overnight member trying organize slate candidate replace Gingrich leadership team House Republicans convene Nov. 18 select leader next year. As Rep. Mark Sanford, R-S.C., put it, When company's stock price go down, CEO get fired. Top Republican aide, speaking anonymously, blunter. People angry last night, one aide said. Today mixture seething dismay. It's ugly. And Newt know it. His career line. Another aide said, Most people really angry Newt, one know it. But dipping toe water seeing temperature is. A possible slate could contain name Reps. Robert L. Livingston Louisiana replace Gingrich, Steve Largent Oklahoma replace Dick Armey Texas majority leader, Jennifer Dunn Washington replace John A. Boehner Ohio conference chairman. Rep. David M. McIntosh Indiana also said run speaker, clear whether would part slate. Rep. Tom DeLay Texas, majority whip, said secure. Armey bluntly acknowledged scramble going wing oust leadership. Told Nightline Republicans head, Armey replied: They're welcome they're big enough take it. Publicly, Gingrich expressed confidence keeping job speaker. But grim-faced last 24 hour closeted Wednesday top strategist making call shore support member. He look victim accident, said Rep. Peter King, R-N.Y., support Gingrich. He's somber tone. The question, always Gingrich, many member prepared rebel leadership. In past, couple dozen member openly expressed dissatisfaction him, coup attempt last year fizzled lack support. I'm hoping people understand need serious reassessment year, said Rep. Charles T. Canady, R-Fla., said hoped challenge speaker 1996 election, Republicans also lost seat. The reality this: Our majority keep shrinking, Canady said. If shrink more, gone. But Gingrich built support moderate, perceived election repudiation conservative. Rep. Sherwood L. Boehlert, R-Utah, said result showed right direction party. To maintain majority, we've got moderate view, Boehlert said. Thomas Mann, Congressional scholar Brookings Institution, said moderate supported Gingrich part appealing alternative emerged. They know see broader world prepared moderate make sense, Mann said. Newt's gone way support moderate. He's nurtured relationship them. But Mann said anger building Gingrich several reason, including signing budget deal last month seemed capitulate President Clinton, offering clear legislative agenda Republicans communicating clear political message. We defined hate said Rep. Mark Souder, R-Ind. But voter sophisticated that, Republicans better something say we're going. The anger grew last day speaker approved $10-million anti-Clinton advertising campaign allowed Democrats turn election referendum Gingrich, never nearly popular public Clinton been. As slowly absorbing implication loss, speaker seemed unable news conference Wednesday morning pinpoint party suffered net drop five seat House. As late Tuesday afternoon, predicting net pickup 10 30. Until look better, I frankly understand thing happened yesterday, said, I'm sure anybody else country either. But said Republicans maniacally focused basic message cutting tax, saving Social Security preventing drug abuse, campaigned aggressively theme. He contrasted lack focus year Contract With America proved successful 1994. People thought stood something pretty big, said. But Gingrich also seemed aware mounting concern leadership, repeatedly casting election result victory leadership team Republicans stayed majority three election row first time 70 year. He also suggested would challenge little support. The people normally quoted people would fact take party narrower base, Gingrich said, referring periodic eruption concern conservative leadership. I'd see plan confident last 60 day would successful share it. An intense struggle control House underway, Rep. Bob Livingston conducting telephone campaign replace Rep. Newt Gingrich speaker Gingrich fighting counter-campaign given member pause ousting him. At time, small band Republicans vowed Thursday would vote re-elect Gingrich circumstance, move that, Republicans' shrunken House majority, could tie party knot month could throw speakership Democrat. Rep. Matt Salmon, R-Ariz., said: I personally made decision I cannot vote Newt Gingrich speaker January, six told feel way, seven people not, take six deadlock vote. Fury speaker boiled Tuesday's election, Republicans suffered net loss five seat House. They blamed Gingrich, party's chief strategist. But many already angry said failure articulate clear message party going election messy budget process gave President Clinton political edge contradicted Republican principle fiscal conservativism containing massive amount pork spending. House Republicans meet Nov. 18 vote secret ballot leader. Whoever win party's nomination speaker stand election full House January. Even Gingrich win secret ballot, could denied re-election speaker January Salmon least five refuse vote him. Because Republicans control House 12 seat, would take six vote Gingrich deny majority allow Democrats potentially elect one speaker. With chaotic unacceptable prospect looming, Livingston told Gingrich step aside good party, according Republican official. The official said Livingston spoke Gingrich shortly disastrous election return also election, reflecting Livingston's earlier displeasure speaker budget process. Several Republicans said Livingston, chairman Appropriations Committee one member stature stand speaker, Gingrich working phone Thursday struggle vote. Livingston said nothing publicly challenge Gingrich, several member aide said Thursday would announce intention, possibly soon Friday, determined could win. He 'til duck row, right lot people still loyal speaker, said aide Republican who, many others, trying straddle line fealty speaker may retain power encouragement challenger offer salve embattled party.

A week White House congressional Democrats disavowed war Speaker Newt Gingrich, James Carville, President Clinton's former campaign strategist chief defender, put forth new battle cry Wednesday: He muzzled. Not that, Carville went customary denunciation Gingrich Republicans and, interview, trained fire leader party sufficiently aggressive four week Election Day. My sense frustration I believe Democrats much better chance much better anyone expects, Carville said. And I think anyone's emerging try pull together. Everybody ought pushing, leadership Congress, White House, DNC. We ought hammer Gingrich every day. How take Congress back make case people running it? I never heard strategy that. Sounding increasingly agitated, went on: The people left activated election Democrats. The right wing, they're bouncing wall. They're going vote. Rep. Dick Gephardt, minority leader, complained Erskine Bowles, White House chief staff, Carville appeared NBC News program Meet Press Sept. 27 declared, Cpl. Cue Ball Carville rolling battle Newt Gingrich. The concern House Democrats, one expressed White House official well, Carville's vitriol would make Democrats appear overly partisan could especially damaging Democrats marginal district want appear easy president. But Wednesday, Carville anything timid. If Gephardt people think they've quieted down, said, I'm quieted. Carville said told official White House, Don't waste breath calling telling say this. Carville insisted would rather battle Republicans fellow Democrats. If want fight me, can, said. I'm going fight Republicans. Yet could help ridicule party. Asked describe Democrats' strategy election, Carville said, If one, one's shared me. Just four year ago, good bet Newt Gingrich would pivotal figure US. politics turn millennium. Seemingly overnight taken moribund minority party turned pumped-up, issue-driven House majority. With promise balance budget, end welfare represent conservative social value, appeared rearranged political map Congress Ronald Reagan done presidency. But Gingrich's leadership shaky maintains hold speaker's office, danger marginalization. A change dramatic suggests something far profound miscalculation election tactic. What looked one major realignments US. political history might turn nothing temporary shift. The Gingrich revolution fueled anger, revolt white working-class Americans perceived Democratic bias favor black minority, middle-class rejection politics big government big deficit. They resentment Ronald Reagan exploited successfully. But old political habit moribund Republican leadership allowed Democrats retain control Congress throughout 1980s, turned Reagan's economic program undisciplined tax-cutting spree created prosperity huge budget gap. Gingrich's attention-grabbing rhetoric, energy talent political organization finally took Reagan's formula success congressional election 1994. But power, ran head Bill Clinton, whose political instinct better. The president co-opted part Contract With America, particularly balanced budget welfare reform. He adapted Republican social message call thing school uniform television rating system, symbolized responsibility parental control supporting government intrusion private life. The Republican right's genuine contempt Clinton based part well-known flaw president's character. But mainly reaction ease diverted supposed flood tide revolution. They expected genuine success Gingrich's first year office would lead still larger victory minimal government tax, unfettered free enterprise return conservative Christian value. But public happy led another direction, focus concern aging baby boomer health care Social Security. The government seen enemy issue budgetary looked potential ally. Back 1994, party stunned sudden change congressional fortune may overestimated meant. In particular may realized quickly good economic time, drop crime national welfare reform could blunt power race US. politics. The Democrats become literally minority party white voter resentfully identified policy city, black immigrant. But last week union worker Catholics returned Democratic fold. Without race wedge issue, solid black Democratic vote became powerful advantage key state. Blacks, woman Latinos angry Republican anti-immigration initiative winning coalition California, North Carolina New York. The speaker right say election expected. There may indeed Republican majority America, appears resemble Republicanism Dwight Eisenhower rather Newt Gingrich pro-business, wary debt inherent distaste bringing messy social issue abortion. The Republicans begun talking compassionate conservatism politics inclusion may peddling political mush, peddled victory Tuesday. The congressional Republican Party's long sojourn wilderness House minority may left accustomed opposition figure for, attached politics anger make sense nation mood moderation. Gingrich suggested mistake let Republicans drift politics impeachment almost maniacally focused thing tax cut. But looking maniacal got trouble first place. Winning control Congress many year tough Gingrich 1994. But ten time tougher forge politics depend rage. House Speaker Newt Gingrich, orchestrated Republican revolution recent year overseeing impeachment inquiry President Clinton, driven office Friday party swiftly turned unexpected loss Tuesday's midterm election. Catching virtually everyone Capitol Hill surprise, Gingrich announced Friday night two conference call Republicans would seek re-election Speaker Nov. 18 vote would leave Congress altogether term expires January. This give u chance purge poison system, Gingrich said, according party aide listened one call. Gingrich's resignation stunning reversal one combative personally confrontational politician America. He made name decade ago bringing one Democratic speaker, Jim Wright, continued assaultive style Tuesday's election last-minute commercial reminding voter Clinton scandal. His reflexive pugilistic response evident Friday night. In second conference call, according several people listened, Gingrich blamed House conservative downfall. Although revolutionary zeal harnessed take control Congress 1994, become bitter critic last two year tumultuous speakership. Friday night called cannibal blackmailed quitting. Rep. Michael P. Forbes, R-N.Y., said: Newt said marginalized Republican Party engaged cannibalism. He said, `Refer clips.' He's blaming others. Another Republican described conference call way: He started statesmanlike, could see anger building. When someone asked leaving, said, `A handful member blackmailed conference.' He said, `They're hateful.' And said, `They're cannibals.' Gingrich announced move hour Rep. Robert L. Livingston Louisiana announced running speaker, putting forward pragmatist manager. After Gingrich call, Rep. Bill Archer Texas announced run speaker. Livingston Archer chairman two powerful committee House. In statement Gingrich said, The Republican conference need unified, time move forward. He said hoped colleague would pick successor reconcile discipline, work together communicate effectively. Referring wife, told colleague resigning Congress Marianne I tired. We need time get know again. He also acknowledged knack bringing negative attention party. If I stay, told colleague Friday night, controversial nature would overshadow success might have, understatement recalled suggestion two year ago forced shutdown government miffed sit back Air Force One trip President Clinton. According another Republican took note, Gingrich said resignation: There lot bitterness amongst member. So long I around, I always target news medium, would mean would never able get message out. Clinton said: Newt Gingrich worthy adversary leading Republican Party majority House joining great national debate best prepare America 21st century. Despite profound difference, I appreciate time able work together national interest, especially Speaker Gingrich's strong support America's continuing leadership freedom, peace prosperity world. Many Republicans took opportunity portray Gingrich visionary. Rep. Sherwood Boehlert New York said first conference call, shock surprise strong expression appreciation leading u Promised Land. His supporter said Gingrich vote win election nominate speaker, conducted secret ballot. But, agreed, party's slim, six-vote majority meant every vote would battle. Kenneth Duberstein, former official Reagan administration, said, I doubt vote speaker, I'm sure vote govern. He said deep rift party, Gingrich would able implement plan. In unusually biting reaction, Rep. Dick Gephardt Missouri, Democratic leader, said hoped Gingrich's resignation would clear fierce partisan air fostered. I hope whoever succeeds Newt Gingrich speaker immediately begin process repairing damage wrought institution last four year, Gephardt said. House Republicans predicted Gingrich's resignation would set wide-ranging hectic scramble replace anticipated. There lot pretender throne test water, said Boehlert, supported Gingrich re-election speaker. There shortage candidate. The presidential campaign 2000 began Wednesday, not. The millennial election fought political playing field whose rough outline, exact boundary, drawn voter Tuesday's election, delivered crushing disappointment giddy hope Republicans unexpected elixir recently ailing Democrats. President Clinton called astonishing triumph issue investigation said Democrats many major victory clear message. Republicans agreed. Of course next 18 month bring many surprise many reversal fortune. But election result offered important guideline. Tuesday great day Vice President Al Gore, least three reason. He worked furiously successfully last ten day balloting persuade Democratic loyalist stay home sulk, appearing behalf fewer 224 candidate, according office. A moderate spectrum party, watched moderate win crucial election, notably California gubernatorial race, Lt. Gov. Gray Davis, cautious pragmatist Gore, smashing victory. The return break Senate Democratic gain five House Representatives also made impeachment President Clinton le likely. And better shape Clinton term end, better chance Gore, sidekick six year now, stand presidential nomination process and, ultimately, election. But California voter also complicated nominating process set Gore strategist work tactic uncomplicate it, consider state absolutely central presidential aspiration. In referendum 1996, California adopted primary system Republicans, Democrats independent voter would receive ballot, candidate party listed. That violates rule major party, measure ballot Tuesday, Proposition 3, would rescinded 1996 change. But failed, raising possibility California's March 7 primary mere political popularity poll, convention delegate chosen caucus convention nightmare. Tuesday bad day Republican right. High-profile right-winger lost country, Attorney General Dan Lungren California governor's race Sen. Lauch Faircloth, denied re-election North Carolina, Rep. Mark Neumann Wisconsin, failed Senate race huge spending advantage Sen. Russell Feingold, Ellen Sauerbrey Maryland, proved unable second try prevail unpopular Democratic governor, Parris Glendening. Both conservative moderate party said Republicans get back basic. Even Speaker Newt Gingrich conceded result sober every Republican called new strategic thinking. If make referendum president 67 cent approval rating, tried do, surprised election go you, said Gov. Tom Ridge Pennsylvania, moderate whose promoter mention weekly possible vice-presidential nominee. Sen. John McCain Arizona, conservative tends steer away divisive social issue, re-election 68 cent vote. He studying possibility presidential race, Republican nominee hope win, said interview Wednesday, congressional Republicans leader need learn lesson. I hope debacle wake-up call people, said. You've got something smaller government, better education, something. We're seen party that's everything. Polls taken late year's campaign bore McCain out. They showed Republicans longer identified issue electoral bread butter, low tax law order. Tuesday also fresh demonstration, anyone needed one, political utility pitching tent big enough almost everyone. Black politician North Carolina, Maryland California reported fear indifferent black turnout proved groundless. Black vote proved indispensable considerable number hard-pressed Democratic candidate, especially felt interest directly threatened. The figure Hispanic voting, assembled exit poll candidates' precinct analysis, showed dramatic difference. In California, outgoing Republican governor, Pete Wilson, played anti-immigration card vengeance, major Democratic candidate Davis Sen. Barbara Boxer, re-election trailing early poll cleaned Hispanic voter. He took 78 percent, 72. But Bush brother, Jeb Florida George W. Texas, took half Hispanic vote highly successful gubernatorial campaign. So McCain. Jeb Bush married Hispanic woman, brother speak Spanish fluently frequently, Senator McCain long espoused Hispanic cause. Both George W. Bush McCain draw strength, decide run, proven ability appeal Hispanic voter, well general electoral strength. George W. Bush took 69 percent vote Texas, Democrat sat governor's chair four year ago, second-largest bloc electoral vote. Florida fourth-largest. Governor Bush Texas uttered rallying cry moderate. A leader compassionate conservative, said victory speech, erase gender gap open Republican party new face new voice. But figure right saw thing differently. James Dobson, leading religious broadcaster, said Republicans fared poorly Gingrich Sen. Trent Lott Mississippi, majority leader, caved president budget de-emphasized social issue abortion flag desecration. He called explicitly ouster Gingrich. Likewise, millionaire publisher Steve Forbes, another probable candidate 2000, said leadership lot answer for. Tuesday proved potency education issue, suggested emerge major theme 2000 campaign. Clinton, limited involvement campaign, Gore, extensive participation, stressed Democratic program build school hire teacher. Almost quarter California voter almost twice many voter California state named education pressing concern. Elsewhere, Democrats governorship Alabama South Carolina odds, partly emphasizing rivals' opposition lottery help pay school. In Iowa, Democrat elected governor first time 1969 platform featured dilapidated condition state's school promise remedy it. Tuesday demonstrated overriding importance money modern American politics. Feingold, one principal backer campaign-finance reform, survived fight another day, opponent reform. And return House race, showing six 401 member sought re-election won, underlined hard is, present system, challenger raise enough money compete effectively. The difficulty raising money may doom many would-be presidential candidacy. Gore need, Bush, Forbes former Gov. Lamar Alexander Tennessee. But many will? Finally, Tuesday delivered indecisive message impeachment. Close two-thirds voter nationwide told exit pollster intended send message Clinton, made clear response question disliked House inquiry president's alleged misdeed wanted see end. In two state, Kansas Nebraska, majority voter say favored congressional censure Clinton, much milder form punishment advocated many Clinton backer. Some Republicans said privately hearing Clinton matter, Democrats began talking deal, equivalent plea bargain would bring matter early close. Nevertheless, Republican member House Judiciary Committee said needed press ahead Constitutional process House set motion. Among taking view Rep. Bob Barr Georgia, fierce foe president, Rep. Mary Bono California, whose tone muted. But Rep. David Dreier California, incoming Rules Committee chairman, said election played role ensuring one u desire drag out.

He also conceded Congress' final scramble pas $500 billion budget bill hurt party. One lesson Republicans need listen carefully people need clear understanding concise message apply nation, said Washington. Both Lott Gingrich said Republicans would put emphasis next year tax-cutting shoring Social Security system. Even two leader spoke, angry rank-and-file lawmaker making phone call trying ass whether mount challenge Republican leader steered Congress Republican's assumed control four year ago. One senior Republican staffer said House become tinderbox intrigue. Scarborough said, The long distance charge Washington office probably going roof today. Everybody's calling everybody. Everybody recognizes something's terribly wrong direction Washington Republicans Republican governor well New York, Massachusetts, Florida Texas. And Gingrich gone way identify Republican campaign's last-minute ad blitz attacking President Clinton, caucus know responsible. Gingrich faced uprising before, foiling coup attempt disgruntled conservative leadership team summer 1997. Any move remove remains long-shot. But House leadership election set mid-November, Republicans said time dissatisfaction caucus crossed ideological line moderate Shays well. We got shellacked, said Rep. Christopher Cannon, conservative Utah. We beat agenda. Republicans discussing possible challenge Gingrich, second-in-command, Rep. Dick Armey, member senior leadership team. Some envisioning trying run entire new ticket headed Rep. Bob Livingston, Appropriations Committee chairman Louisiana including Rep. Steve Largent, Oklahoma conservative. Asked whether Tuesday's election result could cost speakership, Gingrich said, I'm particularly concerned. Republicans close said expected anger dissipate. In Senate, leadership race take place early December, Republicans talking mounting challenge mid-level leadership figure. Several senator expressed particular pique re-election chairman, Senator Mitch McConnell Kentucky, poured party dollar much time trying defeat Democratic champion campaign finance overhaul, Russell Feingold Wisconsin. Feingold close race. Some lawmaker Wednesday approached Sen. Chuck Hagel Nebraska see would replace McConnell. Hagel confirmed talked eight senator, whether challenge McConnell. Hagel lambasted Republican leadership election outcome. This big loss u, said. We squandered historic opportunity last night. To break loss. Most incumbent coasted victory Tuesday night. But returning. Five House Republicans defeated: Vince Snowbarger Kansas, Bill Redmond New Mexico, Jon Fox Pennsylvania, Mike Pappas New Jersey, Rick White Washington. One Democrat also lost re-election bid Rep. Jay Johnson Wisconsin. The new House member include 17 Republicans least 22 Democrats. David Wu, Democrat leading Molly Bordonaro, Republican race one House seat Oregon, final victory announcement expected Friday absentee ballot counted. Unlike self-proclaimed revolutionary Republican class 1994, many newly elected member career politician rose rank local state government. Three Democrats son former lawmaker, Mark Udall Colorado, son Morris Udall represented Arizona; Tom Udall New Mexico, son Udall brother, Stewart, former congressman secretary Interior, Charlie Gonzalez, Texas seat father, Henry. A struggle control House way, Rep. Robert Livingston conducting telephone campaign could lead running Newt Gingrich speaker. But Gingrich's counter-campaign given member pause ousting him. At time, small band Republicans vowed Thursday would vote re-elect Gingrich circumstance, move that, Republicans' shrunken House majority, could tie party knot month. Rep. Matt Salmon, R-Ariz., said: I personally made decision I cannot vote Newt Gingrich speaker January, six told feel way, seven people not, take six deadlock vote. Fury speaker boiled Tuesday's election, Republicans suffered net loss five seat House. They blamed Gingrich, party's chief strategist. But many already angry said failure articulate clear message party going election messy budget process gave President Clinton political edge contradicted Republican principle fiscal conservativism containing massive amount spending local project. House Republicans meet Nov. 18 vote secret ballot leader. Whoever win Republican nomination speaker must stand election full House January. Even Gingrich win secret ballot, could denied re-election speaker January Salmon least five refuse vote him. Because Republicans control House 12 seat, would take six vote Gingrich deny majority. With chaotic unacceptable prospect looming, Livingston told Gingrich step aside good party, Republican official said. The official said Livingston spoke Gingrich shortly election return also election, reflecting Livingston's earlier displeasure speaker budget process. Several Republicans said Livingston, chairman Appropriations Committee one member stature stand speaker, Gingrich working phone Thursday struggle vote. Livingston said nothing publicly challenge Gingrich, several member aide said Thursday would announce intention, possibly soon Friday, determined could win. Rep. Peter King, R-N.Y., one several member spoke Livingston Thursday. He told he's making number phone call, he's gotten positive response running speaker, he'll decide next 48 hour, King said. He till duck row, right lot people still loyal speaker, said aide Republican who, many others, trying straddle line fealty speaker may retain power encouragement challenger offer salve embattled party. Many Republicans immediately blamed Gingrich party's loss Tuesday. Talk quickly emerged next day slate candidate oppose Gingrich lieutenant. The list possible candidate leadership position included Rep.e Steve Largent Oklahoma, talked Livingston Thursday challenging Gingrich, Republican official said, speaking condition name reported. Those official said Largent told Livingston wanted run ticket would challenge Rep. Dick Armey, majority leader. But, official said Livingston challenge Gingrich, Largent would run speaker instead. Other name floated Wednesday leadership post. They included Reps. David McIntosh Indiana speaker Jennifer Dunn Washington conference chairman. Added mix Thursday name Rep. Christopher Cox, California conservative. As sign uncertainty prevailing House member Thursday, Rep. Henry Hyde, chairman Judiciary Committee one House's venerable member, rebuffed chance endorse Gingrich speaker. Hyde said Gingrich bore responsibility party's loss Tuesday. Leadership take credit thing go right, said. They ought take blame thing go wrong. Asked Gingrich remain speaker, Hyde said: I rather think will, remains seen. The energy many vented publicly Wednesday anger Gingrich seemed devoted Thursday intense internal political calculation whether Livingston could succeed toppling Gingrich whether succeed. While many support veteran understands House shown shrewd political skill managing massive federal budget, reviving image Louisianan hot-head gave party bad name government shutdown two year ago tends arm-flailing heated moment. One conservative leader said ally reservation Livingston obsessed trying keep social issue budget process. The budget, said, vehicle conservative year add restriction federal money abortion thing can't get Senate presidential veto. If Livingston challenger, I doubt cause rallying real conservative Congress. Some moderate said prepared support him. Rep. Marge Roukema, R-N.J., said, I would amenable Livingston. Still, cautioned, I'm Newt. But wrong sit seriously look option. Ken Johnson, aide Rep. WJ. (Billy) Tauzin, R-La., said bos emblematic confusion broad base House Republicans. Billy loyal Speaker Gingrich Dick Armey, he's still loyal them, also want hear say committing next election, Johnson said. Everyone asking question: Can refocus message re-energize base re-aligning leadership? Salmon said refusal support Gingrich matter based Gingrich's track record one failed strategy another, including impeachment process pork-laden budget. With challenge way, Gingrich trying show member responsive concern. After election night portrayed Republicans victorious lost seat, next day took responsibility loss. In another move, Gingrich indicated willing cede control party's congressional campaign committee, allowing whole House select member. Gingrich also making strong personal appeal Republicans. Said one top House aide: He'll get support. How much? Only vote-counters know. \n","America Online verge agreeing purchase Netscape Communications Corp., Internet pioneer center government's antitrust suit Microsoft Corp., executives involved talks said Sunday. The proposed deal complex, three-way transaction involving AOL, Netscape Sun Microsystems Inc. AOL, leading on-line service 14 million subscribers, would acquire Netscape's popular site World Wide Web software business. AOL would also enter joint marketing development partnership Sun Microsystems strengthen Netscape's business selling large corporations heavy-duty software needed serve Web pages Internet technologies many thousands users time. The purchase, exchange AOL shares Netscape stock, valued roughly $4 billion. A completed deal could announced soon Monday morning. But executives involved talks cautioned Sunday night details remained negotiated. The Netscape deal, consummated, would realign three businesses forefront modern economy  on-line services, Internet software electronic commerce. It would strengthen two Microsoft's leading rivals, AOL Sun Microsystems. At time, however, would end independent existence Netscape, Internet software maker regarded serious challenger Microsoft's dominance personal computer software market. Netscape, founded 1994, struggled last 18 months assault Microsoft. Its Navigator runaway leader market browser software used navigate World Wide Web. But Microsoft, responding Internet revolution, entered market aggressively, quickly matching quality Netscape's technology bundling Microsoft browser, Internet Explorer, industry-standard Windows operating system giving away free. Eventually, Microsoft's browser technology caught Netscape's. Earlier year, Netscape announced layoffs started distributing Navigator free well, Microsoft steadily gained browser market. Since then, Netscape focused mainly two businesses  advertising transaction fees Netcenter Web site selling industrial-strength software corporations building Internet sites conduct electronic commerce. AOL believes expertise increase revenues Netscape's Web site and, helped Sun's programmers vast corporate sales force, accelerate Netscape's software sales well, executives involved negotiations said. Among large corporations, Sun's version Unix, Solaris, popular operating systems powerful computers run Netscape's server software. The much smaller Netscape would placed wing AOL Sun Microsystems. The three companies combined revenues $12.4 billion last year. Microsoft, comparison, revenues $14 billion. This deal would insure fundamental elements Netscape survive bigger companies drive technologies forward, said David B. Yoffie, professor Harvard business school co-author Michael A. Cusumano Massachusetts Institute Technology recent book, Competing Internet Time: Lessons Netscape Its Battle Microsoft. The impact deal, any, government's antitrust suit Microsoft uncertain. It appear support key theme Microsoft's defense  namely, operates fast-moving industry corporate alliances shift time. Thus, Microsoft argues, antitrust policy tread gently. But deal, government officials insist, direct effect current case. No matter much alliances shift, affect central fact Microsoft's monopoly used abused market power protect monopoly, said David Boies, Justice Department's lead trial lawyer Microsoft case. Executives representing Netscape, AOL Sun Microsystems government witnesses Microsoft trial. And serious merger talks Netscape Chief Executive Officer James Barksdale AOL Chairman Steve Case began month ago, start Microsoft trial, according people close talks. Industry analysts suggest companies may emboldened take stronger anti-Microsoft steps based partly perception antitrust case would weaken Microsoft. And representatives Kleiner Perkins Caufield &AMP; Byers, Silicon Valley venture capital firm regarded power broker Microsoft's rivals, sit boards Netscape, Sun AOL. Still, executives involved talks said timing proposed deal unrelated antitrust trial. Nor it, one person noted, regarded single-minded attempt circle wagons Microsoft. Indeed, AOL, according one person close talks, plans keep Microsoft's Internet Explorer browser default choice on-line service. One government's allegations antitrust suit Microsoft Netscape main browser AOL Microsoft used Windows monopoly bargaining chip. To win browser deal, Microsoft offered AOL prime real estate Windows desktop, main screen 90 percent personal computers sold today. Staying Microsoft's browser seen proof AOL still regards placement Windows desktop crucial, well careful step avoid undermining one allegations government's case. For AOL, Netscape purchase would accelerate evolution Internet. At present, flagship on-line service hybrid  proprietary service, added gateway World Wide Web. In addition, consumers subscribe AOL's dial-up service, also Web site, aol.com, attracts 24 million visitors month, according Media Metrix/Relevant Knowledge, market research firm. Its big Web site offers wide range information, entertainment, Internet chat e-mail, leading example all-in-one sites become known portals. Netscape's Netcenter traffic slipped bit recent months, 16 million visitors month, it, too, major portal. Together, huge player intensifying portal battle viewers resulting advertising revenues. Yahoo current leader portal sites 25 million monthly visitors, Microsoft's site attracts 20 million month. Though known new-media company consumers, AOL also interested boosting electronic commerce business Netscape purchase. AOL recently done work Eastman Kodak, American Greetings companies, promoting products on-line subscribers also building Internet infrastructure software conduct electronic commerce. AOL notes projections recent one Forrester Research Inc., predicted worldwide Internet commerce could reach high $3.2 trillion 2003, 5 percent global sales. Sun Microsystems, analysts say, could strong partner AOL market Internet commerce software. Sun corporate software company sales force several thousand. As moves increasingly Internet technology, AOL prove excellent partner Sun terms developing using Sun's Java, Internet programming language. And Netscape's browser longer generates revenue own, distribution channel Java technology. Having Netscape's browser safely hands friendly company strategic importance Sun, Microsoft owns alternative browser market. AOL expected pay little, any, premium Netscape's stock price Friday, executives close deal said, Netscape shares doubled last month. In last week alone, Netscape's stock jumped $12, nearly 45 percent, reports discussing possible partnership AOL. The stock closed Friday $39.1875, $2.625. AOL's shares gained $1.50 Friday, closing $84.875. Envisioning thoroughly networked world World Wide Web limitless marketplace information, entertainment, products services, America Online Inc. Tuesday laid details agreement buy Netscape Communications Corporation $4.2 billion. By moving quickly companies recently come see inevitable convergence technology media, America Online hopes secure solid lead battle already joined giants Microsoft Corp. International Business Machines Corp. transform greater part cyberspace vast virtual mall. Part vision rests alliance Sun Microsystems America Online negotiated part deal. Sun brings cyber-savvy sales force effort but, importantly, strong technology partner developing Netscape's industrial-strength software running Internet sites. Sun indeed technology heavyweight. It owns Java programming language specially designed Internet applications, Solaris, popular commercial operating systems powerful computers big corporations use serve Internet services World Wide Web, e-mail retail transactions. It also manufactures highly respected line powerful computers based microprocessor chips. But America Online  big Internet players compete  real potential gold mine lies road, perhaps five years away, people venture line information shopping personal computers inexpensive Internet appliances costing $200 each, maybe included free part subscription service, cellular phones now. Today, wired remains comparatively elitist activity  estimated 25 percent American households access Internet last year, 5 percent households bought merchandise line. But executives America Online Netscape hope deal accelerate timetable day Net ubiquitous, people tap World Wide Web appliance-like devices, pagers, cell phones, television set-top boxes computers routinely use telephone today. A new generation Internet devices able deliver service anywhere key part deal long run, said Stephen M. Case, 40, chairman America Online. For present, however, idea make America Online, nation's leading online service, standard way get Internet, executives explained. Netscape, Internet pioneer, crucial part effort, said. There assurance vision technological future prove accurate or, does, America Online-Netscape combination lead way. Still, long-range game plan helps explain brought America Online Netscape together. And ability companies' executives sell vision Netscape's whiz-kid programmers particular determine whether merger succeeds. Netscape's headquarters Mountain View, Calif., likely become prime target Silicon Valley headhunters. As case software company, Netscape's key asset talented programmers, many code hackers may reluctant work America Online, still reputation middle-brow service catering online newcomers, known derisively newbies. Stock options financial incentives tailored try keep Netscape employees board. But people want change world, we've got clear joining America Online, Sun component, really bigger opportunity us, said Marc Andreessen, 26-year-old cofounder Netscape led team young programmers supercomputing center University Illinois Silicon Valley start Internet software company 1994. This ought preeminent Internet company next decade, Andreessen declared, speaking cell phone streetcorner Palo Alto, Calif. For part, Andreessen, Netscape executive vice president, become Netscape's chief technology officer next three four months, merger completed. His new job America Online determined, likely chief technology officer combined company well, America Online executive said. Already, according one Netscape board member, Andreessen delivered 12-page single-spaced memorandum Case, setting view technological road map new company follow future, emphasizing opportunities electronic commerce environment people linked Internet. Netscape, populated computing sophisticates, America Online, known on-ramp Internet technologically challenged, seem corporate odd couple. But two companies, executives explained, evolving year. In telephone interview America Online's headquarters Dulles, Va., Case described Netscape enterprise morphed company dependent sales software used browse World Wide Web  Microsoft's cross-hairs  business relied advertising revenues popular Netcenter Web site selling software corporations handle electronic commerce. The Netscape transformation largely reaction Microsoft's competitive assault browser business  central element government's antitrust suit Microsoft. Microsoft bundled browser industry-standard Windows operating system, gave away browser free. The government alleges steps part pattern anticompetitive practices, Microsoft maintains moves intended mainly benefit consumers. Early year, laying workers suffering large loss last year, Netscape announced would also distribute browser free. It seems stabilized business new model. Netscape announced Tuesday earned $2.7 million revenues $162 million fourth fiscal quarter, ended September. Yet America Online also changed last couple years, moving well reputation online service beginners. It Internet chat service runs all-in-one site Web, known portal, includes e-mail, Internet searching, news, entertainment online shopping. America Online really changed closed online service novice users Internet media technology company diverse set brands, Andreessen said. These two companies moving direction, fit good one. America Online Inc. wants become next Microsoft two promising information-age fields Microsoft Corp. another company  Internet media business electronic commerce. With proposed purchase Netscape Communications Corp., AOL, nation's largest dial-up online service 14 million subscribers, hopes take significant step ambitious goal. If $4 billion deal completed  companies reached final agreement Monday night  AOL would acquire leading Internet brand enlarge wired audience absorbing millions regularly visit Netscape's popular NetCenter site World Wide Web. Acquiring Netscape would really enhance America Online's role premier Internet media company, said James F. Moore, president Geopartners Inc., consulting firm. America Online assembling kind audience numbers convince people Internet becoming mainstream media. In new media business, traditional media television newspapers, eyeballs translate advertising revenue. But really intrigues media executives consumer marketers new media  news, entertainment services rendered computer code  inherently two-way medium people interact tap key click mouse button The interaction advertisers marketers want see, course, buying. And potential exploiting instant, direct connection consumers fueled recent optimism electronic commerce. Today, companies selling everything books baby clothes Internet. Most companies progressed experimentation stage, handful encouraging success stories Amazon.com, on-line bookstore. By 2003, Forrester Research Inc., whose business analyzing trends cyberspace, projects Internet commerce could reach $3.2 trillion, 5 percent sales worldwide. AOL forefront convergence media commerce converge, integration reflected lineage leaders. Steve Case, chairman, new-product manager Pepsico's Pizza Hut chain, Robert Pittman, president, former MTV executive. Microsoft also investing heavily new media electronic commerce. It online service, MSN, competes AOL, well information-and commerce Web sites focus travel, cars real estate. It also owns Sidewalk, network local sites list movies, restaurants stores cities country including Seattle New York. Its MSNBC Internet news service half joint venture NBC. Microsoft expected formidable competitor media-and-commerce business. It shortage bright people money rival. Besides deep pockets, Microsoft built-in advantage computer-based medium Windows operating system runs 90 percent personal computers sold today. Its control Windows desktop gives valuable piece commercial real estate information age. In theory, least, owning desktop screen help Microsoft steer consumers online offerings  issue key government's antitrust suit Microsoft. But far, Microsoft started slowly fields Internet media electronic commerce. Microsoft may want to, dominate new markets, said Richard Shaffer, principal Technologic Partners, research firm. America Online recognizes big opportunity emerging growth businesses electronic commerce instead trying take Microsoft head-on. Still, Netscape deal completed, AOL also find software business way never past. Netscape known pioneer commercial development software used navigate World Wide Web. Microsoft saw browser software direct threat industry dominance pursued market aggressively, bundling browser Windows giving away free  tactics challenged government. But Netscape longer generates revenues browser, also distributes free, sale heavy-duty software sold corporations. Much software used technological back office electronic commerce  used building Web sites processing transactions. A surprising element proposed deal AOL intends hold Netscape's corporate software business instead selling established software company. America Online credibility market, observed Michael A. Cusumano, professor Massachusetts Institute Technology's Sloan School Management. Executives close AOL explain decision need provide full-line offerings electronic commerce, corporate Web site computer screens consumers. But AOL decided needs help preserve strengthen Netscape's corporate software business. To that, brought Sun Microsystems Inc. side deal, complicated transaction considerably. AOL, according executives close proposed deal, Netscape, joint marketing development partnership Sun. As part deal, AOL agree purchase $300 million worth Sun's computers service, Sun apparently agree purchase sizeable amounts Netscape software, Sun's sales force must sell. Still, AOL Sun longer-term objective well  one promises place direct conflict Microsoft. For nearly year, William J. Raduchel, Sun's chief strategist, working closely AOL, according Sun executives. A former Harvard economics professor taught Scott McNealy, Sun chairman, Raduchel focused Sun's Internet programming technologies, called Java Jini, seen potential threats Microsoft's dominance. By combining Sun's technology prowess AOL's powerful consumer brand, Sun executives say, potential kind end-run Microsoft's grip desktop computing. In research laboratories, Sun working stripped-down network computer  simple-to-use information appliance, could cost little $200 given away part subscription service. The concept AOL's Internet media electronic commerce services could delivered many homes today many people still shun expense difficulty using personal computer. The appliance would mainly receiver screen, computing power residing vast central computers serving information users request tapping buttons. Sun's technological specialty kind centralized network computing. If long-term AOL-Sun vision ever materialized  certainly three-to-five year bet, least  could give companies boost technological independence Microsoft. Microsoft Corp. argued federal court Monday proposed acquisition Netscape Communications Corp. America Online seriously undermined government's antitrust suit software giant. From legal standpoint, proposed deal pulls rug government, William Neukom, Microsoft's senior vice president legal affairs, said Monday morning courthouse steps. The reasoning assertion, Microsoft says, proposed deal demonstrates Netscape larger software industry healthy vibrant  illegal anti-competitive practices alleged government's suit. But David Boies, government's lead attorney, said irrelevant. Whatever deal ends  ends deal  going remove obstacles Microsoft placed path competition industry, said. Michael Lacovara, Microsoft lawyer questioning government witness, economist Frederick Warren-Boulton, suggested trial Monday proposed acquisition undermined Warren-Boulton's argument, Microsoft seems headed obtaining monopoly Internet browser software match one apparently holds operating systems. After all, 22 percent Americans use Internet reach America Online. And present AOL uses Microsoft's Web browser, Internet Explorer, service's default choice. In exchange that, Microsoft places AOL advertisement Internet link Windows 98. Lacovara asked witness whether, AOL's service contract expires January, would expect AOL continue distribute Microsoft software. Yes, Warren-Boulton responded. It clear AOL's incentive changed proposed merger Netscape. He noted America Online officials said need online services featured Windows forced accept Microsoft terms  establishing Internet Explorer default choice. Lacovara asked Warren-Boulton question lay entire cross-examination witness  Microsoft's larger assertion Monday proposed Netscape-AOL deal. Surely combination, asked, tells something nature competition software industry? Warren-Boulton's answer probably one Lacovara after. To extent potential merger result Microsoft's actions exclusive contracts actions, said, unfortunate see disappearance firm Netscape, brightest, newest star. Warren-Boulton's purpose stand government establish Microsoft monopoly operating-system software; 90 percent world's computers use Microsoft operating system. That foundation government's case federal antitrust law forbids certain behavior monopolist would legal firm faces healthy competition. Through repeated, circumlocutious questioning, Lacovara tried make case Microsoft's overwhelming market share ephemeral. The software industry vibrant fast moving, suggested, Microsoft could toppled position moment  point view company encourages employees. On Friday Monday, Lacovara repeatedly pointed companies placing operating systems market, software companies  principally Microsoft's greatest rivals  writing software new systems. But Warren-Boulton argued existence fringe competitors operating system market mean way Microsoft monopoly power. On Monday afternoon, Lacovara made issue success Apple Computer Co. selling new iMac computer. He entered evidence Apple news release issued last month showing, things, 12.5 percent people buying Apple's new iMac computer previously owned Windows machine. Apple computers use different operating system, Mac-OS. The outcome Microsoft antitrust case may long way off, one thing already clear: This first major e-mail trial. The government's prosecution Microsoft Corp.'s defense, striking degree, legal campaigns waged electronic messages. The human testimony pales next e-mail evidence. On stand videotaped testimony, people questioned shrug, mumble forget. The e-mail alive ideas competitive zeal, punctuated profanity exclamation points. The second week trial ended prosecutors frustrated lengthy cross-examination Microsoft's lead lawyer left time government show several hours videotaped deposition Bill Gates, Microsoft chairman. With new witness, executive Apple Computer Inc., taking stand Monday, uncertain Gates tape played. The Justice Department 20 states suing Microsoft believe tape strengthen case shows Gates saying involved plans take government alleges illegal steps stifle competition Internet software market. The Gates videotape, said David Boies, Justice Department's trial lawyer, offers opportunity judge Gates' credibility. But Gates credibility gap, one, becomes issue videotape taped remarks compared contrasted e-mail wrote received. The e-mail record, government insists, shows Gates waist-deep plotting anti-competitive deals bullying tactics denies professes never heard taped deposition. If machinations central government's case, summon Gates trial? The government need put Gates stand, e-mail memoranda, Stephen Houck, lawyer states, told court. The Microsoft legal team months preparing e-mail defense. First, Microsoft argues, anything looks damaging taken context. I urge honor, John Warden, Microsoft's lead lawyer, told Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson, view considerable skepticism crazy quilt e-mail fragments seem form core government's case. But Microsoft also mounted e-mail counterattack, culled millions messages obtained subpoena competitors pretrial discovery. Warden's cross-examination ritual present government witness internal e-mail company pose declaration question. These interrogations two refrains: Isn't true company exactly accusing Microsoft doing, true Microsoft prevailed predatory monopolist superior technology? Microsoft accused trying prod companies stay way. So last week, example, Warden produced e-mail Stephen Case, chairman America Online, suggesting partnership Netscape Communications Corp. companies would focus respective strengths. That division labor, Case wrote, would best way achieve goal Marc Andreessen, Netscape's cofounder, described earlier e-mail beating Beast From Redmond wants see us dead  reference Microsoft's headquarters Redmond, Wash. Printouts e-mail another form written communication. By 1920s, typewriters became common, typed memoranda started used court cases. From 1950s 1980s, legal experts say, explosion documentation fueled new technologies electric typewriters, photocopying fax machines, personal computers. And e-mail, add, played important role legal inquiries years, Iran-contra case 1980s e-mail found Oliver North's computer proved crucial. But Microsoft case result sweeping government antitrust investigation high-technology company e-mail supplanted telephone common instrument communication. E-mail revolutionized investigations kind, one senior Justice Department official said. While investigation, Microsoft handed government estimated 30 million documents, mostly e-mail. In trial, two sides submitted 3,000 exhibits, mainly e-mail. And e-mail, people communicate frankly informally writing letter report  tap out, punch button gone cyberspace. But e-mail communication documentary evidence, legal cases provides rich, contemporaneous record people thinking planning time. It sharp contrast formal oral testimony, coached lawyers crafted selective memory. The e-mail record certainly makes I-don't-recall line response harder sustain, said Robert Litan, former senior official Justice Department's antitrust division Brookings Institution. It also powerful ammunition pointing contradictions testimony. And government attacking Gates' credibility videotaped deposition, taken three days August. The government offered glimpse strategy first day trial. It showed brief clips point deposition Gates asked meeting June 21, 1995, which, government alleges, Microsoft offered divide browser market Netscape make investment company, chief rival market. In taped deposition, Gates says recalled asked one subordinates whether thought made sense invest Netscape. He said asked June 1995 meeting replied, I see something made sense. But e-mail May 31, 1995, Gates urged alliance Netscape. We could pay money part deal, wrote, buying piece something. The contradiction Gates' deposition e-mail, though, speak issue whether Microsoft made illegal offer Netscape. To sure, Microsoft  said e-mail communications  counts most. But e-mail looks bad gets record, end Microsoft's lawyers going spend much trial  trying explain away, said Stephen Axinn, leading antitrust litigator firm Axinn, Veltrop &AMP; Harkrider New York. America Online built potent force cyberspace largely appealing families chatty teen-agers want flirt online adults looking easy way send electronic mail checking weather sports scores. Now, company get serious win hearts minds corporate executives pin-stripe suits. Nearly lost complexity America Online's deal buy Netscape Communication Corp. America Online's announcement enter entirely new market: working computer screen help companies open operate online stores. Netscape already created software made player providing support already known electronic commerce. But America Online says ambitions offer much wider array software, consulting services online merchants. Most companies sell consumers realize need get e-commerce space, said America Online president Robert Pittman news conference Tuesday. We see major business offering end-to-end solution. The market big growing bigger day. Forrester Research estimates $325 million spent year electronic commerce software another $5.3 billion services range graphic design turn-key operation entire online stores. By 2002, Forrester estimates, combined market electronic commerce services software top $35 billion. E-commerce services silver bullet enable companies able take advantage true business opportunities Web, said Traci Gere, analyst International Data Corp. The market growing rapidly, fragmented. Analysts say leader today e-commerce services IBM, full line offerings sophisticated software products hand-holding consulting. Other competitors include well-known information technology consulting companies Andersen Consulting, spin-off Arthur Andersen accounting firm; Electronic Data Systems, runs computer systems big companies, PricewaterhouseCoopers, offers accounting consulting separately one umbrella. Software companies Microsoft Netscape sell packaged programs, typically little consulting help customers use them. There also plenty new companies sprouted provide electronic commerce services. Some, Agency.Com Organic Online, started basically advertising design firms. Others, including U S Web Viant, emphasized programming consulting. In fact, two strains blurring together, exemplified U S Web's pending merger CKS Group. America Online argues advantage increasingly crowded bazaar ability combine broad subscriber base 15 million customers Netscape software, hardware Sun Microsystems, joined America Online's venture electronic commerce engineering. This first time anyone put true end-to-end solution starts silicon ends audience, said Barry Schuler, America Online's president interactive services. We start Sun's line servers, commerce tools build store, support services process orders deal online real estate drive traffic. Despite advantages Netscape Sun bring, analysts say America Online faces variety problems new quest. Chief whether appear consistency, focus follow-through corporate customers demand. AOL first company comes mind comes business-quality software, said Robert Chatham, senior analyst Forrester Research. Its decision keep Netscape separate unit offer electronic commerce services partnership Sun enhance credibility, Chatham said. America Online look homogenous vendor, added. It looks customers tangle menage trois AOL, Netscape Sun. Nor Internet service providers telecommunications-oriented companies shown much evidence, Ms. Gere International Data said, capable offering highly specific customized services big corporate clients demand. Telecommunications companies try things efficiently large number customers able offer customized one-to-one relationships, said. Pittman said America Online driven e-commerce business companies approached wanting sell goods needed help simply advertising online. We finding people expert running bricks-and-mortar stores limited infrastructure, said. They online store, square footage small. Even Netscape deal, America Online moving provide electronic commerce software services. It rewriting software lets companies open online stores based universally accepted Internet standards rather specific computer language used America Online. This new software, combined Netscape's online store services, available companies use America Online Internet. Similarly, developed service lets users create file credit card numbers shipping address make online purchases retyping information time. America Online working offer  fee  stores broader Internet. There wide range services incorporated electronic commerce. These include high-end strategy consulting help companies decide whether sell online hurting traditional sale stores. There sorts computer systems developed, ranging online stores connecting sites company's existing inventory accounting systems. There creative services include graphic design, media buying, customer list analysis marketing promotional efforts. And operational services involve actually maintaining big servers users connect use online stores display catalogs, take orders process payments. America Online, Schuler said, emphasize services relate marketing rather back-office functions. We consult merchandise sell online, said. We understand consumer piece puzzle. Some competitors worry America Online's electronic commerce services may simply device sell software hardware. The challenge prove clients getting best possible solution business, said Robert Gett, chief executive Viant. If offer AOL Netscape Sun, answer bit tainted. Netscape expanding force 700 people provide consulting custom programming. But competitive, Gett said, competing nuts-and-bolts projects rather lucrative assignments develop carry full-fledged strategy Web. They say, `Who knows software better Netscape?' Gett said. We help customers decide platform best them. But America Online argues combined might it, Netscape Sun business needs. We always believed commerce, buying goods services, huge revenue stream future, Schuler said. We seen tiniest tip iceberg.

Some, Agency.Com Organic Online, started basically advertising design firms. Others, including U S Web Viant, emphasized programming consulting. In fact, two strains blurring together, exemplified U S Web's pending merger CKS Group.

America Online verge agreeing purchase Netscape Communications Corp., Internet pioneer center government's antitrust suit Microsoft Corp., executives involved talks said Sunday. The proposed deal complex, three-way transaction involving AOL, Netscape Sun Microsystems Inc.

If anyone asked market went looks corrective blip, I would said new target would 9,000. I surprised 10,000 figure came back table year. The New York Times said editorial Wednesday, Nov. 25: America Online's effort acquire Netscape set partnership Sun Microsystems reminder rapidly corporate landscape change fast-moving technical fields. But lessen need Justice Department vigorously pursue antitrust suit Microsoft, dominant player software. The department presented solid evidence Microsoft used monopoly operating systems muscle rivals partners head competition software realms. The Internet risen quickly information medium four years ago, book The Road Ahead, Bill Gates scarcely mentions it. In addition, couple years ago America Online, world's biggest online service, much trouble getting rid bugs system widely derided America On Hold. Now Microsoft moved aggressively Internet Justice Department accusing predatory behavior, America Online rocketed forward make deals Internet players. In antitrust suit Microsoft, federal government charges company illegally bundled browser Windows operating system smother Netscape's chances marketing browser. Now corridors antitrust trial Microsoft's lawyers maintain Netscape found new partner America Online need protection government. But could easily argued Microsoft bludgeoned Netscape dissolution, forcing distress sale America Online. Nor clear customers America Online choose Netscape's browser vehicle buying selling Internet. Even newly musclebound form, America Online remains dependent Microsoft's good favorable placement AOL icon main desktop screen. It may that, years hence, America Online, Netscape Sun put together alternative means Internet telephone lines, cables like.

Still, executive involved talk said timing proposed deal unrelated antitrust trial. Nor it, one person noted, regarded single-minded attempt circle wagon Microsoft. Indeed, AOL, according one person close talk, plan keep Microsoft's Internet Explorer browser default choice on-line service. One government's allegation antitrust suit Microsoft Netscape main browser AOL Microsoft used Windows monopoly bargaining chip. To win browser deal, Microsoft offered AOL prime real estate Windows desktop, main screen 90 percent personal computer sold today. Staying Microsoft's browser seen proof AOL still regard placement Windows desktop crucial, well careful step avoid undermining one allegation government's case. For AOL, Netscape purchase would accelerate evolution Internet. At present, flagship on-line service hybrid proprietary service, added gateway World Wide Web. In addition, consumer subscribe AOL's dial-up service, also Web site, aol.com, attracts 24 million visitor month, according Media Metrix/Relevant Knowledge, market research firm.

Though known new-media company consumer, AOL also interested boosting electronic commerce business Netscape purchase. AOL recently done work Eastman Kodak, American Greetings company, promoting product on-line subscriber also building Internet infrastructure software conduct electronic commerce. AOL note projection recent one Forrester Research Inc., predicted worldwide Internet commerce could reach high $3.2 trillion 2003, 5 percent global sale.

As move increasingly Internet technology, AOL prove excellent partner Sun term developing using Sun's Java, Internet programming language.

Tuesday laid detail agreement buy Netscape Communications Corporation $4.2 billion. By moving quickly company recently come see inevitable convergence technology medium, America Online hope secure solid lead battle already joined giant Microsoft Corp. International Business Machines Corp. transform greater part cyberspace vast virtual mall. Part vision rest alliance Sun Microsystems America Online negotiated part deal. Sun brings cyber-savvy sale force effort but, importantly, strong technology partner developing Netscape's industrial-strength software running Internet site. Sun indeed technology heavyweight. It owns Java programming language specially designed Internet application, Solaris, popular commercial operating system powerful computer big corporation use serve Internet service World Wide Web, e-mail retail transaction. It also manufacture highly respected line powerful computer based microprocessor chip. But America Online big Internet player compete real potential gold mine lie road, perhaps five year away, people venture line information shopping personal computer inexpensive Internet appliance costing $200 each, maybe included free part subscription service, cellular phone now. Today, wired remains comparatively elitist activity estimated 25 percent American household access Internet last year, 5 percent household bought merchandise line. But executive America Online Netscape hope deal accelerate timetable day Net ubiquitous, people tap World Wide Web appliance-like device, pager, cell phone, television set-top box computer routinely use telephone today. A new generation Internet device able deliver service anywhere key part deal long run, said Stephen M. Case, 40, chairman America Online. For present, however, idea make America Online, nation's leading online service, standard way get Internet, executive explained. Netscape, Internet pioneer, crucial part effort, said. There assurance vision technological future prove accurate or, doe, America Online-Netscape combination lead way. Still, long-range game plan help explain brought America Online Netscape together. And ability companies' executive sell vision Netscape's whiz-kid programmer particular determine whether merger succeeds. Netscape's headquarters Mountain View, Calif., likely become prime target Silicon Valley headhunter. As case software company, Netscape's key asset talented programmer, many code hacker may reluctant work America Online, still reputation middle-brow service catering online newcomer, known derisively newbie. Stock option financial incentive tailored try keep Netscape employee board. But people want change world, we've got clear joining America Online, Sun component, really bigger opportunity u, said Marc Andreessen, 26-year-old cofounder Netscape led team young programmer supercomputing center University Illinois Silicon Valley start Internet software company 1994. This ought preeminent Internet company next decade, Andreessen declared, speaking cell phone streetcorner Palo Alto, Calif. For part, Andreessen, Netscape executive vice president, become Netscape's chief technology officer next three four month, merger completed. His new job America Online determined, likely chief technology officer combined company well, America Online executive said. Already, according one Netscape board member, Andreessen delivered 12-page single-spaced memorandum Case, setting view technological road map new company follow future, emphasizing opportunity electronic commerce environment people linked Internet. Netscape, populated computing sophisticate, America Online, known on-ramp Internet technologically challenged, seem corporate odd couple. But two company, executive explained, evolving year. In telephone interview America Online's headquarters Dulles, Va., Case described Netscape enterprise morphed company dependent sale software used browse World Wide Web Microsoft's cross-hairs business relied advertising revenue popular Netcenter Web site selling software corporation handle electronic commerce. The Netscape transformation largely reaction Microsoft's competitive assault browser business central element government's antitrust suit Microsoft. Microsoft bundled browser industry-standard Windows operating system, gave away browser free. The government alleges step part pattern anticompetitive practice, Microsoft maintains move intended mainly benefit consumer. Early year, laying worker suffering large loss last year, Netscape announced would also distribute browser free. It seems stabilized business new model. Netscape announced Tuesday earned $2.7 million revenue $162 million fourth fiscal quarter, ended September. Yet America Online also changed last couple year, moving well reputation online service beginner. It Internet chat service run all-in-one site Web, known portal, includes e-mail, Internet searching, news, entertainment online shopping. America Online really changed closed online service novice user Internet medium technology company diverse set brand, Andreessen said. These two company moving direction, fit good one. America Online Inc. want become next Microsoft two promising information-age field Microsoft Corp. another company Internet medium business electronic commerce. With proposed purchase Netscape Communications Corp., AOL, nation's largest dial-up online service 14 million subscriber, hope take significant step ambitious goal. If $4 billion deal completed company reached final agreement Monday night AOL would acquire leading Internet brand enlarge wired audience absorbing million regularly visit Netscape's popular NetCenter site World Wide Web. Acquiring Netscape would really enhance America Online's role premier Internet medium company, said James F. Moore, president Geopartners Inc., consulting firm. America Online assembling kind audience number convince people Internet becoming mainstream medium. In new medium business, traditional medium television newspaper, eyeball translate advertising revenue. But really intrigue medium executive consumer marketer new medium news, entertainment service rendered computer code inherently two-way medium people interact tap key click mouse button The interaction advertiser marketer want see, course, buying. And potential exploiting instant, direct connection consumer fueled recent optimism electronic commerce. Today, company selling everything book baby clothes Internet. Most company progressed experimentation stage, handful encouraging success story Amazon.com, on-line bookstore. By 2003, Forrester Research Inc., whose business analyzing trend cyberspace, project Internet commerce could reach $3.2 trillion, 5 percent sale worldwide. AOL forefront convergence medium commerce converge, integration reflected lineage leader. Steve Case, chairman, new-product manager Pepsico's Pizza Hut chain, Robert Pittman, president, former MTV executive. Microsoft also investing heavily new medium electronic commerce. It online service, MSN, competes AOL, well information-and commerce Web site focus travel, car real estate. It also owns Sidewalk, network local site list movie, restaurant store city country including Seattle New York. Its MSNBC Internet news service half joint venture NBC. Microsoft expected formidable competitor media-and-commerce business. It shortage bright people money rival. Besides deep pocket, Microsoft built-in advantage computer-based medium Windows operating system run 90 percent personal computer sold today. Its control Windows desktop give valuable piece commercial real estate information age. In theory, least, owning desktop screen help Microsoft steer consumer online offering issue key government's antitrust suit Microsoft. But far, Microsoft started slowly field Internet medium electronic commerce. Microsoft may want to, dominate new market, said Richard Shaffer, principal Technologic Partners, research firm. America Online recognizes big opportunity emerging growth business electronic commerce instead trying take Microsoft head-on. Still, Netscape deal completed, AOL also find software business way never past. Netscape known pioneer commercial development software used navigate World Wide Web. Microsoft saw browser software direct threat industry dominance pursued market aggressively, bundling browser Windows giving away free tactic challenged government. But Netscape longer generates revenue browser, also distributes free, sale heavy-duty software sold corporation. Much software used technological back office electronic commerce used building Web site processing transaction. A surprising element proposed deal AOL intends hold Netscape's corporate software business instead selling established software company. America Online credibility market, observed Michael A. Cusumano, professor Massachusetts Institute Technology's Sloan School Management. Executives close AOL explain decision need provide full-line offering electronic commerce, corporate Web site computer screen consumer. But AOL decided need help preserve strengthen Netscape's corporate software business. To that, brought Sun Microsystems Inc. side deal, complicated transaction considerably. AOL, according executive close proposed deal, Netscape, joint marketing development partnership Sun. As part deal, AOL agree purchase $300 million worth Sun's computer service, Sun apparently agree purchase sizeable amount Netscape software, Sun's sale force must sell. Still, AOL Sun longer-term objective well one promise place direct conflict Microsoft. For nearly year, William J. Raduchel, Sun's chief strategist, working closely AOL, according Sun executive. A former Harvard economics professor taught Scott McNealy, Sun chairman, Raduchel focused Sun's Internet programming technology, called Java Jini, seen potential threat Microsoft's dominance. By combining Sun's technology prowess AOL's powerful consumer brand, Sun executive say, potential kind end-run Microsoft's grip desktop computing. In research laboratory, Sun working stripped-down network computer simple-to-use information appliance, could cost little $200 given away part subscription service. The concept AOL's Internet medium electronic commerce service could delivered many home today many people still shun expense difficulty using personal computer. The appliance would mainly receiver screen, computing power residing vast central computer serving information user request tapping button. Sun's technological specialty kind centralized network computing. If long-term AOL-Sun vision ever materialized certainly three-to-five year bet, least could give company boost technological independence Microsoft. Microsoft Corp. argued federal court Monday proposed acquisition Netscape Communications Corp. America Online seriously undermined government's antitrust suit software giant. From legal standpoint, proposed deal pull rug government, William Neukom, Microsoft's senior vice president legal affair, said Monday morning courthouse step. The reasoning assertion, Microsoft say, proposed deal demonstrates Netscape larger software industry healthy vibrant illegal anti-competitive practice alleged government's suit. But David Boies, government's lead attorney, said irrelevant. Whatever deal end end deal going remove obstacle Microsoft placed path competition industry, said. Michael Lacovara, Microsoft lawyer questioning government witness, economist Frederick Warren-Boulton, suggested trial Monday proposed acquisition undermined Warren-Boulton's argument, Microsoft seems headed obtaining monopoly Internet browser software match one apparently hold operating system. After all, 22 percent Americans use Internet reach America Online. And present AOL us Microsoft's Web browser, Internet Explorer, service's default choice. In exchange that, Microsoft place AOL advertisement Internet link Windows 98. Lacovara asked witness whether, AOL's service contract expires January, would expect AOL continue distribute Microsoft software. Yes, Warren-Boulton responded. It clear AOL's incentive changed proposed merger Netscape. He noted America Online official said need online service featured Windows forced accept Microsoft term establishing Internet Explorer default choice. Lacovara asked Warren-Boulton question lay entire cross-examination witness Microsoft's larger assertion Monday proposed Netscape-AOL deal. Surely combination, asked, tell something nature competition software industry? Warren-Boulton's answer probably one Lacovara after. To extent potential merger result Microsoft's action exclusive contract action, said, unfortunate see disappearance firm Netscape, brightest, newest star. Warren-Boulton's purpose stand government establish Microsoft monopoly operating-system software; 90 percent world's computer use Microsoft operating system. That foundation government's case federal antitrust law forbids certain behavior monopolist would legal firm face healthy competition. Through repeated, circumlocutious questioning, Lacovara tried make case Microsoft's overwhelming market share ephemeral. The software industry vibrant fast moving, suggested, Microsoft could toppled position moment point view company encourages employee. On Friday Monday, Lacovara repeatedly pointed company placing operating system market, software company principally Microsoft's greatest rival writing software new system. But Warren-Boulton argued existence fringe competitor operating system market mean way Microsoft monopoly power. On Monday afternoon, Lacovara made issue success Apple Computer Co. selling new iMac computer. He entered evidence Apple news release issued last month showing, thing, 12.5 percent people buying Apple's new iMac computer previously owned Windows machine. Apple computer use different operating system, Mac-OS. The outcome Microsoft antitrust case may long way off, one thing already clear: This first major e-mail trial. The government's prosecution Microsoft Corp.'s defense, striking degree, legal campaign waged electronic message. The human testimony pale next e-mail evidence. On stand videotaped testimony, people questioned shrug, mumble forget. The e-mail alive idea competitive zeal, punctuated profanity exclamation point. The second week trial ended prosecutor frustrated lengthy cross-examination Microsoft's lead lawyer left time government show several hour videotaped deposition Bill Gates, Microsoft chairman. With new witness, executive Apple Computer Inc., taking stand Monday, uncertain Gates tape played. The Justice Department 20 state suing Microsoft believe tape strengthen case show Gates saying involved plan take government alleges illegal step stifle competition Internet software market. The Gates videotape, said David Boies, Justice Department's trial lawyer, offer opportunity judge Gates' credibility. But Gates credibility gap, one, becomes issue videotape taped remark compared contrasted e-mail wrote received. The e-mail record, government insists, show Gates waist-deep plotting anti-competitive deal bullying tactic denies professes never heard taped deposition. If machination central government's case, summon Gates trial? The government need put Gates stand, e-mail memoranda, Stephen Houck, lawyer state, told court. The Microsoft legal team month preparing e-mail defense. First, Microsoft argues, anything look damaging taken context. I urge honor, John Warden, Microsoft's lead lawyer, told Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson, view considerable skepticism crazy quilt e-mail fragment seem form core government's case. But Microsoft also mounted e-mail counterattack, culled million message obtained subpoena competitor pretrial discovery. Warden's cross-examination ritual present government witness internal e-mail company pose declaration question. These interrogation two refrains: Isn't true company exactly accusing Microsoft doing, true Microsoft prevailed predatory monopolist superior technology? Microsoft accused trying prod company stay way. So last week, example, Warden produced e-mail Stephen Case, chairman America Online, suggesting partnership Netscape Communications Corp. company would focus respective strength. That division labor, Case wrote, would best way achieve goal Marc Andreessen, Netscape's cofounder, described earlier e-mail beating Beast From Redmond want see u dead reference Microsoft's headquarters Redmond, Wash. Printouts e-mail another form written communication. By 1920s, typewriter became common, typed memoranda started used court case. From 1950s 1980s, legal expert say, explosion documentation fueled new technology electric typewriter, photocopying fax machine, personal computer. And e-mail, add, played important role legal inquiry year, Iran-contra case 1980s e-mail found Oliver North's computer proved crucial. But Microsoft case result sweeping government antitrust investigation high-technology company e-mail supplanted telephone common instrument communication. E-mail revolutionized investigation kind, one senior Justice Department official said. While investigation, Microsoft handed government estimated 30 million document, mostly e-mail. In trial, two side submitted 3,000 exhibit, mainly e-mail. And e-mail, people communicate frankly informally writing letter report tap out, punch button gone cyberspace. But e-mail communication documentary evidence, legal case provides rich, contemporaneous record people thinking planning time. It sharp contrast formal oral testimony, coached lawyer crafted selective memory. The e-mail record certainly make I-don't-recall line response harder sustain, said Robert Litan, former senior official Justice Department's antitrust division Brookings Institution. It also powerful ammunition pointing contradiction testimony. And government attacking Gates' credibility videotaped deposition, taken three day August. The government offered glimpse strategy first day trial. It showed brief clip point deposition Gates asked meeting June 21, 1995, which, government alleges, Microsoft offered divide browser market Netscape make investment company, chief rival market. In taped deposition, Gates say recalled asked one subordinate whether thought made sense invest Netscape. He said asked June 1995 meeting replied, I see something made sense. But e-mail May 31, 1995, Gates urged alliance Netscape. We could pay money part deal, wrote, buying piece something. The contradiction Gates' deposition e-mail, though, speak issue whether Microsoft made illegal offer Netscape. To sure, Microsoft said e-mail communication count most. But e-mail look bad get record, end Microsoft's lawyer going spend much trial trying explain away, said Stephen Axinn, leading antitrust litigator firm Axinn, Veltrop &AMP; Harkrider New York. America Online built potent force cyberspace largely appealing family chatty teen-agers want flirt online adult looking easy way send electronic mail checking weather sport score. Now, company get serious win heart mind corporate executive pin-stripe suit. Nearly lost complexity America Online's deal buy Netscape Communication Corp. America Online's announcement enter entirely new market: working computer screen help company open operate online store. Netscape already created software made player providing support already known electronic commerce. But America Online say ambition offer much wider array software, consulting service online merchant. Most company sell consumer realize need get e-commerce space, said America Online president Robert Pittman news conference Tuesday. We see major business offering end-to-end solution. The market big growing bigger day. Forrester Research estimate $325 million spent year electronic commerce software another $5.3 billion service range graphic design turn-key operation entire online store. By 2002, Forrester estimate, combined market electronic commerce service software top $35 billion. E-commerce service silver bullet enable company able take advantage true business opportunity Web, said Traci Gere, analyst International Data Corp. The market growing rapidly, fragmented. Analysts say leader today e-commerce service IBM, full line offering sophisticated software product hand-holding consulting. Other competitor include well-known information technology consulting company Andersen Consulting, spin-off Arthur Andersen accounting firm; Electronic Data Systems, run computer system big company, PricewaterhouseCoopers, offer accounting consulting separately one umbrella. Software company Microsoft Netscape sell packaged program, typically little consulting help customer use them. There also plenty new company sprouted provide electronic commerce service. Some, Agency.Com Organic Online, started basically advertising design firm. Others, including U S Web Viant, emphasized programming consulting. In fact, two strain blurring together, exemplified U S Web's pending merger CKS Group. America Online argues advantage increasingly crowded bazaar ability combine broad subscriber base 15 million customer Netscape software, hardware Sun Microsystems, joined America Online's venture electronic commerce engineering. This first time anyone put true end-to-end solution start silicon end audience, said Barry Schuler, America Online's president interactive service. We start Sun's line server, commerce tool build store, support service process order deal online real estate drive traffic. Despite advantage Netscape Sun bring, analyst say America Online face variety problem new quest. Chief whether appear consistency, focus follow-through corporate customer demand. AOL first company come mind come business-quality software, said Robert Chatham, senior analyst Forrester Research. Its decision keep Netscape separate unit offer electronic commerce service partnership Sun enhance credibility, Chatham said. America Online look homogenous vendor, added. It look customer tangle menage trois AOL, Netscape Sun. Nor Internet service provider telecommunications-oriented company shown much evidence, Ms. Gere International Data said, capable offering highly specific customized service big corporate client demand. Telecommunications company try thing efficiently large number customer able offer customized one-to-one relationship, said. Pittman said America Online driven e-commerce business company approached wanting sell good needed help simply advertising online. We finding people expert running bricks-and-mortar store limited infrastructure, said. They online store, square footage small.

America Online, Schuler said, emphasize service relate marketing rather back-office function. We consult merchandise sell online, said. We understand consumer piece puzzle. Some competitor worry America Online's electronic commerce service may simply device sell software hardware. The challenge prove client getting best possible solution business, said Robert Gett, chief executive Viant. If offer AOL Netscape Sun, answer bit tainted. Netscape expanding force 700 people provide consulting custom programming. But competitive, Gett said, competing nuts-and-bolts project rather lucrative assignment develop carry full-fledged strategy Web. They say, `Who know software better Netscape?' Gett said. We help customer decide platform best them. But America Online argues combined might it, Netscape Sun business need.

Now, company get serious win heart mind corporate executive pin-stripe suit. Nearly lost complexity America Online's deal buy Netscape Communication Corp. America Online's announcement enter entirely new market: working computer screen help company open operate online store. Netscape already created software made player providing support already known electronic commerce. But America Online say ambition offer much wider array software, consulting service online merchant. Most company sell consumer realize need get e-commerce space, said America Online president Robert Pittman news conference Tuesday. We see major business offering end-to-end solution. The market big growing bigger day. Forrester Research estimate $325 million spent year electronic commerce software another $5.3 billion service range graphic design turn-key operation entire online store. By 2002, Forrester estimate, combined market electronic commerce service software top $35 billion. E-commerce service silver bullet enable company able take advantage true business opportunity Web, said Traci Gere, analyst International Data Corp. The market growing rapidly, fragmented. Analysts say leader today e-commerce service IBM, full line offering sophisticated software product hand-holding consulting. Other competitor include well-known information technology consulting company Andersen Consulting, spin-off Arthur Andersen accounting firm; Electronic Data Systems, run computer system big company, PricewaterhouseCoopers, offer accounting consulting separately one umbrella. Software company Microsoft Netscape sell packaged program, typically little consulting help customer use them. There also plenty new company sprouted provide electronic commerce service. Some, Agency.Com Organic Online, started basically advertising design firm. Others, including U S Web Viant, emphasized programming consulting. In fact, two strain blurring together, exemplified U S Web's pending merger CKS Group. America Online argues advantage increasingly crowded bazaar ability combine broad subscriber base 15 million customer Netscape software, hardware Sun Microsystems, joined America Online's venture electronic commerce engineering. This first time anyone put true end-to-end solution start silicon end audience, said Barry Schuler, America Online's president interactive service. We start Sun's line server, commerce tool build store, support service process order deal online real estate drive traffic. Despite advantage Netscape Sun bring, analyst say America Online face variety problem new quest. Chief whether appear consistency, focus follow-through corporate customer demand. AOL first company come mind come business-quality software, said Robert Chatham, senior analyst Forrester Research. Its decision keep Netscape separate unit offer electronic commerce service partnership Sun enhance credibility, Chatham said. America Online look homogenous vendor, added. It look customer tangle menage trois AOL, Netscape Sun. Nor Internet service provider telecommunications-oriented company shown much evidence, Ms. Gere International Data said, capable offering highly specific customized service big corporate client demand.

America Online verge agreeing purchase Netscape Communications Corp., Internet pioneer center government's antitrust suit Microsoft Corp., executive involved talk said Sunday. The proposed deal complex, three-way transaction involving AOL, Netscape Sun Microsystems Inc. AOL, leading on-line service 14 million subscriber, would acquire Netscape's popular site World Wide Web software business. But part deal, AOL would also enter joint marketing development partnership Sun Microsystems strengthen Netscape's business selling large corporation heavy-duty software needed serve Web page Internet technology many thousand user time. The purchase, exchange AOL share Netscape stock, valued roughly $4 billion. A completed deal could announced soon Monday morning. But executive involved talk cautioned Sunday night detail remained negotiated. The Netscape deal, consummated, would realign three business forefront modern economy on-line service, Internet software electronic commerce. It would strengthen two Microsoft's leading rival, AOL Sun Microsystems. At time, however, would subsume Netscape, Internet software maker regarded serious challenger Microsoft's dominance personal computer software market. Netscape, founded 1994, struggled last 18 month assault Microsoft. Its Navigator runaway leader market browser software used navigate World Wide Web. But Microsoft, responding Internet revolution, entered market aggressively, quickly matching quality Netscape's technology bundling Microsoft browser, Internet Explorer, industry-standard Windows operating system giving away free. Earlier year, Netscape announced layoff started distributing Navigator free well, Microsoft steadily gained browser market. Since then, Netscape focused mainly two business advertising transaction fee Netcenter Web site selling industrial-strength software corporation building Internet site conduct electronic commerce. AOL belief expertise increase revenue Netscape's Web site and, helped Sun's programmer vast corporate sale force, accelerate Netscape's software sale well, executive involved negotiation said. Sun's version Unix, Solaris, popular operating system large, powerful computer run Netscape's server software. This deal would insure fundamental element Netscape survive bigger company drive technology forward, said David B. Yoffie, professor Harvard business school co-author Michael A. Cusumano Massachusetts Institute Technology recent book, Competing Internet Time: Lessons Netscape Its Battle Microsoft. The impact deal, any, government's antitrust suit Microsoft uncertain. It appear support key theme Microsoft's defense namely, operates fast-moving industry corporate alliance shift time. Thus, Microsoft argues, antitrust policy tread gently. But deal, government official insist, direct effect current case. No matter much alliance shift, affect central fact Microsoft's monopoly used abused market power protect monopoly, said David Boies, Justice Department's lead trial lawyer Microsoft case. Executives representing Netscape, AOL Sun Microsystems government witness Microsoft trial. And serious merger talk Netscape Chief Executive Officer James Barksdale AOL Chairman Steve Case began month ago, start Microsoft trial, according people close talk. Industry analyst suggest company may emboldened take stronger anti-Microsoft step based partly perception antitrust case would weaken Microsoft. And representative Kleiner Perkins Caufield &AMP; Byers, Silicon Valley venture capital firm regarded power broker Microsoft's rival, sit board Netscape, Sun AOL. Stock price vaulted record level Monday, furthering recovery recently two month ago seemed nearly unthinkable. I thought serious correction 1990, I never thought wrote bull market over, said Byron Wien, US. equity strategist Morgan Stanley Dean Witter &AMP; Co. Now seems u. The Dow Jones industrial average rose 214.72 point, 2.34 percent, 9,37427. The record first July 17, Dow closed 9,33797. Since Aug. 31, Dow stood 7,539.07 steep slide, blue-chip gauge risen 24 percent. For year, Dow 18.54 percent chance rising 20 percent fourth consecutive year, something never accomplished before. Broader average also climbed. The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock index set record, rising 24.66 point, 2.12 percent, 1,18821.

The merger announcement prompted investor change estimate much company worth also indicated coming decline outstanding share stock. This may supply-demand story, demand stock rising supply stock reduced one company another merges, said Hugh Johnson, chief investment officer First Albany Corp. The flow money mutual fund fairly strong, pressure manager put money work. Two deal seemed catalyst broad swath stock. News Bankers Trust may close accepting $8.9 billion offer Deutsche Bank Germany heightened interest financial-services bank stock. And word America Online may acquire Netscape Communications $4 billion stock powered Internet technology stock loftier valuation. Among financial company, JP. Morgan gained 6 1/16, 115 11/16.

Yahoo rose 30 7/16, 221 7/16. And Amazon.com gained 37 3/8, 218. The performance Internet stock unsettling sign, Wien said. Still, more-established technology share also good day. IBM rose 7, 166 5/8. Microsoft jumped 5 9/16, 119 3/16. And Intel closed 113 9/16, 1{. After Monday's big price move, Wien said according calculation, stock 10 percent overvalued. By contrast, middle July market 20 percent overvalued, said. Nonetheless, market's recovery, buttressed three cut interest rate Federal Reserve Board, left many longtime Wall Street hand grasping historical parallel. At point new ground, said Laszlo Birinyi, head market research firm. At beginning year, I said target Dow 10,000 end 1998. If anyone asked market went look corrective blip, I would said new target would 9,000. I surprised 10,000 figure came back table year. The New York Times said editorial Wednesday, Nov. 25: America Online's effort acquire Netscape set partnership Sun Microsystems reminder rapidly corporate landscape change fast-moving technical field. But lessen need Justice Department vigorously pursue antitrust suit Microsoft, dominant player software. The department presented solid evidence Microsoft used monopoly operating system muscle rival partner head competition software realm. The Internet risen quickly information medium four year ago, book The Road Ahead, Bill Gates scarcely mention it. In addition, couple year ago America Online, world's biggest online service, much trouble getting rid bug system widely derided America On Hold. Now Microsoft moved aggressively Internet Justice Department accusing predatory behavior, America Online rocketed forward make deal Internet player. In antitrust suit Microsoft, federal government charge company illegally bundled browser Windows operating system smother Netscape's chance marketing browser. Now corridor antitrust trial Microsoft's lawyer maintain Netscape found new partner America Online need protection government. But could easily argued Microsoft bludgeoned Netscape dissolution, forcing distress sale America Online. Nor clear customer America Online choose Netscape's browser vehicle buying selling Internet. Even newly musclebound form, America Online remains dependent Microsoft's good favorable placement AOL icon main desktop screen. It may that, year hence, America Online, Netscape Sun put together alternative mean Internet telephone line, cable like. But day, fairness requires Justice Department action insure Microsoft use current position thwart consumer choice. Only company know get product consumer incentive innovate turn Internet revolutionary medium promise be. \n","President Leonid Kuchma called Friday corrections Ukraine's program market reforms, pledged reforms would continue. Kuchma elaborate comments group Ukrainian economists, saying changes necessary country's economic problems. Kuchma urged economists come recommendations national meeting economists November, Interfax news agency reported. Ukraine suffered economic problems 1991 collapse Soviet Union especially hard hit financial crisis neighboring Russia, main trading partner. The Russian crisis hurt bilateral trade, caused Ukrainian currency fall led withdrawal investors Ukraine. In recent months, Kuchma implemented economic reforms decree, prompting International Monetary Fund release first installment long-awaited dlrs 2.2 billion loan. Many reforms, however, remain stalled. National Bank chairman Viktor Yushchenko Washington week consultations IMF officials. Yushchenko warned bank would spend dwindling reserves support hryvna currency, avoided comments currency recent days. Kuchma met Friday Yushchenko, Prime Minister Valery Pustovoitenko senior officials discuss ways stabilize hryvna. The government's press service said focused possible ways keep hryvna 3.5 U.S. dollar end year. The hryvna trading 3.4 dollar recent days trading limited. There wide expectations Ukraine hryvna fall further, Ukrainians stocking food, clothing household goods fast-devaluing money. When world's finance ministers central bankers gathered last year Hong Kong, nervously congratulated containing  least moment  nasty financial brush fire Asia. In year's time, many predicted hallway chatter, troubles Thailand Indonesia would look replay Mexico 1995  rough bump road world enjoying remarkable prosperity. Talk bad market calls. Twelve months later, financial mandarins clog Washington limousines glide endless receptions annual meeting International Monetary Fund World Bank, everything could gone wrong world economy has: worst downturn Japan World War II, economic meltdown Russia, depression Indonesia plunging 100 million people poverty line, deep fears happens next Latin America. What makes year's IMF meeting remarkable, though, harshest criticisms directed monetary fund itself, and, extension, U.S. Treasury, viewed power IMF. This year, place confident predictions, mutual recriminations. Arguments breaking whether true culprits crony capitalists weakened leaders Russian President Boris Yeltsin, huge investors poured money world's emerging markets reckless abandon mid-1990s panicked twelve months. Whatever reason, one reality prevails: Hundreds billions dollars fled economies four continents  seeking safest havens possible, United States  money returning anytime soon. And subtext every seminar capital flows every conclave nervous ministers painfully blunt questions: Can stopped? Or world headed global recession? Fifty-three years ago IMF created Bretton Woods conference sought stabilize world economy secure peace World War II. Now attack sides, charged worsening bad situation misjudging economics, politically tone-deaf volatile capitals world, Jakarta, Indonesia, Moscow. For first time, disturbing questions whether institution still capable, financially politically, containing kind economic contagion caught world unaware. Once, IMF's critics largely found Africa South Asia, fund viewed arrogant; today include Wall Street's biggest players top officials powerful economies Asia Europe. Only  including former Secretary State George Schultz members Congress increasingly suspicious international institutions  talking scrapping IMF altogether. But almost everyone talking creating new financial architecture old one clearly cannot: smother financial wildfires leap globe. President Clinton, British Prime Minister Tony Blair leaders, months silence, edged debate, cases wresting issue first time finance ministers central banks. Their fear, advisers say, 15 months financial turmoil threatening political stability. Such concerns turned year's meeting tumbled mass worries groping short long-term solutions. The Japanese, French, Southeast Asians arriving Washington different diagnoses went wrong, different solutions set right. The United States set plans, mix suggestions force disclosure financial data countries world impose American-style financial standards regulation. Meanwhile, ideological argument breaking whether world slow long march free open markets  strategy pressed Clinton administration six years. Others argue unwise start rebuilding hospital patients still operating tables. Last year standard answer us given came this: `We IMF World Bank, know best,' Indonesian Foreign Minister Ali Alatas said breakfast Washington day, reflecting crisis turned 30 years astounding growth country overnight depression. Then said everything went wrong fault, said. But now, I think people know much problem came outside, need something better. And IMF beginning fight back, awkward role institution dominated Ph.D. economists unaccustomed openly challenged. Every place turn read story, came in, made things worse, said Stanley Fischer, deputy managing director fund, born Northern Rhodesia  Zambia  became chairman Massachusetts Institute Technology's economics department taking job put center financial storm. We frequently get blame, well-deserved, said. But politically convenient governments world cry, `The IMF made us it,' pin mistakes us. That's fine. We'd rather loved, we'd effective. MISCALCULATIONS, POLITICS AND SAFETY NETS On steaming January day, Michel Camdessus, IMF's top official, slipped Jakarta private residence President Suharto sat four-hour meeting tick off, line line, huge reforms Indonesia would implement return tens billions dollars emergency aid. Two previous deals collapsed Suharto ignored fund's conditions, Camdessus insisted strike deal directly Suharto, Asia's longest-serving leader. It meeting men knew different worlds power politics: Suharto rose general central Java, Camdessus detonated mines Algeria French army entering French Treasury way becoming head France's central bank. It there, senior IMF official recalled. He told dismantle national airplane project, clove monopoly, distribution monopolies. At one point, Camdessus looked impassive Suharto said, You see means family, reference vast investments country's key industries. He said, `I called children, understand.' But months, exchange Jakarta came symbolize IMF's twin troubles: Its inability understand reckon national politics countries need radical reform, focus economic stabilization rather social costs actions. Suharto intention fulfilling agreement. It was, one former Cabinet members said, delaying move obvious everyone Camdessus. Perhaps one reason IMF sometimes appears tone-deaf senior staff almost entirely composed Ph.D. economists. There officials deep experience international politics, much less complexities Javanese culture work Indonesia. Historically, experts politics security gravitated United Nations, development experts World Bank, economists IMF  creating dangerous gaps crisis one. As result, fund rudimentary understanding would happen demands met Indonesia's state monopolies quickly dissolved. While system lined pockets Suhartos friends, also distributed food, gasoline staples country stretches 3,000 miles thousands islands. To help balance budget, fund demanded quick end expensive subsidies keep price food gasoline artificially low. But that, combined huge currency devaluation sparked crisis, resulted high prices shortages fueled riots continue day, millions Indonesians lose jobs. The IMF  unintentionally, officials insist  also sped Suharto's resignation, insisting elimination crony capitalism, code words removing Suharto family center economy. Ultimately, may prove Indonesia's salvation, new government contain rioting ethnic Chinese minority  whose money desperately needed country's fast-shrinking economy. It worth noting, Fischer said week, programs Asia  Indonesia, Korea Thailand  took hold change government. Nonetheless, Indonesia experience revived argument IMF focused stabilizing banks currencies, preventing capital flight freeing markets, blind social costs actions. Among toughest critics sister institution, World Bank, whose main charge alleviating poverty. You've seen tension almost every day, one senior World Bank official said recently. The bank gone extraordinary lengths recent months differentiate role fund, announce tripling aid poorest countries hit economic chaos. Even U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan joined argument, warning speech Harvard recently globalization succeed, must succeed poor rich alike. It must deliver rights less riches. It must harnessed cause capital alone, development prosperity poorest world. IMF officials say changing strategies see exacting great social cost. It's difficult formula get exactly right, Fischer said August, Russia teetering IMF sending $4.8 billion aid rapidly wasted. You need enough discipline send right message markets keep investors fleeing. But need enough leeway keep people suffering otherwise would. In recent months, noted, IMF allowed spending sustain subsidies basic goods longer periods Indonesia, Korea elsewhere. There new flexibility IMF senior Indonesian official concluded recently. It lot better. A U.S. PAWN, OR A RUNAWAY AGENCY? The Clinton administration admits IMF many failings, many display year. But insists world gone global financial crises IMF century  result 1930s. I doubt situation year would much worse  greater devaluations, defaults, contagion, greater trade dislocations  program agreed IMF finance provided, Deputy Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers told Congress last week. Many Republicans Democrats unconvinced. Even though Senate overwhelmingly approved $18 billion contribution fund help fight new crises, House defeated measure two weeks ago. The fund's last hope getting money, free nearly $100 billion contributions nations waiting United States act, come House Senate try resolve budget differences conference committee next 10 days. A rejection, Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin insists, would send message world United States turning back one institution charged restoring economic stability. Everywhere else world, though, politicians businessmen insist one biggest problems IMF that, contrary view Congress, acts U.S. Treasury's lap dog. Ask Jakarta Moscow, response same: The IMF never ventures far looking back approving nod master. When United States weighs in, however, IMF called rescue country deep trouble. Only IMF  U.S. Treasury  leverage extract commitments return billions aid. In theory, U.S. influence limited: It 18.5 percent vote fund. Germany, Japan, France Britain 5 percent each. But practice United States gets way, exercising influence scenes, interactions Fischer Summers. The two met Fischer MIT faculty Summers graduate student taking one classes, later becoming colleague MIT. Each served chief economist World Bank. It Summers instrumental placing Fischer fund's no. 2 job, days talk constantly. It's warm relationship, Fischer said summer. Remember, job cannot turn outsiders advice  can't call chief economist Wall Street firm, many academic friends, many issues confidential. The Treasury's relations Camdessus strained plays role world diplomat, traveling globe trying coax political leaders. The tensions obvious start Asia crisis. The fund made little secret displeasure United States offering direct aid Thailand, major U.S. ally, sign support confidence. Mindful backlash Congress Mexico bailed U.S. money, last thing Treasury planned do. Summers, turn, thought fund forcing Thais implement reform commitments rigorously enough disclose true financial picture. Within U.S. government dissension: The State Defense Departments felt United States Thailand, backed Treasury asked would pony aid budgets. There conflicts. When Japan used last IMF meeting propose setting $100 billion Asia Fund  one would exclude United States would probably offer aid much relaxed conditions IMF does. Rubin called Camdessus breakfast one morning told Japanese proposal would undercut IMF's authority. We've dispute Michel, Rubin reported aides returned orange juice croissant. One shot back: And 8 a.m. Camdessus backed Rubin's insistence walked away money Asia could used. Japan says back similar proposal weekend, time $30 billion fund. Camdessus also rankled U.S. officials statements amounted cheerleading reassure markets  sometimes face facts. In June, Russia way collapse, Camdessus declared contrary markets commentators imagining slow collapse Russia's economy, crisis. This major development. The bailouts Russia South Korea prime examples Washington muscles IMF's turf soon major U.S. strategic interests involved. Last Christmas, South Korea slipped days running hard currency pay debts December, sent secret envoy, Kim Kihwan, work rescue package. I bother going IMF, Kim recalled recently. I called Summers' office Treasury home Seoul, flew Washington went directly there. I knew would get done. Within days Treasury dispatched David Lipton, experienced veteran emergency bailouts, leaving post undersecretary international affairs month, shadow IMF staff's negotiations government Seoul. Fischer displeased. To make negotiation effective, clear authority negotiating, said. WHO LOST RUSSIA? The pattern repeated summer, United States raced put together $17 billion package Russia. The IMF's staff Moscow declared Russia needed money  needed enact policies would restore confidence investors. The Americans Germans came different conclusion. Soon after, U.S. officials gathered White House situation room consider might happen Russia ruble devalued market reforms collapsed push IMF come emergency money. So fund began assembling last-ditch program prop country resisted reform plans seven years. Camdessus, though, still hesitant, questioning whether IMF risk scarce resources Russia. We pull Michel along, senior Treasury official recalled. As turned out, Camdessus' instincts right approach championed Rubin Summers proved disastrously wrong. The first installment payment  $4.8 billion  wasted, propping currency long enough, words one IMF official, let oligarchs get money country. Then Yeltsin reversed commitments, let ruble devalue anyway, began printing money abandon fired virtually every reformer government  resulting collapse IMF agreements indefinite suspension aid program. Now, IMF Capitol Hill, recriminations lost Russia. Publicly, Fischer argues apologies owed attempted Russia. But IMF officials complain privately let Rubin Summers run roughshod them, striking deal fell apart weeks Russian parliament rebelled Yeltsin backed away commitments. Summers responds United States took calculated risk vastly better Russia succeed succeed. The Russian collapse touched new rounds economic contagion, investors fleeing Latin America, triggering huge losses hedge funds Long Term Capital, Greenwich, Conn., investment firm needed rescued Wall Street powerhouses whose money invested. Russia turning point, said Robert Hormats, vice chairman Goldman, Sachs &AMP; Co. It made world realize countries fail, IMF Treasury intercede. And changed perception risk. Now, countries meet face future IMF warned could bleak, need reverse perceptions, watch countries slowly starve lack capital. The emerging markets calling controls short term investments. The French want stronger IMF. The Americans say answer disclosure, investors better warned, tougher regulation. These nice, quiet meetings; everyone polite, top U.S. official said earlier week. Not year. Ukraine's parliament Friday refused approve President Leonid Kuchma's decree establishing state fund compensate people savings lost banks. Deputies voted 240-47 prepare revised version decree debate later month. They must consider decree Oct. 10, else automatically takes effect constitution. Leftist factions, voted proposed legislation, said would fully guarantee return savings lost financial instability recently hit Ukraine. The fund Kuchma proposed establish would accumulated money special National Bank account repay people case bank kept savings went bankrupt became insolvent. Although decree provided compensation deposits amounting 500 hryvna (dlrs 147 current exchange rate), authors said would cover 90 percent Ukrainians keep money banks. The measure meant prevent mass withdrawals deposits Ukrainian banks already experienced people, scared fall national currency turmoil neighboring Russia, started stock food, clothing household goods. Government officials say Ukrainians recently withdrawn least 10 percent 3 billion hryvna (dlrs 882 million) deposited banks. Russia's new prime minister picked unusual way reassure nation Thursday. After two weeks deliberations announced still plan rescue country economic crisis. I want repeat  program, Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov said. It worked out. In nations statement might provoke alarm. But Primakov seeking calm anxious public worried Kremlin's cure could worse disease. It Russians something concerned about. Thursday Primakov convened meeting top aides try hammer strategy overcoming economic woes. A main item agenda plan drafted Yuri Maslyukov, Communist government's senior policy maker economic issues. It take long Maslyukov's plan hit street. A newspaper, Kommersant Daily, published full Thursday morning. Not surprisingly Maslyukov's plan calls greater state role economy, including controls hard currency. A new State Bank Reconstruction Development would established using nationalized assets failed commercial banks. Wages pensions would paid two months, minimum wage would indexed inflation. There would huge tax cuts, combination suggested government committed printing additional money. The exchange rate ruble would set central bank, based changes inflation balance payments. Maslyukov's plan also implies Russians would able buy dollars exchanges country. It stipulates hard currency could enter country special authorization. Exporters would required sell hard currency reserves. That allusion currency controls sent shock waves Russian public. Russians come treat dollar second currency, many people squirreled away dollars hedge inflation. It obvious stupidity, Otto Latsis, commentator newspaper Noviye Izvestiya, said. People give dollars away. They go black market need to. Yegor Gaidar, former prime minister favors free markets, said plan war dollar predicted would lead shortage imports. As criticism grew, Primakov rushed distance talk currency controls. The rumors state's becoming monopolist inflow hard currency country nonsense, said, asserting document published Kommersant Daily one six possible plans. Primakov may opposed wildly unpopular currency controls. He may worried plan would would set panic buying dollars, depressing ruble. Or may simply trying keep distance Maslyukov's plan Russia tries wrangle next disbursement, $4.3 billion, International Monetary Fund. The particulars could modified, many people maneuvering say believe represents basic thrust government's thinking. Primakov called greater state regulation expansion money supply, two themes Maslyukov's plan. The plan also many similarities plan presented government Gorbachev-era advisers. We think close final document, said United Financial Group, Russian investment business. It unclear long Primakov carry spelling detailed strategy. The ousted tax chief, Boris Fyodorov, argued IMF provide aid Primakov taken tough measures build free market. Primakov has, however, sought turn logic head, arguing government's economic strategy depend fund's willingness provide aid. His aim appears pressure fund implying fund's fault Russia forced default loans take draconian measures home. Or Primakov put Thursday, fund's money, Russia impose unpopular measures. Wall Street extended global stock selloff Thursday Dow industrials tumbling 200 points second straight day.

The United States disappointed economic confusion new Russian government Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov, said Secretary State Madeleine Albright Friday, warned Russia dangers anti-Western policy. In first comprehensive review U.S.-Russian relations Primakov confirmed prime minister last month, Albright said Washington deeply concerned Russia's direction think crisis would soon abate. We heard lot talk recent days printing new money, indexing wages, imposing price capital controls restoring state management parts economy, told U.S.-Russia Business Council Chicago. We wonder members Primakov's team understand basic arithmetic global economy. While praising Primakov, counterpart foreign minister, pragmatist able cooperate key issues Washington, harsh words warning him.

The United States must keep aid Russia adjusting promote building democracy student exchanges well arms control, Albright said. Washington favor direct aid. More big bailouts going restore investor confidence Russia, said. In long run, gap Russia's needs resources must met foreign bailouts foreign investment. Albright sharply criticized self-defeating many voices Russia want shift emphasis Russia's interaction America allies one partnership one assertiveness, opposition defiance stake. Russia could stand alone world, said, United States' ability help Russians help go merely very, difficult absolutely impossible. At time, said, Washington would assume worst, still plenty people Russia fight turning back clock. And urged world  American critics  patient workings democratic process Russia start day taking census reformers Kremlin, census American officials promoted President Boris Yeltsin dismissed previous government. While Moscow may continue oppose NATO use force Serbian forces southern province Kosovo, Albright said, NATO must prepared act regardless. If Communist Party way  planning months  millions Russians take streets Wednesday biggest demonstrations years. But Communists politicians Communist stamp approval running country economy question marchers demonstrating against. President Boris Yeltsin economic advisers easy targets two months ago. But Yeltsin seems shadow today, advisers gone. The Communists, undergone sort resurgence playing discontent, working hard cast outsiders government help run  keep focus protests Wednesday Yeltsin policies. Even strategy may backfire, however, discontent Yeltsin necessarily translate support predecessors. An adviser Communist Party leader, Gennadi Zyuganov, made headlines long ago called new government bourgeois. The characterization striking, new prime minister, Yevgeny Primakov, one Zyuganov's top choices post. The deputy prime minister charge economy, Yuri Maslyukov, Communist Party figure headed Gosplan, infamous central-planning program helped bring Soviet Union ruin. We slogans aimed government, first secretary Moscow Communist Party committee, Alexander Kuvayev, said recent interview. All slogans aimed president economic course country. Only president fully blamed course brought country situation. Anger Russia's fate, own, drawing Russians back Soviet-style slogans old-style hostility capitalism. The ardently pro-Communist newspaper Sovietskaya Rossiya devoted front page Thursday said results contest readers protest slogans. The entries ranged catchy kitschy, from, Legislator, official, banker  study Constitution; exam Oct. 7, to,  Imperialist! Help Russia return exported capital, pay debts once. Russia seen nothing approaching sort economic chaos despair 1993, hyperinflation swept economy. There real way knowing whether latest travails produce huge ugly crowds small, peaceful ones. A deputy editor political analyst newsweekly, Itogi, Masha Lipman, said situation 1993, Yeltsin sought, won, popular mandate referendum. He used dissolve Communist-dominated Parliament increase power. That led autumn showdown, shelling Parliament tanks total defeat, time being, Yeltsin's legislative opponents. You interpret demonstration Communist mandate, I think act Yeltsin, Ms. Lipman said. Support Communists smallest level, maybe 20 percent. In survey 1,714 people released last week All-Russian Public Opinion Center said nearly half population supported idea demonstrations Yeltsin, barely one-tenth likely participate way. Nobody interested sort struggle, Yuri Levada, heads center, said interview. This mainly general expression great wave distrust authorities, mainly president. He's great scapegoat sins. There seems little enthusiasm demonstrations sort. Only thousand people turned Sunday fifth anniversary shelling Parliament Yeltsin's subsequent triumph Communists. The Communist Party Federation Independent Russian Unions, leftist organization says main sponsor protests, predict 9 million Russians participate Wednesday. The government vowed keep order resorting force. But concerned enough summoned 11,000 police officers patrol Moscow 6,000 military troops intervene violence erupts. Protests 1993 generally tepid, deep-seated feeling here. Some demonstrations last week, less practice runs, hinted similarly dampened marches year. President Boris Yeltsin would respond strongly effort prohibit Russians buying foreign currencies, believing move would bringing another Iron Curtain country, spokesman said Friday. The president clearly understands ban would clear violation rights ... would mean return Iron Curtain everyday life, said presidential spokesman Dmitry Yakushin. The remarks came media reports government economic plan works would prohibit Russians buying U.S. dollars foreign currencies, institute strict economic controls, rolling back seven years reforms. Though government officials say plan one six possibilities, Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov warned Thursday might forced take unpopular measures rescue Russian economy receive next installment dlrs 22.6 billion loan International Monetary Fund. Central Bank Chairman Viktor Gerashchenko Finance Minister Mikhail Zadornov flew Washington Friday negotiations IMF dlrs 4.3 billion installment. IMF officials said want Russian government come sound economic program loan given, made clear currency controls boosting money supply printing rubles acceptable. But Primakov said country's plan would dependent IMF loan, way around. No short-term economic plan known another three weeks, long IMF set make decision, said First Deputy Prime Minister Vadim Gustov. A draft version government's fourth-quarter budget would rely heavily IMF loan, Kommersant newspaper said. Without loan, government would engage major deficit spending. Calls Soviet-style controls  part plan drafted First Deputy Prime Minister Yuri Maslyukov leaked press  apparently created rift Cabinet. The plan drew heavy criticism Zadornov, Gerashchenko called idea banning foreign currency sales mad idea. Meanwhile, Russia's stock market dropped 5 percent 38.8 Friday, trading light downward move meant little. The stock market continued fall crisis hit Aug. 17. And tax collection September, result collapse Russia's banking system, said Alexander Pochinok, head government's finance credit department. Revenues totaled 14.3 billion rubles (dlrs 875 million), 700 million rubles (dlrs 43 million) less expected. The government wants reverse trend raising taxes oil gas companies, idea expected meet sharp resistance lower house Russia's parliament, wants cut tax rates, Pochinok said. Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov said Saturday economic crisis would bring end government's program privatizing state property. Privatization accomplished growth production, growth investment growth production effectiveness renewal major funds, Primakov said meeting Western businessmen. We shall conduct privatization serves interests people, state, business, said, according ITAR-Tass news agency. Primakov reassured businessmen, members prime minister's consultive council foreign investment Russia, government plans ban circulation U.S. dollars Russia. But, said, government would take steps staunch flow dollars Russia. Responding media reports government economic plan would prohibit Russians buying U.S. dollars foreign currency, Primakov said reports absolutely correspond reality, ITAR-Tass quoted saying. He said need regulate influx dollars Russia, government take steps prevent called dollar drain. Russian companies stashed dlrs 2.5 billion country September alone, Interfax news agency reported Friday, quoting central bank figures. Primakov said foreign investors force help Russia minimize losses current economic crisis. We much interested foreign investments, especially ones go real production sector, Primakov said, according Interfax. We need continuous dialogue foreign investors, difficult us overcome current difficulties. He said Russia wanted long-term investments. Foreign capital coming country short-term operations, Primakov said. This, said, liking yours. Viktor Gerashchenko, central bank chairman, said Friday government must act stem flow dollars Russia. Gerashchenko Finance Minister Mikhail Zadornov Washington Saturday annual meeting International Monetary Fund, plan spell measures Russia taking bail finance system. Russia wants IMF release second dlrs 4.3 billion installment loan approved July, month country's economy crashed government effectively defaulted foreign loans. IMF officials said want Russian government come sound economic program installment given, made clear currency controls boosting money supply printing rubles acceptable. In season crashing banks, plunging rubles, bouncing paychecks, failing cropsand rotating governments, maybe ultimate insult. But nation bore Tolstoy Chekhov, still regards well-written letter labor love, buckling little week, longer wish good health Baba Anya Omsk. The Post Office broke. In 60 country's 89 statelike regions, 1,000 mail cars sidetracked, many stuffed 18 tons letters, newspapers parcels. The state Railway Ministry refuses carry mail Post Office makes good 210 million rubles old bills  $13 million today's dollars, $35 million dollars six weeks ago. Air mail, amounts one every four five letters, also suspended one Moscow's major airports week, Post Office coughed 5 million rubles old bills. A second airport still demanding 3 million rubles past-due debts. So much mail backed post offices Moscow elsewhere simply stopped accepting out-of-town mail, areas easily reached truck. Delivery schedules fallen weeks, perhaps months, behind. The situation really extraordinary, said Vladimir Sherekhov, deputy chief mail service administration government's Communications Committee. We've never anything before. Maybe Post Office lucky. Extraordinary rule elsewhere Russia. Until Friday, lower house Parliament preparing sue government failure provide soap, heat, toilet paper copy-machine paper legislature's monumental downtown offices. It turned politicians exhausted funds cutting short recess returning address nation's economic crisis. Earlier week, officials said Russia's Arctic shipping routes may close next month half nation's icebreakers disrepair money fix them. The oldest ships ancient nickname Granny. Such anecdotal evidence Russia losing wheels, one old, ill-maintained Volga sedans, everywhere. But oddly, real signs public distress particularly common, perhaps system rarely seems shed part big postal system. If U.S. Postal Service increasingly pipeline sweepstakes notices bills, Russian Post Office still holds special place national conversation. Russians still write letters other, frequently fervently, many remote regions get news mail. Millions use mails ship canned goods provisions needy relatives friends faraway areas, especially vital service winter. And last years, Post Office become vehicle growing mail-order trade books, clothes catalog items readily available big cities. Exactly rumbled halt dispute. What clear Post Office Railway Ministry suffer ails every Russian venture, private public alike: Nobody pays bills. The state Railway Ministry complains continually stiffed customers believe railroads honor-bound carry freight whether paid not. The government specified nearly 40 categories freight railroads must carry next nothing. Among biggest deadbeats power ministries  military interior departments  pay Soviet times feel little need pay now. It's psychology formed socialist period, said Tatiana Pashkova, deputy spokeswoman ministry, situation exists Post Office. We've dispute long time. Always try understand differences. But can't carry cargo free. No kidding, says Post Office: It, too, owed 200 million rubles government agencies, barred raising rates though freight costs outstripping revenues. Moreover, Post Office also required government carry forms mail, pension checks, reduced rates. Officials state Communications Department say also suspect ulterior motive railroads' actions: struggle dominate thriving mail-order business. Here's competition us railroads delivery parcels, I think decisions made railroads mainly explained competition, Sherekhov said. They blame us carrying commercial cargoes instead mail. The Railways Ministry's spokeswoman, Ms. Pashkova, said commercial cargoes indeed problem, railroads know Post Office already gotten cash transport packages. The railroads still waiting share money, said. In meantime, situation come boil. In late September railroads cut mail service Moscow, effectively decapitating postal system forcing officials draft fleet trucks move letters city. Hundreds empty full rail cars clogged local yards point moving cars position unloading become difficult. At last count, 39 loaded cars awaiting service one yard. And customers getting angry. We've gotten kinds complaints, said Viktor Salikov, deputy Communications Department's mail shipping center. People coming us, searching mail sent weeks ago. \n","\n","\n","\n","President Leonid Kuchma called Friday correction Ukraine's program market reform, pledged reform would continue. Kuchma elaborate comment group Ukrainian economist, saying change necessary country's economic problem. Kuchma urged economist come recommendation national meeting economist November, Interfax news agency reported. Ukraine suffered economic problem 1991 collapse Soviet Union especially hard hit financial crisis neighboring Russia, main trading partner. The Russian crisis hurt bilateral trade, caused Ukrainian currency fall led withdrawal investor Ukraine. In recent month, Kuchma implemented economic reform decree, prompting International Monetary Fund release first installment long-awaited dlrs 2.2 billion loan. Many reform, however, remain stalled. National Bank chairman Viktor Yushchenko Washington week consultation IMF official. Yushchenko warned bank would spend dwindling reserve support hryvna currency, avoided comment currency recent day. Kuchma met Friday Yushchenko, Prime Minister Valery Pustovoitenko senior official discus way stabilize hryvna. The government's press service said focused possible way keep hryvna 3.5 US. dollar end year. The hryvna trading 3.4 dollar recent day trading limited. There wide expectation Ukraine hryvna fall further, Ukrainians stocking food, clothing household good fast-devaluing money. When world's finance minister central banker gathered last year Hong Kong, nervously congratulated containing least moment nasty financial brush fire Asia. In year's time, many predicted hallway chatter, trouble Thailand Indonesia would look replay Mexico 1995 rough bump road world enjoying remarkable prosperity. Talk bad market call. Twelve month later, financial mandarin clog Washington limousine glide endless reception annual meeting International Monetary Fund World Bank, everything could gone wrong world economy has: worst downturn Japan World War II, economic meltdown Russia, depression Indonesia plunging 100 million people poverty line, deep fear happens next Latin America. What make year's IMF meeting remarkable, though, harshest criticism directed monetary fund itself, and, extension, US. Treasury, viewed power IMF. This year, place confident prediction, mutual recrimination. Arguments breaking whether true culprit crony capitalist weakened leader Russian President Boris Yeltsin, huge investor poured money world's emerging market reckless abandon mid-1990s panicked twelve month. Whatever reason, one reality prevails: Hundreds billion dollar fled economy four continent seeking safest haven possible, United States money returning anytime soon. And subtext every seminar capital flow every conclave nervous minister painfully blunt questions: Can stopped? Or world headed global recession? Fifty-three year ago IMF created Bretton Woods conference sought stabilize world economy secure peace World War II. Now attack side, charged worsening bad situation misjudging economics, politically tone-deaf volatile capital world, Jakarta, Indonesia, Moscow. For first time, disturbing question whether institution still capable, financially politically, containing kind economic contagion caught world unaware. Once, IMF's critic largely found Africa South Asia, fund viewed arrogant; today include Wall Street's biggest player top official powerful economy Asia Europe. Only including former Secretary State George Schultz member Congress increasingly suspicious international institution talking scrapping IMF altogether. But almost everyone talking creating new financial architecture old one clearly cannot: smother financial wildfire leap globe. President Clinton, British Prime Minister Tony Blair leader, month silence, edged debate, case wresting issue first time finance minister central bank. Their fear, adviser say, 15 month financial turmoil threatening political stability. Such concern turned year's meeting tumbled mass worry groping short long-term solution. The Japanese, French, Southeast Asians arriving Washington different diagnosis went wrong, different solution set right. The United States set plan, mix suggestion force disclosure financial data country world impose American-style financial standard regulation. Meanwhile, ideological argument breaking whether world slow long march free open market strategy pressed Clinton administration six year. Others argue unwise start rebuilding hospital patient still operating table. Last year standard answer u given came this: `We IMF World Bank, know best,' Indonesian Foreign Minister Ali Alatas said breakfast Washington day, reflecting crisis turned 30 year astounding growth country overnight depression. Then said everything went wrong fault, said. But now, I think people know much problem came outside, need something better. And IMF beginning fight back, awkward role institution dominated PhD. economist unaccustomed openly challenged. Every place turn read story, came in, made thing worse, said Stanley Fischer, deputy managing director fund, born Northern Rhodesia Zambia became chairman Massachusetts Institute Technology's economics department taking job put center financial storm. We frequently get blame, well-deserved, said. But politically convenient government world cry, `The IMF made u it,' pin mistake u. That's fine. We'd rather loved, we'd effective. MISCALCULATIONS, POLITICS AND SAFETY NETS On steaming January day, Michel Camdessus, IMF's top official, slipped Jakarta private residence President Suharto sat four-hour meeting tick off, line line, huge reform Indonesia would implement return ten billion dollar emergency aid. Two previous deal collapsed Suharto ignored fund's condition, Camdessus insisted strike deal directly Suharto, Asia's longest-serving leader. It meeting men knew different world power politics: Suharto rose general central Java, Camdessus detonated mine Algeria French army entering French Treasury way becoming head France's central bank. It there, senior IMF official recalled. He told dismantle national airplane project, clove monopoly, distribution monopoly. At one point, Camdessus looked impassive Suharto said, You see mean family, reference vast investment country's key industry. He said, `I called child, understand.' But month, exchange Jakarta came symbolize IMF's twin troubles: Its inability understand reckon national politics country need radical reform, focus economic stabilization rather social cost action. Suharto intention fulfilling agreement. It wa, one former Cabinet member said, delaying move obvious everyone Camdessus. Perhaps one reason IMF sometimes appears tone-deaf senior staff almost entirely composed PhD. economist. There official deep experience international politics, much le complexity Javanese culture work Indonesia. Historically, expert politics security gravitated United Nations, development expert World Bank, economist IMF creating dangerous gap crisis one. As result, fund rudimentary understanding would happen demand met Indonesia's state monopoly quickly dissolved. While system lined pocket Suhartos friend, also distributed food, gasoline staple country stretch 3,000 mile thousand island. To help balance budget, fund demanded quick end expensive subsidy keep price food gasoline artificially low. But that, combined huge currency devaluation sparked crisis, resulted high price shortage fueled riot continue day, million Indonesians lose job. The IMF unintentionally, official insist also sped Suharto's resignation, insisting elimination crony capitalism, code word removing Suharto family center economy. Ultimately, may prove Indonesia's salvation, new government contain rioting ethnic Chinese minority whose money desperately needed country's fast-shrinking economy. It worth noting, Fischer said week, program Asia Indonesia, Korea Thailand took hold change government. Nonetheless, Indonesia experience revived argument IMF focused stabilizing bank currency, preventing capital flight freeing market, blind social cost action. Among toughest critic sister institution, World Bank, whose main charge alleviating poverty. You've seen tension almost every day, one senior World Bank official said recently. The bank gone extraordinary length recent month differentiate role fund, announce tripling aid poorest country hit economic chaos. Even UN. Secretary General Kofi Annan joined argument, warning speech Harvard recently globalization succeed, must succeed poor rich alike. It must deliver right le rich. It must harnessed cause capital alone, development prosperity poorest world. IMF official say changing strategy see exacting great social cost. It's difficult formula get exactly right, Fischer said August, Russia teetering IMF sending $4.8 billion aid rapidly wasted. You need enough discipline send right message market keep investor fleeing. But need enough leeway keep people suffering otherwise would. In recent month, noted, IMF allowed spending sustain subsidy basic good longer period Indonesia, Korea elsewhere. There new flexibility IMF senior Indonesian official concluded recently. It lot better. A US. PAWN, OR A RUNAWAY AGENCY? The Clinton administration admits IMF many failing, many display year. But insists world gone global financial crisis IMF century result 1930s. I doubt situation year would much worse greater devaluation, default, contagion, greater trade dislocation program agreed IMF finance provided, Deputy Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers told Congress last week. Many Republicans Democrats unconvinced. Even though Senate overwhelmingly approved $18 billion contribution fund help fight new crisis, House defeated measure two week ago. The fund's last hope getting money, free nearly $100 billion contribution nation waiting United States act, come House Senate try resolve budget difference conference committee next 10 day. A rejection, Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin insists, would send message world United States turning back one institution charged restoring economic stability. Everywhere else world, though, politician businessmen insist one biggest problem IMF that, contrary view Congress, act US. Treasury's lap dog. Ask Jakarta Moscow, response same: The IMF never venture far looking back approving nod master. When United States weighs in, however, IMF called rescue country deep trouble. Only IMF US. Treasury leverage extract commitment return billion aid. In theory, US. influence limited: It 18.5 percent vote fund. Germany, Japan, France Britain 5 percent each. But practice United States get way, exercising influence scene, interaction Fischer Summers. The two met Fischer MIT faculty Summers graduate student taking one class, later becoming colleague MIT. Each served chief economist World Bank. It Summers instrumental placing Fischer fund's no. 2 job, day talk constantly. It's warm relationship, Fischer said summer. Remember, job cannot turn outsider advice can't call chief economist Wall Street firm, many academic friend, many issue confidential. The Treasury's relation Camdessus strained play role world diplomat, traveling globe trying coax political leader. The tension obvious start Asia crisis. The fund made little secret displeasure United States offering direct aid Thailand, major US. ally, sign support confidence. Mindful backlash Congress Mexico bailed US. money, last thing Treasury planned do. Summers, turn, thought fund forcing Thais implement reform commitment rigorously enough disclose true financial picture. Within US. government dissension: The State Defense Departments felt United States Thailand, backed Treasury asked would pony aid budget. There conflict. When Japan used last IMF meeting propose setting $100 billion Asia Fund one would exclude United States would probably offer aid much relaxed condition IMF doe. Rubin called Camdessus breakfast one morning told Japanese proposal would undercut IMF's authority. We've dispute Michel, Rubin reported aide returned orange juice croissant. One shot back: And 8 am. Camdessus backed Rubin's insistence walked away money Asia could used. Japan say back similar proposal weekend, time $30 billion fund. Camdessus also rankled US. official statement amounted cheerleading reassure market sometimes face fact. In June, Russia way collapse, Camdessus declared contrary market commentator imagining slow collapse Russia's economy, crisis. This major development. The bailouts Russia South Korea prime example Washington muscle IMF's turf soon major US. strategic interest involved. Last Christmas, South Korea slipped day running hard currency pay debt December, sent secret envoy, Kim Kihwan, work rescue package. I bother going IMF, Kim recalled recently. I called Summers' office Treasury home Seoul, flew Washington went directly there. I knew would get done. Within day Treasury dispatched David Lipton, experienced veteran emergency bailouts, leaving post undersecretary international affair month, shadow IMF staff's negotiation government Seoul. Fischer displeased. To make negotiation effective, clear authority negotiating, said. WHO LOST RUSSIA? The pattern repeated summer, United States raced put together $17 billion package Russia. The IMF's staff Moscow declared Russia needed money needed enact policy would restore confidence investor. The Americans Germans came different conclusion. Soon after, US. official gathered White House situation room consider might happen Russia ruble devalued market reform collapsed push IMF come emergency money. So fund began assembling last-ditch program prop country resisted reform plan seven year. Camdessus, though, still hesitant, questioning whether IMF risk scarce resource Russia. We pull Michel along, senior Treasury official recalled. As turned out, Camdessus' instinct right approach championed Rubin Summers proved disastrously wrong. The first installment payment $4.8 billion wasted, propping currency long enough, word one IMF official, let oligarch get money country. Then Yeltsin reversed commitment, let ruble devalue anyway, began printing money abandon fired virtually every reformer government resulting collapse IMF agreement indefinite suspension aid program. Now, IMF Capitol Hill, recrimination lost Russia. Publicly, Fischer argues apology owed attempted Russia. But IMF official complain privately let Rubin Summers run roughshod them, striking deal fell apart week Russian parliament rebelled Yeltsin backed away commitment. Summers responds United States took calculated risk vastly better Russia succeed succeed. The Russian collapse touched new round economic contagion, investor fleeing Latin America, triggering huge loss hedge fund Long Term Capital, Greenwich, Conn., investment firm needed rescued Wall Street powerhouse whose money invested. Russia turning point, said Robert Hormats, vice chairman Goldman, Sachs &AMP; Co. It made world realize country fail, IMF Treasury intercede. And changed perception risk. Now, country meet face future IMF warned could bleak, need reverse perception, watch country slowly starve lack capital. The emerging market calling control short term investment. The French want stronger IMF. The Americans say answer disclosure, investor better warned, tougher regulation. These nice, quiet meetings; everyone polite, top US. official said earlier week. Not year. Ukraine's parliament Friday refused approve President Leonid Kuchma's decree establishing state fund compensate people saving lost bank. Deputies voted 240-47 prepare revised version decree debate later month. They must consider decree Oct. 10, else automatically take effect constitution. Leftist faction, voted proposed legislation, said would fully guarantee return saving lost financial instability recently hit Ukraine. The fund Kuchma proposed establish would accumulated money special National Bank account repay people case bank kept saving went bankrupt became insolvent. Although decree provided compensation deposit amounting 500 hryvna (dlrs 147 current exchange rate), author said would cover 90 percent Ukrainians keep money bank. The measure meant prevent mass withdrawal deposit Ukrainian bank already experienced people, scared fall national currency turmoil neighboring Russia, started stock food, clothing household good. Government official say Ukrainians recently withdrawn least 10 percent 3 billion hryvna (dlrs 882 million) deposited bank. Russia's new prime minister picked unusual way reassure nation Thursday. After two week deliberation announced still plan rescue country economic crisis. I want repeat program, Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov said. It worked out. In nation statement might provoke alarm. But Primakov seeking calm anxious public worried Kremlin's cure could worse disease. It Russians something concerned about. Thursday Primakov convened meeting top aide try hammer strategy overcoming economic woe. A main item agenda plan drafted Yuri Maslyukov, Communist government's senior policy maker economic issue. It take long Maslyukov's plan hit street. A newspaper, Kommersant Daily, published full Thursday morning. Not surprisingly Maslyukov's plan call greater state role economy, including control hard currency. A new State Bank Reconstruction Development would established using nationalized asset failed commercial bank. Wages pension would paid two month, minimum wage would indexed inflation. There would huge tax cut, combination suggested government committed printing additional money. The exchange rate ruble would set central bank, based change inflation balance payment. Maslyukov's plan also implies Russians would able buy dollar exchange country. It stipulates hard currency could enter country special authorization. Exporters would required sell hard currency reserve. That allusion currency control sent shock wave Russian public. Russians come treat dollar second currency, many people squirreled away dollar hedge inflation. It obvious stupidity, Otto Latsis, commentator newspaper Noviye Izvestiya, said. People give dollar away. They go black market need to. Yegor Gaidar, former prime minister favor free market, said plan war dollar predicted would lead shortage import. As criticism grew, Primakov rushed distance talk currency control. The rumor state's becoming monopolist inflow hard currency country nonsense, said, asserting document published Kommersant Daily one six possible plan. Primakov may opposed wildly unpopular currency control. He may worried plan would would set panic buying dollar, depressing ruble. Or may simply trying keep distance Maslyukov's plan Russia try wrangle next disbursement, $4.3 billion, International Monetary Fund. The particular could modified, many people maneuvering say believe represents basic thrust government's thinking. Primakov called greater state regulation expansion money supply, two theme Maslyukov's plan. The plan also many similarity plan presented government Gorbachev-era adviser. We think close final document, said United Financial Group, Russian investment business. It unclear long Primakov carry spelling detailed strategy. The ousted tax chief, Boris Fyodorov, argued IMF provide aid Primakov taken tough measure build free market. Primakov ha, however, sought turn logic head, arguing government's economic strategy depend fund's willingness provide aid. His aim appears pressure fund implying fund's fault Russia forced default loan take draconian measure home. Or Primakov put Thursday, fund's money, Russia impose unpopular measure.

If Communist Party way planning month million Russians take street Wednesday biggest demonstration year. But Communists politician Communist stamp approval running country economy question marcher demonstrating against. President Boris Yeltsin economic adviser easy target two month ago. But Yeltsin seems shadow today, adviser gone. The Communists, undergone sort resurgence playing discontent, working hard cast outsider government help run keep focus protest Wednesday Yeltsin policy. Even strategy may backfire, however, discontent Yeltsin necessarily translate support predecessor. An adviser Communist Party leader, Gennadi Zyuganov, made headline long ago called new government bourgeois. The characterization striking, new prime minister, Yevgeny Primakov, one Zyuganov's top choice post. The deputy prime minister charge economy, Yuri Maslyukov, Communist Party figure headed Gosplan, infamous central-planning program helped bring Soviet Union ruin. We slogan aimed government, first secretary Moscow Communist Party committee, Alexander Kuvayev, said recent interview. All slogan aimed president economic course country. Only president fully blamed course brought country situation. Anger Russia's fate, own, drawing Russians back Soviet-style slogan old-style hostility capitalism. The ardently pro-Communist newspaper Sovietskaya Rossiya devoted front page Thursday said result contest reader protest slogan. The entry ranged catchy kitschy, from, Legislator, official, banker study Constitution; exam Oct. 7, to, Imperialist! Help Russia return exported capital, pay debt once. Russia seen nothing approaching sort economic chaos despair 1993, hyperinflation swept economy. There real way knowing whether latest travail produce huge ugly crowd small, peaceful one. A deputy editor political analyst newsweekly, Itogi, Masha Lipman, said situation 1993, Yeltsin sought, won, popular mandate referendum. He used dissolve Communist-dominated Parliament increase power. That led autumn showdown, shelling Parliament tank total defeat, time being, Yeltsin's legislative opponent. You interpret demonstration Communist mandate, I think act Yeltsin, Ms. Lipman said. Support Communists smallest level, maybe 20 percent. In survey 1,714 people released last week All-Russian Public Opinion Center said nearly half population supported idea demonstration Yeltsin, barely one-tenth likely participate way. Nobody interested sort struggle, Yuri Levada, head center, said interview. This mainly general expression great wave distrust authority, mainly president. He's great scapegoat sin. There seems little enthusiasm demonstration sort. Only thousand people turned Sunday fifth anniversary shelling Parliament Yeltsin's subsequent triumph Communists. The Communist Party Federation Independent Russian Unions, leftist organization say main sponsor protest, predict 9 million Russians participate Wednesday. The government vowed keep order resorting force. But concerned enough summoned 11,000 police officer patrol Moscow 6,000 military troop intervene violence erupts. Protests 1993 generally tepid, deep-seated feeling here. Some demonstration last week, le practice run, hinted similarly dampened march year. President Boris Yeltsin would respond strongly effort prohibit Russians buying foreign currency, believing move would bringing another Iron Curtain country, spokesman said Friday. The president clearly understands ban would clear violation right . would mean return Iron Curtain everyday life, said presidential spokesman Dmitry Yakushin. The remark came medium report government economic plan work would prohibit Russians buying US. dollar foreign currency, institute strict economic control, rolling back seven year reform. Though government official say plan one six possibility, Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov warned Thursday might forced take unpopular measure rescue Russian economy receive next installment dlrs 22.6 billion loan International Monetary Fund. Central Bank Chairman Viktor Gerashchenko Finance Minister Mikhail Zadornov flew Washington Friday negotiation IMF dlrs 4.3 billion installment. IMF official said want Russian government come sound economic program loan given, made clear currency control boosting money supply printing ruble acceptable. But Primakov said country's plan would dependent IMF loan, way around. No short-term economic plan known another three week, long IMF set make decision, said First Deputy Prime Minister Vadim Gustov. A draft version government's fourth-quarter budget would rely heavily IMF loan, Kommersant newspaper said. Without loan, government would engage major deficit spending. Calls Soviet-style control part plan drafted First Deputy Prime Minister Yuri Maslyukov leaked press apparently created rift Cabinet. The plan drew heavy criticism Zadornov, Gerashchenko called idea banning foreign currency sale mad idea. Meanwhile, Russia's stock market dropped 5 percent 38.8 Friday, trading light downward move meant little. The stock market continued fall crisis hit Aug. 17.

For second day row, astronauts boarded space shuttle Endeavour Friday liftoff NASA's first space station construction flight. Let's go this, said commander Robert Cabana. Amen, replied launch controller. Rain cloudy skies threat. But NASA confident master alarm Endeavour's cockpit would behave; went 4{ minutes go countdown Thursday, forcing delay. NASA five minutes less day launch Endeavour order meet first space station part, put orbit two weeks ago Russians. The shuttle contains second station component. The master alarm blared red lights flashed shuttle lift early Thursday. By time controllers traced problem momentary drop hydraulic pressure decided press ahead, late  missed cutoff second two. Sure, frustrating, said Bill Readdy, shuttle program director veteran shuttle commander. But things right. We things book, we're going cut corners means shaving second two. The six astronauts crawled shuttle, two threw hands. Cabana held thumb index finger half-inch apart: We close. The problem confined one Endeavour's three hydraulic pressure units. The pressure dropped long enough trigger alarm, evidently sensitive switch, returned normal. NASA engineers spent day examining problem, found nothing wrong systems confident would reoccur. Endeavour's flight already year late cash crunch Russia, one NASA's partners building international space station. The one-day delay cost NASA $600,000, mostly fuel overtime pay. Aboard Endeavour American-made connecting passageway named Unity. The astronauts use shuttle robot arm capture Russian space station piece attach Unity. Then, two spacewalkers hook electrical connections cables two cylinders, attach handrails tools future crews. Until alarm sounded, looked though weather would problem. Rain clouds moved Atlantic 1{ hours liftoff, drifted away minutes spare. Secretary State Madeleine Albright dignitaries world gathered drizzle see Endeavour crew off. Here 16 countries cooperating venture future, said Albright, expected back Friday's attempt. This good investment. The planet's daring construction job began Friday shuttle Endeavour carried orbit six astronauts first U.S.-built part international space station expected cost $100 billion. After last-minute alarm shuttle forced postponement early Thursday, launch went flawlessly 3:36 Friday morning, right schedule. The night sky clear, moon full. With roar, Endeavour made fiery ascent briefly turned Florida coastline night day. More five minutes 500 miles later, spaceship's main engines could still seen distance, twinkling new star. On 12-day flight, Endeavour's astronauts locate Russian part already orbit, grasp shuttle's robot arm attach new U.S. module. Wielding tools hundreds miles Earth, working methodically cold void, astronauts starting five-year assembly likely make construction Pyramids great cathedrals look child's play. Construction station, research facility, require estimated 160 space walks, which, safety reasons, always done two people. When complete, international space station, dominated solar power arrays, cover area equal two football fields. Modules interconnected laboratories living quarters seven astronauts form habitat equal two 747 jetliners. The station's batteries alone, lined up, would extend half-mile. The project entails high risk, technical difficulty putting together unforgiving environment space, dangers inherent flying space shuttle construction site. The work complicated international politics worries money. The Russians, whose participation partnership clinched post-Cold War deal five years ago, wild card. Moscow's economic political woes left Western officials unsure ability willingness come share money technology. At time, station's costs rising, critics scientists worry appetite money consume federal financing. The project's total cost subject debate, credible estimates put price assembly operation decade, station's estimated lifetime, $110 billion. Of that, American taxpayers spend roughly $96 billion, project's 15 foreign partners $14 billion. The station intended grand laboratory where, environment weightlessness, investigators develop new materials new drugs explore physiology's remaining mysteries, part humans may someday know adapt long space flight worlds. Friday, case, little heard project praise. Great show, Endeavour, mission control Houston radioed six astronauts shuttle went orbit. At Florida spaceport, Secretary State Madeleine Albright lauded launching team new venture. That truly, truly fantastic, told team liftoff. And important, added, many nations working together kinds issues 21st century going concerned with. So congratulations you, secretary said. Stupendous work. The main cargo Thursday Unity module, first U.S.-built station part. Small compared giants come three dozen shuttle flights assembly, unit 18 feet long, weighs 13 tons serve connecting hub modules. Saturday, one astronauts, Lt. Col. Nancy Currie Army, shuttle's robot arm hoist Unity payload bay secure Endeavour's docking system, moving unit horizontal vertical position. Then, Sunday, astronauts rendezvous module known Zarya, Sunrise, Russia launched orbit Kazakhstan Nov. 20. Financed United States built Russia, Zarya, 41 feet long, kind tugboat embryonic station, furnishing power propulsion well communication rendezvous abilities. When Endeavour's payload bay 10 feet Zarya, Colonel Currie reach robot arm pull Russian module position Unity. The mechanical arm never moved anything big. Zarya, completely weightless space, 21 tons mass. If mishandled, crush kill. As Col. Currie holds Zarya steady, Endeavour's commander, Col. Robert Cabana Marine Corps, veteran three space flights, nudge shuttle forward join two station pieces together. When mated special attachments, Zarya Unity form station's first element, 63 feet long 78 feet wide tips solar arrays. Starting Monday, pair space-walking astronauts hook electrical connections data cables units, attach antennas install tools handrails future visitors. The builders Col. Jerry Ross Air Force, 50, Dr. James Newman, 42, physicist. Their series three space walks continue Wednesday end Saturday, Dec. 12. As construction goes outside, astronauts Endeavour busy making preparations enter new station connecting tunnel docking system. Next Thursday, crew enter embryonic station first time, installing portable fans lights. Friday enter, prepare arrival 1999 next major element, first one built financed Russia. The astronauts Endeavour pilot, Maj. Frederick Sturckow Marine Corps, mission specialist, Sergei Krikalev Russian Space Agency. After separating new outpost, crew bring Endeavour back Kennedy Space Center Dec. 15, mission length shy 12 days. Gretchen McClain, NASA's director Washington international space station, said interview overall costs actually small individual Americans. Over lifetime, said, annual cost equal pizza soft drink nation's 96 million taxpayers. U.S. costs construction, added, $24 billion, operations year 2012 $10.4 billion, total $34.4 billion. Most experts agency consider figure ridiculously low ignores many billions dollars spent early development work well cost numerous shuttle flights, run $800 million apiece. Following series intricate maneuvers skillful use space shuttle Endeavour's robot arm, astronauts Sunday joined first two many segments form international space station. The shuttle crew six snared Russian-made Zarya control module chasing Earth ever-closing orbits throughout day. Less hour rendezvous 240 miles Earth shortly 6 p.m., Lt. Col. Nancy Currie Army deftly used 50-foot arm grab 40,000-pound cylinder craft passed Russia slowly pull shuttle. Seeing Zarya close, Col. Robert Cabana Marines, shuttle commander, confirmed two antennas failed deploy module launch Kazakhstan Nov. 20. There earlier indications antennas, used later station manually assist spacecraft dockings, extended. Currie took almost two hours painstakingly move Zarya American-made Unity docking port positioned Endeavour's cargo bay. When two pieces aligned inches one another, Cabana fired small thruster rockets raised shuttle, allowing modules clamp together. The two station pieces, together measuring 77 feet end end combined mass 70,000 pounds, first 100 major components united space next five years form orbiting outpost would weigh almost million pounds span area size two football fields. More 40 additional missions U.S. shuttles Russian rockets used haul components supplies orbit, astronauts nations spend almost 1,800 hours spacewalks assemble entire structure. The spece station expected cost partnership 16 nations $40 billion construct. Bringing pieces together first step mating them. A pair astronauts make three spacewalks week, first Monday, hook electrical communications cables, remove covers, attach handrails perform tasks get modules work one unit. The difficult part Sunday's mating $240 million Zarya $300 million Unity bringing together shuttle caught Russian unit. Currie use Canadian-built robot arm place Zarya top Unity able see pieces joined. Unity, raised Endeavour's cargo bay Saturday, large blocked Currie's view mating fixtures shuttle's windows. She used views remote cameras computerized vision system built arm estimate relative positions two large segments. The computerized system examined markings modules, computed relationship one another using marks displayed results laptop computer. We've never done anything before, Currie said flight, adding practiced difficult maneuver 100 times last two years. The flight Endeavour, took Cape Canaveral, Fla., last Friday, gone according plan early Sunday, mission control ordered shuttle change orbit slightly avoid piece space debris. Air Force space debris trackers noted shuttle pass 1.6 miles spent stage American booster rocket launched last month. Although considered safe distance, shuttle controllers decided widen separation five miles extra precaution. Endeavour astronauts closed Sunday capture first piece international space station, Russian-made Zarya control module connected Unity chamber shuttle. Stacking two giant cylinders 240 miles Earth considered difficult part mission. The job fell Nancy Currie, shuttle crane operator deftly hoisted repositioned Unity cargo bay Saturday. The two station pieces big  77 feet tip one tip combined mass 70,000 pounds  Currie crewmates going rely computerized vision system camera views, rather direct line sight. Such blind docking never attempted before. Mission Control gave astronauts plenty time tasks. The main thing I've tried last two years working flight make sure time.

A last-minute alarm forced NASA halt Thursday's launching space shuttle Endeavour, mission start assembling international space station. Another attempt Endeavour crew six astronauts scheduled Friday 3:36 a.m. This first time three years, 19 flights, shuttle countdown stopped spaceship fueled crew craft ready go. The uncommon delay prompted frowns furrowed brows here, although officials stressed entirely warranted. We want err conservative side, Ralph Roe, launch director Kennedy Space Center, said news conference sudden halt countdown 19 seconds liftoff. Everything going smoothly rare nighttime launching, set 3:58 Thursday morning. The weather, forecast iffy, turned fine, sky alight nearly full moon. But length so-called launching window was, planned, unusually short  10 minutes. That brevity result Endeavour's rendezvous space-station part Russia put orbit last month. The show-stopper arose four minutes liftoff computer space shuttle set master alarm. Controllers studied data discovered momentary pressure drop one hydraulic systems control movements shuttle's engines rudder flight surfaces. Officials eventually decided pressure drop insignificant, resolved press ahead. But late: time run one procedures needed keep shuttle's fuel supercold. So countdown aborted 19 seconds blastoff.

Endeavour's astronaut connected first two building block international space station Sunday, creating seven-story tower shuttle cargo bay. It first time Russian-built Zarya control module made-in-America Unity chamber ever touched. It looked perfect and, hopefully, long-lasting fit. We capture Zarya, commander Robert Cabana announced moment two piece came together. Congratulations crew good ship Endeavour, replied Mission Control. That's terrific. The 240-mile-high construction job began two hour earlier Nancy Currie's capture Zarya (Russian Sunrise) using shuttle robot arm. We're halfway home, Cabana said. Then came hard part: stacking two giant cylinder cargo bay. The two station piece big 77 foot tip one tip combined mass 70,000 pound Currie crewmates rely computerized vision system camera view, rather direct line sight. This first time blind docking ever attempted. Currie positioned solar-winged Zarya, still end shuttle robot arm, several inch directly Unity. It slow going; wanted needed perfect alignment. Once sure it, Cabana fired Endeavour's thruster, brief burst raised shuttle thereby Unity enough docking mechanism two station component snap together. The historical moment occurred South Pacific. It took several try, however, Zarya Unity pulled tightly together.

For second day row, astronaut boarded space shuttle Endeavour Friday liftoff NASA's first space station construction flight. Let's go this, said commander Robert Cabana. Amen, replied launch controller. Rain cloudy sky threat. But NASA confident master alarm Endeavour's cockpit would behave; went 4{ minute go countdown Thursday, forcing delay. NASA five minute le day launch Endeavour order meet first space station part, put orbit two week ago Russians. The shuttle contains second station component. The master alarm blared red light flashed shuttle lift early Thursday. By time controller traced problem momentary drop hydraulic pressure decided press ahead, late missed cutoff second two. Sure, frustrating, said Bill Readdy, shuttle program director veteran shuttle commander. But thing right. We thing book, we're going cut corner mean shaving second two. The six astronaut crawled shuttle, two threw hand. Cabana held thumb index finger half-inch apart: We close. The problem confined one Endeavour's three hydraulic pressure unit. The pressure dropped long enough trigger alarm, evidently sensitive switch, returned normal. NASA engineer spent day examining problem, found nothing wrong system confident would reoccur. Endeavour's flight already year late cash crunch Russia, one NASA's partner building international space station. The one-day delay cost NASA $600000, mostly fuel overtime pay. Aboard Endeavour American-made connecting passageway named Unity. The astronaut use shuttle robot arm capture Russian space station piece attach Unity. Then, two spacewalker hook electrical connection cable two cylinder, attach handrail tool future crew. Until alarm sounded, looked though weather would problem. Rain cloud moved Atlantic 1{ hour liftoff, drifted away minute spare. Secretary State Madeleine Albright dignitary world gathered drizzle see Endeavour crew off. Here 16 country cooperating venture future, said Albright, expected back Friday's attempt. This good investment. The planet's daring construction job began Friday shuttle Endeavour carried orbit six astronaut first U.S.-built part international space station expected cost $100 billion. After last-minute alarm shuttle forced postponement early Thursday, launch went flawlessly 3:36 Friday morning, right schedule. The night sky clear, moon full. With roar, Endeavour made fiery ascent briefly turned Florida coastline night day. More five minute 500 mile later, spaceship's main engine could still seen distance, twinkling new star. On 12-day flight, Endeavour's astronaut locate Russian part already orbit, grasp shuttle's robot arm attach new US. module. Wielding tool hundred mile Earth, working methodically cold void, astronaut starting five-year assembly likely make construction Pyramids great cathedral look child's play. Construction station, research facility, require estimated 160 space walk, which, safety reason, always done two people. When complete, international space station, dominated solar power array, cover area equal two football field. Modules interconnected laboratory living quarter seven astronaut form habitat equal two 747 jetliner. The station's battery alone, lined up, would extend half-mile. The project entail high risk, technical difficulty putting together unforgiving environment space, danger inherent flying space shuttle construction site. The work complicated international politics worry money. The Russians, whose participation partnership clinched post-Cold War deal five year ago, wild card. Moscow's economic political woe left Western official unsure ability willingness come share money technology. At time, station's cost rising, critic scientist worry appetite money consume federal financing. The project's total cost subject debate, credible estimate put price assembly operation decade, station's estimated lifetime, $110 billion. Of that, American taxpayer spend roughly $96 billion, project's 15 foreign partner $14 billion. The station intended grand laboratory where, environment weightlessness, investigator develop new material new drug explore physiology's remaining mystery, part human may someday know adapt long space flight world. Friday, case, little heard project praise. Great show, Endeavour, mission control Houston radioed six astronaut shuttle went orbit. At Florida spaceport, Secretary State Madeleine Albright lauded launching team new venture. That truly, truly fantastic, told team liftoff. And important, added, many nation working together kind issue 21st century going concerned with. So congratulation you, secretary said. Stupendous work. The main cargo Thursday Unity module, first U.S.-built station part. Small compared giant come three dozen shuttle flight assembly, unit 18 foot long, weighs 13 ton serve connecting hub module. Saturday, one astronaut, Lt. Col. Nancy Currie Army, shuttle's robot arm hoist Unity payload bay secure Endeavour's docking system, moving unit horizontal vertical position. Then, Sunday, astronaut rendezvous module known Zarya, Sunrise, Russia launched orbit Kazakhstan Nov. 20. Financed United States built Russia, Zarya, 41 foot long, kind tugboat embryonic station, furnishing power propulsion well communication rendezvous ability. When Endeavour's payload bay 10 foot Zarya, Colonel Currie reach robot arm pull Russian module position Unity. The mechanical arm never moved anything big. Zarya, completely weightless space, 21 ton mass. If mishandled, crush kill. As Col. Currie hold Zarya steady, Endeavour's commander, Col. Robert Cabana Marine Corps, veteran three space flight, nudge shuttle forward join two station piece together. When mated special attachment, Zarya Unity form station's first element, 63 foot long 78 foot wide tip solar array. Starting Monday, pair space-walking astronaut hook electrical connection data cable unit, attach antenna install tool handrail future visitor. The builder Col. Jerry Ross Air Force, 50, Dr. James Newman, 42, physicist. Their series three space walk continue Wednesday end Saturday, Dec. 12. As construction go outside, astronaut Endeavour busy making preparation enter new station connecting tunnel docking system. Next Thursday, crew enter embryonic station first time, installing portable fan light. Friday enter, prepare arrival 1999 next major element, first one built financed Russia. The astronaut Endeavour pilot, Maj. Frederick Sturckow Marine Corps, mission specialist, Sergei Krikalev Russian Space Agency. After separating new outpost, crew bring Endeavour back Kennedy Space Center Dec. 15, mission length shy 12 day. Gretchen McClain, NASA's director Washington international space station, said interview overall cost actually small individual Americans. Over lifetime, said, annual cost equal pizza soft drink nation's 96 million taxpayer. US. cost construction, added, $24 billion, operation year 2012 $10.4 billion, total $34.4 billion. Most expert agency consider figure ridiculously low ignores many billion dollar spent early development work well cost numerous shuttle flight, run $800 million apiece. Following series intricate maneuver skillful use space shuttle Endeavour's robot arm, astronaut Sunday joined first two many segment form international space station. The shuttle crew six snared Russian-made Zarya control module chasing Earth ever-closing orbit throughout day. Less hour rendezvous 240 mile Earth shortly 6 p.m., Lt. Col. Nancy Currie Army deftly used 50-foot arm grab 40,000-pound cylinder craft passed Russia slowly pull shuttle. Seeing Zarya close, Col. Robert Cabana Marines, shuttle commander, confirmed two antenna failed deploy module launch Kazakhstan Nov. 20. There earlier indication antenna, used later station manually assist spacecraft docking, extended. Currie took almost two hour painstakingly move Zarya American-made Unity docking port positioned Endeavour's cargo bay. When two piece aligned inch one another, Cabana fired small thruster rocket raised shuttle, allowing module clamp together. The two station piece, together measuring 77 foot end end combined mass 70,000 pound, first 100 major component united space next five year form orbiting outpost would weigh almost million pound span area size two football field. More 40 additional mission US. shuttle Russian rocket used haul component supply orbit, astronaut nation spend almost 1,800 hour spacewalks assemble entire structure. The spece station expected cost partnership 16 nation $40 billion construct. Bringing piece together first step mating them. A pair astronaut make three spacewalks week, first Monday, hook electrical communication cable, remove cover, attach handrail perform task get module work one unit. The difficult part Sunday's mating $240 million Zarya $300 million Unity bringing together shuttle caught Russian unit. Currie use Canadian-built robot arm place Zarya top Unity able see piece joined. Unity, raised Endeavour's cargo bay Saturday, large blocked Currie's view mating fixture shuttle's window. She used view remote camera computerized vision system built arm estimate relative position two large segment. The computerized system examined marking module, computed relationship one another using mark displayed result laptop computer. We've never done anything before, Currie said flight, adding practiced difficult maneuver 100 time last two year. The flight Endeavour, took Cape Canaveral, Fla., last Friday, gone according plan early Sunday, mission control ordered shuttle change orbit slightly avoid piece space debris. Air Force space debris tracker noted shuttle pas 1.6 mile spent stage American booster rocket launched last month. Although considered safe distance, shuttle controller decided widen separation five mile extra precaution. Endeavour astronaut closed Sunday capture first piece international space station, Russian-made Zarya control module connected Unity chamber shuttle. Stacking two giant cylinder 240 mile Earth considered difficult part mission. The job fell Nancy Currie, shuttle crane operator deftly hoisted repositioned Unity cargo bay Saturday. The two station piece big 77 foot tip one tip combined mass 70,000 pound Currie crewmates going rely computerized vision system camera view, rather direct line sight. Such blind docking never attempted before. Mission Control gave astronaut plenty time task. The main thing I've tried last two year working flight make sure time. We margin everything, said flight director Bob Castle. Before beginning final approach Zarya Russian Sunrise shuttle's six astronaut steer clear chunk rocket launched last month California. Mission Control ordered pilot fire shuttle thruster put extra three mile Endeavour space junk, putting Endeavour total five mile orbiting debris. The smaller gap would probably little close comfort, Mission Control said. The bigger worry, far, Endeavour's pursuit capture Zarya, coupling Unity. The shuttle's 50-foot robot arm never assigned handle object massive 44,000-pound Zarya, power propulsion module launched Kazakhstan Nov. 20. It provide necessary electricity steering fledgling space station permanent control module launched next summer. The 36-foot, 25,000-pound Unity serve connecting passageway, vestibule, future module. In case Zarya Unity could connected robot arm, two spacewalking astronaut would manually fit together. The astronaut would going anyway Monday attach electrical connector cable two component. In all, three spacewalks planned Endeavour's 12-day flight. NASA estimate 43 launch 159 spacewalks needed mission assemble entire orbiting complex. Once completed, 16-nation space station mass 1 million pound, longer football field, house seven astronaut cosmonaut. Endeavour's astronaut connected first two building block international space station Sunday, creating seven-story tower shuttle cargo bay. It first time Russian-built Zarya control module made-in-America Unity chamber ever touched. It looked perfect and, hopefully, long-lasting fit. We capture Zarya, commander Robert Cabana announced moment two piece came together. Congratulations crew good ship Endeavour, replied Mission Control. That's terrific.

NASA estimate 43 launch 159 spacewalks needed mission assemble entire orbiting complex. Once completed, 16-nation space station mass 1 million pound, longer football field, house seven astronaut cosmonaut. A last-minute alarm forced NASA halt Thursday's launching space shuttle Endeavour, mission start assembling international space station. Another attempt Endeavour crew six astronaut scheduled Friday 3:36 am. This first time three year, 19 flight, shuttle countdown stopped spaceship fueled crew craft ready go. The uncommon delay prompted frown furrowed brow here, although official stressed entirely warranted. We want err conservative side, Ralph Roe, launch director Kennedy Space Center, said news conference sudden halt countdown 19 second liftoff. Everything going smoothly rare nighttime launching, set 3:58 Thursday morning. The weather, forecast iffy, turned fine, sky alight nearly full moon. But length so-called launching window wa, planned, unusually short 10 minute. That brevity result Endeavour's rendezvous space-station part Russia put orbit last month. The show-stopper arose four minute liftoff computer space shuttle set master alarm. Controllers studied data discovered momentary pressure drop one hydraulic system control movement shuttle's engine rudder flight surface. Officials eventually decided pressure drop insignificant, resolved press ahead. But late: time run one procedure needed keep shuttle's fuel supercold. So countdown aborted 19 second blastoff. The six astronaut began emerge shuttle hour later ultimately headed bed rest another attempt early Friday. \n","Making first collective decision monetary policy, 11 European nations launching common currency Jan. 1 cut interest rates Thursday surprise move market confidence. Ten 11 countries joining European economic union dropped key interest rate 3 percent, Portugal making significant plunge, 3.75 percent. Austria made smallest cut, 3.2 percent. The exception Italy, cut 4 3.5 percent. It expected drop common rate time euro launched. Unifying interest rate critical step laying groundwork monetary union, analysts generally expected rates settle level Germany's, 3.3 percent cut, 3 percent. However, interest rate levels become contentious political issue center-left governments Germany France pushing rate cuts help spur growth combat unemployment, stuck 10.9 percent nations adopting euro. The head European Central Bank set monetary policy euro nations, Wim Duisenberg, Thursday suggested governments reform rigid labor markets create jobs, pressure cut rates. The remarks Brussels  cuts made  gave hint rate drop imminent, made clear resistance political pressure strong ever. So strong, fact, Dutch Finance Minister Gerrit Zalm said feared bank would delay decision. What feared that, order prove independence, ECB would go analysis would wait longer, would nonsensical, Zalm said. Hans Tietmeyer, runs German Bundesbank ECB modeled, hinted rate cut designed boost confidence new currency, dampened global economic crises Europe's worsening outlook. The coordinated rate cut could lead reduction current pessimism reduction financial market turbulence, Tietmeyer said. The cuts seemed desired impact. Frankfurt's main index closed 2.1 percent, France's 1.8 percent. The cuts also boosted markets Spain, Belgium, Italy Britain, nations launching euro. The reaction is, `Oh good, they're little bit prop euro economy.' But confidence taken quite hit Europe recently, I think action ECB needed next year, maybe 2.5 percent, James Mitchell, senior London-based strategist Nomura. An economist Banque Bruxelles Lambert, Liesbeth Van de Craen, said cuts timely. We clearly headed slowdown, said. Until recently, Europe's economies held relatively well damage Asia Russia's economic crises unstable financial markets. But two days ago, Duisenberg painted bleakest picture Europe's economies, warning growth likely slow 2.5 percent next year earlier expectations 3 percent. The rate cuts may help. By making cheaper borrow money, rate cuts lead investment new businesses, making less worthwhile inducing people spend. That expands economy. The 11 countries launching euro Austria, Belgium, Ireland, Italy, Finland, France, Germany, Luxembourg, Netherlands, Spain Portugal. Wim Duisenberg, head new European Central Bank, said interview published Wednesday step completing half term earlier agreed. I hoped ask question. The answer no, Duisenberg told Le Monde daily, asked would step four years job. Duisenberg named spring head new European Central Bank, govern policies euro, new single currency goes effect Jan. 1. France surprised euro partners proposing central banker, Jean-Claude Trichet, last minute job Duisenberg expected secure easily. Although elected easily, Duisenberg agreed step four years eight year term although said gentleman's agreement exists. Duisenberg told Le Monde, newspaper fervently backed euro, the introduction new currency significant step far European unification. However, said would see political integration, especially area foreign tax social policies. China made trading euro official Monday, announcing authorization European common currency's use trade financial dealings starting Jan. 1. The expected announcement central People's Bank China State Administration Foreign Exchange, carried official Xinhua News Agency, also authorized opening euro accounts. Financial institutions, enterprises individuals China accept use euro economic, trade financial exchanges 11 members European Union effective January 1, 1999, Xinhua reported. In addition, convert, use open euro accounts, said. Chinese officials said government may convert proportion dlrs 145 billion worth foreign exchange reserves euro currency's Jan. 1 debut. The 11 countries launching common currency Austria, Belgium, Ireland, Italy, Finland, France, Germany, Luxembourg, Netherlands, Spain Portugal. The annual inflation rate 11 nations adopt euro shared currency Jan. 1 fell 0.9 percent November, European Union's statistics agency reported Wednesday. The fall continued steady decline inflation euro-zone year. Annual inflation stood 1 percent October 1.6 percent November 1997, according Eurostat's monthly report. In 15 nation EU whole, inflation fell 1 percent November compared 1.5 percent United States 0.8 percent Japan. Germany, France, Italy, Spain, Netherlands, Belgium, Austria, Portugal, Finland, Ireland Luxembourg set adopt euro common currency midnight New Year's Eve. The latest figures may hint trouble ahead euro-zone significant increases year Portugal Ireland. With European Central Bank setting common interest rate whole bloc, economists fear low rate designed boost core EU economies France Germany may bring overheating smaller nations faster growth. There good news Greece kept euro-zone failing meet economic conditions joining, including low inflation. It's rate 3.9 percent November 5 percent year before. Greece hops join euro-zone 2001. Denmark, Sweden Britain decided stay euro political reasons. Eurostat gave rates November 1998, November 1997 brackets: Sweden, 0.1 (2.7); France, 0.2 (1.4); Germany, 0.6 (1.4); Austria, 0.5 (1.1); Luxembourg, 0.5 (1.5); Belgium, 0.6 (1.3 percent); Denmark, 1.1 (1.6); Netherlands, 1.5 (2.5); Finland, 0.9 (1.8); Britain, 1.4 (1.9); Spain, 1.4 (1.9); Italy, 1.7 (1.8); Portugal, 2.6 (1.9); Ireland, 2.2 (1.1); Greece, 3.9 (5). In candid remarks economy, European Central Bank President Wim Duisenberg said Friday growth appears slowing 11 countries adopting EU common currency  euro  Jan. 1. Despite area-wide survey suggested moderation pace growth, Duisenberg said domestic demand continue boost economy. He pointed also gradual improvement labor market conditions supporting growth, well interest-rate cuts 3.3 percent level euro-zone's lowest rate countries. Duisenberg, spoke event London, said Dec. 1 Dec. 22 meetings Central Bank's policy-making body gauge outlook inflation EU economy.

While inflation lowest levels decades  1 percent euro-zone  unemployment 11 nations remains stubbornly high 10.9 percent. Struggling avoid sidelined Continent-wide equities market promised Europe's soon-to-be-introduced single currency, French authorities said Thursday Paris stock exchange would join alliance London Frankfurt seen precursor pan-European market. The Bourse Paris also announced would play host meeting Nov. 27 nine European exchanges discuss steps conditions needed create unifying competitive pan-European equity market. The two announcements show introduction currency, euro, reshaping Europe's financial landscape, requiring Europeans think Continental rather national terms finance business. And suggested exchange authorities Paris, ruffled announcement July strategic alliance London Stock Exchange Deutsche Borse Frankfurt, abandoned effort set rival market also seeking gain initiative organizing Nov. 27 gathering. Some doubt remained, however, timing technicalities French entry alliance. Foreign Minister Dominique Strauss-Kahn said, Paris joining alliance creation January 1999 joint company. However, officials London Frankfurt  welcomed idea principle  declined say whether timing arrangements far advanced Strauss-Kahn implied. I'm afraid I can't confirm anything that, spokeswoman London Stock Exchange said. The appearances well ahead reality point, said American banker, spoke condition anonymity. Not that, notion Europe-wide exchange raises technical questions compatibility trading systems also regulations governing stock market operations countries use euro beginning January. That led analysts forecast pan-European exchange could running 2000. There awful lot issues resolved, American banker said. The euro introduced electronic trading equities, bonds futures intergovernmental transfers. Notes coins  pocket money shoppers travelers carry  introduced 2002. Initially, currency group 11 European nations euro zone, leaving Britain, Denmark, Sweden Greece outside. With concentration banking trading, however, London expected continue main market center. The prospect heightened pressure consolidation exchanges. Stock market officials Milan, Madrid, Amsterdam Brussels indicated would interested joining London-Frankfurt alliance, initially create single point liquidity trading British German blue-chip issues. The London exchange estimates pan-European stock exchange would group together companies market capitalization $5.5 trillion, compared $8.7 trillion New York Stock Exchange. The Paris Bourse, third largest European exchanges last major holdout pan-European market, said also invited officials exchanges Zurich Stockholm attend Nov. 27 meeting. A spokeswoman said officials London Stock Exchange would meeting. Also Thursday, New York Mercantile Exchange International Petroleum Exchange acknowledged merger would bring together two biggest energy futures markets.

Back economists dourly predicted huge migrations, particularly unskilled laborers moving southern countries prosperous north. Actually, huge industries steel shrank 1970s '80s, job opportunities working-class Europeans. There 15 countries European Union, small percentage citizens moved countries, according estimates prepared Eurostat. Those mostly find jobs service industry waiters, maids garbage collectors. There still legal barriers preventing doctors, lawyers academics finding work countries. So far European Union profitably put use white-collar business executives eagerly followed career opportunities national borders, time zones language barriers.

Now European unification TV time; seeped people's unconscious. Even people care politics recognize faces Tony Blair Jacques Chirac. Ten years ago, people did. According European Union, Britain twice many EU citizens France, country highest concentration residents European countries. According estimates based surveys prepared Eurostat, nearly third residents tiny Luxembourg, low unemployment high standard living, European countries. Belgium, European Commission NATO headquarters, second, 5.4 percent. Paradoxically, perhaps, Britain, one major European nation held joining euro, widely viewed nerve center new cosmopolitanism, headquarters New Europeans  bankers business executives drawn London's financial district, flexible bureaucracy universality English language. Perhaps surprisingly, London also serves example another less obvious aspect European cosmopolitanism  breakdown certain social barriers.

I could never kind job I I stayed Paris, Routier explained. France still hierarchical. Bosses want know went school, father does. In London, none matters long make money. Many Britons still view country weighed heavy class distinctions. For example, Tony Smith, 36, editor several Portuguese magazines Lisbon, seized opportunity study Vienna 14 years ago, never looked back. He lived Europe, fluent Portuguese, Spanish, German, French Serbo-Croatian. His father, car mechanic, traveled Britain 1992. Smith said could never succeeded well stayed home.

Although Saramago discounts influence Latin American magical realism work, novels use supernatural, allegorical, paradoxical irrational ways addressing complex questions faith existence. Many novels set backdrop political historical events, unwavering concern individual fate gives fiction distinctive voice independent character.

Saramago, whose body work includes poetry, essays, plays journal well 10 novels, unusual emerged major literary figure age 60. His novels translated 30 languages, selling particularly well Portugal, Brazil, Spain, Italy Germany. While well known United States, novels always critically well received there. For late blooming, though, Saramago long dreamed becoming writer. Born family rural laborers raised Lisbon, forced poverty leave school teen-ager learn trade car mechanic. Yet managed publish small novel age 25. Later, found work Lisbon publishing company, oppressive censorial atmosphere Salazar dictatorship discouraged writing. It Portugal's April 1974 revolution Saramago felt free find voice. A member Portuguese Communist Party 1969, served editor Lisbon newspaper, Diario de Noticias, 18-month period left looked likely seize power Portugal. But anti-Communist backlash November 1975 forced newspaper began translating French texts Portuguese make ends meet. In late 1970s, also turned novels, publishing three succession 1977, 1978 1980. But 1982, Baltasar Blimunda (Memorial Convento Portuguese), achieved international breakthrough. This rich, multifaceted polysemous text time historical, social individual perspective, Swedish Academy noted Thursday. The insight wealth imagination gives expression characteristic Saramago's work whole. Set 18th-century Portugal Inquisition, book tells baroque efforts war veteran, Baltasar, visionary, Blimunda, escape heavens flying machine powered human wills captured hypersensory Blimunda. This fantastic story takes place real background tortuous construction massive Mafra Convent thousands men held grip Inquisition. When novel published United States 1987, Irving Howe acclaimed brilliant The New York Times Book Review. Mr. Saramago constantly present voice European skepticism, connoisseur ironies, Howe wrote. I think I hear prose echoes Enlightenment sensibility, caustic shrewd. In next novel, The Year Death Ricardo Reis, also homage great Portuguese poet Fernando Pessoa, appears ghost, Saramago sets story early years Salazar dictatorship, tale romantic sexual misadventures poet-physician. Writing The New York Times, Herbert Mitgang called rare, old-fashioned novel  lyrical, symbolic meditative. Saramago, whose sense literary freedom evident unconventional punctuation conflicting use tenses, sought different form freedom The Stone Raft, imagines confusion unleashed Iberian peninsula suddenly breaks free rest Europe begins drifting New World threatens collide Azores. To delight Britons, Gibraltar left behind. Unsurprisingly, bitter satire, The Gospel According Jesus Christ, proved controversial, God shown using innocently human Jesus create religion spawned violence intolerance. When Lisbon jury picked book Portugal's entry 1992 European literary prize, country's conservative government vetoed choice blasphemous. It Saramago decided leave small, crowded apartment Lisbon relative solitude Lanzarote. The History Siege Lisbon, published United States last year, whimsical tale set motion decision humble proofreader publishing house insert word key passage standard history Portugal.

The announcement significant phase discoveries two Monday's winners meeting 1986 elicited avalanche research activities many different laboratories world, said Nobel committee Karolinska Institute Stockholm, makes awards. Its citation said research led new treatments treating heart lung diseases, shock impotence. Ignarro discovered principle led use Viagra anti-impotency drug, said Dr. Sten Orrenius, professor toxicology Karolinska Institute. Nitric oxide starts process blood vessels penis widen produce erection. Nitric oxide, chemical relative anesthetic gas nitrous oxide, better known common air pollutant formed nitrogen burns, automobile exhaust fumes. But scientists know distributed widely body. The discoveries honored Monday made largely 1980s time scientists knew bacteria produced nitric oxide think important animals humans. The award committee said first discovery gas act signal molecule organism. The discovery startling nitric oxide totally different known signal molecule unstable converted nitrate nitrite 10 seconds. Recipients Nobel Prize, including lobbied years, profess surprise learning award. This year's winners refreshingly candid. Furchgott said planned sleep late Monday, holiday, awakened 5:30 home Hewlett, N.Y. He said knew previous Nobel prize winners nominated award, still somewhat surprised receive it. I guess I good friends voting, Furchgott said. He said could get back sleep. Murad said pondered odds thought maybe I could win prize, maybe couple years. He described award culmination career said happens, incredible. Ignarro traveling Italy. Dr. Gerald Levey, dean UCLA, said actually anticipated day four years now. The three 1998 winners never worked together, talked lot shop talk meetings, Furchgott said. Dr. Valentin Fuster, president American Heart Association head cardiology Mt. Sinai Hospital Manhattan, said discovery nitric oxide function one important history cardiovascular medicine. Doctors learned prize-winning research heart disease, endothelium, inner lining arteries, makes less nitric oxide. Drugs nitroglycerine, however, help replenish stores nitric oxide. Now, drug companies trying develop powerful heart drugs based newer knowledge nitric oxide's role signal molecule. Researchers also learned nitric oxide produced endothelium rapidly spreads cell membranes underlying muscle cells arteries. Then shut muscle contractions arteries, thus widening reducing blood pressure. Inhalation nitric oxide gas saved lives people certain lung diseases, particularly infants developed dangerously high pulmonary blood pressure. But regulating amount nitric oxygen inhaled critical much lethal. Nitric oxide plays harmful role collapse circulatory system, shock, resulting overwhelming microbial infections. Bacteria release products cause white blood cells release enormous amounts nitric oxide. As result, blood pressure drops. Scientists trying develop drugs block production nitric oxide infections. White blood cells also play role attacking cancerous cells. The gas also induce type programmed cell death known apoptosis. Scientists studying nitric oxide's effects immune system stop growth cancers. They also exploring nitric oxide's possible role regulating body temperature. Doctors measuring production nitric oxide lungs intestines diagnose number ailments, including asthma colitis, studying role menstruation. Nitric oxide formed nerve cells spreads rapidly directions activate cells vicinity influence many functions, behavior mobility intestinal tract. Nitric oxide also studied role smell memory. Nitric oxide's role still unfolding; scientists written thousands scientific papers recent years started journal, Nitric Oxide. The Nobel committee cited Furchgott performing 1980 ingenious experiment showed drug, acetylcholine, widened blood vessels inner layer, endothelium, intact. Furchgott concluded blood vessels widen endothelial cells produce signal molecule called EDRF, endothelium-derived relaxing factor, relaxes smooth muscle cells blood vessels. Furchgott's findings led quest identify factor, citation said. (OPTIONAL TRIM CAN BEGIN HERE) The citation refer accident Furchgott's laboratory played major role discoveries. In 1995, Annual Review Pharmacology Toxicology, Furchgott wrote May 5, 1978, first series planned experiments arteries rabbit, technician follow directions correctly. The technician performed one step experiment instead supposed wash drug used earlier phase experiment. Furchgott expected arteries would contract. Instead, relaxed. It first time seen drugs study produce reaction, used insight plan additional experiments. Furchgott omitted technician's name paper another 1996 Journal American Medical Association. On Monday, said David Davidson technician. (OPTIONAL TRIM ENDS HERE) The committee cited Ignarro concluding 1986, brilliant series analyses conducted independently Furchgott, EDRF identical nitric oxide. Furchgott said Ignarro made announcement symposium 1986 Mayo Clinic Rochester, Minn., papers published 1998. Murad cited work conducted years worked University Virginia Charlottesville, Stanford University Palo Alto, Calif., Abbott Laboratories Illinois. Murad said felt fortunate heard Furchgott report early work EDRF 1980. Murad showed gas could regulate important cellular functions studied nitroglycerin related heart drugs led release nitric oxide. (OPTIONAL TRIM CAN BEGIN HERE) In early training Case Western Reserve University Cleveland, Murad worked laboratory Dr. Theodore Rall, also trained another Nobel prize winner, Dr. Alfred Gilman University Texas Southwestern Dallas. Gilman said interview believed Rall, retired living Charlottesville, Va., first scientist trained two Nobel Prize winners. In addition, Rall worked Dr. Earl Sutherland, also Nobel Prize. In early reseach years, Murad worked chemical known cyclic guanosine monophosphate, later turned critical nitric oxide story. Murad's trainees referred early work dumping experiments could laboratory time crudely add various hormones agents slices tissue, cell cultures. It took years develop refined techniques led understanding nitric oxide's many roles body. But many years, scientific community skeptical ability free radical nitric oxide activate enzyme, Murad said 1996 Furchgott shared Albert Lasker basic medical research award. (OPTIONAL TRIM ENDS HERE) The Nobel Prizes created Alfred Nobel, whose invention dynamite involved use nitroglycerine. The award committee noted odd twist year's award. When Nobel developed chest pain heart disease, said, refused take nitroglycerine doctor prescribed knew caused headache. Nobel dismissed nitroglycerine's benefit relief chest pain. Nobel died 1896. The prize three scientists share worth $938,000. When Alfred Nobel wrote directions establishing literature prize name, chose unclear word scratched letters.

Arguments Academy's choices inevitable, instructions given. Nobel's says prize recognize literature works ideal direction. What, exactly, meant ideal** unclear Academy's choices reflected confusion. The Academy chosen interpret word apply works ranging good-hearted charm Szymborska's poetry crushing hopelessness Samuel Beckett's writings. When Nobel wrote word ideal  Swedish idealisk**  superimposed last couple letters previous one. Allen curious understand Nobel's thoughts engaged forensic expert try find earlier letters were. The expert succeeded  point. He found first word Nobel wrote idealirad, word exist. Despite inclarity edges, Allen said confident Academy's choices bolster Nobel's core idea literature would basis kind progress. About year's choice, say that: Academy bound keep deliberations secret. But observers love speculate might win, who's shortlist prize, year worth 7.6 million kronor (about dlrs 974,000). Names freuqently come guessing include V.S.

Jose Saramago became first writer Portuguese win Nobel Prize Literature Thursday. His personal delight seconded burst public elation homeland. Saramago, 75, Portuguese said pleased Swedish Academy finally acknowledged literary contribution Portugal, small country 10 million people bordering Spain Europe's southwestern Iberian Peninsula. It taken century win Nobel Prize Portuguese language, Saramago said Frankfurt Book Fair, speaking interpreter.

I skeptical, reserved, I gush, I go smiling, hugging people trying make friend, said. A gaunt man wisp white hair, Saramago born Azinhaga, small town Lisbon. From poor family, never finished university continued study part-time supporting metalworker. His first novel, published 1947 Terra Pecado, Country Sin tale peasant moral crisis. It sold badly enough recognition propel welder's shop literary magazine. But next 18 year, Saramago, communist opposed 41-year conservative dictatorship Antonio Salazar, published travel poetry book worked journalist.

He first critical acclaim abroad 1982 historical fantasy Memorial Convento, published English 1988 Baltasar Blimunda. It set Catholic-inspired inquisition explores war individual organized religion, picking Saramago's recurring theme loner struggling authority. He frequently compared Colombian writer Gabriel Garcia Marquez prose rooted recognizable setting time tinged magical element. The Nobel citation praised work parable sustained imagination, compassion irony continually enables u apprehend elusory reality. Saramago remains prominent nonconformist regular newspaper radio commentary, though view always inspired deep concern fellow man. Blindness, recent book translated English, unsettling allegory social meltdown inexplicable blindness sweep society. This blindness real blindness, blindness rationality, said. We're rational being behave rationally. If did, there'd starvation world. In 1989 The History Siege Lisbon, Lisbon proofreader mischievously insert word text 12th century capture Portuguese capital Moors, thereby fictionally altering course European history stroke pen. Such historical literary mischief Saramago trademark. In 1986 book, The Stone Raft, Iberian Peninsula snap rest European continent float North Atlantic apparently metaphorical search identity away standardizing nature European Union, Portugal Spain enthusiastic member. Saramago receive dlrs 978,000 prize Dec. 10 Stockholm. Former US. President Jimmy Carter, seems perennial Nobel Peace Prize also-ran, could coveted honor 1978 strict deadline rule nomination. That prize shared Egyptian President Anwar Sadat Israeli Prime Minister Menachem Begin signing Camp David peace accord. However, five-member Norwegian award committee also wanted honor Carter brokering pact, foiled rule. The Nobel committee wanted give prize three, said Geir Lundestad, current committee's nonvoting secretary, said Sunday. But Carter nominated deadline ran out. Nominations postmarked Feb. 1 accepted year's prize. The committee add nomination first meeting year, early March. The Camp David accord signed Sept. 17, 1978, five week year's peace prize annouCkuld give prize, Norwegian committee recognized 1978 award citation positive initiative taken President Jimmy Carter. Lundestad said committee, work deep secrecy five six meeting year, tried find loophole rule, overseen Swedish Nobel Foundation. The Nobel Prizes endowed Alfred Nobel, Swedish industrialist whose 355 invention included dynamite. In 1895 will, Nobel endowed prize, said peace prize picked Norwegian committee rest Swedish institution. Lundestad said committee turned Swedish Nobel Foundation advice Carter question principle. Stig Ramel, Swede director Nobel Foundation, advised breaking rule, Lundestad said telephone. Normally, committee refuse discus candidate keeping strict policy secrecy selection detail sealed 50 year. Lundestad made exception Ramel revealed Carter dilemma 1994 memoir. Carter repeatedly nominated Nobel prize consistent wide-ranging peace effort. He also 139 candidate prize announced Oslo Friday. However, early speculation lean someone involved Northern Ireland peace process, Czech President Vaclav Havel mark 30th anniversary Soviet invasion country, human right activist mark 50th anniversary UN. Human Rights Charter. While committee wanted honor Carter could not, hindsight regretted prize reason. Four year Begin prize, Israeli prime minister ordered invasion southern Lebanon thousand civilian died. Kare Kristiansen, served peace prize committee 1991 1994, said that, committee waited, Begin probably would won. There's room name 20th century honor roll writer, one added week Swedish Academy announces latest Nobel Literature laureate. Who chosen stimulates animated conversation reader well academic, critic author themselves. This year's winner or, possibly, winner announced Thursday, Academy disclosed Tuesday. The joke hear go people never heard of, said Ian Jack, editor London-based Granta literary magazine. But Nobel, awarded every year 1901, also shine light, deservedly, wonderful writer people read, added. His favorite include Trinidad-born VS. Naipaul, though he's convinced Naipaul probably win dark . pessimistic scathing portrayal post-colonial African culture. The academy keep deliberation secret. Who considered seriously, who's nominated, disclosed. A writer's nationality, term prize founder Alfred Nobel's will, supposed irrelevant. Two share prize, though last time happened 1974. Winners expected personally receive it: award given posthumously. Looking process afar, Harold Bloom, member American Academy Arts Letters, said award committee unsettling record selection nationally 'correct' politically 'correct.' The winner list prestigious, concedes, mean uniformly lustrous. Absolutely not! Outrageously not, said telephone interview New York. They include kind fifth-raters. . James Joyce never got one, heaven's sake. Neither Marcel Proust. Bloom's US. favorite include Cormac McCarthy, author Blood Meridian; Philip Roth, author American Pastoral; John Ashbery, best living poet. A review recent winner may foreshadow year's laureate. Seven 10 men favor woman? Two three poet favor prose writer? Four 10 wrote English, last three laureate European. In comparison, three Asian writer ever won. Bei Dao personal favorite mine, said Abe Harumasa, editor-in-chief Japanese literary magazine Bungei. The choice could interpreted motivated partly politics, given poet's association China's democracy movement, clear he's wonderful poet. Minoru Takeuchi, professor Chinese literature Japan's prestigious Kyoto University, cited novelist Pa Kin Xie Bing Xin worthy. The latter known portrayal struggle Chinese woman. China, translates publishes work many Nobel winner, desperately want first laureate, added. Spain's Nobel hope pinned Francisco Ayala, 92, winner year's renowned Prince Asturias prize, said Jose Maria Martinez Cachero, author, university professor secretary jury selected Ayala. Other presumed Latin candidate Peru-born Mario Vargas Llosa, member 200-year-old Royal Spanish Language Academy, Martinez Cachero said, Portugal's Jose Saramago, whose work translated 20 language. For part, Saramago, 75, said recent Associated Press interview he's weary speculation year, again, might win. Let's get that, said. I write. Jose Saramago, 75-year-old Portuguese writer took literature relatively late life whose richly imaginative novel soon loyal reader Europe vocal admirer United States, awarded year's Nobel Prize Literature Thursday Swedish Academy Stockholm. A tall, balding man whose large, tinted glass give mien severity, Saramago first Portuguese-language writer one first card-carrying Communists become Nobel Literature laureate. He also fourth successive European win prize, Italy's Dario Fo 1997, Poland's Wislawa Szymborska 1996 Ireland's Seamus Heaney 1995. In citation Thursday, Swedish Academy praised Saramago parable sustained imagination, compassion irony continually enables u apprehend elusory reality. Although Saramago discount influence Latin American magical realism work, novel use supernatural, allegorical, paradoxical irrational way addressing complex question faith existence. Many novel set backdrop political historical event, unwavering concern individual fate give fiction distinctive voice independent character. His best-known book, published United States, Baltasar Blimunda, The Year Death Ricardo Reis, The Stone Raft The History Siege Lisbon. His latest book available English, Blindness, one character mysteriously become blind, described symphonic new novel Andrew Miller The New York Times Book Review Sunday. There cynicism conclusion, clear-eyed compassionate acknowledgment thing are, quality honestly termed wisdom, Miller, novelist, wrote. We grateful handed u generous measure. Saramago learned award Thursday Frankfurt airport, preparing fly home Madrid Lanzarote Canary Islands attending Frankfurt Book Fair. Earlier week, participated round-table Portuguese writer topic, Why I still Communist. He immediately returned fair received cheer bouquet rose. I personally happy myself, said. I also happy country. Later told news conference: The Portuguese language wait 100 year this. There way mean protecting language become museum, something alive. The writer's role protect work it. The award also celebrated Lisbon, President Jorge Sampaio described recognition Portuguese culture, local Communist leader, Carlos Carvalho, saw credit party. As member party, noted solemnly, Saramago make great contribution ideal struggle social change. The laureate's fiction, though, never overtly political. Saramago, whose body work includes poetry, essay, play journal well 10 novel, unusual emerged major literary figure age 60. His novel translated 30 language, selling particularly well Portugal, Brazil, Spain, Italy Germany. While well known United States, novel always critically well received there. For late blooming, though, Saramago long dreamed becoming writer. Born family rural laborer raised Lisbon, forced poverty leave school teen-ager learn trade car mechanic. Yet managed publish small novel age 25. Later, found work Lisbon publishing company, oppressive censorial atmosphere Salazar dictatorship discouraged writing. It Portugal's April 1974 revolution Saramago felt free find voice. A member Portuguese Communist Party 1969, served editor Lisbon newspaper, Diario de Noticias, 18-month period left looked likely seize power Portugal. But anti-Communist backlash November 1975 forced newspaper began translating French text Portuguese make end meet. In late 1970s, also turned novel, publishing three succession 1977, 1978 1980. But 1982, Baltasar Blimunda (Memorial Convento Portuguese), achieved international breakthrough. This rich, multifaceted polysemous text time historical, social individual perspective, Swedish Academy noted Thursday. The insight wealth imagination give expression characteristic Saramago's work whole. Set 18th-century Portugal Inquisition, book tell baroque effort war veteran, Baltasar, visionary, Blimunda, escape heaven flying machine powered human will captured hypersensory Blimunda. This fantastic story take place real background tortuous construction massive Mafra Convent thousand men held grip Inquisition. When novel published United States 1987, Irving Howe acclaimed brilliant The New York Times Book Review. Mr. Saramago constantly present voice European skepticism, connoisseur irony, Howe wrote. I think I hear prose echo Enlightenment sensibility, caustic shrewd. In next novel, The Year Death Ricardo Reis, also homage great Portuguese poet Fernando Pessoa, appears ghost, Saramago set story early year Salazar dictatorship, tale romantic sexual misadventure poet-physician. Writing The New York Times, Herbert Mitgang called rare, old-fashioned novel lyrical, symbolic meditative. Saramago, whose sense literary freedom evident unconventional punctuation conflicting use tense, sought different form freedom The Stone Raft, imago confusion unleashed Iberian peninsula suddenly break free rest Europe begin drifting New World threatens collide Azores. To delight Britons, Gibraltar left behind. Unsurprisingly, bitter satire, The Gospel According Jesus Christ, proved controversial, God shown using innocently human Jesus create religion spawned violence intolerance. When Lisbon jury picked book Portugal's entry 1992 European literary prize, country's conservative government vetoed choice blasphemous. It Saramago decided leave small, crowded apartment Lisbon relative solitude Lanzarote. The History Siege Lisbon, published United States last year, whimsical tale set motion decision humble proofreader publishing house insert word key passage standard history Portugal. With lunatic creative act, Edmund White put The New York Times Book Review, totally derails national saga affirming crusader fact help liberate 12th-century Lisbon Moorish occupation. White ended July 1997 review prescient remark. Word Saramago overdue Nobel Prize, noted. No candidate better claim lasting recognition novelist. With recent publication Blindness United States, Saramago's latest novel, Todos o Nomes, All Names still awaits translation English. In tradition Andre Gide Julian Green, though, embarked journal. The fourth volume Cadernos de Lanzarote published Lisbon. Saramago receive Nobel Prize, worth equivalent $967,500 year, ceremony Stockholm Dec. 10. Three American pharmacologist awarded Nobel Prize Monday surprising discovery natural production gas, nitric oxide, mediate wide variety bodily action.

In energy businesses financial services, telecommunications automobiles, global competition technology made unthinkable combinations practical, necessary. Oil companies Exxon Corp. Mobil Corp. additional pressure, one unthinkable less two decades ago. Crude oil prices fallen sharply, plunging 40 percent year levels, adjusted inflation, seen first oil embargo 25 years ago. As such, oil companies, spent years cutting costs, desperate savings order continue operating profitably low prices. Exxon Mobil two largest, strongest competitors emerge nation's famous antitrust case, 1911 breakup John D. Rockefeller's Standard Oil Trust. Now face Royal Dutch/Shell Group larger either them. They also confront British Petroleum PLC made far potent United States agreement summer buy Amoco Corp. $48.2 billion. Industry executives say deals scale inevitable. Executives companies return calls Thursday comment talks, unclear Thursday night outcome might be. But Exxon Mobil agree become one, antitrust regulators likely cautious putting back together much long ago broke apart. Even so, oil industry analysts contend improved efficiency combining giant energy companies would lower costs concentrated ownership gas stations refineries would raise them. The ultimate beneficiary consumer, said Daniel Yergin, chairman Cambridge Energy Research Associates. If Exxon Mobil ultimately combine, costs could prove heaviest energy industry employees. Analysts say 80,000 global employees Exxon, based Irving, Texas, 40,000 Mobil, Fairfax, Va., thousands would likely lose jobs. Exxon, Lee R. Raymond, Mobil, Lucio A. Noto, chief executives preoccupied humbling accommodations low oil prices made necessary. Oil companies everybody's favorite targets trust-busting era early century Arab oil embargoes 1970s. Now seem especially vulnerable demand weakens much world, especially economically troubled Asia, weighing already depressed prices. They're pitiful, helpless giants, said Ronald Chernow, author Titan, biography John D. Rockefeller, Standard Oil's founder. As such, giants compelled continue cutting costs spreading risks huge, expensive international projects needed develop oil reserves needed next century. Mobil, $58.4 billion sales last year, might seem large enough undertake anything. But competing rights develop huge natural gas fields Turkmenistan, former Soviet republic, Mobil unable match Shell's offer build pipeline $1 billion more. Oil companies decided cannot count rebound oil prices revive fortunes time soon. Earlier month, Energy Department predicted collapse Asian demand would continue depress oil prices nearly decade, much $5.50 barrel year 2000. And Thursday, Organization Petroleum Exporting Countries put March decision extending oil production cutbacks prop prices. Moreover, improving technology exploration production opening new regions development added already huge supply oil hand now. In response, many energy companies already begun new wave cutbacks staffs operations. To reduce costs, companies Mobil forming partnerships stop short full mergers. Two years ago, Mobil agreed combine European refining marketing operations British Petroleum's, resulting annual savings $500 million. Shell Texaco formed refining partnership United States. In face partnerships, said Amy Jaffe, energy analysts James A. Baker III Institute Public Policy Houston, Exxon, compete? Though Mobil Exxon might high concentrations gas stations certain areas United States, analysts say far competition pump oil prices collapsed 1980s. Thousands convenience stores also sell gasoline produced variety refining companies, foreign national oil companies, Venezuela's, sell supplies acquired companies Citgo. Under Noto, Mobil hunting ways becoming large lean enough survive. He took lead deal British Petroleum considered buying smaller companies. And made clear corporate personal pride would never block deal. In European agreement British Petroleum, Mobil's red flying horses come fronts many gas stations, green yellow BP logos gone up. As major oil companies team up, said John Hervey, analyst Donaldson Lufkin &AMP; Jenrette, If price right, egos get way. In past, Mobil reportedly talks British Petroleum combinations, well talks Amoco forming American refining venture. The company also interested Conoco Inc. DuPont Co. began looking divest oil gas business. But deals reached. More recently, speculation Wall Street Mobil talking Chevron Corp. British Petroleum purchase Amoco put pressure Noto seek deal, Hervey said. I think whole thing would started British Petroleum pulled trigger, said. The British Petroleum-Amoco deal, progressing quickly August announcement expected $2 billion annual savings, put companies large Exxon spot. There, Raymond far concentrated making operations efficient finding allies. Though Royal Dutch/Shell's financial resources greater Exxon's, analysts say Exxon still size soundness absorb company Mobil's size. Only largest oil companies afford take advantage today's best opportunities. Finding new fields deep waters coast West Africa Gulf Mexico require platforms costing $1 billion more. Producing oil states former Soviet Union taken time money many investors anticipated. In September, Noto American executives invited Saudi leader visiting Washington greatly step investments country, too. Noto spent 1977 1985 Saudi Arabia himself, building Mobil operations including huge refinery. But new partnerships Saudis might require Mobil's connections Exxon's capital. Back Standard Oil organized operations state, Exxon Standard Oil New Jersey, Mobil Standard Oil New York. Even Standard Oil monopoly broken up, remained several years building Manhattan. Chernow, Rockefeller biographer, noted two pieces Standard Oil trust already likely united. British Petroleum bought Standard Oil Ohio 1970s, Amoco Standard Oil Indiana. The break-up Standard Oil resulting competition cited precedent current antitrust action Microsoft. Chernow sees reason allowing Exxon acquisition Mobil go suggest leniency Microsoft. Exxon would obviously larger leading competitors, way Microsoft is, said. In energy business today, added, large dinosaurs stalk particular jungle. The boards Exxon Corp. Mobil Corp. expected meet Tuesday consider possible merger agreement would form world's largest oil company, source close negotiations said Friday. The source, spoke condition anonymity, said prospects good completing agreement. Exxon Mobil confirmed Friday discussing ways combine. They cautioned, however, agreement reached assurance would reach one. The statement sent stock companies surging, suggesting investors believe companies combine. Shares Exxon, biggest U.S. oil company, rose $1.6875, 2.3 percent, $74.375. Shares Mobil, No. 2 U.S. oil company, rose $7.625, 9.7 percent, $86. Some analysts said two giants reached agreement, likely form takeover Exxon Mobil. Exxon far larger financially stronger. Analysts predicted would huge cuts duplicate staff companies, employ 122,700 people. Adam Sieminski, oil analyst BT Alex. Brown, said companies would probably make cuts $3 billion $5 billion year. Sieminski analysts said Exxon would offer premium 15 20 percent price prior Monday, serious speculation Exxon takeover Mobil first circulated sent Mobil shares sharply. They said transaction would probably exchange Mobil shares Exxon shares. Based Mobil's $75.25 share price week ago, takeover company would worth $70 billion. The merger discussions come backdrop particularly severe pressure Lucio Noto, chairman, president chief executive Mobil, find new reserves oil natural gas keep big projects profitable time deep decline crude oil prices. This one intelligent chief executives business man considerable ability inherited serious structural problems company, said J. Robin West, chairman Petroleum Finance Co., consulting group energy industry based Washington. He said Mobil's prime assets include Arun natural gas field Indonesia, one largest world, contributed one-third Mobil's profits years beginning run down. The field, production 1977, supplies liquefied natural gas Japan Korea. Although Mobil Noto moved quickly cut costs muscle way promising new areas Kazakhstan, partner joint venture develop huge Tengiz oil field, payoff ventures many years away. Other companies face similar strains. The challenge replace crown jewels grow increasingly competitive environment, West said. Noto shy sitting companies British Petroleum Amoco year see combination made sense. Although Exxon chairman Lee Raymond heads much stronger bigger company Mobil, immune strains global petroleum business. Those strains intensified year Russia's economic collapse raised risks Exxon's extensive exploration venture country. Exxon also follower leader huge projects deep offshore fields, major finds made West Africa Gulf Mexico. News Exxon Mobil, two giants energy patch, merger talks last week biggest sign corporate marriages back vogue. Even combination came light, deal-making fast furious. On Monday alone, $40.4 billion corporate acquisitions either announced declared imminent. Driving resurgence mergers roaring stock market, recognition major corporations getting harder increase revenues internally growing confidence market players economy plunge recession next year. There also industry-specific issues, low crude-oil prices driving oil giants one another's arms. But investors, mega-marriages real money made. Rather, smaller companies, whose still-depressed stock prices luring bigger acquirers stocks peaks. If Exxon buys Mobil close current prices, deals month total value $140 billion  April's peak $244 billion three times volume September, stock market falling. Which industries likely witness mergers? Tom Burnett, director Merger Insight, institutional investment advisory firm New York, says deals certainty energy, suffering low crude-oil prices. Burnett also says health care executives finding tougher ever lift earnings. But smaller companies may better way play takeover game. Charles LaLoggia, editor Special Situation Investor newsletter Potomac, Md., said: Some premiums high-profile mergers great anymore. The values small-cap stocks. Another reason deals involving smaller-cap candidates less likely incur wrath antitrust regulators. LaLoggia reckons odds picking takeover winners increase investor focuses companies already partially owned another. In energy sector, Houston Exploration qualifies, says; oil gas driller 66 percent owned Keyspan Energy. He also believes deals imminent drug chains supermarkets. Longs Drug Stores Drug Emporium, says, remain acquisition candidates, though neither controlled another concern. In supermarkets, LaLoggia likes Great Atlantic &AMP; Pacific Tea Co., 55 percent owned Tengelmann Group Germany. Another pick Smart Final, operator warehouse-style stores 55 percent owned U.S. subsidiary Groupe Casino, France's largest supermarket chain. Both A&AMP;P Smart Final trading book value, LaLoggia said. Takeovers typically occur book value. Finally, recommends National Presto Industries, maker housewares electrical appliances, trading $39, close low year. The company $30 share cash balance sheet, debt dividend yield 5 percent. After last month's announced acquisition Rubbermaid Newell Co., LaLoggia thinks National Presto could find acquirer's cross-hairs.

Johnson said thought investors, inspired Federal Reserve's three interest rate cuts two months new stimulus package Japan, assume problems solved. Investors looking valley they see, said. But worries financial crisis, began Thailand July 1997 intensified effective default Russia August, go away quickly. It seems every financial crisis, everybody gets impression storm passed, Johnson said. But never easy. Exxon Corp. Mobil Corp. held discussions combining business operations, person involved talks said Wednesday. It unclear Wednesday whether talks continuing. If companies merge, would create largest U.S. company terms revenue. A possible merger reported separately The Financial Times London Bloomberg News. The reported talks Exxon, whose annual revenue exceeds Wal-Mart General Electric, Mobil, No. 2 U.S. oil company, come oil prices sunk lowest almost 12 years. A combined company would bigger Royal Dutch/Shell Group, world's largest oil company revenue. Financial terms discussions could determined Wednesday. Neither Exxon Mobil would comment. Any union would reunite two parts John D. Rockefeller's Standard Oil Trust, broken Supreme Court 1911. Exxon known Standard Oil New Jersey, Mobil consisted two companies: Standard Oil New York Vacuum Oil. Both Exxon, market value $176.7 billion, Mobil, market value $61.1 billion, history fiercely independence. Both already cut back staff made lean order survive long periods oil prices low. But particularly unsettling year oil industry, little prospect crude oil prices recover soon. Consequently, chief executives oil companies swallow pride look suitable partners. This summer, British Petroleum announced $48.2 billion agreement buy Amoco Corp., creating world's third-largest oil company prompting analysts predict widespread consolidation. It showed megamergers doable, said Adam Sieminski, analyst BT Alex. Brown. He added, however, combination Exxon Mobil would easy match Mobil known proud company said would want merge. Exxon, added, well run company likes grow businesses. He added heads companies, Lee Raymond, chairman Exxon, based Irving, Texas, Lucio Noto, chairman, president chief executive Mobil, based Fairfax, Va., different personalities. It easy, said combining two far-flung companies, vast networks refineries gas stations overlap United States Europe. If offer enough money make anything happen, added. Both companies pressure find new fields oil help survive long term. Like oil companies, hoped quickly tap vast reserves Russia. Even though prepared spend billions, held back political economic crisis Russia great reluctance Russian officials oil companies give control vast fields. Thus fall back exploration areas deep waters Gulf Mexico West Africa. Such exploration expensive, large fields found takes platforms costing $1 billion bring oil production. Oil prices pressure year, falling 40 percent $20-a-barrel level growing inventories petroleum declining Asian demand caused economic crisis there. On Wednesday, crude oil January delivery fell 29 cents, 2.6 percent, $11.86 barrel New York Mercantile Exchange, close 12-year low $11.42 reached June 15. Members Organization Petroleum Exporting Countries oil-producing nations, notably Mexico, tried stem price drops pledges cut back production. But pledges always honored, rallies oil market year proven short-lived. OPEC members Wednesday continued discussion extending production cutbacks, agreement expected early Thursday. In spring, OPEC agreed reduce production 2.6 million barrels day, 3 percent daily world supply 74 million barrels. The main result agreement appears keep oil prices falling $10 barrel. Washington regulators said Wednesday notified Exxon-Mobil discussions. The Federal Trade Commission still reviewing British Petroleum's pending purchase Amoco. An Exxon-Mobil deal would certain receive several months' worth scrutiny commission, would review much industry merger would control. Analysts investment bankers split logic possible merger. Some pointed difficulties companies could face combined. If asked Exxon needed bigger, answer probably no, said Garfield Miller, president Aegis Energy Advisors Corp., small independent investment bank based New York. It hard say anything particular gain. In particular, Miller said, two companies enormous similarities domestic refining marketing businesses. They really overlap quite bit, said. You really wonder benefit redundancy. Another investment banker energy business, speaking condition anonymity, also questioned rationale discussed merger. When look BP-Amoco deal, rationalize it, banker said. But none reasons apply Exxon-Mobil deal. But Amy Jaffe, energy research analyst James A. Baker III Institute Public Policy, said combination two companies would logical, part would give greater influence bidding projects Middle Eastern countries. This deal makes sense, Ms. Jaffe said. With combined company, project would big. In addition, Ms. Jaffe said, merger would provide company new oil gas assets areas world little influence. There lot complimentary assets redundant, said. She said Exxon, example, strong presence Angola, Mobil not. And Mobil significant assets Caspian Sea Nigeria, Exxon weak. Exxon Mobil, nation's two largest oil companies, confirmed Friday discussing possible merger, antitrust lawyers, industry analysts government officials predicted deal would require sale important large pieces new corporate behemoth. Those divestitures would reshape industry already undergoing broad transformation low price oil. But mergers corporate combinations also beginning create new regulatory climate antitrust officials, one may prove particularly challenging Exxon Mobil. Although companies confirmed discussing possibility merger, person close discussions said boards Exxon Mobil expected meet Tuesday consider agreement. Shares surged New York Stock Exchange. Oil exploration drilling interests would necessarily present antitrust problems Exxon-Mobil merger competition areas brisk. But retailing marketing operations, Exxon-Mobil combination would Ford merging General Motors, Macy's Gimbels, said Stephen Axinn, antitrust lawyer New York represented Texaco acquisition Getty decade ago. In United States, deal would come purview Federal Trade Commission, Clinton administration examined large corporate mergers vigor seen 1970s. The agency blocked number proposed mergers, $4 billion combination Staples Office Depot, two largest office supply discounters, two deals involving four largest drug wholesalers. On hand approved big mergers, Boeing's $14 billion acquisition McDonnell Douglas. The agency's analysis Exxon-Mobil combination, senior official said Friday, turn might resemble John D. Rockefeller's Standard Oil trust dismantled Supreme Court 1911. The big antitrust issue whether, merger alliance, able get competition one another backs, particularly background BP-Amoco Shell-Texaco, said Eleanor M. Fox, professor New York University School Law antitrust expert. It may looking consolidation world level looked consolidation national level 100 years ago. The Federal Trade Commission recently approved significant joint venture Shell Texaco venture agreed sell refinery divest retailing operations Hawaii California. It also proposed $54 billion merger British Petroleum Amoco re-examine combination light new talks Exxon Mobil. In past, two mergers involving industry, government considered together deciding deal them, said Terry Calvani, former commissioner Federal Trade Commission whose clients include Chevron. But coming aftermath Shell-Texaco BP-Amoco deals, combination Exxon Mobil, significantly overlapping retail refinery businesses United States Europe, poses questions antitrust officials confronted 1980s. It's real test case, said Frederick Leuffer, senior energy analyst Bear Stearns. If FTC let one go major divesting, everything would fair game. Why GM merge Ford? While 1911 breakup Standard Oil viewed Washington officials industry executives ancient history, Exxon Mobil become dominant rivals retailing refining markets, production lubricants petrochemicals. Leuffer said believed divestitures necessary case could large deal-breakers. Other analysts lawyers, disagreeing required divestitures could kill deal, said companies would nonetheless shed significant operations expected challenges raised broad spectrum constituents, including competitors, customers state officials. These absolute obstacles, said John Hervey, analyst Donaldson Lufkin &AMP; Jenrette. In past, two big oil companies merged, aggressive attorneys general states almost always become involved raising questions high visibility local gas station. When state attorney general drives sees four stations corner two Mobil Exxon, certain raise questions, Axinn said. Exxon Mobil significant concentrations retailing marketing concerns Northeast, Southwest West Coast, also big refining operations. Because two companies involved everything exploration shipping refining retailing, meaning deal consumers take months regulators sort out. The regulators examining transaction would dissect business, determine whether market global, national local, determine whether combined entity high concentration business areas. Experts agreed regulators likely permit Exxon Mobil keep exploratory oil production businesses areas already highly competitive merger would result higher prices. Hervey said markets already fragmented combined market share major American European oil companies 17 percent. They downsized, cut back re-engineered. So 900 remaining blue-collar workers Mobil's largest domestic refinery, 1,500 decade ago, heard last week company discussing possible merger Exxon, siren warning already suspect valve might blow. I think terrible thing, said Dick Mabry, refinery operator, emerged plant's artificial twilight main gate 12-hour shift ended 4:30 Sunday morning. He stopped rub eyes rimmed red, topic bedtime could delayed. It's revival Standard Oil Company. It's going put 20 30 thousand people work. I think Justice Department step stop it. Ernest Lewis, whose overalls bore Big E patch appropriate scale, added uh-huh's. The latest evidence things heading hulked right nearby, said, glancing new power plant likely operated company unions man refinery's generators. But Mobil Corp. sold, Lewis said, noting gains company stock holdings, buyer solid large Exxon Corp. might least evils. If merged Chevron, we'd Moron, added. A growing American economy make billionaire someone unproven idea Internet marketing still sloughing workers older industries, petroleum much any. Those point tote board Beaumont plant's brick headquarters, say shows already handled 171 million barrels 130 million planned full year. But numbers matter ones 89.9, 88.9, 81.9, nearby gas stations  lowest prices, inflation, Depression. Which Mobil Exxon combining world's largest oil company. Some people close talks cautioned deal would considered boards least Tuesday, maybe Wednesday. And why, beginning last Wednesday evening, phone home Jimmy Herrington, president Oil, Chemical Atomic Workers Local 4-243 rang stop. No, know merger talk television, said Herrington, also works full-time producing lubricants. He asked Mobil managers, meeting earlier month, rumors, said heard nothing. Oil industry analysts say first targets combined company's efforts cut billions dollars annual costs would office staff professionals, geologists engineers, field. One company's accountants could almost work two. But crews fully expect Exxon buyer would ask whether refinery could turn crude oil gasoline, motor oil products fewer people. Union leaders raise prospect Exxon would sell refinery. Antitrust regulators, say, bound notice Exxon refineries hour's drive one direction three hours other, Gulf Mexico crescent forms petrochemical industry's home. The Beaumont plant, steaming, humming chemistry set lining Neches River Gulf, become prime provider livelihoods built almost spray nearby Spindletop gusher. With mounting overtime stretch shift 16 hours more, workers regularly make $55,000 $65,000 year. People go retire there, Herrington said, drove plant's fenced periphery. Lewis, 17th year, third-generation employee. But nephew laboring exception. The workers streaming plant dawn mostly balding going gray, sign full generation refinery concerned get rid workers attract them. The cutbacks have, far, come attrition, retirements encouraged incentives. But plywood sheets covering windows fast food places gas stations Herrington's union hall advertise best times long gone. His members chafe experts come Wall Street question justification every person's job. In tiring dangerous tasks, question elimination relief laborers favor covering vacations sickness overtime (although extra pay, say plant become safer years). They complain growing numbers contractors taking formerly unionized tasks. But many workers choosing invest least retirement savings Mobil stock, 1990s ethos gaining. Some share credit plant's management efficiency measures agree necessary true job security. Some take attitude every company always sale. They concerned feel it, said Sam Salim, one electrical plant workers whose future uncertain. But fork $60 billion? I'd look over. With Mobil executives saying little possible now, calls Sunday local plant manager company spokesman elicit peep. Union leaders, however, already squawking. I believe creating new monopolies way prop industry, said Robert Wages, former refinery operator union's president, telephone Saturday. Nevertheless, admirable foresight union negotiated clause last November's three-year contract extension guaranteeing company buyer would keep terms. Many members, typically came work high school, already molding oil companies' latest exploits case studies fit rapacious MBA's. They're biggest, said Bobby Whisneant, assistant operator gasoline lubrication oil units, referring Exxon. He coming, early Sunday morning, plant gate whose white canopy seems borrowed self-service station. So go buy second biggest. That's one way get rid competition. I hope something 80s  buying companies scrapping them. Or something Robber Baron era century before, said Mabry, another operator. Didn't teachers teach us school Standard Oil Company would never come back? Remember that? said, looking friend, Lewis, Big E, agreement. But I better shut up. I still work Mobil. Used to, Lewis said. Exxon Corp. Mobil Corp. held discussions combining business operations, person involved talks said Wednesday. It unclear Wednesday whether talks continuing. If companies merge, would create largest U.S. company terms revenue. A possible merger reported separately The Financial Times London Bloomberg News.

In energy business financial service, telecommunication automobile, global competition technology made unthinkable combination practical, necessary. Oil company Exxon Corp. Mobil Corp. additional pressure, one unthinkable le two decade ago. Crude oil price fallen sharply, plunging 40 percent year level, adjusted inflation, seen first oil embargo 25 year ago. As such, oil company, spent year cutting cost, desperate saving order continue operating profitably low price. Exxon Mobil two largest, strongest competitor emerge nation's famous antitrust case, 1911 breakup John D. Rockefeller's Standard Oil Trust. Now face Royal Dutch/Shell Group larger either them. They also confront British Petroleum PLC made far potent United States agreement summer buy Amoco Corp. $48.2 billion. Industry executive say deal scale inevitable. Executives company return call Thursday comment talk, unclear Thursday night outcome might be. But Exxon Mobil agree become one, antitrust regulator likely cautious putting back together much long ago broke apart. Even so, oil industry analyst contend improved efficiency combining giant energy company would lower cost concentrated ownership gas station refinery would raise them. The ultimate beneficiary consumer, said Daniel Yergin, chairman Cambridge Energy Research Associates. If Exxon Mobil ultimately combine, cost could prove heaviest energy industry employee. Analysts say 80,000 global employee Exxon, based Irving, Texas, 40,000 Mobil, Fairfax, Va., thousand would likely lose job. Exxon, Lee R. Raymond, Mobil, Lucio A. Noto, chief executive preoccupied humbling accommodation low oil price made necessary. Oil company everybody's favorite target trust-busting era early century Arab oil embargo 1970s. Now seem especially vulnerable demand weakens much world, especially economically troubled Asia, weighing already depressed price. They're pitiful, helpless giant, said Ronald Chernow, author Titan, biography John D. Rockefeller, Standard Oil's founder. As such, giant compelled continue cutting cost spreading risk huge, expensive international project needed develop oil reserve needed next century. Mobil, $58.4 billion sale last year, might seem large enough undertake anything. But competing right develop huge natural gas field Turkmenistan, former Soviet republic, Mobil unable match Shell's offer build pipeline $1 billion more. Oil company decided cannot count rebound oil price revive fortune time soon. Earlier month, Energy Department predicted collapse Asian demand would continue depress oil price nearly decade, much $5.50 barrel year 2000. And Thursday, Organization Petroleum Exporting Countries put March decision extending oil production cutback prop price. Moreover, improving technology exploration production opening new region development added already huge supply oil hand now. In response, many energy company already begun new wave cutback staff operation. To reduce cost, company Mobil forming partnership stop short full merger. Two year ago, Mobil agreed combine European refining marketing operation British Petroleum's, resulting annual saving $500 million. Shell Texaco formed refining partnership United States. In face partnership, said Amy Jaffe, energy analyst James A. Baker III Institute Public Policy Houston, Exxon, compete? Though Mobil Exxon might high concentration gas station certain area United States, analyst say far competition pump oil price collapsed 1980s. Thousands convenience store also sell gasoline produced variety refining company, foreign national oil company, Venezuela's, sell supply acquired company Citgo. Under Noto, Mobil hunting way becoming large lean enough survive. He took lead deal British Petroleum considered buying smaller company. And made clear corporate personal pride would never block deal. In European agreement British Petroleum, Mobil's red flying horse come front many gas station, green yellow BP logo gone up. As major oil company team up, said John Hervey, analyst Donaldson Lufkin &AMP; Jenrette, If price right, ego get way. In past, Mobil reportedly talk British Petroleum combination, well talk Amoco forming American refining venture. The company also interested Conoco Inc. DuPont Co. began looking divest oil gas business. But deal reached. More recently, speculation Wall Street Mobil talking Chevron Corp. British Petroleum purchase Amoco put pressure Noto seek deal, Hervey said. I think whole thing would started British Petroleum pulled trigger, said. The British Petroleum-Amoco deal, progressing quickly August announcement expected $2 billion annual saving, put company large Exxon spot. There, Raymond far concentrated making operation efficient finding ally. Though Royal Dutch/Shell's financial resource greater Exxon's, analyst say Exxon still size soundness absorb company Mobil's size. Only largest oil company afford take advantage today's best opportunity. Finding new field deep water coast West Africa Gulf Mexico require platform costing $1 billion more. Producing oil state former Soviet Union taken time money many investor anticipated. In September, Noto American executive invited Saudi leader visiting Washington greatly step investment country, too. Noto spent 1977 1985 Saudi Arabia himself, building Mobil operation including huge refinery. But new partnership Saudis might require Mobil's connection Exxon's capital. Back Standard Oil organized operation state, Exxon Standard Oil New Jersey, Mobil Standard Oil New York. Even Standard Oil monopoly broken up, remained several year building Manhattan. Chernow, Rockefeller biographer, noted two piece Standard Oil trust already likely united. British Petroleum bought Standard Oil Ohio 1970s, Amoco Standard Oil Indiana. The break-up Standard Oil resulting competition cited precedent current antitrust action Microsoft. Chernow see reason allowing Exxon acquisition Mobil go suggest leniency Microsoft. Exxon would obviously larger leading competitor, way Microsoft is, said. In energy business today, added, large dinosaur stalk particular jungle. The board Exxon Corp. Mobil Corp. expected meet Tuesday consider possible merger agreement would form world's largest oil company, source close negotiation said Friday. The source, spoke condition anonymity, said prospect good completing agreement. Exxon Mobil confirmed Friday discussing way combine. They cautioned, however, agreement reached assurance would reach one. The statement sent stock company surging, suggesting investor believe company combine. Shares Exxon, biggest US. oil company, rose $1.6875, 2.3 percent, $74375. Shares Mobil, No. 2 US. oil company, rose $7.625, 9.7 percent, $86. Some analyst said two giant reached agreement, likely form takeover Exxon Mobil. Exxon far larger financially stronger. Analysts predicted would huge cut duplicate staff company, employ 122,700 people. Adam Sieminski, oil analyst BT Alex. Brown, said company would probably make cut $3 billion $5 billion year. Sieminski analyst said Exxon would offer premium 15 20 percent price prior Monday, serious speculation Exxon takeover Mobil first circulated sent Mobil share sharply. They said transaction would probably exchange Mobil share Exxon share. Based Mobil's $75.25 share price week ago, takeover company would worth $70 billion. The merger discussion come backdrop particularly severe pressure Lucio Noto, chairman, president chief executive Mobil, find new reserve oil natural gas keep big project profitable time deep decline crude oil price. This one intelligent chief executive business man considerable ability inherited serious structural problem company, said J. Robin West, chairman Petroleum Finance Co., consulting group energy industry based Washington. He said Mobil's prime asset include Arun natural gas field Indonesia, one largest world, contributed one-third Mobil's profit year beginning run down. The field, production 1977, supply liquefied natural gas Japan Korea. Although Mobil Noto moved quickly cut cost muscle way promising new area Kazakhstan, partner joint venture develop huge Tengiz oil field, payoff venture many year away. Other company face similar strain. The challenge replace crown jewel grow increasingly competitive environment, West said. Noto shy sitting company British Petroleum Amoco year see combination made sense. Although Exxon chairman Lee Raymond head much stronger bigger company Mobil, immune strain global petroleum business. Those strain intensified year Russia's economic collapse raised risk Exxon's extensive exploration venture country. Exxon also follower leader huge project deep offshore field, major find made West Africa Gulf Mexico. News Exxon Mobil, two giant energy patch, merger talk last week biggest sign corporate marriage back vogue. Even combination came light, deal-making fast furious. On Monday alone, $40.4 billion corporate acquisition either announced declared imminent. Driving resurgence merger roaring stock market, recognition major corporation getting harder increase revenue internally growing confidence market player economy plunge recession next year. There also industry-specific issue, low crude-oil price driving oil giant one another's arm. But investor, mega-marriages real money made. Rather, smaller company, whose still-depressed stock price luring bigger acquirer stock peak. If Exxon buy Mobil close current price, deal month total value $140 billion April's peak $244 billion three time volume September, stock market falling. Which industry likely witness merger? Tom Burnett, director Merger Insight, institutional investment advisory firm New York, say deal certainty energy, suffering low crude-oil price. Burnett also say health care executive finding tougher ever lift earnings. But smaller company may better way play takeover game. Charles LaLoggia, editor Special Situation Investor newsletter Potomac, Md., said: Some premium high-profile merger great anymore. The value small-cap stock. Another reason deal involving smaller-cap candidate le likely incur wrath antitrust regulator. LaLoggia reckons odds picking takeover winner increase investor focus company already partially owned another. In energy sector, Houston Exploration qualifies, says; oil gas driller 66 percent owned Keyspan Energy. He also belief deal imminent drug chain supermarket. Longs Drug Stores Drug Emporium, say, remain acquisition candidate, though neither controlled another concern. In supermarket, LaLoggia like Great Atlantic &AMP; Pacific Tea Co., 55 percent owned Tengelmann Group Germany. Another pick Smart Final, operator warehouse-style store 55 percent owned US. subsidiary Groupe Casino, France's largest supermarket chain. Both A&AMP;P Smart Final trading book value, LaLoggia said. Takeovers typically occur book value. Finally, recommends National Presto Industries, maker housewares electrical appliance, trading $39, close low year. The company $30 share cash balance sheet, debt dividend yield 5 percent. After last month's announced acquisition Rubbermaid Newell Co., LaLoggia think National Presto could find acquirer's cross-hairs.

Many analyst noted eight-week stock market rally, Nasdaq composite index jumped 42 percent, investor buying though major financial problem world including slumping Asia, weakening Latin America troubled Russia resolved. Johnson said thought investor, inspired Federal Reserve's three interest rate cut two month new stimulus package Japan, assume problem solved. Investors looking valley they see, said. But worry financial crisis, began Thailand July 1997 intensified effective default Russia August, go away quickly. It seems every financial crisis, everybody get impression storm passed, Johnson said. But never easy. Exxon Corp. Mobil Corp. held discussion combining business operation, person involved talk said Wednesday. It unclear Wednesday whether talk continuing. If company merge, would create largest US. company term revenue. A possible merger reported separately The Financial Times London Bloomberg News. The reported talk Exxon, whose annual revenue exceeds Wal-Mart General Electric, Mobil, No. 2 US. oil company, come oil price sunk lowest almost 12 year. A combined company would bigger Royal Dutch/Shell Group, world's largest oil company revenue. Financial term discussion could determined Wednesday. Neither Exxon Mobil would comment. Any union would reunite two part John D. Rockefeller's Standard Oil Trust, broken Supreme Court 1911. Exxon known Standard Oil New Jersey, Mobil consisted two companies: Standard Oil New York Vacuum Oil. Both Exxon, market value $176.7 billion, Mobil, market value $61.1 billion, history fiercely independence. Both already cut back staff made lean order survive long period oil price low. But particularly unsettling year oil industry, little prospect crude oil price recover soon. Consequently, chief executive oil company swallow pride look suitable partner. This summer, British Petroleum announced $48.2 billion agreement buy Amoco Corp., creating world's third-largest oil company prompting analyst predict widespread consolidation. It showed megamergers doable, said Adam Sieminski, analyst BT Alex. Brown. He added, however, combination Exxon Mobil would easy match Mobil known proud company said would want merge. Exxon, added, well run company like grow business. He added head company, Lee Raymond, chairman Exxon, based Irving, Texas, Lucio Noto, chairman, president chief executive Mobil, based Fairfax, Va., different personality. It easy, said combining two far-flung company, vast network refinery gas station overlap United States Europe. If offer enough money make anything happen, added. Both company pressure find new field oil help survive long term. Like oil company, hoped quickly tap vast reserve Russia. Even though prepared spend billion, held back political economic crisis Russia great reluctance Russian official oil company give control vast field. Thus fall back exploration area deep water Gulf Mexico West Africa. Such exploration expensive, large field found take platform costing $1 billion bring oil production. Oil price pressure year, falling 40 percent $20-a-barrel level growing inventory petroleum declining Asian demand caused economic crisis there. On Wednesday, crude oil January delivery fell 29 cent, 2.6 percent, $11.86 barrel New York Mercantile Exchange, close 12-year low $11.42 reached June 15. Members Organization Petroleum Exporting Countries oil-producing nation, notably Mexico, tried stem price drop pledge cut back production. But pledge always honored, rally oil market year proven short-lived. OPEC member Wednesday continued discussion extending production cutback, agreement expected early Thursday. In spring, OPEC agreed reduce production 2.6 million barrel day, 3 percent daily world supply 74 million barrel. The main result agreement appears keep oil price falling $10 barrel. Washington regulator said Wednesday notified Exxon-Mobil discussion. The Federal Trade Commission still reviewing British Petroleum's pending purchase Amoco. An Exxon-Mobil deal would certain receive several months' worth scrutiny commission, would review much industry merger would control. Analysts investment banker split logic possible merger. Some pointed difficulty company could face combined. If asked Exxon needed bigger, answer probably no, said Garfield Miller, president Aegis Energy Advisors Corp., small independent investment bank based New York. It hard say anything particular gain. In particular, Miller said, two company enormous similarity domestic refining marketing business. They really overlap quite bit, said. You really wonder benefit redundancy. Another investment banker energy business, speaking condition anonymity, also questioned rationale discussed merger. When look BP-Amoco deal, rationalize it, banker said. But none reason apply Exxon-Mobil deal. But Amy Jaffe, energy research analyst James A. Baker III Institute Public Policy, said combination two company would logical, part would give greater influence bidding project Middle Eastern country. This deal make sense, Ms. Jaffe said. With combined company, project would big. In addition, Ms. Jaffe said, merger would provide company new oil gas asset area world little influence. There lot complimentary asset redundant, said. She said Exxon, example, strong presence Angola, Mobil not. And Mobil significant asset Caspian Sea Nigeria, Exxon weak. Exxon Mobil, nation's two largest oil company, confirmed Friday discussing possible merger, antitrust lawyer, industry analyst government official predicted deal would require sale important large piece new corporate behemoth. Those divestiture would reshape industry already undergoing broad transformation low price oil. But merger corporate combination also beginning create new regulatory climate antitrust official, one may prove particularly challenging Exxon Mobil. Although company confirmed discussing possibility merger, person close discussion said board Exxon Mobil expected meet Tuesday consider agreement. Shares surged New York Stock Exchange. Oil exploration drilling interest would necessarily present antitrust problem Exxon-Mobil merger competition area brisk. But retailing marketing operation, Exxon-Mobil combination would Ford merging General Motors, Macy's Gimbels, said Stephen Axinn, antitrust lawyer New York represented Texaco acquisition Getty decade ago. In United States, deal would come purview Federal Trade Commission, Clinton administration examined large corporate merger vigor seen 1970s. The agency blocked number proposed merger, $4 billion combination Staples Office Depot, two largest office supply discounter, two deal involving four largest drug wholesaler. On hand approved big merger, Boeing's $14 billion acquisition McDonnell Douglas. The agency's analysis Exxon-Mobil combination, senior official said Friday, turn might resemble John D. Rockefeller's Standard Oil trust dismantled Supreme Court 1911. The big antitrust issue whether, merger alliance, able get competition one another back, particularly background BP-Amoco Shell-Texaco, said Eleanor M. Fox, professor New York University School Law antitrust expert. It may looking consolidation world level looked consolidation national level 100 year ago. The Federal Trade Commission recently approved significant joint venture Shell Texaco venture agreed sell refinery divest retailing operation Hawaii California. It also proposed $54 billion merger British Petroleum Amoco re-examine combination light new talk Exxon Mobil. In past, two merger involving industry, government considered together deciding deal them, said Terry Calvani, former commissioner Federal Trade Commission whose client include Chevron. But coming aftermath Shell-Texaco BP-Amoco deal, combination Exxon Mobil, significantly overlapping retail refinery business United States Europe, pose question antitrust official confronted 1980s. It's real test case, said Frederick Leuffer, senior energy analyst Bear Stearns. If FTC let one go major divesting, everything would fair game. Why GM merge Ford? While 1911 breakup Standard Oil viewed Washington official industry executive ancient history, Exxon Mobil become dominant rival retailing refining market, production lubricant petrochemical. Leuffer said believed divestiture necessary case could large deal-breakers. Other analyst lawyer, disagreeing required divestiture could kill deal, said company would nonetheless shed significant operation expected challenge raised broad spectrum constituent, including competitor, customer state official. These absolute obstacle, said John Hervey, analyst Donaldson Lufkin &AMP; Jenrette. In past, two big oil company merged, aggressive attorney general state almost always become involved raising question high visibility local gas station. When state attorney general drive see four station corner two Mobil Exxon, certain raise question, Axinn said. Exxon Mobil significant concentration retailing marketing concern Northeast, Southwest West Coast, also big refining operation. Because two company involved everything exploration shipping refining retailing, meaning deal consumer take month regulator sort out. The regulator examining transaction would dissect business, determine whether market global, national local, determine whether combined entity high concentration business area. Experts agreed regulator likely permit Exxon Mobil keep exploratory oil production business area already highly competitive merger would result higher price. Hervey said market already fragmented combined market share major American European oil company 17 percent. They downsized, cut back re-engineered. So 900 remaining blue-collar worker Mobil's largest domestic refinery, 1,500 decade ago, heard last week company discussing possible merger Exxon, siren warning already suspect valve might blow. I think terrible thing, said Dick Mabry, refinery operator, emerged plant's artificial twilight main gate 12-hour shift ended 4:30 Sunday morning. He stopped rub eye rimmed red, topic bedtime could delayed. It's revival Standard Oil Company. It's going put 20 30 thousand people work. I think Justice Department step stop it. Ernest Lewis, whose overall bore Big E patch appropriate scale, added uh-huh's. The latest evidence thing heading hulked right nearby, said, glancing new power plant likely operated company union man refinery's generator. But Mobil Corp. sold, Lewis said, noting gain company stock holding, buyer solid large Exxon Corp. might least evil. If merged Chevron, we'd Moron, added. A growing American economy make billionaire someone unproven idea Internet marketing still sloughing worker older industry, petroleum much any. Those point tote board Beaumont plant's brick headquarters, say show already handled 171 million barrel 130 million planned full year. But number matter one 89.9, 88.9, 81.9, nearby gas station lowest price, inflation, Depression. Which Mobil Exxon combining world's largest oil company. Some people close talk cautioned deal would considered board least Tuesday, maybe Wednesday. And why, beginning last Wednesday evening, phone home Jimmy Herrington, president Oil, Chemical Atomic Workers Local 4-243 rang stop. No, know merger talk television, said Herrington, also work full-time producing lubricant. He asked Mobil manager, meeting earlier month, rumor, said heard nothing. Oil industry analyst say first target combined company's effort cut billion dollar annual cost would office staff professional, geologist engineer, field. One company's accountant could almost work two. But crew fully expect Exxon buyer would ask whether refinery could turn crude oil gasoline, motor oil product fewer people. Union leader raise prospect Exxon would sell refinery. Antitrust regulator, say, bound notice Exxon refinery hour's drive one direction three hour other, Gulf Mexico crescent form petrochemical industry's home. The Beaumont plant, steaming, humming chemistry set lining Neches River Gulf, become prime provider livelihood built almost spray nearby Spindletop gusher. With mounting overtime stretch shift 16 hour more, worker regularly make $55,000 $65,000 year. People go retire there, Herrington said, drove plant's fenced periphery. Lewis, 17th year, third-generation employee. But nephew laboring exception. The worker streaming plant dawn mostly balding going gray, sign full generation refinery concerned get rid worker attract them. The cutback have, far, come attrition, retirement encouraged incentive. But plywood sheet covering window fast food place gas station Herrington's union hall advertise best time long gone. His member chafe expert come Wall Street question justification every person's job. In tiring dangerous task, question elimination relief laborer favor covering vacation sickness overtime (although extra pay, say plant become safer years). They complain growing number contractor taking formerly unionized task. But many worker choosing invest least retirement saving Mobil stock, 1990s ethos gaining. Some share credit plant's management efficiency measure agree necessary true job security. Some take attitude every company always sale. They concerned feel it, said Sam Salim, one electrical plant worker whose future uncertain. But fork $60 billion? I'd look over. With Mobil executive saying little possible now, call Sunday local plant manager company spokesman elicit peep. Union leader, however, already squawking. I believe creating new monopoly way prop industry, said Robert Wages, former refinery operator union's president, telephone Saturday. Nevertheless, admirable foresight union negotiated clause last November's three-year contract extension guaranteeing company buyer would keep term. Many member, typically came work high school, already molding oil companies' latest exploit case study fit rapacious MBA's. They're biggest, said Bobby Whisneant, assistant operator gasoline lubrication oil unit, referring Exxon. He coming, early Sunday morning, plant gate whose white canopy seems borrowed self-service station. So go buy second biggest. That's one way get rid competition. I hope something 80 buying company scrapping them. Or something Robber Baron era century before, said Mabry, another operator. Didn't teacher teach u school Standard Oil Company would never come back? Remember that? said, looking friend, Lewis, Big E, agreement. But I better shut up. I still work Mobil. Used to, Lewis said. Exxon Corp. Mobil Corp. held discussion combining business operation, person involved talk said Wednesday. It unclear Wednesday whether talk continuing. If company merge, would create largest US. company term revenue. A possible merger reported separately The Financial Times London Bloomberg News.

Any union would reunite two part John D. Rockefeller's Standard Oil Trust, broken Supreme Court 1911. Exxon known Standard Oil New Jersey, Mobil consisted two companies: Standard Oil New York Vacuum Oil. As oil price plummeted level last seen mid-1980s, oil company pressure cut cost. Exxon, market value $176.7 billion, Mobil, market value $61.1 billion, history fiercely independent, already cut back staff made lean survive prolonged period low oil price. But particularly unsettling year oil industry, little prospect crude oil price recover soon. Consequently, chief executive oil company swallow pride look suitable partner.

Still, Big Oil small oil getting squeezed low petroleum price high capital cost exploration. Given exotic locale promising, untapped field, seems unlikely exploration get cheaper. And West Texas crude trading $12 barrel, seems safe bet oil selling $100 barrel turn century price analyst early 1980s predicting would reach. Philip K. Verleger Jr., publisher Petroleum Economics Monthly senior adviser Brattle Group, Cambridge, Mass., consulting firm, spent time late last week talking Mobil, Exxon changing dynamic oil business. Following excerpt conversation: Q. (italics)There lot focus antitrust aspect Exxon-Mobil deal. Do see problems?(end italic) A. Let say right I think done deal. I think far that. But happen, I see many problem. BP Amoco perfect end-to-end merger, one little overlap company merging with. Exxon-Mobil come close. The first issue competition local market. The possible problem area West Coast, company pretty small player there. If reason merger might get extra attention, Exxon Mobil terribly friendly either Clinton administration's European Union's position global warming. Q. (italics)Why skeptical deal?(end italic) A. Well, Mobil trying get bigger. They talk Amoco. They wanted buy Conoco. But I understand Lucio Noto, Mobil's chief executive, fit this.

From 1988 1996, Exxon's exploration production expenditure rose 8 percent. Mobil's rose 14 percent. But Mobil's expenditure much sensitive price elasticity oil Exxon's.

(italics)Earlier month Energy Department said oil price would stay soft nearly decade. Do agree?(end italic) A. You know, every time I see forecast go far I want go buy stock oil company.

And Asian economy start growing lead good deal higher oil price, say $20 barrel, next 18 month. Q. (italics)The number oil company going shrink coming year, regardless, it?(end italic) A. We probably heading world five six big oil company, possibly eight. There really precedent many big player oil business modern society. Q. (italics)Do think oil stock good investment?(end italic) A. I think oil company still worthwhile investment, place investor plan making money next 9 12 month. And area investor need careful, period good deal consolidation smaller company.

Speaker-elect Robert Livingston called House floor President Clinton quit White House face certain impeachment. Shockingly, stunningly, Livingston that. He quit one breathtaking utterance, flicking trump card heap impeachment angst festering eyes debating chamber. In one strategem leading fellow House Republicans, Livingston's decision struck Congress verbal bomb. Stunned Democrats saw fury vaporized instant. They stand, almost staggering feet, join Republicans prolonged, emotional ovation Livingston undeniable self-sacrifice. As stood, Democrats sensed Livingston suddenly closed trap president defenders. For, impeachment issue set move Senate, Livingston, whose marital indiscretions public obvious misery, chose show question political leader's resignation much play tumult-tossed city. I must set example I hope President Clinton follow, Livingston declared, flabbergasting attending impeachment debate nation watching beyond. Livingston walked floor sheriff bullet-pocked political High Noon, discarding leadership badge wrested earlier speaker-casualty, Newt Gingrich. In corridor beyond, doorman shouted police officer: Livingston resigned! What? What? came reply officer, obviously thought momentous announcement would Clinton's impeachment, Livingston's political self-immolation. Just so, Democrats, already deep bone-raw exhaustion long fight president, grasped bearings. It surrender developing sexual McCarthyism! declared Rep. Jerrold Nadler, D-N.Y., leading presidential defender trying rally Democrats argument Livingston resign President Clinton quit fire. But Republicans surging fore strength Livingston's announcement, fighting tears rose salute ultimate political role model grueling impeachment process roared final minutes debate. For longer good enough make mistake, confirm mistake take consequences mistake, said Tom DeLay, Republican whip, hands shaking, eyes tearing addressed House sought drive example Livingston way Pennsylvania Avenue. He understood debate  honor, duty, integrity truth, said DeLay arguing one swift blow, Livingston demonstrated far better speaker Clinton president. With something political elan president showed initiating Iraq attack impeachment loomed, House Republicans, battered public opinion polls, found rocket's red glare own. I hurt deeply beg forgiveness, Livingston told House, nation family announced retreat. Only moments before, Democrats openly hissed man Livingston firmly read judgment president: Sir, done great damage nation year. Presidential resignation order, continued, came shouts You resign! You resign! And Livingston closed circle career, stunned place collective breath disbelief somehow almost threatened reduce dark historic issue House  impeachment president  matter anticlimax. They must succeed, David Bonior, Democratic whip said Republicans given task refocusing day misdeeds president, departure speaker. We debate impeachment distracted that, declared. The way stop vicious cycle, Bonior cried floor, refuse give it, whether Bill Clinton Bob Livingston. But House still reeling frenzied day fateful vote presidency approached notion resignation licked capital city flame forest. Rejecting last-minute Democratic attempt soften action censure, House Representatives moved impeach President William Jefferson Clinton perjury Saturday call Senate try him, convict remove office. But vote, Republicans pressed another line attack, demanding Clinton's resignation. Rep. Robert Livingston, nominated speaker last month party, startled House announced would run speaker would resign House 21 years service. He urged president heal wounds created. You, sir, may resign post. Angry Democrats booed shouted, You resign! Livingston continued, I challenge fashion I willing heed words. Apologizing extramarital affairs revealed two days ago, said, I believe I fine job. But I cannot job kind leader I would current circumstances. Then bolted House chamber, nearly knocking reporters members down. (The House voted 228-206 approve first article impeachment, accusing Clinton committing perjury federal grand jury. The vote announced 1:24 p.m. EST, leaving 42nd president face trial Senate whether removed office.) Clinton rejected advice immediately. His spokesman, Joe Lockhart, said, The president intention resigning. By calling Livingston reconsider, president argued broadly resignation fire. Perhaps speaking cases, Lockhart said, It would wrong give insidious politics personal destruction. Unless Clinton changes course, would second impeachment president 209-year history Republic, first Andrew Johnson acquitted 1868. Sen. Trent Lott Mississippi, majority leader, insisted bargaining censure prevent starting. But Senate could halt trial later part deal. Considering degree partisanship displayed Saturday, assembling two-thirds majority required Constitution conviction unlikely. Sixty-seven votes would required, 55 Republicans Senate, 45 Democrats. Four articles impeachment House charged Clinton perjury lying affair Monica Lewinsky federal grand jury Aug. 17. He also charged perjury Paula Jones sexual harassment suit, obstruction justice abuse power. The Republican argument, over, Clinton lied denying sexual relations Ms. Lewinsky. Rep. Dick Armey Texas, majority leader, said, A nation laws cannot ruled person breaks law. Rep. Nancy Johnson Connecticut said: There justice truth. That profoundly so, perjury matters. Rep. Gerald Kleczka Wisconsin began Democrats' arguments saying, What president wrong, personally morally, acts threaten democracy thus rise level impeachable offenses defined founding fathers Constitution. Rep. Charles Schumer, New York's senator-elect, said: The rule law requires punishment fit crime. Allow us vote censure. Saturday's votes penultimate step serious conflict Congress president Richard M. Nixon resigned face impeachment certain conviction Aug. 9, 1974. But case spun 1972 break-in Democratic headquarters Watergate complex, one began murky land deal Arkansas 1978. Through efforts Kenneth Starr, independent counsel law enacted wake Watergate, investigation spread examine Clinton's affair White House intern. All year preoccupied capital immense disconnect public opinion; scandal became public January, polls shown public opposed impeachment wanted inquiry brought end. Even Friday night, 13-hour debate, CBS News Poll 548 people showed 38 percent wanted representative vote impeachment; 58 percent wanted vote. The conflict enters uncharted seas, Nixon resignation cut matter short Johnson trial occurred different America, nuclear weapons cable television public opinion polls. But capital still rife confident speculation. Some guessed, hoped, results recent poll, showed increases support resignation way spare nation trial Ms. Lewinsky Linda Tripp would star witnesses, would weaken Clinton's resolve. Others thought Republicans, seeing dismal numbers polls party's standing United States, would first blink. With majority Senate, power end trial time Senate receives notice impeachment day convenes, Jan. 6, next day. But Clinton focused polls, CBS News survey showed 64 percent still approve handling job president, resignation could almost immediately subject criminal prosecution. And Republicans steadfastly ignored polls year, confronted directly Saturday. Representative J.C. Watts Oklahoma, newly elected chairman Republican caucus, said: What's popular always right. You say polls this. Polls measure changing feelings, steadfast principle. Polls would rejected Ten Commandments. Polls would embraced slavery ridiculed women's rights. You say must draw close. I say must draw line right wrong, tiny fine line executive fountain pen, big fat lead No. 2 pencil. And must every kid America see it. The point whether president prevail, whether truth prevail. Last weekend, Judiciary Committee recommended four articles impeachment, Clinton's side still hoped prevail help 20 30 Republican moderates uncommitted. As week wore on, almost broke president. One not, Rep. Christopher Shays Connecticut, said Saturday: After Judge Starr's report Congress September, presentation Judiciary Committee November, I concluded impeachable offenses proven, proven offenses impeachable. But president's continued failure come grips actions, sincerity arguments members Judiciary Committee sides aisle, change heart conviction members side aisle originally opposed impeachment support it, strong powerful opinion many constituents oppose position wanted president impeached caused rethink position. He added: Yesterday morning, I visited president, I concluded original position correct one, me. I believe impeachable offenses proven, proven offenses impeachable. But Rep. Tom DeLay Texas, led Republican effort force Clinton office, dismissed arguments moral relativism. He began praising Livingston: There greater American mind, least today, Bob Livingston, understood debate about. It honor decency integrity truth; everything honor country. It also debate relativism vs. absolute truth. He continued, The president's defenders said president morally reprehensible, reckless, violated trust American people, lessened esteem office president dishonored office entrusted him,  rise level impeachment. Rep. Jose Serrano New York said, My constituents hate Bill Clinton; love they're praying right moment. You may votes today impeach him, American people. And let tell something, I grew public housing projects South Bronx. I see bunch bullies I see them. The bullies get theirs, going get yours, too. Rep. Henry Hyde Illinois, Judiciary Committee chairman brought charges House floor, said Congress American people needed distinguish private acts infidelity public acts public officials. In Clinton's case, said, House dealing serial violator oath chief law-enforcement officer. He said Senate could innovative creative deciding best punish Clinton, House bound Constitution move ahead articles impeachment. Justice important humble us, Hyde said. Equal justice law  that's we're fighting for. Democrats, reading Constitution, voiced diametrically conclusions, attacked fairness proceedings culminated Saturday. We're losing track distinction sins crimes, said Rep. Jerrold Nadler, D-N.Y. We're lowering standards impeachment. What president done great dangerous offense republic. Democrats also criticized Republicans impeaching Clinton moment U.S. troops waged war Iraq. Six days Christmas troops battle, lame-duck Congress rushing overthrow commander chief, said Rep. David Bonior Michigan, second-ranking House Democrat. The ghosts Watergate hung House chamber. One Republican cited parallels charges House Judiciary Committee brought Nixon 25 years ago, counts committee brought House floor affirmation Saturday. Nixon cheated. He cheated electoral system, said Rep. Lindsey Graham, South Carolina Republican Judiciary Committee. And now, Graham said, full House voting impeach Clinton believe committed crimes result cheating judicial system. But day's debate firmly rooted Clinton's effort conceal sexual affair Monica Lewinsky. Rep. Bob Barr, Georgia Republican Judiciary Committee one Clinton's fiercest critics, held copies U.S. Criminal Code, Judiciary Committee's report impeachment inquiry and, finally, Constitution, defending decision impeach president. Today, rely three pillars society: law itself, evidence Constitution, said Barr. There joy upholding law, Watts said. If cannot see lawlessness, children cannot recognize it. How tell children honesty best policy demand policy? But Democrats assailed premise Republican majority built impeachment case Clinton. Rep. John Conyers Jr. Michigan, ranking Democrat Judiciary Committee, assailed four articles impeachment, count count, unfounded evidence failing rise impeachment. He saved savage scorn final count, abuse power. The majority simply tried dress perjury counts Watergate abuse-of-power language, Conyers said. Rep. Bob Livingston, confessed colleagues Thursday night had adulterous affairs, stunned House chamber Saturday morning saying impeachment debate President Clinton would serve speaker would quit Congress six months. He urged president follow example quit, too. But White House, calls Clinton's resignation derided Republican strategy, president sent spokesman driveway urge Livingston reconsider resignation. Livingston stood well House served two decades called Clinton resign office rather force trial Senate, drawing boos colleagues cat-calls quit instead. He that. I must set example I hope President Clinton follow, Livingston announced shocked silent chamber act left Republican Party total chaos hours vote impeach Clinton. The decision also left party leaderless eve opening 106th Congress, Republicans must govern one narrowest majorities history. Several Republicans, including Rep. Tom DeLay Texas, majority whip, somberly welcomed news, suggesting relieved excruciating embarrassment. In lauding Livingston's move, DeLay said, He understood debate  honor decency integrity truth, everything honor country. But Democrats said aghast, many  including Clinton  called Livingston reconsider decision. Mr. Livingston's resignation wrong, declared Rep. Jerrold Nadler, D-N.Y. It surrender developing sexual McCarthyism. Are going new test someone wants run public office  you ever adulterer? He called country distinguish sins crimes. White House press secretary Joe Lockhart said Clinton disappointed news Livingston's plans wished would reconsider. Lockhart said president firmly believes politics personal destruction town country come end. He reaffirmed Clinton would resign, saying: The president going what's best interest country. It would wrong give insidious politics personal destruction. Livingston's announced resignation stunning disclosure process could result president's removal office. The speaker second line presidency, vice president. Newt Gingrich, outgoing speaker, driven post Republicans lost five seats November election, technically remains speaker Jan. 6, Livingston's election ratified new Congress. But Gingrich removed daily operations House extraordinary session begun dismantle office. Livingston's decision said driven part anger group dozen conservatives party disillusioned withheld news affairs them. They threatened withhold votes election January would formally make speaker. He also concerned pain caused family disclosures, members said. They added that, lost many party, example would set president offering resign post now. DeLay, No. 3 House Republican leadership, expected fill power vacuum least temporarily, deed title, party regroups find new speaker. Many members quickly rallied Rep. Dennis Hastert Illinois. Hastert, one DeLay's deputy whips well respected colleagues, promoted candidate majority leader last month, never mounted campaign. Rep. Dick Armey Texas precariously held majority-leader post last month considered likely candidate speaker. He expected manage reorganization, Republican leaders set Jan. 4. Livingston met privately closest advisers Friday impeachment debate unfolded. Some colleagues believed made mistake disclosing Thursday night  House moving divisive debate impeachment  occasion strayed marriage. He told Republican leaders late Thursday afternoon Hustler magazine going expose affairs early next year. Some leaders urged keep quiet, wife, Bonnie, encouraged tell colleagues immediately, momentous vote nearing floor. At point Thursday night, Roll Call, newspaper Capitol Hill, reported Web site Livingston going admit affairs going offer resign. In closed-door meeting fellow Republicans, admit affairs made offer step down, receiving three standing ovations instead. Thursday night, Livingston stated would intimidated efforts exploit past. But Friday removed public action night drew closest advisers confidence. His aides said Saturday clue contemplating, members aware plans. Asked advance word, Rep. J.C. Watts Oklahoma, newly elected member Republican leadership, said: I idea. Asked internal party pressure Livingston resign, Rep. Harold Rogers, R-Ky., said: I know was, added, There members critical it. As leaders tried Saturday hold party together House floor, Republicans stuck prepared scripts floor favor impeaching president. But began expressing anguish. Rep. Henry Hyde, R-Ill., admitted adulterous affair earlier year, said Livingston's resignation: Those us sinners must feel wretched today. Something going repeatedly stopped, confusion private acts infidelity public acts. To much applause, Hyde declared: Congress business intruding private acts. Republicans, indeed Livingston himself, made distinction Clinton's sexual indiscretions Livingston's, saying Clinton lied private acts therefore abused legal system powers. As Livingston said statement Thursday: These indiscretions employees staff I never asked testify oath them. Democrats hoped Livingston's seemingly drastic action would wake House poisoned atmosphere become might prompt Republicans reconsider impeachment Clinton. Rep. Paul Kanjorski, D-Pa., said, We starting offer sacrificial lambs terrible disease is. In stirring speech applauded Republicans, Rep. Dick Gephardt Missouri, Democratic leader, praised Livingston worthy, good honorable man said resignation grave mistake. It's terrible capitulation negative political forces consuming political system country, Gephardt said, adding events last days showed life imitates farce. We need stop destroying imperfect people unattainable altar public morality, said, urging colleagues step back abyss reject resignation, impeachment vicious self-righteousness. The New York Times said editorial Sunday, Dec. 20: The Republicans' drive partisan impeachment based soley party-line voting power rather sense proportion produced unexpected sideshow resignation Rep. Bob Livingston role future speaker House. Analysts sides struggle President Clinton's future point Livingston's downfall evidence generalized breakdown legislative civility Capitol Hill. Democrats see moral symmetry, depicting Livingston victim sexual puritanism wielding Clinton. But one thing one fall Livingston's invitation use resignation model resolving crisis White House. Livingston's statement rocked Congress, shake foundations somber constitutional process underway. By lying oath, Clinton made necessary House consider impeachment. The evidence convinced Americans president censured, removed office. Livingston allowed GOP partisans block censure House. The result Saturday's expected impeachment vote, Livingston's unexpected announcement, mission Senate remains same. It must resist Republicans want short-circuit constitutional process demands resignation, must use upcoming Senate trial forum finding censure commensurate president's personal dishonesty offenses law. These require stern punishment removal office. In undertaking work, Senate must also reassure American people decisive wisdom core messy-looking political system melted down. In distempered times, shining opportunity Senate. Its members pride Republic's fire wall presidential excess popular partisan passions sometimes seize House Representatives. No one predict whether Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott rise defining challenge career whether surrender mean streak acquired 16 grumpy years minority member House. We would see Lott reach starring role history. Lott's growling response questions censure encouraging. He may right Constitution requires convene trial, nothing document prevents speedily guiding Senate censure negotiations. Indeed, simple majority vote  45 Democrats 6 cooperating Republicans  end Senate trial time, clearing way introduction kind censure resolution suggested former Sen. Bob Dole. In intriguing report NBC, Tim Russert described discussions bipartisan group senators censure would involve form presidential confession, fine joint congressional request Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr prosecute Clinton courts. If Lott refuses allow bipartisan search censure, burden fall respected members Joseph Lieberman Democratic side Orrin Hatch Republicans. Through cooperation, guide Senate punishment fixes Clinton history president lied oath, avoids taint partisan vengeance associated House impeachment vote. The Senate's historic reputation prudence requires find appropriate punishment personally weak president damaged rule law, threatened stability government. House Speaker-elect Robert L. Livingston presented fresh note shock impeachment debate President Clinton Thursday night Republican leader forced admit Republican colleagues carried adulterous affairs past. It suddenly come attention individuals working together media investigating personal background effort find indiscretions may exploitable party eve upcoming historic vote impeachment, Livingston declared statement appearing shocked House Republican conference head disclosure surfaced news reports. After hearing admissions closed session, Livingston's colleagues gave standing ovation support said question resigning never arisen. My fate hands, Livingston told Republicans, according lawmakers present. The debate president's fate would go forward, Republicans later insisted, drawing distinctions speaker-elect's revelations sex-and-mendacity scandal put Clinton brink impeachment. The president charged impeachment resolution perjury abuse power attempt hide sexual indiscretions. Democrats offered immediate comment, Republicans braced hear Livingston's admissions alluded debate Friday Democrats decried investigation president basically partisan unfair rummaging sex life. Livingston, saying sought spiritual counseling received forgiveness family, noted several times told reporters campaign become speaker I running speaker, sainthood. He added, There reason words. During 33-year marriage wife, Bonnie, I occasion strayed marriage, nearly cost marriage family, Livingston said brief prepared statement. But attempted draw contrast allegations president, asserting: I want assure everyone indiscretions employees staff I never asked testify oath them. The disclosure speaker-elect's marital infidelities, disclosed Rollcall, Capitol Hill newspaper, sent new jolt uncertainty lawmakers prepared momentous debate president's admitted misbehavior office whether impeached tried Senate. Rep. Henry Hyde, Republican chairman House Judiciary Committee bring impeachment charges president, previously cited magazine extra-marital affair past. Then, Thursday night, Republicans voiced suspicions Democratic defenders president instigated media investigations effort embarrass Clinton's principal accusers. But proof offered Republicans left conference, facing uncertainties debate already promised bare-knuckled partisanship. Livingston left conference surrounded Capitol police, taking questions waiting reporters. His chief leadership aides immediately rallied support. Some would rather struggle constitutional question continue try twist debate unseemly investigation private lives, said Rep. Dick Armey, Republican majority leader. In report internet Thursday night, Rollcall disclose source made oblique reference Hustler, sex magazine. Larry Flint, publisher Hustler, earlier year advertised offer $1 million bounty information e members Congress guilty sexual indiscretions. It breaks heart we're subject human frailties, said Asa Hutchinson, R-Ark., left conference. This comfortable circumstance anyone, added, insisting president speaker-elect presented two separate issues. We've got duty Constitution. It gotten point drastic action may necessary. You know movies Ebola virus outbreaks, guys sterile suits come in, seal area completely irradiate it? They may Washington. Just eradicate us start scratch. In few, short days managed make terms surreal, bizarre, split-screen America, shocking, runaway train politics personal destruction useless cliches. We longer govern here. We roll gutter wondering who's next sexual auto-de-fe. On Saturday morning, surreal, shocking, bizarre, split-screen image Bob Livingston, speaker-elect, stepping marital infidelities revealed. We pawns chessboard, Livingston said, asking president resign resigning himself. Livingston's rabid pursuit president, hoped hide dirty laundry, made avatar hypocrisy capital rotting hypocrisy. On Thursday night, Livingston first confessed sins Republicans hopes keeping hold post, colleagues gave standing ovation. And made surprise announcement Saturday, Republicans gave another ovation stepped deliver encomiums lost speaker. One's self-esteem gets utterly crushed times this, sighed Henry Hyde, another tormenter president also admit succumbed temptation. Tom DeLay, jagged-edge exterminator may next-up speaker roundelay, choked up, praising greatness Livingston understanding debate relativism absolute truth. What could relative Republican hidden lot affairs trying impeach president lying his? Spurred Larry Flynt's bounty sinnuendo, city braced craziness. The Ship Fools reached cruising speed Friday evening, frightening scene Republicans crazed hatred president railroading impeachment though United States war Iraq, though House chamber mostly empty, though Republicans huddled glass house issue sex lies, though White House still pitching tent planning sleigh rides Winter Wonderland press party Monday. (The White House keeping journalists quarantined year, encouraged bring kids. To soak cozy family atmosphere, doubt. Why Republicans obsessed, everyone right mind agrees impeachment outlandishly over-the-top punishment Clinton self-destructive course country? Because genuinely hate president. They think he's dishonest, immoral, issue-stealing, selfish child '60s. They think they're going pay political price this, do, care. It might great time see lot combovers, great time see lot stature. The House debate history. It hideous version The McLaughlin Group. While Republicans tried draw distinction Clinton perjured himself, ignored president lured Starr-Jones attorney team testifying Monica Lewinsky. Ordinarily one would feel sorry Livingston. But Republicans brought sexual doomsday machine focusing single-mindedly Clinton's sex life. The Republicans determined high-tech lynching engaged wacky role reversals. Many Republican hawks argued Bill Clinton bombing Saddam, claiming timing suspicious, though hammered bombing five weeks ago. In incredibly unseemly display, Trent Lott, majority leader, former Bush national security adviser Brent Scowcroft Bush Secretary State Lawrence Eagleburger chimed attack. There's much hate here. And I hate it. We debate impeachment distracted that, minority whip, Rep. David Bonior, Democrat Michigan, said Saturday's House debate, leaped impossible goal. It would taken kaleidoscopic television screen capture constantly shifting images competing center stage: impeachment, Iraq, resignation Rep. Robert Livingston, response White House. The months leading impeachment President Clinton become series televised anticlimaxes, hours vote made lack drama. There hardly enough shorthand terms split screens cover activity. All networks cable channels carried moment unexpectedly set tone, Livingston, Louisiana Republican, announced debate would become House speaker. The commentators set carry congressional ratification inevitable vote, suddenly plugged-in reporters caught guard. As Tim Russert said Tom Brokaw NBC, Tom, knock us over. In echo chamber television news becomes, shared mantra weightier early morning. For second time American history president would impeached, went standard line. Yet pundits speculating politicians telegraphing every move, one hinted Livingston resignation. The announcement was, Brokaw put it, least partly political ploy, repercussions immediate. Reporters began gathering word Capitol Hill candidates speaker's job, conversation moved next stage political tug war. The Republicans used Livingston's resignation say president resign, too; Democrats immediately countered idea president would stay Livingston well. That led one less-expected split screens day, bad choice. While Congress debating, CNN showed anti-aircraft fire Baghdad one box. In other, Joe Lockhart, Clinton's press secretary, stood White House driveway telling reporters president would Livingston reconsider decision. There stateliness House television offers, one reason purely visual. Keep mind control picture, Dan Rather said CBS, explaining television cameras Congress provided House, individual networks. There way roam zoom reaction shots, political convention. But sense history decorum last long CBS. At noon, vote, CBS went football game, becoming network leave news coverage. CBS' corporate decision try ways meant Rather would break updates Washington. I'll see soon, said signed complete coverage, looking trouper. But position news anchor day. He later announced impeachment votes split screen football game progress upper part screen. On networks cable channels, vote literally happened background. As TV screens toted numbers electronically-cast vote, members Congress milled chatted floor. Even brief Democratic walkout motion consider censure defeated thoroughly forecast. As Democrats straggled steps Congress, looked curiously undramatic television, though probably made better still photograph place. And votes progress, jockeying speaker's job heated up. We already presumptive leader, Gwen Ifill NBC News said midafternoon, naming Rep. Dennis Hassert, R-Ill., also cited networks likely candidate. If political military action intruded, might obvious debate House floor sent message vast divisions politics morality, signaling deep cultural fissure crisis opened. The impeachment, said Rep. Tom DeLay, R-Texas, debate relativism vs. absolute truth. Rep. Jerrold Nadler, D-N.Y., contended Congress lost distinction sins crimes, argued sexual McCarthyism become prominent. And backdrop revelations adultery led Livingston's resignation, Rep. Dick Gephardt, minority leader, declared politics personal destruction end. But jabbering political posturing continued, reporters raced cover president's statement impeachment latest briefings Pentagon, little time focus profound cultural message rhetorical flourishes. Bob Livingston, incoming speaker House, took public role Friday debate unfolded whether impeach President Clinton. His previous 24 hours visible month party nominated speaker perhaps excruciating public career: He spent day chaotic procedural wrangle terms Friday's debate; ended telling Republican colleagues had extramarital affairs 20-year tenure Congress. His disclosure followed investigation Larry Flynt, publisher Hustler, sex magazine, said Friday news conference Beverly Hills, Calif., publication learned Livingston had adulterous affairs last 10 years. Flynt said earlier year wanted expose hypocrisy Washington investigating Clinton October offered $1 million anyone could prove had affairs members Congress. He said Friday larger investigation, published perhaps soon January, would reveal described indiscretions several Republicans. He said connection White House hired investigative firm based Washington made former employees FBI CIA. He would confirm whether firm Terry Lenzner's Investigative Group Inc., done work president's private lawyers. Livingston unavailable reporters Friday. He spent time Friday morning sprawled chair back House chamber, listening debate whether impeach Clinton lying sexual indiscretions. Several colleagues knelt Livingston's knee, whispered patted back. He spent day private office chamber, avoiding gauntlet reporters lay wait House regular office street. The word aides Navy awarded contracts worth millions dollars ships built Louisiana district Avondale Shipyards. During Friday's debate, handful Democrats made oblique allusions human failures. For example, Rep. John Lewis, D-Ga., said: Let sin cast first stone. Who, us sinned? But one said Livingston's disclosure mild Democratic attempts exploit would influence votes impeachment. Rather, House floor hallway chitchat, Livingston's conduct seemed last thing either Republicans Democrats wanted talk about. Bob Livingston first-rate human being, said Rep. David Obey, D-Wis., worked closely sparred Livingston Appropriations Committee, interview. I repeat nuns taught St. James long time ago: We would hell lot better looking souls rather trying evaluate somebody else's. None us business opinion it. Even conservative Republicans seemed ready overlook disclosure. We're going say, `Bob, can't speaker violated vows wife,' said Rep. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C. Like many, including Livingston, Graham distinguished Livingston's conduct Clinton's saying president trampled legal system whereas Livingston's behavior strictly private. Despite Flynt's claims, many Republicans blamed Clinton administration smearing Livingston, although offered evidence. This happening own, said Rep. Dana Rohrabacher, R- Calif. The thing certain uncertainty. The smart money shouts President Clinton never resign, concurs. The smart money argues Senate could muster 67 votes would needed remove wounded president office, would require defection 12 Democrats Republicans stand him. The smart money insists someone cut deal end this. Maybe so. But smarter money whispers, Remember. Remember everyone Washington, including Rep. Henry Hyde, R-Ill., chairman Judiciary Committee, said House would never, ever, treat impeachment partisan issue. Wrong. Remember pundits predicted Democratic losses midterm elections, happened, said impeachment dead. Twice wrong. And remember New Year nation may travel road never traveled before. One president, Andrew Johnson Tennessee, tried Senate, course. But happened different country one 37 states, primitive communications, simple economy based largely agriculture, minimal commitments abroad. In toxic politics century's end Washington, inconceivable become commonplace. The wholly unanticipated announcement Saturday morning Rep. Robert Livingston, R-La., would serve speaker would resign Congress, equally unanticipated disclosure Thursday night several extramarital affairs, deepened capital's profound sense insecurity. The deadly sweep scythe neo-puritanism appears unstoppable, least moment, Livingston's forthcoming resignation increase pressure president likewise. You've set us example, leader House Republican majority, Rep. Dick Armey Texas, told Livingston Saturday. The example principle comes power. The Democrats made point, arguing Livingston case showed wrong savage people personal pecaddillos. One transcendently important thing remains same: Although surrounded judicial trappings presided chief justice, trials presidents political processes, power residing hands elective politicians. In addition narrow legal issues guilt innocence, weigh considerations party, nation's future, individual political well-being almost anything else care weigh reaching verdict. The longer took, numerous call resignation would probably be. Even Saturday's epochal roll-calls, four ten Americans interviewed latest New York Times/CBS News Poll said thought president step indicted, fact large majority voiced disapproval impeachment proceedings. What lies seeming contradiction, course, fear Clinton, country him, would incapacitated. No one took Andrew Johnson seriously escaped conviction single vote. But Clinton, man powerful whose whole life series comebacks, already embarked effort show nation's business. Richard Nixon clawed way back respectability leaving White House one thought could; Clinton intends re-establish authority still office. He one great advantage: Two-thirds American public continues voice approval political stewardship, thinks man. The president press hard, much-reduced leverage, deal censure. Indeed, fine piece political irony one could ask for, already sought enlist former Sen. Bob Dole, Republican defeated 1996, emissary Senate majority. The numbers unpromising: help six Republicans, 45 Democrats could end trial time pass censure resolution House would surely take up. There enough Republican moderates sometime party-buckers make plausible target. But Republican leader Senate, Trent Lott Mississippi, made unwillingness take president's word plainly evident recent days, determined fight trial-aborting arrangement. It clear Clinton's reputation stained forever, matter Senate does. The spot out. History remember man coveted glowing legacy impresario economic growth, Moses pointed way 21st century, second president ever impeached, first ousted. That harsh word, impeachment, cling name surely Teapot Dome clings Harding's Depression Hoover's. But alone suffered grievous injury political avalanche shaken loose disclosure Clinton's sexual relationship former White House intern, Monica Lewinsky. The Republicans' public support shriveled 40 percent new Times/CBS News poll, lowest level 14 years, could go lower fact impeachment sinks in. Journalists seen many jackals, indifferent personal suffering national angst may cause long get story, none concerned accuracy. In fact, whole political culture 1990s, criminalization political conduct seeming indifference important national international issues, fallen disrepute ordinary Americans. The last week seemed crystallize long-term decline political civility. Republicans called Clinton liar, committing American pilots skies Iraq, Democrats accused rivals conducting political lynching political coup d'etat. Bipartisanship may biggest victim all. Party lines Saturday's rolls calls held firm leg irons. Almost Republicans opposed impeachment exclusively legal principle least partly special political circumstances  Democratic majority Rep. Constance Morella's district Maryland suburbs Washington, example, gratitude Rep. Peter King, R-N.Y., Clinton's peacemaking Ireland. It hard see emerged reputation enhanced, perhaps Hillary Rodham Clinton, staunch face deception. If threats dire predictions uttered House Democrats recent days taken face value, nation entering Era Bad Feelings, polar second Era Good Feelings, similar 1820s, Clinton hoped preside over. Rep. Tom Sawyer, D-Ohio, compared Clinton Friday Sir Thomas More, executed treason 1535 religious beliefs. He quoted More's words admonition today: What hunted actions thoughts heart. It long road opened. God help statesmen walk road. But amidst loose talk permanent damage institution that, remember: Things change startling speed modern American politics, institutions American government proved extraordinarily resilient. President Nixon, almost universally agreed 1974, weakened American presidency many decades come. Nobody said eight years Ronald Reagan, 15 years later. In end, people meant nothing. Bob Livingston clearer that. His mind minds followers closed. Even bombing continued Iraq Americans coast coast clamoring alternative impeachment, adulterous flushed grotesque invasions privacy inevitably followed relentlessly prurient pursuit president, country began contemplate destructive effects lengthy bitter Senate trial, speaker-designate arrogantly stupidly proclaimed: Let us disregard influences. The radicals Hill would hear nothing echoes fanaticism. Impeach! Impeach! And continued stunning announcement Saturday morning Livingston would quit House. Dismayed partisan stampede, Dick Gephardt, Democratic leader, warned impeachment debate Friday: In effort uphold Constitution, trampling Constitution. David Bonior, Democratic whip, said: This wrong. It unfair. It unjust. At time events world challenges home demand stand united, censure one solution bring us together. To colleagues aisle, I say let go obsession. Listen American people. But voices reason would heard. Livingston right-wing colleagues, Tom DeLays, Henry Hydes, Bob Barrs, mission destruction would denied. Ordinary Americans could cry wanted. They could protest demonstrate, send faxes E-mails. It matter. The right march democracy run. Rep. Thomas Barrett, Democrat Wisconsin, tried remind Republican colleagues Constitution allow remove president office can't stand him. He was, course, ignored. The Republicans pay huge price brazen, utterly partisan attempt drag president White House defiance people. The party's contempt voters arrogantly quite adequately summed Alan Simpson, former senator Wyoming, said: The attention span Americans movie coming next month whether quarterly report stock change. If voters dopes Mr. Simpson thinks are, come 2000 everyone forgotten impeachment crisis. But Rep. Robert Menendez, D-N.J., probably closer truth said, I warn colleagues reap bitter harvest unfair partisan seeds sow today. One many strange events couple weeks way virtually previously undecided Republicans, so-called moderates, surrendered independence lined lackeys follow right wing's lead. All proclaimed loudly voting principle, fact exercise mass cowardice, exemplified Rep. John McHugh upstate New York. McHugh announced Tuesday would vote impeachment. But decision based principle, odd way expressing it. The Washington Post said McHugh appeared stomach Senate conviction removal president office. Of colleagues Senate, McHugh said, I, one, would accept, welcome, mercy. In words, let Senate heavy constitutional lifting. McHugh may wished loud mercy, clearly frightened right-wingers House cast compassionate vote himself. The GOP longer conceal party extremists, right-wing absolutists, party step political cultural orientation Americans. Bob Livingston may leaving, arrogant comment still serve party's slogan. Let us disregard influences. Let us disregard people. \n","\n","\n","\n","The raw passion House Democrats hesitate bellow You resign! You resign! Speaker-elect Robert Livingston called House floor President Clinton quit White House face certain impeachment. Shockingly, stunningly, Livingston that. He quit one breathtaking utterance, flicking trump card heap impeachment angst festering eye debating chamber. In one strategem leading fellow House Republicans, Livingston's decision struck Congress verbal bomb. Stunned Democrats saw fury vaporized instant. They stand, almost staggering foot, join Republicans prolonged, emotional ovation Livingston undeniable self-sacrifice. As stood, Democrats sensed Livingston suddenly closed trap president defender. For, impeachment issue set move Senate, Livingston, whose marital indiscretion public obvious misery, chose show question political leader's resignation much play tumult-tossed city. I must set example I hope President Clinton follow, Livingston declared, flabbergasting attending impeachment debate nation watching beyond. Livingston walked floor sheriff bullet-pocked political High Noon, discarding leadership badge wrested earlier speaker-casualty, Newt Gingrich. In corridor beyond, doorman shouted police officer: Livingston resigned! What? What? came reply officer, obviously thought momentous announcement would Clinton's impeachment, Livingston's political self-immolation. Just so, Democrats, already deep bone-raw exhaustion long fight president, grasped bearing. It surrender developing sexual McCarthyism! declared Rep. Jerrold Nadler, D-N.Y., leading presidential defender trying rally Democrats argument Livingston resign President Clinton quit fire. But Republicans surging fore strength Livingston's announcement, fighting tear rose salute ultimate political role model grueling impeachment process roared final minute debate. For longer good enough make mistake, confirm mistake take consequence mistake, said Tom DeLay, Republican whip, hand shaking, eye tearing addressed House sought drive example Livingston way Pennsylvania Avenue. He understood debate honor, duty, integrity truth, said DeLay arguing one swift blow, Livingston demonstrated far better speaker Clinton president. With something political elan president showed initiating Iraq attack impeachment loomed, House Republicans, battered public opinion poll, found rocket's red glare own. I hurt deeply beg forgiveness, Livingston told House, nation family announced retreat. Only moment before, Democrats openly hissed man Livingston firmly read judgment president: Sir, done great damage nation year. Presidential resignation order, continued, came shout You resign! You resign! And Livingston closed circle career, stunned place collective breath disbelief somehow almost threatened reduce dark historic issue House impeachment president matter anticlimax. They must succeed, David Bonior, Democratic whip said Republicans given task refocusing day misdeed president, departure speaker. We debate impeachment distracted that, declared. The way stop vicious cycle, Bonior cried floor, refuse give it, whether Bill Clinton Bob Livingston. But House still reeling frenzied day fateful vote presidency approached notion resignation licked capital city flame forest. Rejecting last-minute Democratic attempt soften action censure, House Representatives moved impeach President William Jefferson Clinton perjury Saturday call Senate try him, convict remove office. But vote, Republicans pressed another line attack, demanding Clinton's resignation. Rep. Robert Livingston, nominated speaker last month party, startled House announced would run speaker would resign House 21 year service. He urged president heal wound created. You, sir, may resign post. Angry Democrats booed shouted, You resign! Livingston continued, I challenge fashion I willing heed word. Apologizing extramarital affair revealed two day ago, said, I believe I fine job. But I cannot job kind leader I would current circumstance. Then bolted House chamber, nearly knocking reporter member down. (The House voted 228-206 approve first article impeachment, accusing Clinton committing perjury federal grand jury. The vote announced 1:24 pm. EST, leaving 42nd president face trial Senate whether removed office.) Clinton rejected advice immediately. His spokesman, Joe Lockhart, said, The president intention resigning. By calling Livingston reconsider, president argued broadly resignation fire. Perhaps speaking case, Lockhart said, It would wrong give insidious politics personal destruction. Unless Clinton change course, would second impeachment president 209-year history Republic, first Andrew Johnson acquitted 1868. Sen. Trent Lott Mississippi, majority leader, insisted bargaining censure prevent starting. But Senate could halt trial later part deal. Considering degree partisanship displayed Saturday, assembling two-thirds majority required Constitution conviction unlikely. Sixty-seven vote would required, 55 Republicans Senate, 45 Democrats. Four article impeachment House charged Clinton perjury lying affair Monica Lewinsky federal grand jury Aug. 17. He also charged perjury Paula Jones sexual harassment suit, obstruction justice abuse power. The Republican argument, over, Clinton lied denying sexual relation Ms. Lewinsky. Rep. Dick Armey Texas, majority leader, said, A nation law cannot ruled person break law. Rep. Nancy Johnson Connecticut said: There justice truth. That profoundly so, perjury matter. Rep. Gerald Kleczka Wisconsin began Democrats' argument saying, What president wrong, personally morally, act threaten democracy thus rise level impeachable offense defined founding father Constitution. Rep. Charles Schumer, New York's senator-elect, said: The rule law requires punishment fit crime. Allow u vote censure. Saturday's vote penultimate step serious conflict Congress president Richard M. Nixon resigned face impeachment certain conviction Aug. 9, 1974. But case spun 1972 break-in Democratic headquarters Watergate complex, one began murky land deal Arkansas 1978. Through effort Kenneth Starr, independent counsel law enacted wake Watergate, investigation spread examine Clinton's affair White House intern. All year preoccupied capital immense disconnect public opinion; scandal became public January, poll shown public opposed impeachment wanted inquiry brought end. Even Friday night, 13-hour debate, CBS News Poll 548 people showed 38 percent wanted representative vote impeachment; 58 percent wanted vote. The conflict enters uncharted sea, Nixon resignation cut matter short Johnson trial occurred different America, nuclear weapon cable television public opinion poll. But capital still rife confident speculation. Some guessed, hoped, result recent poll, showed increase support resignation way spare nation trial Ms. Lewinsky Linda Tripp would star witness, would weaken Clinton's resolve. Others thought Republicans, seeing dismal number poll party's standing United States, would first blink. With majority Senate, power end trial time Senate receives notice impeachment day convenes, Jan. 6, next day. But Clinton focused poll, CBS News survey showed 64 percent still approve handling job president, resignation could almost immediately subject criminal prosecution. And Republicans steadfastly ignored poll year, confronted directly Saturday. Representative JC. Watts Oklahoma, newly elected chairman Republican caucus, said: What's popular always right. You say poll this. Polls measure changing feeling, steadfast principle. Polls would rejected Ten Commandments. Polls would embraced slavery ridiculed women's right. You say must draw close. I say must draw line right wrong, tiny fine line executive fountain pen, big fat lead No. 2 pencil. And must every kid America see it. The point whether president prevail, whether truth prevail. Last weekend, Judiciary Committee recommended four article impeachment, Clinton's side still hoped prevail help 20 30 Republican moderate uncommitted. As week wore on, almost broke president. One not, Rep. Christopher Shays Connecticut, said Saturday: After Judge Starr's report Congress September, presentation Judiciary Committee November, I concluded impeachable offense proven, proven offense impeachable. But president's continued failure come grip action, sincerity argument member Judiciary Committee side aisle, change heart conviction member side aisle originally opposed impeachment support it, strong powerful opinion many constituent oppose position wanted president impeached caused rethink position. He added: Yesterday morning, I visited president, I concluded original position correct one, me. I believe impeachable offense proven, proven offense impeachable. But Rep. Tom DeLay Texas, led Republican effort force Clinton office, dismissed argument moral relativism. He began praising Livingston: There greater American mind, least today, Bob Livingston, understood debate about. It honor decency integrity truth; everything honor country. It also debate relativism v. absolute truth. He continued, The president's defender said president morally reprehensible, reckless, violated trust American people, lessened esteem office president dishonored office entrusted him, rise level impeachment. Rep. Jose Serrano New York said, My constituent hate Bill Clinton; love they're praying right moment. You may vote today impeach him, American people. And let tell something, I grew public housing project South Bronx. I see bunch bully I see them. The bully get theirs, going get yours, too. Rep. Henry Hyde Illinois, Judiciary Committee chairman brought charge House floor, said Congress American people needed distinguish private act infidelity public act public official. In Clinton's case, said, House dealing serial violator oath chief law-enforcement officer. He said Senate could innovative creative deciding best punish Clinton, House bound Constitution move ahead article impeachment. Justice important humble u, Hyde said. Equal justice law that's we're fighting for. Democrats, reading Constitution, voiced diametrically conclusion, attacked fairness proceeding culminated Saturday. We're losing track distinction sin crime, said Rep. Jerrold Nadler, D-NY. We're lowering standard impeachment. What president done great dangerous offense republic. Democrats also criticized Republicans impeaching Clinton moment US. troop waged war Iraq. Six day Christmas troop battle, lame-duck Congress rushing overthrow commander chief, said Rep. David Bonior Michigan, second-ranking House Democrat. The ghost Watergate hung House chamber. One Republican cited parallel charge House Judiciary Committee brought Nixon 25 year ago, count committee brought House floor affirmation Saturday. Nixon cheated. He cheated electoral system, said Rep. Lindsey Graham, South Carolina Republican Judiciary Committee. And now, Graham said, full House voting impeach Clinton believe committed crime result cheating judicial system. But day's debate firmly rooted Clinton's effort conceal sexual affair Monica Lewinsky. Rep. Bob Barr, Georgia Republican Judiciary Committee one Clinton's fiercest critic, held copy US. Criminal Code, Judiciary Committee's report impeachment inquiry and, finally, Constitution, defending decision impeach president. Today, rely three pillar society: law itself, evidence Constitution, said Barr. There joy upholding law, Watts said. If cannot see lawlessness, child cannot recognize it. How tell child honesty best policy demand policy? But Democrats assailed premise Republican majority built impeachment case Clinton. Rep. John Conyers Jr. Michigan, ranking Democrat Judiciary Committee, assailed four article impeachment, count count, unfounded evidence failing rise impeachment. He saved savage scorn final count, abuse power. The majority simply tried dress perjury count Watergate abuse-of-power language, Conyers said. Rep. Bob Livingston, confessed colleague Thursday night had adulterous affair, stunned House chamber Saturday morning saying impeachment debate President Clinton would serve speaker would quit Congress six month. He urged president follow example quit, too. But White House, call Clinton's resignation derided Republican strategy, president sent spokesman driveway urge Livingston reconsider resignation. Livingston stood well House served two decade called Clinton resign office rather force trial Senate, drawing boo colleague cat-calls quit instead. He that. I must set example I hope President Clinton follow, Livingston announced shocked silent chamber act left Republican Party total chaos hour vote impeach Clinton. The decision also left party leaderless eve opening 106th Congress, Republicans must govern one narrowest majority history. Several Republicans, including Rep. Tom DeLay Texas, majority whip, somberly welcomed news, suggesting relieved excruciating embarrassment. In lauding Livingston's move, DeLay said, He understood debate honor decency integrity truth, everything honor country. But Democrats said aghast, many including Clinton called Livingston reconsider decision. Mr. Livingston's resignation wrong, declared Rep. Jerrold Nadler, D-NY. It surrender developing sexual McCarthyism. Are going new test someone want run public office you ever adulterer? He called country distinguish sin crime. White House press secretary Joe Lockhart said Clinton disappointed news Livingston's plan wished would reconsider. Lockhart said president firmly belief politics personal destruction town country come end. He reaffirmed Clinton would resign, saying: The president going what's best interest country. It would wrong give insidious politics personal destruction. Livingston's announced resignation stunning disclosure process could result president's removal office. The speaker second line presidency, vice president. Newt Gingrich, outgoing speaker, driven post Republicans lost five seat November election, technically remains speaker Jan. 6, Livingston's election ratified new Congress. But Gingrich removed daily operation House extraordinary session begun dismantle office. Livingston's decision said driven part anger group dozen conservative party disillusioned withheld news affair them. They threatened withhold vote election January would formally make speaker. He also concerned pain caused family disclosure, member said. They added that, lost many party, example would set president offering resign post now. DeLay, No. 3 House Republican leadership, expected fill power vacuum least temporarily, deed title, party regroups find new speaker. Many member quickly rallied Rep. Dennis Hastert Illinois. Hastert, one DeLay's deputy whip well respected colleague, promoted candidate majority leader last month, never mounted campaign. Rep. Dick Armey Texas precariously held majority-leader post last month considered likely candidate speaker. He expected manage reorganization, Republican leader set Jan. 4. Livingston met privately closest adviser Friday impeachment debate unfolded. Some colleague believed made mistake disclosing Thursday night House moving divisive debate impeachment occasion strayed marriage. He told Republican leader late Thursday afternoon Hustler magazine going expose affair early next year. Some leader urged keep quiet, wife, Bonnie, encouraged tell colleague immediately, momentous vote nearing floor. At point Thursday night, Roll Call, newspaper Capitol Hill, reported Web site Livingston going admit affair going offer resign. In closed-door meeting fellow Republicans, admit affair made offer step down, receiving three standing ovation instead. Thursday night, Livingston stated would intimidated effort exploit past. But Friday removed public action night drew closest adviser confidence. His aide said Saturday clue contemplating, member aware plan. Asked advance word, Rep. JC. Watts Oklahoma, newly elected member Republican leadership, said: I idea. Asked internal party pressure Livingston resign, Rep. Harold Rogers, R-Ky., said: I know wa, added, There member critical it. As leader tried Saturday hold party together House floor, Republicans stuck prepared script floor favor impeaching president. But began expressing anguish. Rep. Henry Hyde, R-Ill., admitted adulterous affair earlier year, said Livingston's resignation: Those u sinner must feel wretched today. Something going repeatedly stopped, confusion private act infidelity public act. To much applause, Hyde declared: Congress business intruding private act. Republicans, indeed Livingston himself, made distinction Clinton's sexual indiscretion Livingston's, saying Clinton lied private act therefore abused legal system power. As Livingston said statement Thursday: These indiscretion employee staff I never asked testify oath them. Democrats hoped Livingston's seemingly drastic action would wake House poisoned atmosphere become might prompt Republicans reconsider impeachment Clinton. Rep. Paul Kanjorski, D-Pa., said, We starting offer sacrificial lamb terrible disease is. In stirring speech applauded Republicans, Rep. Dick Gephardt Missouri, Democratic leader, praised Livingston worthy, good honorable man said resignation grave mistake. It's terrible capitulation negative political force consuming political system country, Gephardt said, adding event last day showed life imitates farce. We need stop destroying imperfect people unattainable altar public morality, said, urging colleague step back abyss reject resignation, impeachment vicious self-righteousness. The New York Times said editorial Sunday, Dec. 20: The Republicans' drive partisan impeachment based soley party-line voting power rather sense proportion produced unexpected sideshow resignation Rep. Bob Livingston role future speaker House. Analysts side struggle President Clinton's future point Livingston's downfall evidence generalized breakdown legislative civility Capitol Hill. Democrats see moral symmetry, depicting Livingston victim sexual puritanism wielding Clinton. But one thing one fall Livingston's invitation use resignation model resolving crisis White House. Livingston's statement rocked Congress, shake foundation somber constitutional process underway. By lying oath, Clinton made necessary House consider impeachment. The evidence convinced Americans president censured, removed office. Livingston allowed GOP partisan block censure House. The result Saturday's expected impeachment vote, Livingston's unexpected announcement, mission Senate remains same. It must resist Republicans want short-circuit constitutional process demand resignation, must use upcoming Senate trial forum finding censure commensurate president's personal dishonesty offense law. These require stern punishment removal office. In undertaking work, Senate must also reassure American people decisive wisdom core messy-looking political system melted down. In distempered time, shining opportunity Senate. Its member pride Republic's fire wall presidential excess popular partisan passion sometimes seize House Representatives. No one predict whether Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott rise defining challenge career whether surrender mean streak acquired 16 grumpy year minority member House. We would see Lott reach starring role history. Lott's growling response question censure encouraging. He may right Constitution requires convene trial, nothing document prevents speedily guiding Senate censure negotiation. Indeed, simple majority vote 45 Democrats 6 cooperating Republicans end Senate trial time, clearing way introduction kind censure resolution suggested former Sen. Bob Dole. In intriguing report NBC, Tim Russert described discussion bipartisan group senator censure would involve form presidential confession, fine joint congressional request Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr prosecute Clinton court. If Lott refuse allow bipartisan search censure, burden fall respected member Joseph Lieberman Democratic side Orrin Hatch Republicans. Through cooperation, guide Senate punishment fix Clinton history president lied oath, avoids taint partisan vengeance associated House impeachment vote. The Senate's historic reputation prudence requires find appropriate punishment personally weak president damaged rule law, threatened stability government. House Speaker-elect Robert L. Livingston presented fresh note shock impeachment debate President Clinton Thursday night Republican leader forced admit Republican colleague carried adulterous affair past. It suddenly come attention individual working together medium investigating personal background effort find indiscretion may exploitable party eve upcoming historic vote impeachment, Livingston declared statement appearing shocked House Republican conference head disclosure surfaced news report. After hearing admission closed session, Livingston's colleague gave standing ovation support said question resigning never arisen. My fate hand, Livingston told Republicans, according lawmaker present. The debate president's fate would go forward, Republicans later insisted, drawing distinction speaker-elect's revelation sex-and-mendacity scandal put Clinton brink impeachment. The president charged impeachment resolution perjury abuse power attempt hide sexual indiscretion. Democrats offered immediate comment, Republicans braced hear Livingston's admission alluded debate Friday Democrats decried investigation president basically partisan unfair rummaging sex life. Livingston, saying sought spiritual counseling received forgiveness family, noted several time told reporter campaign become speaker I running speaker, sainthood. He added, There reason word. During 33-year marriage wife, Bonnie, I occasion strayed marriage, nearly cost marriage family, Livingston said brief prepared statement. But attempted draw contrast allegation president, asserting: I want assure everyone indiscretion employee staff I never asked testify oath them. The disclosure speaker-elect's marital infidelity, disclosed Rollcall, Capitol Hill newspaper, sent new jolt uncertainty lawmaker prepared momentous debate president's admitted misbehavior office whether impeached tried Senate. Rep. Henry Hyde, Republican chairman House Judiciary Committee bring impeachment charge president, previously cited magazine extra-marital affair past. Then, Thursday night, Republicans voiced suspicion Democratic defender president instigated medium investigation effort embarrass Clinton's principal accuser. But proof offered Republicans left conference, facing uncertainty debate already promised bare-knuckled partisanship. Livingston left conference surrounded Capitol police, taking question waiting reporter. His chief leadership aide immediately rallied support. Some would rather struggle constitutional question continue try twist debate unseemly investigation private life, said Rep. Dick Armey, Republican majority leader. In report internet Thursday night, Rollcall disclose source made oblique reference Hustler, sex magazine. Larry Flint, publisher Hustler, earlier year advertised offer $1 million bounty information e member Congress guilty sexual indiscretion. It break heart we're subject human frailty, said Asa Hutchinson, R-Ark., left conference. This comfortable circumstance anyone, added, insisting president speaker-elect presented two separate issue. We've got duty Constitution. It gotten point drastic action may necessary. You know movie Ebola virus outbreak, guy sterile suit come in, seal area completely irradiate it? They may Washington. Just eradicate u start scratch. In few, short day managed make term surreal, bizarre, split-screen America, shocking, runaway train politics personal destruction useless cliche. We longer govern here. We roll gutter wondering who's next sexual auto-de-fe. On Saturday morning, surreal, shocking, bizarre, split-screen image Bob Livingston, speaker-elect, stepping marital infidelity revealed. We pawn chessboard, Livingston said, asking president resign resigning himself. Livingston's rabid pursuit president, hoped hide dirty laundry, made avatar hypocrisy capital rotting hypocrisy. On Thursday night, Livingston first confessed sin Republicans hope keeping hold post, colleague gave standing ovation. And made surprise announcement Saturday, Republicans gave another ovation stepped deliver encomium lost speaker. One's self-esteem get utterly crushed time this, sighed Henry Hyde, another tormenter president also admit succumbed temptation. Tom DeLay, jagged-edge exterminator may next-up speaker roundelay, choked up, praising greatness Livingston understanding debate relativism absolute truth. What could relative Republican hidden lot affair trying impeach president lying his? Spurred Larry Flynt's bounty sinnuendo, city braced craziness. The Ship Fools reached cruising speed Friday evening, frightening scene Republicans crazed hatred president railroading impeachment though United States war Iraq, though House chamber mostly empty, though Republicans huddled glass house issue sex lie, though White House still pitching tent planning sleigh ride Winter Wonderland press party Monday. (The White House keeping journalist quarantined year, encouraged bring kid. To soak cozy family atmosphere, doubt. Why Republicans obsessed, everyone right mind agrees impeachment outlandishly over-the-top punishment Clinton self-destructive course country? Because genuinely hate president. They think he's dishonest, immoral, issue-stealing, selfish child '60s. They think they're going pay political price this, do, care. It might great time see lot combovers, great time see lot stature. The House debate history. It hideous version The McLaughlin Group. While Republicans tried draw distinction Clinton perjured himself, ignored president lured Starr-Jones attorney team testifying Monica Lewinsky. Ordinarily one would feel sorry Livingston. But Republicans brought sexual doomsday machine focusing single-mindedly Clinton's sex life. The Republicans determined high-tech lynching engaged wacky role reversal. Many Republican hawk argued Bill Clinton bombing Saddam, claiming timing suspicious, though hammered bombing five week ago. In incredibly unseemly display, Trent Lott, majority leader, former Bush national security adviser Brent Scowcroft Bush Secretary State Lawrence Eagleburger chimed attack. There's much hate here. And I hate it. We debate impeachment distracted that, minority whip, Rep. David Bonior, Democrat Michigan, said Saturday's House debate, leaped impossible goal. It would taken kaleidoscopic television screen capture constantly shifting image competing center stage: impeachment, Iraq, resignation Rep. Robert Livingston, response White House. The month leading impeachment President Clinton become series televised anticlimax, hour vote made lack drama. There hardly enough shorthand term split screen cover activity. All network cable channel carried moment unexpectedly set tone, Livingston, Louisiana Republican, announced debate would become House speaker. The commentator set carry congressional ratification inevitable vote, suddenly plugged-in reporter caught guard. As Tim Russert said Tom Brokaw NBC, Tom, knock u over. In echo chamber television news becomes, shared mantra weightier early morning. For second time American history president would impeached, went standard line. Yet pundit speculating politician telegraphing every move, one hinted Livingston resignation. The announcement wa, Brokaw put it, least partly political ploy, repercussion immediate. Reporters began gathering word Capitol Hill candidate speaker's job, conversation moved next stage political tug war. The Republicans used Livingston's resignation say president resign, too; Democrats immediately countered idea president would stay Livingston well. That led one less-expected split screen day, bad choice. While Congress debating, CNN showed anti-aircraft fire Baghdad one box. In other, Joe Lockhart, Clinton's press secretary, stood White House driveway telling reporter president would Livingston reconsider decision. There stateliness House television offer, one reason purely visual. Keep mind control picture, Dan Rather said CBS, explaining television camera Congress provided House, individual network. There way roam zoom reaction shot, political convention. But sense history decorum last long CBS. At noon, vote, CBS went football game, becoming network leave news coverage. CBS' corporate decision try way meant Rather would break update Washington. I'll see soon, said signed complete coverage, looking trouper. But position news anchor day. He later announced impeachment vote split screen football game progress upper part screen. On network cable channel, vote literally happened background. As TV screen toted number electronically-cast vote, member Congress milled chatted floor. Even brief Democratic walkout motion consider censure defeated thoroughly forecast. As Democrats straggled step Congress, looked curiously undramatic television, though probably made better still photograph place. And vote progress, jockeying speaker's job heated up. We already presumptive leader, Gwen Ifill NBC News said midafternoon, naming Rep. Dennis Hassert, R-Ill., also cited network likely candidate. If political military action intruded, might obvious debate House floor sent message vast division politics morality, signaling deep cultural fissure crisis opened. The impeachment, said Rep. Tom DeLay, R-Texas, debate relativism v. absolute truth. Rep. Jerrold Nadler, D-N.Y., contended Congress lost distinction sin crime, argued sexual McCarthyism become prominent. And backdrop revelation adultery led Livingston's resignation, Rep. Dick Gephardt, minority leader, declared politics personal destruction end. But jabbering political posturing continued, reporter raced cover president's statement impeachment latest briefing Pentagon, little time focus profound cultural message rhetorical flourish. Bob Livingston, incoming speaker House, took public role Friday debate unfolded whether impeach President Clinton. His previous 24 hour visible month party nominated speaker perhaps excruciating public career: He spent day chaotic procedural wrangle term Friday's debate; ended telling Republican colleague had extramarital affair 20-year tenure Congress. His disclosure followed investigation Larry Flynt, publisher Hustler, sex magazine, said Friday news conference Beverly Hills, Calif., publication learned Livingston had adulterous affair last 10 year. Flynt said earlier year wanted expose hypocrisy Washington investigating Clinton October offered $1 million anyone could prove had affair member Congress. He said Friday larger investigation, published perhaps soon January, would reveal described indiscretion several Republicans. He said connection White House hired investigative firm based Washington made former employee FBI CIA. He would confirm whether firm Terry Lenzner's Investigative Group Inc., done work president's private lawyer. Livingston unavailable reporter Friday. He spent time Friday morning sprawled chair back House chamber, listening debate whether impeach Clinton lying sexual indiscretion. Several colleague knelt Livingston's knee, whispered patted back. He spent day private office chamber, avoiding gauntlet reporter lay wait House regular office street. The word aide Navy awarded contract worth million dollar ship built Louisiana district Avondale Shipyards. During Friday's debate, handful Democrats made oblique allusion human failure. For example, Rep. John Lewis, D-Ga., said: Let sin cast first stone. Who, u sinned? But one said Livingston's disclosure mild Democratic attempt exploit would influence vote impeachment. Rather, House floor hallway chitchat, Livingston's conduct seemed last thing either Republicans Democrats wanted talk about. Bob Livingston first-rate human being, said Rep. David Obey, D-Wis., worked closely sparred Livingston Appropriations Committee, interview. I repeat nun taught St. James long time ago: We would hell lot better looking soul rather trying evaluate somebody else's. None u business opinion it. Even conservative Republicans seemed ready overlook disclosure. We're going say, `Bob, can't speaker violated vow wife,' said Rep. Lindsey Graham, R-SC. Like many, including Livingston, Graham distinguished Livingston's conduct Clinton's saying president trampled legal system whereas Livingston's behavior strictly private. Despite Flynt's claim, many Republicans blamed Clinton administration smearing Livingston, although offered evidence. This happening own, said Rep. Dana Rohrabacher, R- Calif. The thing certain uncertainty. The smart money shout President Clinton never resign, concurs. The smart money argues Senate could muster 67 vote would needed remove wounded president office, would require defection 12 Democrats Republicans stand him. The smart money insists someone cut deal end this. Maybe so. But smarter money whisper, Remember. Remember everyone Washington, including Rep. Henry Hyde, R-Ill., chairman Judiciary Committee, said House would never, ever, treat impeachment partisan issue. Wrong. Remember pundit predicted Democratic loss midterm election, happened, said impeachment dead. Twice wrong. And remember New Year nation may travel road never traveled before. One president, Andrew Johnson Tennessee, tried Senate, course. But happened different country one 37 state, primitive communication, simple economy based largely agriculture, minimal commitment abroad. In toxic politics century's end Washington, inconceivable become commonplace. The wholly unanticipated announcement Saturday morning Rep. Robert Livingston, R-La., would serve speaker would resign Congress, equally unanticipated disclosure Thursday night several extramarital affair, deepened capital's profound sense insecurity. The deadly sweep scythe neo-puritanism appears unstoppable, least moment, Livingston's forthcoming resignation increase pressure president likewise. You've set u example, leader House Republican majority, Rep. Dick Armey Texas, told Livingston Saturday. The example principle come power. The Democrats made point, arguing Livingston case showed wrong savage people personal pecaddillos. One transcendently important thing remains same: Although surrounded judicial trapping presided chief justice, trial president political process, power residing hand elective politician. In addition narrow legal issue guilt innocence, weigh consideration party, nation's future, individual political well-being almost anything else care weigh reaching verdict. The longer took, numerous call resignation would probably be. Even Saturday's epochal roll-calls, four ten Americans interviewed latest New York Times/CBS News Poll said thought president step indicted, fact large majority voiced disapproval impeachment proceeding. What lie seeming contradiction, course, fear Clinton, country him, would incapacitated. No one took Andrew Johnson seriously escaped conviction single vote. But Clinton, man powerful whose whole life series comeback, already embarked effort show nation's business. Richard Nixon clawed way back respectability leaving White House one thought could; Clinton intends re-establish authority still office. He one great advantage: Two-thirds American public continues voice approval political stewardship, think man. The president press hard, much-reduced leverage, deal censure. Indeed, fine piece political irony one could ask for, already sought enlist former Sen. Bob Dole, Republican defeated 1996, emissary Senate majority. The number unpromising: help six Republicans, 45 Democrats could end trial time pas censure resolution House would surely take up. There enough Republican moderate sometime party-buckers make plausible target. But Republican leader Senate, Trent Lott Mississippi, made unwillingness take president's word plainly evident recent day, determined fight trial-aborting arrangement. It clear Clinton's reputation stained forever, matter Senate doe. The spot out. History remember man coveted glowing legacy impresario economic growth, Moses pointed way 21st century, second president ever impeached, first ousted. That harsh word, impeachment, cling name surely Teapot Dome cling Harding's Depression Hoover's. But alone suffered grievous injury political avalanche shaken loose disclosure Clinton's sexual relationship former White House intern, Monica Lewinsky. The Republicans' public support shriveled 40 percent new Times/CBS News poll, lowest level 14 year, could go lower fact impeachment sink in. Journalists seen many jackal, indifferent personal suffering national angst may cause long get story, none concerned accuracy. In fact, whole political culture 1990s, criminalization political conduct seeming indifference important national international issue, fallen disrepute ordinary Americans. The last week seemed crystallize long-term decline political civility. Republicans called Clinton liar, committing American pilot sky Iraq, Democrats accused rival conducting political lynching political coup d'etat. Bipartisanship may biggest victim all. Party line Saturday's roll call held firm leg iron. Almost Republicans opposed impeachment exclusively legal principle least partly special political circumstance Democratic majority Rep. Constance Morella's district Maryland suburb Washington, example, gratitude Rep. Peter King, R-N.Y., Clinton's peacemaking Ireland. It hard see emerged reputation enhanced, perhaps Hillary Rodham Clinton, staunch face deception. If threat dire prediction uttered House Democrats recent day taken face value, nation entering Era Bad Feelings, polar second Era Good Feelings, similar 1820s, Clinton hoped preside over. Rep. Tom Sawyer, D-Ohio, compared Clinton Friday Sir Thomas More, executed treason 1535 religious belief. He quoted More's word admonition today: What hunted action thought heart. It long road opened. God help statesman walk road. But amidst loose talk permanent damage institution that, remember: Things change startling speed modern American politics, institution American government proved extraordinarily resilient. President Nixon, almost universally agreed 1974, weakened American presidency many decade come. Nobody said eight year Ronald Reagan, 15 year later. In end, people meant nothing. Bob Livingston clearer that. His mind mind follower closed. Even bombing continued Iraq Americans coast coast clamoring alternative impeachment, adulterous flushed grotesque invasion privacy inevitably followed relentlessly prurient pursuit president, country began contemplate destructive effect lengthy bitter Senate trial, speaker-designate arrogantly stupidly proclaimed: Let u disregard influence. The radical Hill would hear nothing echo fanaticism. Impeach! Impeach! And continued stunning announcement Saturday morning Livingston would quit House. Dismayed partisan stampede, Dick Gephardt, Democratic leader, warned impeachment debate Friday: In effort uphold Constitution, trampling Constitution. David Bonior, Democratic whip, said: This wrong. It unfair. It unjust. At time event world challenge home demand stand united, censure one solution bring u together. To colleague aisle, I say let go obsession. Listen American people. But voice reason would heard. Livingston right-wing colleague, Tom DeLays, Henry Hydes, Bob Barrs, mission destruction would denied. Ordinary Americans could cry wanted. They could protest demonstrate, send fax E-mails. It matter. The right march democracy run. Rep. Thomas Barrett, Democrat Wisconsin, tried remind Republican colleague Constitution allow remove president office can't stand him. He wa, course, ignored. The Republicans pay huge price brazen, utterly partisan attempt drag president White House defiance people. The party's contempt voter arrogantly quite adequately summed Alan Simpson, former senator Wyoming, said: The attention span Americans movie coming next month whether quarterly report stock change. If voter dope Mr. Simpson think are, come 2000 everyone forgotten impeachment crisis. But Rep. Robert Menendez, D-N.J., probably closer truth said, I warn colleague reap bitter harvest unfair partisan seed sow today. One many strange event couple week way virtually previously undecided Republicans, so-called moderate, surrendered independence lined lackey follow right wing's lead. All proclaimed loudly voting principle, fact exercise mass cowardice, exemplified Rep. John McHugh upstate New York. McHugh announced Tuesday would vote impeachment. But decision based principle, odd way expressing it. The Washington Post said McHugh appeared stomach Senate conviction removal president office. Of colleague Senate, McHugh said, I, one, would accept, welcome, mercy. In word, let Senate heavy constitutional lifting. McHugh may wished loud mercy, clearly frightened right-winger House cast compassionate vote himself. The GOP longer conceal party extremist, right-wing absolutist, party step political cultural orientation Americans. Bob Livingston may leaving, arrogant comment still serve party's slogan. Let u disregard influence. Let u disregard people. \n","The first part international space station smoothly orbiting Earth Friday faultless launch marked start new age space exploration colonization. A Russian Proton booster rocket carried module initial orbit 200 kilometers (125 miles) Earth unit operating planned, officials said.

Russian space officials gave first module international space station routine tweak Saturday push higher orbit, convened meeting Earth map future. Flight controllers fired one module's two maneuvering engines raise orbit 230 kilometers (157 miles) space, station's public affairs office said. Russian Space Agency general director Yuri Koptev told reporters maneuver carried great accuracy, 24-ton core module cruising space problems.

The space agency heads agreed schedule future meetings holding scientific conference project somewhere Europe, unspecified date. Also Saturday, head Russia's Mission Control, Vladimir Lobachev, quoted saying Russia would take lead role managing international space station first five years. Previously, space officials said station would jointly controlled Moscow Houston, U.S. space agency NASA taking lead role. According Interfax, Lobachev said made sense Russia control project Russian-built Zarya Russian-built service module would perform life support navigational functions station's first five years. Furthermore, Russian engineers experienced job NASA officials aware this, said. The space station expected cost least dlrs 40 billion, United States expected pay dlrs 24 billion. Russia's financing problems delayed initial launch year, critics said station amounts expensive way NASA keep Russia's beleaguered space program alive.

Built Russian company launched atop Russian booster rocket, 24-ton Zarya (Sunrise) control cargo module U.S.-funded component station. It serve space tugboat early stages project, providing propulsion, power communications. The unmanned launch, set 9:40 Moscow time (0640 GMT) Friday Baikonur Kazakhstan, delayed one year mainly cash-strapped Russian space agency's failure complete another part station. After years discussing, planning replanning, launch hardware, Gretchen McClain, deputy associate administrator new station, said news conference earlier week. We ready begin project bring us millennium women men living working space permanently. Russian officials added traditional note superstition. It Russian tradition preface launch ... advance statements. I would knock wood, rather common Russian tradition, said Alexander Krasnov, deputy chief Russian Space Agency's manned flight department. The station, involving 16 nations United States Russia playing biggest roles, consist 100 elements take 45 assembly flights complete. It due completed 2004. The station weigh 500 tons (more million pounds) expected cost least dlrs 40 billion, United States planning pay dlrs 21 billion. It serve orbital home visiting astronauts cosmonauts 20 years. Zarya fly alone two weeks rendezvous American space shuttle Endeavor, launched Dec. 3 carrying Unity connecting module. The shuttle crew attach two modules together three space walks, using Endeavors robot arm. The 12.4-meter (41.2-feet) Zarya holds 6 tons fuel 16 tanks capable flying independently 430 days. Its control system consists 36 thrusters two large engines major orbital changes. It launched three-stage heavy-lift Proton booster rocket would put Zarya orbit less 10 minutes blastoff. In ensuing days, ground controllers gradually adjust orbit preparation meeting Endeavor. The space station inhabitable early 2000, launch Russian crew module set blast next July August. Russia repeatedly failed meet deadlines constructing crew module, putting whole project schedule. Having lost hope getting promised government funds, Russian space agency sold early research time station NASA dlrs 60 million complete segment. Agency chief Yuri Koptev said taking part new station hope beleaguered Russian space industry, whose funding collapsed Soviet collapse. The project would allow Russia keep 80,000 jobs next 15 years. Koptev assailed Russian space engineers continue insist money put Russia's battered 12-year old Mir space station extend lifetime instead committing funds new space outpost. The choice determined emotions. Some people glued one thing (Mir) care rest, Koptev said recent news conference. We must proceed understanding would take us future, allow us preserve industry. The Russian Khrunichev company earned dlrs 200 million building Zarya, whose design based earlier Soviet spacecraft, including Mir's six modules. WASHINGTON  NASA Russian Space Agency agreed set aside last-minute Russian request launch international space station orbit closer Mir, officials announced Friday. While putting new station closer Russia's 12-year-old Mir station would make easier transfer equipment supplies old outpost new one, request came late acted on, said Randy Brinkley, NASA's space station program manager. NASA surprised last week Russia's prime station contractor proposed orbital position change two-and-a-half weeks launch first part new station. Delaying Nov. 20 flight 10 hours match orbits would forced similar shifts subsequent assembly flights, resulted potentially unfavorable sun angles solar-powered station, engineers said. We mutually concluded would prudent make changes, Brinkley said news conference held Johnson Space Center Houston. It added technical complexity risks mission justified. The decision, followed frank candid discussions two partners, imposed United States, said. The conclusions mutual, Brinkley said. Both sides concluded make sense. The Russians, struggling find money space program nation economic collapse, said wanted transfer thousands pounds newer equipment scientific instruments Mir economy move. However, critics questioned Russians' motives, wondering requested orbital change part plan delay decommissioning destruction Mir, Russians agreed next summer. The Russians little money United States partners international station fear money spent Mir prevent Russia meeting obligations new project. The Mir competes international space station critical resources funding, Brinkley said. NASA consider ideas salvaging Mir's research equipment use international space station, said, interfere assembling new station. The United States 15 nations plan begin building new station orbit next week Russians launch module supply power propulsion early stages five-year construction period. The space shuttle Endeavor follow Dec. 3 second station part, U.S.-built connecting passageway attaches first module. The first piece international space station orbiting Earth Friday, sprouting antennae unfolding solar power panels awaited segments, eventually grow largest orbital laboratory history. The module, called Zarya Russian term meaning sunrise dawn, took flawless ride space atop three-stage Russian Proton booster rocket lifted 1:40 a.m. Eastern time Baikonur cosmodrome Kazakhstan. The launching witnessed heads space agencies 16 nations sponsoring station, cost least $40 billion build next five years. Zarya, built Russia $240 million United States, joined two weeks first American module, docking hub called Unity. The space shuttle Endeavour take Dec. 3 rendezvous Zarya attach two units. This followed 43 flights American Russian rockets carrying 100 parts assembled space form 900,000-pound research station housing seven astronauts. Daniel Goldin, administrator NASA, said news conference launching, Now 44 launches go, 1,000 hours space walks countless problems. But partner nations trusting working together, said, international space station going reality. Even new space station coming together, questions continue fate Russia's existing space laboratory, 12-year-old Mir. Because collapse Russian economy, doubts Russia produce enough rockets equipment support projects led Russia promise would abandon Mir destroy station next summer. However, recent weeks Russian officials lobbying find ways extend Mir's life. According report news agency Reuters, President Boris Yeltsin's space adviser, Yevgeny Shaposhnikov, said Friday preparing number proposals extending Mir's life year 2000. Support options growing recent weeks Russian space officials, astronauts nationalists, see Mir symbol Russian achievements space. James Van Laak, NASA's deputy manager operations space station, said Friday agency received formal proposals extending Mir's life. NASA would find proposal unacceptable measurable impact international space station, Van Laak said telephone interview Johnson Space Center Houston, No one objection Mir keeping operational Russians find way support projects, demonstrate can. Yuri Koptev, head Russian Space Agency, said launching Zarya, 42,000-pound space tugboat supply power propulsion early stages station construction, needed vindication troubled Russian space program. The Russian space industry alive well perfectly able fulfill commitments international space station, Koptev said. A Russian Proton booster rocket carried first part international space station orbit Friday, heralding start new era international space colonization. Russian space officials cheered ground control announced capsule separated booster rocket reached first orbit 200 kilometers (125 miles) Earth. Success, shouted one exultant official 10 minutes giant rocket blasted entered orbit. The heads space agencies 16 nations participating project watched lift-off distance 5 kilometers (3 miles). Strategic Rocket Forces troops prepared launch underground bunkers avoid poisoning highly toxic rocket fuel. Russian U.S. officials said launch flawless module performed well initial tests. They cautioned much work remains done get ambitious space station project working. Now 44 launches go, 1,000 hours space walks countless problems, trust mutual respect ... international space station going reality, NASA chief Daniel Goldin told press conference launch. His Russian counterpart, Yuri Koptev, said launch vital vindication troubled Russian space industry, proving could play major role space operations. Today made truly epoch-making step carry project. The Russian space industry alive well perfectly able fulfill commitments international space station, said. The launch went smoothly, rocket soaring cloudy sky central Asian steppes. The huge roar rocket reverberated dozens kilometers (miles) empty plain base. The mood launch pad tense launch, space officials workers anxiously making last-minute checks ensure problems. Solar power panels module successfully deployed shortly reached first orbit systems working normally, officials said. The launch Russian cargo module, delayed year, ushers new era cooperation former space-race rivals. Space officials expressed optimism cooperation would promote world stability end Cold War. We still contradictions, still combat missiles aimed other, predominant trend state cooperation things together, said Yuri Semyonov Russia's Energia space company. The 12.4-meter (41.2-feet) Zarya, Sunrise, launched three-stage Proton booster rocket. Zarya designed serve space tugboat early stages project, providing propulsion, power communications. Engineers finished final preparations early Friday liftoff 24-ton module. The rocket blasted cloudy skies strong winds, disappeared clouds 40 seconds later. The international space station, U.S.-led successor Russia's beleaguered Mir, involves 16 nations due completed 2004. It consist 100 elements take 45 assembly flights complete. Russia's crucial participation hampered country's financial problems. The launch first segment postponed repeatedly, mainly chronically broke Russian space agency afford complete another part station go later. Zarya fly alone two weeks rendezvous American space shuttle Endeavor, launched Dec. 3 carrying Unity connecting module. The space station inhabitable least early 2000, launch Russian crew module set blast next July August. The space station expected cost least dlrs 40 billion, United States planning pay dlrs 24 billion. It serve orbital home visiting astronauts cosmonauts least 15 years. Russia repeatedly failed meet deadlines constructing crew module, putting whole project schedule. Having lost hope getting promised government funds, Russian space agency sold research time station NASA dlrs 60 million complete segment. Russia rents Baikonur launching pad Kazakstan. Endeavour astronauts closed Sunday capture first piece international space station, Russian-made Zarya control module connected Unity chamber shuttle.

So they're paying products instead cash. Some workplaces already offered employees things hammers, nails, screws bolts instead traditional cash bonus normally equivalent one month's wage, said head Brazil's largest federation trade unions. The idea completely unacceptable, said Joao Antonio Felicio, secretary-general federation, represents 2,000 unions 19 million workers. We recommend unions reject preposterous proposal. But strapped cash punished high interest rates declining sales, factory owners may choice, said Joseph Curi, president Sao Paulo State Association Small Industries, represents 110,000 factories employ nearly 800,000 workers. Access credit almost impossible, Curi said. If banks government create kind emergency credit line, option many associates will use products pay bonus.

Curi predicted harsher times Brazil belt-tightening austerity package newly re-elected President Fernando Henrique Cardoso expected announce Tuesday. The measures, aimed curbing country's ballooning budget deficit  equal 7 percent gross domestic product  expected include spending cuts and, possibly, taxes. There lot talk increasing taxes, means less cash circulating market credit restrictions, Curi said. It shortsighted approach spell recession collapse many small factories.

Cardoso wants impose tough measures would slash government spending impose new taxes try halt slide Brazil's economy restore investor confidence. But plan, expected unveiled next week, must approved Congress, state governors enormous sway local delegations. The influence governors congressional blocs overwhelming, said University Sao Paulo political scientist Eduardo Kugelmas. Brazil caught financial turmoil began year ago Southeast Asia.

Kugelmas said opponents president stand good chance winning four large states  Sao Paulo, Minas Gerais, Rio de Janeiro Rio Grande Sul. If win, president face tough uphill battle, said. Cardoso needs governors' support influencing congressional delegations, also holding spending. The problem none candidates Sunday's elections ... wants identified unpopular austerity measures, said Kugelmas. So promise spend money schools, hospitals public work projects.

The presidents World Bank InterAmerican Development Bank also expected talks. The move U.S. Federal Reserve cut interest rates Thursday revived Latin America's financial markets, analysts expected reprieve short-lived deep concerns continent's economic health. The recent economic troubles stemmed part structural weaknesses Latin American economies. A strike waged state employees Colombia government austerity package offers glimpse trouble could arise tough reforms introduced. Brazil drafting austerity package hit public spending, especially social security. Brazilian officials ended four days meetings representatives International Monetary Fund Tuesday living public pledge announce concrete measures reduce government deficits. In Washington, Pedro Parente, executive secretary Brazilian Finance Ministry, offered details Brazil's plans raising primary account surplus next three years. With five days go gubernatorial runoffs Sunday, neither President Fernando Henrique Cardoso, Brasilia, said government planned achieve savings. Important allies Cardoso lagging three key states, government promises, market analysts expect announcement elections. Instead, strategy Brasilia Washington appeared focus reassuring markets work cutting deficit going forward, providing fodder opponents domestic elections. The discussions continue objective reaching agreement soon detailed program, said joint statement IMF Brazilian Finance Ministry. Because Brazil's enormous deficits, collapse emerging markets hit nation particularly hard, draining foreign currency reserves pushing economy recession. Finance officials Washington world fear collapse Brazil, size links economies, would worsen financial instability throughout hemisphere. With 160 million people, Brazil represents world's ninth-largest economy financial engine Latin America. Throughout day, government officials met Cardoso Brasilia expected fine-tune three-year austerity package Cardoso discuss congressional party leaders Wednesday morning. In Brasilia, officials said measures considered tax increase financial transactions, three-tenths percent two-tenths percent, extending Fiscal Stabilization Fund, sets aside 20 percent taxes collected presidential discretionary spending. The fund expired 1999. Speaking Washington, Parente said Brazil would aim surplus 2.6 percent 1999, 2.8 percent 2000 3 percent 2001. It already announced, end IMF's annual meeting Washington two weeks ago Brazil would reach primary account surplus 2.5 percent 3 percent qualify IMF aid. The primary account covers government expenses, interest payments debt.

The United States preparing commit U.S. taxpayer funds part lending program least $30 billion try insulate Brazil, rest Latin America, worst effects financial turmoil circling globe, according U.S. foreign officials assembling program. Details U.S. contribution, expected total several billion dollars direct aid loan guarantees, negotiated. But several congressional leaders alerted likelihood administration would act Congress recess. This early warning administration reflects memories Congress erupted objections hearings 1995 President Clinton committed $20 billion U.S. funds bailout Mexico. But administration officials said last week early soundings indicate members Congress deeply concerned preventing economic collapse Latin America would resound United States, thus expect objections. The timing aid package Brazil  originally expected next days  complicated unexpected delays cropped dealing Brazilian government. The government President Fernando Henrique Cardoso faces politically risky gubernatorial elections Sunday, may well determine whether Brazil execute austerity program key condition loans concurrently negotiating International Monetary Fund. The biggest role rescue program Brazil taken International Monetary Fund, said last week would contribute least $15 billion  appears pressure United States more. Another $9 billion come World Bank Inter-American Development Bank, remainder United States major industrial nations. Germany Japan, though, reluctant take part, one U.S. official noted, suggesting Latin America chiefly Washington's problem, own. So far, U.S. officials working scenes organize aid package said nothing public details plans direct contribution Brazil. Brazil important economic well-being region, United States international community, us much focused seeing helpful, Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin said Friday. But wide-ranging interview global economic turmoil, Rubin declined say strategy would pursue dealing Brazil's problems insisted decisions made United States might contribute. But discussed Brazil opportunity engage kind preventive financial diplomacy President Clinton advocated speeches IMF World Bank three weeks ago. At time, Clinton argued monetary fund provide contingent finance help countries ward global financial contagion rather wait disaster strike. Direct U.S. aid Brazil would clearly send symbolic message: year trying manage financial crisis monetary fund, United States ready put limited amount capital risk prevent havoc  Brazil stop chaos spreading Argentina, Mexico countries major U.S. trading partners. That would change strategy. So far, United States operated almost entirely international financial institutions, chiefly IMF But would also risky move President Clinton, economically politically. Even though Congress objected $20 billion U.S. funds committed bailout Mexico, turned $12 billion ultimately needed, paid back, interest. But Rubin noted Friday different environment now. Other administration officials say believe would objections Congress direct U.S. participation Brazil bailout. I think lot people Congress scared death what's happening markets, could happen districts, White House official said last week, say much long vote it. By acting soon stabilize Latin America, administration hoping capitalize two weeks relative calm late-summer panic engulfed Russia and, height, led outflow billion dollars day Brazil, fear would next country forced devalue currency. Whether calm marks beginning turnaround another pause wildfires erupted Thailand's currency crisis July 1997 matter considerable debate. But many experts cite confluence several events reassured jittery investors world: two successive interest-rate cuts United States, Japan's long-delayed move prop banking system $500 billion taxpayer funds, steady strengthening currencies Thailand, Indonesia South Korea, first signs investors may preparing return. Always circumspect comes commenting publicly markets, Rubin acknowledged last several weeks number significant, positive developments. But former trader, burned 26-year career many false market rallies, warned serious issues remain take time world work way repeatedly called serious international financial disruption last 50 years. In fact, Rubin's aides clearly nervous possibility another outbreak could set new panic, made virtually impossible many emerging-market countries borrow money world markets. Brazil Japan two obvious tinderboxes, said Jeffrey Garten, dean Yale School Management, served undersecretary commerce international affairs Clinton's first term. In Brazil, issue whether package coming together really big enough deal exploding debt problem. And Japan question whether real reform goes money. But spending 18 months negotiations Japanese, Rubin clearly senses United States little leverage Tokyo; problems chiefly rooted political gridlock, lack resources. In Brazil, though, United States better chance buying time influencing economic reform program, long appear dictating terms publicly Cardoso team. But demonstrating economic support probably require tapping Exchange Stabilization Fund, created Roosevelt administration help stabilize dollar. The money Rubin's control, presidential approval, reached circumvent congressional objections aiding Mexico 1995. But reaction strong  time Congress restricted tapping fund international bailouts  Rubin extraordinarily cautious ever since. He committed $3 billion second line defense emergency aid programs Indonesia South Korea last year, money ultimately dispersed either country. U.S. officials said South Korea need extra help, collapse Suharto government Indonesia changed political scene would risky offer direct U.S. aid. In bailout Russia  whose economy collapsed President Boris Yeltsin abandoned agreement reform economy dismissed leading reformers  United States offered direct help. Those events set panicked exit investors emerging markets, greatly worsened Brazil's troubles. So far, Brazilian officials successfully calmed market constantly talking forthcoming aid program IMF, convincing speculators would dangerous bet country. But time, Brazilian officials maintained pose really need cash  certainly hurry get it. U.S. officials top officials IMF clearly nervous, worried longer negotiations drag on, greater risk Brazil caught another market turmoil. The Brazilians want everyone think control, said investment banker involved talks. But fact there's still real risk sometime next 18 months government going forced devalue currency, pegged dollar, adjusts 7.5 percent year carefully controlled fall. To prevent sudden devaluation, Brazilian government raise interest rates 50 percent, choking credit companies. Meanwhile, country slipping recession. The aid would buy time Brazilians, contingent Cardoso's success persuading legislature end huge deficits, chiefly unpopular cuts social spending. The first deputy managing director International Monetary Fund, Stanley Fischer, spent Friday Brazil review country's austerity plan, expected announced Sunday's elections international package, avoid appearance global lender dictating conditions Brazil. Brazil lot, Fischer said last week leaving trip. In return, I expect international community make large contribution.

Whether calm mark beginning turnaround another pause wildfire erupted Thailand's currency crisis July 1997 matter considerable debate. But many expert cite confluence several event reassured jittery investor world: two successive interest-rate cut United States, Japan's long-delayed move prop banking system $500 billion taxpayer fund, steady strengthening currency Thailand, Indonesia South Korea, first sign investor may preparing return. Always circumspect come commenting publicly market, Rubin acknowledged last several week number significant, positive development. But former trader, burned 26-year career many false market rally, warned serious issue remain take time world work way repeatedly called serious international financial disruption last 50 year. In fact, Rubin's aide clearly nervous possibility another outbreak could set new panic, made virtually impossible many emerging-market country borrow money world market. Brazil Japan two obvious tinderbox, said Jeffrey Garten, dean Yale School Management, served undersecretary commerce international affair Clinton's first term. In Brazil, issue whether package coming together really big enough deal exploding debt problem. And Japan question whether real reform go money. But spending 18 month negotiation Japanese, Rubin clearly sens United States little leverage Tokyo; problem chiefly rooted political gridlock, lack resource. In Brazil, though, United States better chance buying time influencing economic reform program, long appear dictating term publicly Cardoso team. But demonstrating economic support probably require tapping Exchange Stabilization Fund, created Roosevelt administration help stabilize dollar. The money Rubin's control, presidential approval, reached circumvent congressional objection aiding Mexico 1995. But reaction strong time Congress restricted tapping fund international bailouts Rubin extraordinarily cautious ever since. He committed $3 billion second line defense emergency aid program Indonesia South Korea last year, money ultimately dispersed either country. US. official said South Korea need extra help, collapse Suharto government Indonesia changed political scene would risky offer direct US. aid. In bailout Russia whose economy collapsed President Boris Yeltsin abandoned agreement reform economy dismissed leading reformer United States offered direct help. Those event set panicked exit investor emerging market, greatly worsened Brazil's trouble. So far, Brazilian official successfully calmed market constantly talking forthcoming aid program IMF, convincing speculator would dangerous bet country. But time, Brazilian official maintained pose really need cash certainly hurry get it. US. official top official IMF clearly nervous, worried longer negotiation drag on, greater risk Brazil caught another market turmoil. The Brazilians want everyone think control, said investment banker involved talk. But fact there's still real risk sometime next 18 month government going forced devalue currency, pegged dollar, adjusts 7.5 percent year carefully controlled fall. To prevent sudden devaluation, Brazilian government raise interest rate 50 percent, choking credit company. Meanwhile, country slipping recession. The aid would buy time Brazilians, contingent Cardoso's success persuading legislature end huge deficit, chiefly unpopular cut social spending. The first deputy managing director International Monetary Fund, Stanley Fischer, spent Friday Brazil review country's austerity plan, expected announced Sunday's election international package, avoid appearance global lender dictating condition Brazil. Brazil lot, Fischer said last week leaving trip. In return, I expect international community make large contribution.

There's thing free lunch longer Brazil, President Fernando Henrique Cardoso telling government worker. No haircut phone call, either. Eager bolster sagging economy, Cardoso want slash dlrs 19 billion budget deficit, he's beginning paring perk 2,000 worker presidential palace Brasilia, capital.

Despite Cardoso's effort, many Brazilians le impressed palace penny-pinching.

The Globo TV network also suggested still plenty fat cut, citing government expense running shoe, Persian carpet gold cufflink, intended present visiting dignitary.

The Commerce Department Tuesday provided concrete measure effect global economic downturn American economy, reporting nation's trade deficit widened $2.2 billion August $16.77 billion. That widest gap government recalculated way measure trade flow 1992. It resulted decline American export sharp increase country buy abroad. So far year, trade deficit running roughly 50 percent last year's level projected $170 billion year, gap expected widen further. One senior administration official deal economic issue, speaking condition anonymity, said Tuesday internal projection suggest trade deficit 1999 could reach $300 billion, figure said certainly cut growth, could well become major political problem. Trade deficit carry good troubling signal economy. The current flood import helping contain inflation lowest level decade.

And effect hurting everyone Midwest farmer longer send wheat impoverished Russia, East Coast fisherman discovering Japan's appetite salmon lobster ruined banking crisis. Among surprising element Tuesday's report third August's deficit one country far managed ward worst effect global troubles: China. Despite continued growth Chinese economy, export China slowed dramatically import Chinese-made good exploded, country desperately seek sell good would ordinarily sold elsewhere Asia. That increased monthly deficit Beijing $5.9 billion, level previously seen trade Japan. The Chinese besieged flood, deeply troubled state-owned industry incipient banking crisis signaled United States recent week little interest swift move open market return entry World Trade Organization.

President Kim Dae-jung, appearing Clinton news conference, pledged government would spare effort supporting U.S. endeavor resolve nuclear question. He called full access U.S. inspectors North Korean underground facility said North must constrain development exports missiles. On first two days South Korea, Clinton also held roundtable discussion business leaders hear prescriptions putting nation's economy back track. Economics security Clinton's twin themes five-day Asia trip began Japan. Clinton acknowledged U.S. intelligence officials certain suspicious underground construction project North Korea nuclear related. But said North risks closing door cooperation refuses U.S. inspection site. It raises strong suspicion, Clinton said joint news conference Kim Blue House, presidential mansion overlooking capital. We need access it. The foundation U.S. efforts ease North Korea's decades-long hostility South 1994 agreed framework North halted nuclear weapons program exchange Western commitment build modern nuclear energy sources there. That deal would shattered suspect site turned clandestine nuclear project. And that, turn, would jeopardize preliminary North-South peace talks could produce treaty replace shaky armistice ended Korean War 1953. Kim, moved South Korea sunshine policy engaging North Korea cultural economic fronts, firmly said government supports Clinton nuclear issue. We must require full access ways ascertain nature purposes construction site, Kim said. If is, fact, proven nuclear related, demand immediate close down. He also said North must limit missile development, citing great shock Japan North Koreans test-fired missile way Aug. 31. In dinner toast, Kim said tensions, North Korea cautiously noticeably taking measures increase interaction cooperation South North. And Clinton saluted Seoul's battle Asia's economic woes. I believe Asia emerge present crisis prosperous, stable, democratic  thanks small measure Korea's example. After state dinner, Clinton made surprise late-night stop concert Sejong Culture Center younger brother, Roger, band performing. The president listened songs stage brother introduced president special person. The audience 2,000 people stood applauded. In meetings week Pyongyang, North Korean capital, U.S. officials rebuffed request see suspicious underground site, American intelligence officials fear could secret effort revive North's nuclear weapons program. U.S. spy satellite photos show thousands workers digging massive complex. U.S. special envoy Charles Kartman said Thursday Pyongyang talks compelling evidence underground nuclear facility. But statement distributed U.S. Embassy Saturday, Kartman backtracked, saying instead United States lacks conclusive evidence site nuclear facility. There strong information makes us suspicious, lack conclusive evidence intended purpose underground site nuclear related and, so, type nuclear facility might be, Kartman said, offering clarification earlier remarks. Kim said government would spare effort supporting U.S. endeavor resolve nuclear question. The North Koreans denied underground construction site nuclear purpose, demanded dlrs 300 million payment proving that. In remarks Tokyo Friday, Clinton rejected idea compensation. Directing remarks North Korea, Clinton noted significance new tourism deal bringing South Koreans North cruise ships  arrangement touted Kim sign North may opening 1950s Korean War enemy. To risk kind cooperation  progress America issues  stonewalling suspected nuclear site contrary North's long-term interests, said. Nothing could ever put hole ground, given defense partnership here, nothing could ever put hole ground would give North Koreans much advantage, much power, much wealth, much happiness, ships going full people here, Clinton said. To underscore U.S. military commitment South Korea, Clinton scheduled venture capital Sunday visit U.S. Army troops training range north Seoul. He also planned address American troops Osan Air Base U-2 spy plane hangar. North Korea demanded United States pay hundreds millions dollars right inspect huge underground center U.S. intelligence analysts fear houses nuclear-weapons program, Clinton administration officials said Wednesday. The United States rejected request meetings week Pyongyang, North Korean capital, North Korean officials U.S. government delegation. As expected, North Koreans brought issue compensation, flatly rejected it, said State Department Spokesman James Rubin. Asked much money North Koreans demanded, Rubin said payment fee possibility I care get figures. Other administration officials said fee would hundreds millions dollars; one put $300 million. The North Koreans denied complex, built mountainside 25 miles northeast Yongbyon, former North Korean nuclear research center, intended used nuclear weapons program. They repeatedly said U.S. inspectors could visit site long Washington agreed pay large fee compensation North Koreans describe administration's slander. The North Korean representative United Nations, Kim Chang Guk, said last week United States could inspect site condition confirmed nuclear facility, United States pay compensation slandering defaming country. U.S. intelligence agencies fear building complex, North Korea may decided abandon four-year-old agreement United States North Korea pledged give nuclear weapons program exchange billions dollars aid. The U.S. delegation, led Charles Kartman, President Clinton's special envoy North Korean issues, left Pyongyang Wednesday 12 hours negotiations three days team North Korean Foreign Ministry. The talks ended Clinton began trip Asia include visit South Korea, issue North Korean construction site expected major topics discussed President Kim Dae-jung. Rubin said U.S. delegation North Korea pressed access site. We told access site essential, said. We've expected would difficult, told North Koreans, we've said before, verbal assurances, wont give, simply unacceptable. U.S. officials said construction underground site may technically violated accord, evidence North Korea begun pouring cement new reactor reprocessing plant convert nuclear waste bomb-grade plutonium. But United States determines North Korea revived nuclear program, Rubin said, would go entire letter spirit objectives agreement, would affect viability agreement. The administration expressed growing concern North Korea's intentions several provocative acts, including underground construction Yongbyon test firing last August missile Japan. Last week Clinton named former Defense Secretary William Perry review U.S. policy North Korea. Administration officials say Perry asked study ways salvage 1994 nuclear agreement North Korea, administration's proudest achievements foreign policy. North Korean news media Thursday said communist nation's military full alert war United States dispute nuclear inspections comes blows. The North's official Korean Central News Agency reported North Korean soldiers people walks life full alert war. North Korea typically sends belligerent rhetoric, especially enters high-stake talks Washington. The United States North Korea set resume talks Friday inspections underground North Korean site suspected used produce nuclear weapons. KCNA broadcasts brimmed anti-American saber-rattling. Our People's Army blow U.S. territory whole United States starts war divided Korean Peninsula, Vice Defense Minister Jong Chang Ryol quoted saying Thursday. The general staff North Korean military accused Washington Wednesday pushing situation Korea brink war demanding inspections talks aimed preventing Pyongyang developing nuclear weapons long-range missiles. Under prevailing touch-and-go situation, Korean People's Army bracing fight U.S. imperialist aggressors, KCNA quoted Jong saying. The agency also quoted various party officials, plant managers, museum curators pledging thousandfold revenge vowing arm spirit human bombs suicidal attack. Washington demands unconditional inspections North's underground project. But North Korea asked Washington pay dlrs 300 million right inspect site. Concerns North Korea developing long-range missiles capable striking Japan parts United States escalated North Korea fired rocket Aug. 31. Believed test Taepo Dong missile, rocket flew Japan landed Pacific Ocean. The North's 1.1 million-strong military world's fifth largest. It forms backbone North Korean government, leader Kim Jong Il ruling country head military. A congressman visited remote parts North Korea last week said Saturday food health situation desperate deteriorating, millions North Koreans might starved death last years. The congressman, Tony Hall, D-Ohio, longtime interest world hunger, passed Tokyo return United States showed photographs taken North Korean children patchy hair, protruding bones, open sores signs severe malnutrition. Hall also brought back bag officials called substitute food distributed government food station: dried leaves straw, coarse cattle would normally turn away. They grind powder make noodles, Hall said. The noodles nutrition indigestible, leaving people holding aching stomachs, said. North Korea admitted facing serious economic difficulties, sharply diverging assessments serious are. Some visitors United Nations organizations said food situation seems bit better year two ago. Hall said divergence might arisen North Korean capital, Pyongyang, life seem slightly better three previous trips North Korea. But rural areas foreigners allowed visit, added, overall situation worse ever. Based visits four hospitals, Hall also emphasized public health care declined sharply. In one hospital, assistants holding patient surgeons conducted stomach operation electric lights anesthesia. Ordinary North Koreans suffering, part, government's hard-line policies alienated would-be donors aid agencies. The United Nations repeatedly appealed relief aid North Korea, latest appeal raised less one-third target. In September, Doctors Without Borders announced pulling staff 13 North Korea feared aid going politically connected rather needy. North Korea release mortality figures health statistics, Hall said United Nations gathered would soon release data indicating 30 percent North Korean children age 2 acutely malnourished 67 percent children physically stunted. Hall said thought overall least 1 million people died total probably closer 3 million. In indication seriousness professional demographers view situation, U.S. Bureau Census recently published estimates suggesting North Korea's population peaked 1995 21.55 million fallen 21.23 million year. That would decline 320,000 three years, period North Korea's population would expected grow 925,000 people, based population growth rate early 1990s. Nicholas Eberstadt, American specialist North Korean population figures, says simply enough hard information estimate death toll famine. But notes one political tidbit: North Korea's constitution stipulates one delegate country's people's assembly every 30,000 citizens. This year's assembly expand previous ones did, rather 687 delegates, previous assembly held 1990. While Eberstadt counsels caution, could mean North Korea's population, eight years expected add several million people, back 20.6 million people fewer. The United States supplying grain North Korea, strains growing secret underground complex North experts worry may heart new nuclear weapons program. The United States warned last week agreed framework basis relations North Korea jeopardy unless North lets American experts visit underground complex resolve doubts. North Korea said show complex Washington promises complex nuclear one, pay vilifying us impairing prestige. Washington refuses pay, North Korea warning standoff could lead agreement fall apart. Their shameless wicked demand open infringement sovereignty wanton interference internal affairs, declared North Korea's leading newspaper, Rodong Sinmun. A South Korean lawmaker said Friday communist North Korea could producing plutonium could secret underground nuclear facilities already feared. Without naming source, Rep. Kim Deog-ryong Parliament's Foreign Affairs Committee said information two underground facilities captured U.S. spy satellite photos may nuclear plants. He said Parliament session one believed already producing plutonium would able produce enough 10 nuclear bombs starting 2004. If true, assertion paints worse picture suspected North Korean nuclear activity already made public. Kim said asked government's Unification Ministry issue earlier week suspicious answer. It sufficient sincere, I came suspect government trying hide truth, Kim said seven-page press release. U.S. South Korean officials said August detected huge underground construction site mountainside 40 kilometers (25 miles) northeast Yongbyon, country's main nuclear complex. The United States said suspects construction nuclear-related, though evidence. North Korea denied it. Kim, lawmaker main opposition Grand National Party, said may actually two underground facilities far Yongbyon complex. It activity Yongbyon prompted United States negotiate 1994 accord promising development two light-water reactors fuel-oil shipments North Korea would halt nuclear weapons development. At time, North Korea believed made enough plutonium one two atomic bombs. The Yongbyon complex, houses 500-megawatt laboratory nuclear reactor, frozen 1994 accord. Kim said Friday one new facility already operating construction operational four six years. We estimate reactor go on-line 2002 2003, enabling production enough plutonium build one nuclear weapon six 12 months, Kim said. North Korea would able make sufficient plutonium make eight 10 nuclear weapons every year that. North Korea said underground construction civilian use nuclear-related. It offered open facility U.S. inspectors, says Washington must pay compensation facility proven civilian use. President Clinton made unusual, direct appeal North Korea Saturday set aside nuclear ambitions favor strengthening ties South Korea United States. The appeal came meeting reporters also counseled patience Iraq's refusal comply request weapons inspectors. I think important overreact first day, Clinton said response reports Iraq balked request U.N. inspectors documents weapons program. But, speaking joint appearance South Korean President Kim Dae Jung, Clinton called requested documents quite important said Iraq affirmative obligations help weapons inspectors. Aides Clinton denied comments represented softening Iraq. They said situation still developing president preparing meetings Kim briefed detail Iraq's resistance appeared reporters Saturday. National Security Adviser Sandy Berger said administration consulting members U.N. Security Council matter. If Iraq fails meet obligations U.N. resolutions, said, We obviously prepared act. Last weekend, Clinton called strike Iraq minutes begin, delayed departure Asia monitor crisis said U.S. forces remained poised strike Iraq reneged agreement let U.N. weapons inspectors work. In appearance Kim, president addressed handful questions ranged North Korea Indonesia whether Congress punish Lewinsky scandal. Before leaving Washington five-day trip Japan, Korea Guam, drew parallel governments Iraq North Korea, saying, We must less concerned North Korea's weapons activities. The Clinton administration urgently seeking inspect vast construction site North Korea believes may beginnings nuclear weapons plant. Saturday, Clinton called site, together North Korea's test firing August missile Japan, cause deep concern. But Clinton administration trying different approach North Korea Iraq, partly urging Kim, pursuing sunshine policy engagement North. As Clinton Kim delivered prepared statements answered questions Saturday, Clinton became animated describing called beautiful picture happened spot turning hotel television arriving Seoul Friday night: film cruise ship recently permitted carry South Koreans tour North. I ask North Koreans think this, said, arguing Kim's policy engagement North presented great opportunity. Nothing could ever put hole ground would give North Koreans much advantage, much power, much wealth, much happiness ships going full people here. The Clinton administration fears construction site may evidence North Korea abandoned 1994 pledge United States give nuclear weapons program exchange billions dollars aid. The North Koreans denied complex intended help build nuclear weapons. But demanded United States pay $300 million inspect it, request rejected week U.S. delegation Pyongyang, North Korean capital. The new complex built mountainside 25 miles northeast Yongbyon, former North Korean nuclear research center. Kim continued Saturday emphasize hopes new opening North Korea. But said, We tolerate possible attempt North Korea proliferate nuclear weapons, missiles weapons mass destruction. The Clinton administration plans resume negotiating North Korea inspecting site December. In addition strategies easing Asian financial crisis, Clinton discussed North Korea visit Tokyo Thursday Friday. The subject North Korea consumed two hours meetings Kim Saturday Blue House, contains Korean president's office home. The administration criticized Congress region letting policy North Korea drift, Clinton called policy clear-eyed mix diplomacy deterrence. He said far 1994 agreement worked, North Korea already would produced sizable amount weapons-grade plutonium. Under pressure congressional critics, Clinton last week appointed William Perry, former defense secretary, review policy North Korea. On matters, Clinton declined criticize government Indonesia using force crack protesters there, saying enough facts moment give right answer. But said hoped would backsliding Indonesia. Clinton followed appearance Kim visit National Folk Museum here, conducted hourlong conversation six Korean academics, businessmen union leaders troubled state Korea's economy impact society. He attended state dinner Saturday night, stopping concert brother, Roger, musician, happened performing. Clinton repeatedly congratulated Kim efforts economic reform, noting interest rates fallen currency stabilized. But also pressed Kim private meetings restructure five huge conglomerates, chaebols, account 40 percent Korean economy. In describing leaders' conversation, Berger called restructuring chaebols perhaps serious remaining problem South Korean economy. Clinton said economic forum Saturday afternoon felt impatient South Korea's failure act chaebols. It may necessary proceed slowly restructuring, said, begin. On Sunday, Clinton plans visit 37,000 American troops stationed here. In green aviator jacket black cap, President Clinton spent Sunday visiting American troops stationed South Korea. He promoted private, sang birthday greetings sergeant major described threats hopes peaceful engagement North Korea. Lately, signs danger intensified, Clinton said address airmen here, standing gunmetal gray F-16 A-10 parked nose-to-nose. So must remain vigilant. And thanks you, are. For eagerness talk information-age economic dangers quicksilver currency flows, Clinton returned again five-day trip Japan South Korea old-style regional military threat posed North Korea. The subject consumed meetings President Kim Dae-jung South Korea Saturday formed backdrop visits troops Sunday. It's kind tense here, said John Kelley, 26-year-old airman Wisconsin, describing life base. You know four minutes away missile. In speech, Clinton pointed recent North Korean missile tests, incursions south mysterious underground site may nuclear weapons installation signs potential threat. And compared North Korea Iraq, saying North Korea also major concern chemical biological weapons. Until North Korea fully commits constructive role peninsula, said, must remain ready. Clinton restated support Kim's policy engagement North Korea, though, saying hopeful signs justify it. He pointed talks began summer American military command Korea North Korean military prevent problems demilitarized zone south north. Clinton planned leave South Korea early Monday return Washington Monday night, paying visit Guam. On bright icy afternoon, Clinton warmly received soldiers camouflage black boots, waited almost three hours, shifting foot foot rubbing hands.

On darker note, mentioned recent tensions Asian steel exports United States, skyrocketed year great cost domestic U.S. steelmakers. Japanese steel biggest problem, South Korean steel exports also rise. Clinton said U.S. economy could tolerate increased imports  concentrated industries, result Asian economies begin recover. We sensitive price basically erase entire sector U.S. economy, Clinton said. North Korea agreed receive U.S. delegation next month discuss American concerns construction vast underground complex widely feared house nuclear weapons program, State Department said Wednesday. The delegation, led Charles Kartman, press access site, American intelligence agencies believe could centerpiece effort revive frozen nuclear arms program. We've made clear North Koreans attempt North Korea pursue nuclear weapons development program would unacceptable, State Department spokesman, James Rubin, said. The talks Pyongyang, capital, added, aimed completely satisfying U.S. concerns suspect construction. American intelligence agencies fear building complex could effort break four-year-old pact North Korea pledged give nuclear-weapons program exchange billions dollars aid United States, South Korea Japan. American officials said spy satellites recently photographed thousands North Koreans huge site 25 miles northeast Yongbyon, nuclear center North Korea believed stockpiled enough plutonium 1994 accords build six bombs. Although explained exactly government building complex, North Korean officials denied would used develop nuclear weapons. The official North Korean press agency said last week government building civilian underground structures `doubt' cannot cast suggested American officials would allowed inspect complex pressed access. If U.S. side persists inspecting underground structures, press agency said, show them. Rubin said United States received formal assurances Kartman, American special envoy Korean nuclear issues, delegation would allowed inspect site trip, begin Nov. 16. We beginning discussion demand access, Rubin said. The history U.S.-North Korea discussions involves lengthy discussion process agreement requirements. So expecting walk one day able access next. The trip announced signs grow relative warming relations United States North Korea. Representatives United States, China two Koreas met recently Geneva agreed steps reduce tension Korean Peninsula. In September United States pledged provide additional 300,000 tons grain North Korea, years crippled severe food shortages.

American officials said activity Yongbyon may technically violated accord, evidence North Korea begun pouring cement new reactor reprocessing plant convert nuclear waste bomb-grade plutonium. This city always kept unwritten list foreign leaders  dictators, unfriendly authoritarians consistently annoying allies  thinks make enormous contribution peace, security America's agenda taking early retirement, minimum. In 1950s, leftist leaders Iran Guatamala made Top 10, '60s populated Diem Sukarno Southeast Asians. President Richard M. Nixon advisers infamously agreed secret meeting '70s best way deal government Salvador Allende Gossens Chile make economy scream. Diplomatic etiquette, though, discouraged shouting America's enemies list White House rooftop. After all, foreign policy personalities, right? But last week, driven frustration, anxiety, perhaps lure sounding tough cameras, Clinton administration piped up, twice. In different situations, corners world, United States spoke loudly can't find stick. Sunday, hours called attack Iraq, Clinton finally volunteered obvious, focus U.S. policy Iraq removal President Saddam Hussein  Clinton called supporting forces change Iraq. No matter covert efforts failed miserably. The bigger surprise came Monday, polite-to-a-fault Al Gore used visit Malaysia Asian economic summit meeting throw U.S. support protesters calling reformasi, code word streets Kuala Lumpur dumping Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamed. He long burr Washington's side, denouncing America, currency traders Jews. He recently imprisoned Western-thinking finance minister, Anwar Ibrahim, suddenly become Asia's visible jailed dissident. But Mahathir Saddam, long shot. Gore's aides insist speech call reform, demand Mahathir step down. But interpreted way. The New Zealanders called megaphone diplomacy. The Malaysian government called disgusting interference internal affairs. Predictably, executives several U.S. companies flocked Kuala Lumpur told Malaysians Gore rude, assuring Washington uttered words needed said. Whatever wisdom Gore's words, raised question takes days world's powerful nation begin publicly suggesting time nettlesome leader go. Because official list, real criteria getting it. Some leaders mysteriously escape mention, Kim Jong Il North Korea.

Rivera, president largest union New York City, praised D'Amato persuading Trent Lott, Senate majority leader, support legislation financed health coverage hundreds thousands uninsured children. It looked Rivera's politically potent union might endorse D'Amato  minimum stay neutral year's U.S. Senate race New York. But Monday, Rivera's 150,000-member union, 1199, National Health Human Service Employees union, endorsed Rep. Charles E. Schumer, D-N.Y., thereby risked D'Amato's wrath. The endorsement risky, labor leaders acknowledge, angering powerful senator could make far less responsive labor's needs unions turn help future re-elected. Although may seem illogical, two words go far explain Rivera's union backed Schumer: Monica Lewinsky. Largely result Lewinsky scandal, Democrats say suddenly fear Republicans gain filibuster-proof, 60-seat majority Senate, Republicans 55 seats Democrats' 45. For labor leaders Rivera, notion strong Republican majority nightmare. That fear helped push New York unions Schumer's column, though D'Amato long courted them. Those unions include teamsters' joint council New York City District Council 37, umbrella group representing 120,000 municipal employees. Labor leaders say fear filibuster-proof Republican majority, Senate would push anti-union legislation, recently defeated Republican proposals curb labor's political spending cut financing National Labor Relations Board. We worried legislation allow labor movement survive next century, Rivera said. Alarmed Democrats lose Senate seats California, Illinois, Wisconsin, Nevada South Carolina, Rivera's union concluded worth backing Schumer. The decision, Rivera emphasized repeatedly, personal based national considerations. Unfortunately, leadership Republican Party national level person Newt Gingrich Trent Lott necessarily culture Republicans Northeast, said. They're far conservative, far anti-labor, far anti-worker, far pro-business. We fear Democratic Party faces irrelevance United States Senate go 41 seats. Trying avoid rupture D'Amato, Rivera praised effective senator. The endorsement could boon Schumer. Rivera's union teachers' union labor's strongest political operations New York. In addition, Schumer get thousands dollars local well use renowned phone banks, make 50,000 political calls day. A spokesman D'Amato said, Al D'Amato's proud he's endorsed 100 union federations locals, representing 400,000 working men women, he'll continue efforts behalf working middle class families. His labor endorsements include New York City Patrolmen's Benevolent Association New York State Building Construction Trades Council. Besides backing 1199, Schumer also received endorsement 1199's parent union, Service Employees International Union, 350,000 members New York State. Rivera  support D'Amato last time ran either  announced endorsements founding convention New York State Council service employees union. The convention packed Town Hall, new group aims make service employees power reckoned bringing together dozen union locals forge common political legislative strategy. Earlier year, 1199 merged service employees, part agreement, Rivera became head service employees New York State. Nearly 60 years times, House voted Friday condemn Nazi-Soviet nonaggression pact 1939. The measure, nonbinding resolution, brought floor Rep. John Shimkus, R-Ill. He Lithuanian descent, pocket Lithuanians hometown Collinsville wants try highlight support Baltic states' efforts Soviet repression. Shimkus' measure example members Congress spending time stand idle wait Republican leaders reach agreement spending bills White House, thus avoiding government shutdown allowing go home campaign November elections. With time hands, many Republicans using House floor personal stage elicit votes topics boast folks back home. Most matters little chance finding way law, members hope turn advantage Election Day. There plenty items whose sponsors hope attract attention. These tend special-interest matters members hope escape scrutiny rush leave town. The sponsors measures added advantage impeachment inquiry, preoccupying Congress, news media public giving cover move pet causes quietly gigantic omnibus package Congress eventually present Clinton signing. These quieter measures include one proposed Mississippi's two senators, Trent Lott Thad Cochran, Republicans. They want agriculture export credits buy chickens Russia, bought chickens cannot pay them. The chickens Mississippi. Democrats little influence Republican-controlled Congress. But Democrats close enough Republican leaders, Republican goals, measures taken seriously. These include Rep. John Murtha, D-Pa., ranking Democrat national security subcommittee Appropriations Committee, pushing measure increase military pensions. Perhaps best example attempt force vote political advantage measure would require minors notify parents seeking contraceptives federally funded family planning clinics. House leaders allowed measure brought floor way appease conservative members, believe shortchanged budget process. It passed House vote 224-200 almost chance becoming law. The Senate plan take up, Clinton would almost certainly veto it. But Rep. Tom Coburn, R-Okla., said votes important put sponsors' ideological foes record opposing something sounds reasonable, opposition used Nov. 3 election. It voice mail message Dr. Marilyn Rymer, neurologist Kansas City, Mo., would routinely delete, registered Democrat. Speaker Newt Gingrich's office, said, calling discuss national leadership award. Dr. Rymer acclaim director prominent stroke-treatment center, proposition seemed particularly grand. When returned call, said told would also named honorary chairman elite committee advise Gingrich legislation. Too good true? Well, Dr. Rymer would pay way committee actually meet, honorary committee chairman, discovered, would member committee composed entirely honorary chairmen. And oh, speaker wanted donation $500 $1,000 help efforts, according transcript similar chat another doctor, elect bigger Republican majority House Representatives. With approach midterm elections next month, turns National Republican Congressional Committee, supports candidates House, sponsoring similar calls tens thousands small-business owners, including doctors. With fund-raising programs, committee says amassed $62 million elections. But campaign finance watchdogs say solicitations mark new departure political fund raising, one call akin practices marketing companies Publishers' Clearing House hook consumers visions million-dollar windfalls induce subscribe magazines. By citing speaker promising celebrity influence, say, calls bait-and-switch scheme seize attention people might otherwise hang up. Dr. Rymer says incensed. So Dr. Stanley Turecki, child family psychiatrist New York votes independent also called. I absolutely outraged, said. Anybody else would would fall category consumer fraud. Kenneth Gross, Washington lawyer specializes election law represents Democratic Republican clients, said, I never heard particular device. But appear illegal, said, adding, It's fund-raising gimmick get attention. Fred Wertheimer, president Democracy 21, nonprofit, nonpartisan advocate campaign finance reform, said, This new version caveat emptor  buyer damned instead buyer beware. When businesses it, added, Congress orders investigations. But going investigated members Congress it. Todd Harris, spokesman National Republican Congressional Committee, said heard complaints intent deceive. The national leadership award part call donor member fulfillment, Harris said. It's part bringing process. It's important recognized support give party. There's quid pro quo people solicited could receive awards contributions, added. What peeves Drs. Rymer Turecki message left secretaries answering machines invoking Gingrich's office proposing award. They say envisioned senior aide telephone speaker's chambers Capitol Dome. The calls, however, placed aides Gingrich, offices anyone Washington. They made people headsets computers home InfoCision Management Corp., telemarketing firm Congressional committee client Akron, Ohio. On Web page, InfoCision says 1,400 employees operate 1,584 telephone lines 9 phone centers. Every word script approved clients, company says Web site. Every conceivable objection scripted powerful rebuttal. Besides telemarketing businesses, said Jamie Blair, supervisor center, specialize helping Republican Party conservative political groups. However far Gingrich, telemarketers instructed answer return calls with: Republican Congressional Committee, Newt Gingrich's office. May I help you? A doctor Kansas City, Mo., registered Republican declined named, dialed Gingrich number (888-484-1644) left answering machines secretly recorded ensuing discussion, legal Missouri. We asked contact behalf speaker, says woman picked call identified Nancy. He right aggressively pushing legislation cut taxes much half, he's also interested legislation cut capital gains single rate 15 percent. To assure passage legislation, speaker wants increase Republican majority, says, adding, To help us that, speaker pulling together group individuals inviting honorary chairman advisory council. Nancy continues: There correspondence speaker, conference calls. It's great way get input thoughts legislation concern you. Or maybe surveys questionnaires. Later, Nancy says: As member committee, would receiving speaker national leadership award, really quite honor. And honest, asking chairmen could help efforts increase majority one-time contribution $500 $1,000. Now would used nationwide media campaign Newt undertaken target seats really need. And someone I'm sure would also benefit this, could I tell speaker could count help? The doctor demurs. I registered, know, Republican Kansas, tells Nancy. Probably I something would go representative. Then doctor tries ascertain Nancy located. Is congressman Gingrich's office I'm talking to? doctor asks. The speaker's office, says Nancy. This speaker's office. That I'm talking to, says doctor, double-checking. Uh-huh, Nancy replies. The law prohibits political fund-raising calls federal offices. Vice President Al Gore Justice Department investigation fund-raising calls allegedly made office 1996 presidential campaign. But calls made anywhere else, including campaign offices. Harris said calls way related speaker's OFFICIAL office. He added: What important calls get routed. People interested award speaker's good name whether call gets routed Washington Ohio. Turecki disagrees. I see basic sleaze, said. The last time George Voinovich ran office, re-election Ohio's governor 72 percent vote, stunning optimistic supporters setting 20th-century record victory margins Ohio politics. This year, Voinovich, Republican barred seeking third term, running again, time Senate seat held John Glenn, Democrat retiring. And expect Voinovich repeat electoral benchmark four years ago, politicians parties generally acknowledge well positioned increase Republican majority Senate. That prevented Voinovich's Democratic opponent, Mary Boyle, undertaking vigorous campaign. Ms. Boyle, former commissioner Cuyahoga County, encompasses Cleveland, crisscrossing nation's seventh-most populous state describes grass-roots campaign that, operating comparative shoestring, nonetheless attracted side nationally known Democrats  President Clinton foremost  campaign trail. Glenn, former astronaut preparing return space month age 77, made endorsement Senate race. Like many candidates year, Ms. Boyle, 55, campaigning hard issue education, seeking portray Voinovich, 61, lackluster steward allowed state's schools decline. He promised education governor, said Ms. Boyle. But seven half years failed students state. Her role campaign, said, remind people state Ohio George Voinovich made promise deliver it. Specifically, discusses decision last year Ohio Supreme Court cited wide disparities quality state's schools ruled unconstitutional formula funding them. She also attacked Republican opponent supporting proposal raise state's sales tax one percent. Under plan, half additional funds would used school improvement remainder earmarked reducing property taxes. That statewide ballot initiative last May proved wildly unpopular, 80 percent voters opposing it. While topics taxes education hot ones political season Ohio, clear Ms. Boyle's emphasis helped campaign. Despite narrowing opinion polls, still trailing Voinovich 15 percentage points polls much 20 points others. There also sharp fund-raising disparity. Ms. Boyle, running first statewide race widespread union support, raised nearly $2 million far, far less nearly $7 million Voinovich taken in. Also, Voinovich, former lieutenant governor, statewide ballots five times last 20 years thus better-known candidate. The electoral dynamics Ohio also aiding Voinovich. The northern half state, history industrial, unionized cities, tradition voting largely Democratic candidates, southern tier state considered conservative typically leans Republican. But Voinovich Ms. Boyle share home terrain, depriving Ms. Boyle geographic advantage accompanies Democratic candidates. Indeed, boy, Voinovich delivered newspapers Boyle home working-class Collinwood section Cleveland. And Voinovich, former mayor Cleveland, developed reputation moderate Republican works well Democrats. Voinovich, campaigning vigorously himself, keeping full schedule official duties, assuming role experienced, elected official. If I get Senate, I probably know domestic policy member Senate, said interview Wednesday Canton, sandwiched ribbon-cutting ceremony fund-raising reception vacuum cleaner museum. As mayor, I nose rubbed problems urban America fairly successful dealing them. And, governor, I dealt problems Medicaid, welfare education. I'm person United States president National League Cities chairman National Governors Association. To opponent's charges record education, Voinovich dismissive. I'm probably Republican United States endorsed Ohio Education Association National Education Association, said, adding Ms. Boyle member state Legislature period cited Supreme Court ruling. Mary Boyle vice chairman Ways Means Committee member Democratic leadership years, Voinovich said. They nothing fix buildings, nothing technology urban school districts. Ms. Boyle, begun run campaign commercials television, said status underdog allowed focused, intense. Pausing campaign fund-raising breakfast former Democratic Sen. Bill Bradley New Jersey Wednesday, Ms. Boyle said: This marathon pretty much uphill. But now, we're last three miles. It's tough race. In cocoon loyal wealthy supporters, President Clinton said Friday must live consequences mistakes, although contended Democrats take pride achievements presidency take heart possibilities. Clinton stopped apologizing conduct Monica Lewinsky, taken making glancing, times humble, references it, moving attack Republican Congress indifferent Americans' needs. He Friday series fund-raisers. In one deft sentence, acknowledged personal pain claiming credit country's economic strength, making compact appeal sympathy support appearance earlier day Cleveland. After thanking gathered donors kind personal things said him, president declared, If I again, every day, I would heartbeat, see America today compared six years ago. As applause died away, Clinton continued, I want understand, too, live consequences mistakes life. He added chuckle: Most us live quite public way. But nobody gets life free. To music saxophone hammered dulcimer, Clinton raised $200,000 lunch private home Cleveland Democratic Senate candidate Ohio, Mary Boyle. Then flew Philadelphia raise half million dollars Democratic Party. By midsummer, president's aides delighted persuaded condense fund-raising remarks 10 minutes policy points partisan jabbing. But troubles grown mid-term elections approached, free-form remarks become longer. In Cleveland Friday, spoke 26 minutes Friday evening spoke almost 20 minutes. These fund-raising visits fallen pattern Clinton's videotaped grand jury testimony Aug. 17. He lauded, applauded embraced hosts donors. Mr. President, friends today, said Tony George, host Cleveland event, offering refrain played similar role. But Cleveland elsewhere, protesters scattered president's motorcade route reminders calls resignation impeachment, mockery heaping presidency. At rally president city hall Friday night group Teamsters chanted, two years. Clinton's motorcade route lined downtown hundreds people, carrying supportive condemnatory signs. After impromptu shopping trip, greeted shouts We love you, Clinton told donors beginning impassioned reprise Cleveland speech: I mind protesters, that's American way. But, added, preferred minority, seemed case. As rode Cleveland, Clinton passed billboard local radio station, WNCX. Lovin', touchin', squeezin', read, words superimposed cartoon president arm Ms. Lewinsky's shoulders, Washington Monument them. The president left aides Friday respond directly latest gusher grand jury disclosures Washington. Instead, remarks, Clinton spoke pride record urgency addressing international economic crisis needs struggling farmers schoolchildren. As typically partisan audiences, also walked political calculation mid-term elections. Clinton said Cleveland Republicans bragged privately prospects. They tell me, `Oh, we're going well, Mr. President, mid-terms much money do,' Democrats turned re-elect Clinton would return polls off-year. That argument, course, would also insulate Clinton blame depressing Democratic vote. But goes that, saying predicament could actually help Democrats. Lower-income Democratic voters, said, might bother vote typical election. The people good enough serve event today, they've got lot hassles life, said. But, said, adversity friend, overcome apathy focus us issue here. What issue, Clinton said, achievements agenda Republicans' record, described harshly. What done? asked Cleveland. They killed minimum wage increase 12 million Americans. They killed campaign finance reform. They killed tobacco reform legislation.

I think anybody vote Al D'Amato HRC endorsement, said White House aide spoke condition anonymity. But I think people Right Life Party upstate people going say, `Who guy vote him?' In election years, Reps. David Price Julia Carson would little common Democrats relatively safe seats. Price centrist represented high-tech district North Carolina 2 last 12 years, political scientist taught Duke Yale. Mrs. Carson, fairly liberal, House freshman worked way politics grass roots, reared poverty. But party officials opened election year high hopes recapturing House beginning worry Democratic incumbents Price Mrs. Carson share something else: greater-than-expected peril Election Day. As many congressional races, biggest variable White House scandal, injected fear uncertainty campaigns country. Other Democratic incumbents Republican officials cite locked contests competitive expected include Reps. Corrine Brown Florida, Vic Snyder Arkansas, Lois Capps Ellen Tauscher California, Martin Frost Texas, Melvin Watt North Carolina, John LaFalce New York Sander Levin Michigan. Here North Carolina's 4th Congressional District, Price, acknowledging polls showed tight race, said: This swing district sensitive tide trend. It's something think lot connection president's troubles. The efforts Price Mrs. Carson contain Lewinsky debacle  opponents' attempts capitalize  offer important clues suggesting Clinton's problems influencing conduct races country. Many Democrats straddling line seems shift bit every new scandal-related disclosure: want appear close president whose conduct embarrasses them, yet, sensing possibility public backlash Republicans, weighing words carefully wary hopping impeachment bandwagon. And publicly Democrats express confidence scandal little impact them, campaigns preparing worst placing greater emphasis ever behind-the-efforts prod core constituencies vote. In reflection uncertainty Clinton scandal cast Republicans, challengers Price Carson districts  political novices seeking office first time  differing strategies: Tom Roberg, computer executive Raleigh taking Price, broadcast television commercial exploiting scandal. Tom Roberg called Bill Clinton's resignation, narrator says. This time silent, Price. Where stand? But Indianapolis, Gary Hofmeister, conservative jeweler challenging Mrs. Carson Indiana's 10th Congressional District, taking subtle approach: rather mention scandal directly, notes Julia votes Clinton almost 100 percent time. Asked much raising scandal directly, Hofmeister said: Don't murder somebody they're process committing suicide. There would danger went overboard. The best evidence discomfort Price Mrs. Carson asked separate interviews whether would want Clinton campaign districts, said would impossible late date White House schedule visit. What sudden schedule change? Both paused, squirmed bit mustered answers hardly affirmative. Given president's popularity, I doubt hurt me, Mrs. Carson said. And Price? I think would good idea, said. I've never president campaign here, I want start time although eagerly welcoming Erskine Bowles, president's chief staff popular native son North Carolina, stump Sunday.) Making strategy stump complicated anecdotal evidence runs counter Democratic fears Republican hopes. In three days campaign stops North Carolina Indianapolis, scandal rarely raised voter courted candidates either party. When reporter asked it, many voters said appalled Clinton's behavior, hard time relating decision way vote congressional elections five weeks. As Hofmeister walked parking lot gun knife show Indiana National Guard Armory Indianapolis last Sunday, Billy Derringer, 57-year-old machinist retired disability, called express outrage millions dollars spent investigate Clinton. It's pathetic spend money, said Derringer, identified independent. It gotten far. Hofmeister tried best make Republicans' case. There rule law, said. Mrs. Carson said hoped Democrats swing voters alike would become fed Lewinsky inquiry issue might help her. To end, proudly informs audiences voted making public report delivered House Kenneth Starr, Whitewater independent counsel. I one 63 members Congress voted putting filth Internet, said, adding Starr's inquiry cruel hoax terms fiscal responsibility accountability. The Carson campaign counting voters Timothy Daly, 38-year-old real estate executive voted Republican two years ago favors Mrs. Carson. I'm pulling Democratic ticket I'm tired it: right side Republican Party playing politics, Daly said. We'd see go people's business. Back 4th District, Price reasons worried. He first elected House 1986 but, four-term incumbent, ousted Republican sweep 1994 (only win seat back two years later). In addition, district redrawn last year include large Durham section voters know well. Determined midterm casualty Clinton again, Price says waging vigorous get-out-the-vote ground campaign career. Rather engage Roberg Clinton scandal, Price begun broadcasting television commercial emphasizes central issue: education. The congressman's advisers say intentionally produced advertisement appears decidedly nonpolitical  features school children play  effort break television clutter scandal. But Price campaign also weapon holding reserve, event Roberg appears riding Clinton scandal advantage: incumbent's advisers say would timid running commercials underscoring earned divinity degree getting doctorate political science. At coffee voters wealthy enclave Raleigh night, Roberg opened remarks asserting Clinton lost moral authority lead. Yet none assembled asked scandal; concerned state's plans build highway neighborhood. The last time George Voinovich ran office, re-election Ohio's governor 72 percent vote, stunning optimistic supporters setting 20th-century record victory margins Ohio politics. This year, Voinovich, Republican barred seeking third term, running again, time Senate seat held John Glenn, Democrat retiring. And expect Voinovich repeat electoral benchmark four years ago, politicians parties generally acknowledge well positioned increase Republican majority Senate. That prevented Voinovich's Democratic opponent, Mary Boyle, undertaking vigorous campaign. Ms. Boyle, former commissioner Cuyahoga County, encompasses Cleveland, crisscrossing nation's seventh-most populous state describes grass-roots campaign that, operating comparative shoestring, nonetheless attracted side nationally known Democrats  President Clinton foremost  campaign trail. Glenn, former astronaut preparing return space month age 77, made endorsement Senate race. Like many candidates year, Ms. Boyle, 55, campaigning hard issue education, seeking portray Voinovich, 61, lackluster steward allowed state's schools decline. He promised education governor, said Ms. Boyle. But seven half years failed students state. Her role campaign, said, remind people state Ohio George Voinovich made promise deliver it. Specifically, discusses decision last year Ohio Supreme Court cited wide disparities quality state's schools ruled unconstitutional formula funding them. She also attacked Republican opponent supporting proposal raise state's sales tax one percent. Under plan, half additional funds would used school improvement remainder earmarked reducing property taxes. That statewide ballot initiative last May proved wildly unpopular, 80 percent voters opposing it. While topics taxes education hot ones political season Ohio, clear Ms. Boyle's emphasis helped campaign. Despite narrowing opinion polls, still trailing Voinovich 10 percentage points polls much 18 points others. There also sharp fund-raising disparity. Ms. Boyle, running first statewide race widespread union support, raised nearly $2 million far, far less nearly $7 million Voinovich taken in. Also, Voinovich, former lieutenant governor, statewide ballots five times last 20 years thus better-known candidate. The electoral dynamics Ohio also aiding Voinovich. The northern half state, history industrial, unionized cities, tradition voting largely Democratic candidates, southern tier state considered conservative typically leans Republican. But Voinovich Ms. Boyle share home terrain, depriving Ms. Boyle geographic advantage accompanies Democratic candidates. Indeed, boy, Voinovich delivered newspapers Boyle home working-class Collinwood section Cleveland. And Voinovich, former mayor Cleveland, developed reputation moderate Republican works well Democrats. Voinovich, campaigning vigorously himself, keeping full schedule official duties, assuming role experienced, elected official. If I get Senate, I probably know domestic policy member Senate, said interview Wednesday Canton, sandwiched ribbon-cutting ceremony fund-raising reception vacuum cleaner museum. As mayor, I nose rubbed problems urban America fairly successful dealing them. And, governor, I dealt problems Medicaid, welfare education. I'm person United States president National League Cities chairman National Governors Association. To opponent's charges record education, Voinovich dismissive. I'm probably Republican United States endorsed Ohio Education Association National Education Association, said, adding Ms. Boyle member state Legislature period cited Supreme Court ruling. Mary Boyle vice chairman Ways Means Committee member Democratic leadership years, Voinovich said. They nothing fix buildings, nothing technology urban school districts. Ms. Boyle, begun run campaign commercials television, said status underdog allowed focused, intense. Pausing campaign fund-raising breakfast former Democratic Sen. Bill Bradley New Jersey Wednesday, Ms. Boyle said: This marathon pretty much uphill. But now, we're last three miles. It's tough race. Sen. Alfonse D'Amato, New York Republican running re-election, went Manhattan's Grand Central Terminal morning accept award mass-transit advocates. But reporters gathered showed little interest shiny train car senator's back. Instead, repeatedly asked would vote impeachment President Clinton. Look, I'm going make comment respect subject matter, D'Amato responded. I citizen. I citizen-senator may called make decision. But D'Amato something else well: candidate may tightest Senate race nation. And variations elliptical response heard Senate races country, Republicans Democrats encountering similar questions. All suggests House voted Thursday authorize impeachment inquiry, year's 34 races U.S. Senate become, already were, electoral equivalent jury selection. If House votes impeach Clinton, matter goes Senate, must decide two-thirds majority whether convict and, thus, remove office. As result, Monica Lewinsky matter suddenly injected new disruptive force Senate contests. Voters, support Clinton, expect political leaders, Republican Democratic, renounce Clinton's behavior, candidates that. But impeachment another matter; polls show nation it. The danger Senate candidates impeachment real possibility, debate may move president's behavior  little disagreement  problematic issue whether removed office. For strategists involved races, little guidance handle impeachment issue. Advisers candidates parties said interviews last week perplexed worried, unsure issue gain advantage  guard harm. I can't tell one going go, said Mike Russell, spokesman Republican Senatorial Campaign Committee. This surreal environment. Of 34 Senate seats play, 18 held Democrats 16 Republicans, hold 55 seats all. Republicans would win 28 34 races produce 67 votes necessary conviction, assuming vote go party lines. Only electoral catastrophe Democrats, seems almost unthinkable, could produce huge loss. Jennifer Duffy, follows Senate races Cook Political Report, nonpartisan newsletter, said far, least, none Senate candidates made explicit appeal votes based would vote presidential jury. But wondering may change. This difficult ground measure. One central questions political year Clinton's dealings Ms. Lewinsky might affect turnout. For long time, politicians assumed dispirited Democrats would stay home rebuke Clinton, many Republicans November 1974, three months President Richard M. Nixon resigned. But analysts wonder partisan fight Congress last week might effect Democrats. That's problem, said Stuart Rothenberg, editor independent political newsletter Washington. It's know, politicians know, general public stands impeachment. The problem know electorate stands impeachment. And asking voters think ahead impeachment proceeding cast ballots Senate race is, words Stuart Stevens, Republican consultant, double bank-shot. Such strategies, said, tend work small number single-minded sophisticated voters. Against complicated backdrop, prevailing thinking use impeachment issue vary race race, state state week week, depending circumstances candidates composition electorate. If Democrats try turn image Clinton dock advantage, would states Democratic edge sizable numbers black voters, overwhelmingly support president. In contests those, might well prove interest Democratic candidate to, one consultant put it, sit front camera tape advertisement candidate denounces president's behavior solemnly pledges vote impeachment. Strategists parties believe kind approach could prove effective. This issue huge disconnect elites public, said Fred Yang, Democratic consultant clients Wisconsin Carolinas. That kind Democratic strategy might emerge California, New York, Illinois, Wisconsin, Washington perhaps Arkansas. By contrast, Democrats South Carolina, Georgia Nevada would less likely oppose Clinton's impeachment. On side, Republican consultants telling candidates stress Clinton's misdeeds stay away talk impeachment. The last thing party wants turn Senate elections referendum whether Clinton forced office. The White House might think overall public numbers maybe would make referendum election, said Ed Goeas, Republican pollster working Senate races year. Republicans certainly going let happen. D'Amato responded questions Clinton language Republican consultants suggesting candidates. When matter comes Senate, I decide facts presented time, D'Amato said. It would premature suggest course action referred. Because, indeed, may called act jury kind. But Schumer, member House Judiciary Committee, conducting impeachment investigation, virtually embraced issue. In live telecast hearings, said president deserved lesser punishment, censure reprimand. And Schumer plans campaign New York Monday Clinton side. Schumer's media adviser, Hank Morris, seemed suggest last week impeachment grow issue. Senator D'Amato claims want share opinion people New York, Morris said. And opinion, he's New Yorker opinion. Asked Schumer would raise issue television commercial, Morris responded: We talk we're going do. I rule I rule out. \n","\n","\n","\n","It surprising scene three month ago Dennis Rivera, one New York City's left-leaning labor leader, singing praise Sen. Alfonse M. D'Amato. Rivera, president largest union New York City, praised D'Amato persuading Trent Lott, Senate majority leader, support legislation financed health coverage hundred thousand uninsured child. It looked Rivera's politically potent union might endorse D'Amato minimum stay neutral year's US. Senate race New York. But Monday, Rivera's 150,000-member union, 1199, National Health Human Service Employees union, endorsed Rep. Charles E. Schumer, D-N.Y., thereby risked D'Amato's wrath. The endorsement risky, labor leader acknowledge, angering powerful senator could make far le responsive labor's need union turn help future re-elected. Although may seem illogical, two word go far explain Rivera's union backed Schumer: Monica Lewinsky. Largely result Lewinsky scandal, Democrats say suddenly fear Republicans gain filibuster-proof, 60-seat majority Senate, Republicans 55 seat Democrats' 45. For labor leader Rivera, notion strong Republican majority nightmare. That fear helped push New York union Schumer's column, though D'Amato long courted them. Those union include teamsters' joint council New York City District Council 37, umbrella group representing 120,000 municipal employee. Labor leader say fear filibuster-proof Republican majority, Senate would push anti-union legislation, recently defeated Republican proposal curb labor's political spending cut financing National Labor Relations Board. We worried legislation allow labor movement survive next century, Rivera said. Alarmed Democrats lose Senate seat California, Illinois, Wisconsin, Nevada South Carolina, Rivera's union concluded worth backing Schumer. The decision, Rivera emphasized repeatedly, personal based national consideration. Unfortunately, leadership Republican Party national level person Newt Gingrich Trent Lott necessarily culture Republicans Northeast, said. They're far conservative, far anti-labor, far anti-worker, far pro-business. We fear Democratic Party face irrelevance United States Senate go 41 seat. Trying avoid rupture D'Amato, Rivera praised effective senator. The endorsement could boon Schumer. Rivera's union teachers' union labor's strongest political operation New York. In addition, Schumer get thousand dollar local well use renowned phone bank, make 50,000 political call day. A spokesman D'Amato said, Al D'Amato's proud he's endorsed 100 union federation local, representing 400,000 working men woman, he'll continue effort behalf working middle class family. His labor endorsement include New York City Patrolmen's Benevolent Association New York State Building Construction Trades Council. Besides backing 1199, Schumer also received endorsement 1199's parent union, Service Employees International Union, 350,000 member New York State.

The convention packed Town Hall, new group aim make service employee power reckoned bringing together dozen union local forge common political legislative strategy. Earlier year, 1199 merged service employee, part agreement, Rivera became head service employee New York State. Nearly 60 year time, House voted Friday condemn Nazi-Soviet nonaggression pact 1939. The measure, nonbinding resolution, brought floor Rep. John Shimkus, R-Ill. He Lithuanian descent, pocket Lithuanians hometown Collinsville want try highlight support Baltic states' effort Soviet repression. Shimkus' measure example member Congress spending time stand idle wait Republican leader reach agreement spending bill White House, thus avoiding government shutdown allowing go home campaign November election. With time hand, many Republicans using House floor personal stage elicit vote topic boast folk back home. Most matter little chance finding way law, member hope turn advantage Election Day. There plenty item whose sponsor hope attract attention. These tend special-interest matter member hope escape scrutiny rush leave town. The sponsor measure added advantage impeachment inquiry, preoccupying Congress, news medium public giving cover move pet cause quietly gigantic omnibus package Congress eventually present Clinton signing. These quieter measure include one proposed Mississippi's two senator, Trent Lott Thad Cochran, Republicans. They want agriculture export credit buy chicken Russia, bought chicken cannot pay them. The chicken Mississippi. Democrats little influence Republican-controlled Congress. But Democrats close enough Republican leader, Republican goal, measure taken seriously. These include Rep. John Murtha, D-Pa., ranking Democrat national security subcommittee Appropriations Committee, pushing measure increase military pension. Perhaps best example attempt force vote political advantage measure would require minor notify parent seeking contraceptive federally funded family planning clinic. House leader allowed measure brought floor way appease conservative member, believe shortchanged budget process. It passed House vote 224-200 almost chance becoming law. The Senate plan take up, Clinton would almost certainly veto it. But Rep. Tom Coburn, R-Okla., said vote important put sponsors' ideological foe record opposing something sound reasonable, opposition used Nov. 3 election. It voice mail message Dr. Marilyn Rymer, neurologist Kansas City, Mo., would routinely delete, registered Democrat. Speaker Newt Gingrich's office, said, calling discus national leadership award. Dr. Rymer acclaim director prominent stroke-treatment center, proposition seemed particularly grand. When returned call, said told would also named honorary chairman elite committee advise Gingrich legislation. Too good true? Well, Dr. Rymer would pay way committee actually meet, honorary committee chairman, discovered, would member committee composed entirely honorary chairman. And oh, speaker wanted donation $500 $1,000 help effort, according transcript similar chat another doctor, elect bigger Republican majority House Representatives. With approach midterm election next month, turn National Republican Congressional Committee, support candidate House, sponsoring similar call ten thousand small-business owner, including doctor. With fund-raising program, committee say amassed $62 million election. But campaign finance watchdog say solicitation mark new departure political fund raising, one call akin practice marketing company Publishers' Clearing House hook consumer vision million-dollar windfall induce subscribe magazine. By citing speaker promising celebrity influence, say, call bait-and-switch scheme seize attention people might otherwise hang up. Dr. Rymer say incensed. So Dr. Stanley Turecki, child family psychiatrist New York vote independent also called. I absolutely outraged, said. Anybody else would would fall category consumer fraud. Kenneth Gross, Washington lawyer specializes election law represents Democratic Republican client, said, I never heard particular device. But appear illegal, said, adding, It's fund-raising gimmick get attention. Fred Wertheimer, president Democracy 21, nonprofit, nonpartisan advocate campaign finance reform, said, This new version caveat emptor buyer damned instead buyer beware. When business it, added, Congress order investigation. But going investigated member Congress it. Todd Harris, spokesman National Republican Congressional Committee, said heard complaint intent deceive. The national leadership award part call donor member fulfillment, Harris said. It's part bringing process. It's important recognized support give party. There's quid pro quo people solicited could receive award contribution, added. What peeve Drs. Rymer Turecki message left secretary answering machine invoking Gingrich's office proposing award. They say envisioned senior aide telephone speaker's chamber Capitol Dome. The call, however, placed aide Gingrich, office anyone Washington. They made people headset computer home InfoCision Management Corp., telemarketing firm Congressional committee client Akron, Ohio. On Web page, InfoCision say 1,400 employee operate 1,584 telephone line 9 phone center. Every word script approved client, company say Web site. Every conceivable objection scripted powerful rebuttal. Besides telemarketing business, said Jamie Blair, supervisor center, specialize helping Republican Party conservative political group. However far Gingrich, telemarketers instructed answer return call with: Republican Congressional Committee, Newt Gingrich's office. May I help you? A doctor Kansas City, Mo., registered Republican declined named, dialed Gingrich number (888-484-1644) left answering machine secretly recorded ensuing discussion, legal Missouri. We asked contact behalf speaker, say woman picked call identified Nancy. He right aggressively pushing legislation cut tax much half, he's also interested legislation cut capital gain single rate 15 percent. To assure passage legislation, speaker want increase Republican majority, say, adding, To help u that, speaker pulling together group individual inviting honorary chairman advisory council. Nancy continues: There correspondence speaker, conference call. It's great way get input thought legislation concern you. Or maybe survey questionnaire. Later, Nancy says: As member committee, would receiving speaker national leadership award, really quite honor. And honest, asking chairman could help effort increase majority one-time contribution $500 $1,000. Now would used nationwide medium campaign Newt undertaken target seat really need. And someone I'm sure would also benefit this, could I tell speaker could count help? The doctor demur. I registered, know, Republican Kansas, tell Nancy. Probably I something would go representative. Then doctor try ascertain Nancy located. Is congressman Gingrich's office I'm talking to? doctor asks. The speaker's office, say Nancy. This speaker's office. That I'm talking to, say doctor, double-checking. Uh-huh, Nancy reply. The law prohibits political fund-raising call federal office. Vice President Al Gore Justice Department investigation fund-raising call allegedly made office 1996 presidential campaign. But call made anywhere else, including campaign office. Harris said call way related speaker's OFFICIAL office. He added: What important call get routed. People interested award speaker's good name whether call get routed Washington Ohio. Turecki disagrees. I see basic sleaze, said. The last time George Voinovich ran office, re-election Ohio's governor 72 percent vote, stunning optimistic supporter setting 20th-century record victory margin Ohio politics. This year, Voinovich, Republican barred seeking third term, running again, time Senate seat held John Glenn, Democrat retiring. And expect Voinovich repeat electoral benchmark four year ago, politician party generally acknowledge well positioned increase Republican majority Senate. That prevented Voinovich's Democratic opponent, Mary Boyle, undertaking vigorous campaign. Ms. Boyle, former commissioner Cuyahoga County, encompasses Cleveland, crisscrossing nation's seventh-most populous state describes grass-roots campaign that, operating comparative shoestring, nonetheless attracted side nationally known Democrats President Clinton foremost campaign trail. Glenn, former astronaut preparing return space month age 77, made endorsement Senate race. Like many candidate year, Ms. Boyle, 55, campaigning hard issue education, seeking portray Voinovich, 61, lackluster steward allowed state's school decline. He promised education governor, said Ms. Boyle. But seven half year failed student state. Her role campaign, said, remind people state Ohio George Voinovich made promise deliver it. Specifically, discus decision last year Ohio Supreme Court cited wide disparity quality state's school ruled unconstitutional formula funding them. She also attacked Republican opponent supporting proposal raise state's sale tax one percent. Under plan, half additional fund would used school improvement remainder earmarked reducing property tax. That statewide ballot initiative last May proved wildly unpopular, 80 percent voter opposing it. While topic tax education hot one political season Ohio, clear Ms. Boyle's emphasis helped campaign. Despite narrowing opinion poll, still trailing Voinovich 15 percentage point poll much 20 point others. There also sharp fund-raising disparity. Ms. Boyle, running first statewide race widespread union support, raised nearly $2 million far, far le nearly $7 million Voinovich taken in. Also, Voinovich, former lieutenant governor, statewide ballot five time last 20 year thus better-known candidate. The electoral dynamic Ohio also aiding Voinovich. The northern half state, history industrial, unionized city, tradition voting largely Democratic candidate, southern tier state considered conservative typically lean Republican. But Voinovich Ms. Boyle share home terrain, depriving Ms. Boyle geographic advantage accompanies Democratic candidate. Indeed, boy, Voinovich delivered newspaper Boyle home working-class Collinwood section Cleveland. And Voinovich, former mayor Cleveland, developed reputation moderate Republican work well Democrats. Voinovich, campaigning vigorously himself, keeping full schedule official duty, assuming role experienced, elected official. If I get Senate, I probably know domestic policy member Senate, said interview Wednesday Canton, sandwiched ribbon-cutting ceremony fund-raising reception vacuum cleaner museum. As mayor, I nose rubbed problem urban America fairly successful dealing them. And, governor, I dealt problem Medicaid, welfare education. I'm person United States president National League Cities chairman National Governors Association. To opponent's charge record education, Voinovich dismissive. I'm probably Republican United States endorsed Ohio Education Association National Education Association, said, adding Ms. Boyle member state Legislature period cited Supreme Court ruling. Mary Boyle vice chairman Ways Means Committee member Democratic leadership year, Voinovich said. They nothing fix building, nothing technology urban school district. Ms. Boyle, begun run campaign commercial television, said status underdog allowed focused, intense. Pausing campaign fund-raising breakfast former Democratic Sen. Bill Bradley New Jersey Wednesday, Ms. Boyle said: This marathon pretty much uphill. But now, we're last three mile. It's tough race. In cocoon loyal wealthy supporter, President Clinton said Friday must live consequence mistake, although contended Democrats take pride achievement presidency take heart possibility. Clinton stopped apologizing conduct Monica Lewinsky, taken making glancing, time humble, reference it, moving attack Republican Congress indifferent Americans' need. He Friday series fund-raisers. In one deft sentence, acknowledged personal pain claiming credit country's economic strength, making compact appeal sympathy support appearance earlier day Cleveland. After thanking gathered donor kind personal thing said him, president declared, If I again, every day, I would heartbeat, see America today compared six year ago. As applause died away, Clinton continued, I want understand, too, live consequence mistake life. He added chuckle: Most u live quite public way. But nobody get life free. To music saxophone hammered dulcimer, Clinton raised $200,000 lunch private home Cleveland Democratic Senate candidate Ohio, Mary Boyle. Then flew Philadelphia raise half million dollar Democratic Party. By midsummer, president's aide delighted persuaded condense fund-raising remark 10 minute policy point partisan jabbing. But trouble grown mid-term election approached, free-form remark become longer. In Cleveland Friday, spoke 26 minute Friday evening spoke almost 20 minute. These fund-raising visit fallen pattern Clinton's videotaped grand jury testimony Aug. 17. He lauded, applauded embraced host donor. Mr. President, friend today, said Tony George, host Cleveland event, offering refrain played similar role. But Cleveland elsewhere, protester scattered president's motorcade route reminder call resignation impeachment, mockery heaping presidency. At rally president city hall Friday night group Teamsters chanted, two year. Clinton's motorcade route lined downtown hundred people, carrying supportive condemnatory sign. After impromptu shopping trip, greeted shout We love you, Clinton told donor beginning impassioned reprise Cleveland speech: I mind protester, that's American way. But, added, preferred minority, seemed case. As rode Cleveland, Clinton passed billboard local radio station, WNCX. Lovin', touchin', squeezin', read, word superimposed cartoon president arm Ms. Lewinsky's shoulder, Washington Monument them. The president left aide Friday respond directly latest gusher grand jury disclosure Washington. Instead, remark, Clinton spoke pride record urgency addressing international economic crisis need struggling farmer schoolchildren. As typically partisan audience, also walked political calculation mid-term election. Clinton said Cleveland Republicans bragged privately prospect. They tell me, `Oh, we're going well, Mr. President, mid-terms much money do,' Democrats turned re-elect Clinton would return poll off-year. That argument, course, would also insulate Clinton blame depressing Democratic vote. But go that, saying predicament could actually help Democrats. Lower-income Democratic voter, said, might bother vote typical election. The people good enough serve event today, they've got lot hassle life, said. But, said, adversity friend, overcome apathy focus u issue here. What issue, Clinton said, achievement agenda Republicans' record, described harshly. What done? asked Cleveland. They killed minimum wage increase 12 million Americans. They killed campaign finance reform. They killed tobacco reform legislation. White House official gay Democrats, concerned nation's largest gay lesbian political organization endorse Sen. Alfonse D'Amato re-election, intensely lobbying group try shift support Democratic challenger, Rep. Charles Schumer. Publicly, official organization, Human Rights Campaign, said still deliberating position closely watched race, considered tightest nation. They said would probably make endorsement Friday. But privately, organization official gay activist party monitoring debate say group likely endorse D'Amato, Republican seeking fourth term. They also raised possibility group would endorse candidate, remain neutral. If group endorses D'Amato, said official spoke condition anonymity, endorsement would based three major factors: The group tends favor incumbent, searching ally Senate Republican majority considers D'Amato's recent record gay issue quite strong. An endorsement group, held high regard many gay lesbian voter, could prove important swinging voter D'Amato tight race. It would also major symbolic victory senator, sought recast centrist recent year could use endorsement build standing moderate swing voter. A D'Amato endorsement would also weaken Schumer's effort portray incumbent right-wing extremist would signify many voter fraying traditional Democratic coalition included black gay voter, woman labor union. The intensity debate surrounding endorsement underscore importance New York Senate race Democrats nation, see defeating D'Amato one best opportunity prevent Republicans gaining 60 seat Senate enough stop Democratic filibuster. The Republicans currently hold 55-to-45 majority. There sentiment community Republicans get 60 vote, Trent Lott basically charge politically next two year, said David Mixner, close friend President Clinton's gay. He referring Senate majority leader, called homosexuality sin likened kleptomania. Saturday, Schumer picked endorsement New York's largest gay lesbian political organization, Empire State Pride Agenda. Although Human Rights Campaign bipartisan, close Clinton administration, many Democrats board receives much money Democratic contributor. Largely group's strong Democratic tie, gay Democrats, New York liberal White House official infuriated endorsing D'Amato, also run Right Life Conservative Party line receives high rating Christian Coalition, typically opposes legislation civil right gay people. Although organization thought inching D'Amato endorsement month, lobbying campaign Schumer picked intensity last two week, driven partly growing sense race closer ever. Democrats advocate party support right gay people said Vice President Al Gore, Hillary Rodham Clinton Secretary Health Human Services Donna Shalala made personal appeal Human Rights Campaign official urging endorse D'Amato. White House official said know whether three made appeal, Human Rights Campaign official declined comment. Schumer met privately group's top official last week make one last pitch endorsement. Clinton administration official also buttonholing group's board member every opportunity, cocktail party fund-raisers, raising concern D'Amato endorsement. Some New York advocate civil right gay people flooded organization phone call, e-mail message letter. Democratic official encouraging group's major donor express opposition D'Amato. People involved lobbying effort said best, hoping group endorse candidate, make endorsement all. Chuck Schumer strong supporter issue important gay community, said senior White House official spoke condition anonymity. The last thing want hurt candidacy someone supportive agenda. The Human Rights Campaign considered influential gay lesbian organization Washington, national membership 250,000 annual budget $13 million. The group created early 1980s large part counter rise Christian right Ronald Reagan. Paradoxically, D'Amato first elected Reagan landslide 1980 remained strong supporter President Reagan. For D'Amato, aggressively courted gay voter, endorsement would represent crowning achievement effort reposition moderate. Since 1993, senator backed right gay citizen serve military, sponsored legislation prevent job discrimination gay worker opposed leadership's attempt block nomination two openly gay men position Clinton administration. To gay supporter D'Amato, endorsement Human Rights Campaign would signify political maturation gay electorate help organization insulate accusation close Democratic Party. Those support D'Amato endorsement, including top official Human Rights Campaign, contend current political climate, Congress almost certain remain Republican control November, gay people must build alliance moderate Republicans. Human Rights Campaign official also say standing policy support friendly incumbent, challenger better voting record gay issue. That case New York, Schumer's rating Human Rights Campaign consistently better D'Amato's. Both men, however, angered advocate right gay people voting legislation allows state recognize gay marriage. In precedent widely cited D'Amato supporter, organization endorsed Sen. John F. Kerry, Democrat, Republican challenger, William Weld, 1996 Massachusetts Senate race, though Weld's record gay right considered stronger. The move angered gay Republicans, contend snubbing D'Amato would prove group biased Democrats. But clearly large number Human Rights Campaign contributor board member strongly feel endorsing D'Amato permanently damage group, particularly woman. They fear abortion right supporter quit group drove D'Amato never wavered opposition abortion 18 year Congress. Many New York gay activist would also deeply upset group endorses D'Amato, blame installing state Senate majority leader, Joseph Bruno, consider strongly anti-gay. Matt Foreman, executive director Empire State Pride Agenda, cited D'Amato's role architect state Republican Party major reason group endorsed Schumer. While criticized fellow Republicans Washington intolerance, home, party's blatant discrimination still order day, Foreman said. For reason, White House official say think Human Rights Campaign endorsement D'Amato almost meaningless gay voter. They contend might hurt senator conservative base. I think anybody vote Al D'Amato HRC endorsement, said White House aide spoke condition anonymity. But I think people Right Life Party upstate people going say, `Who guy vote him?'

I think anybody vote Al D'Amato HRC endorsement, said White House aide spoke condition anonymity. But I think people Right Life Party upstate people going say, `Who guy vote him?' In election year, Reps. David Price Julia Carson would little common Democrats relatively safe seat. Price centrist represented high-tech district North Carolina 2 last 12 year, political scientist taught Duke Yale. Mrs. Carson, fairly liberal, House freshman worked way politics grass root, reared poverty. But party official opened election year high hope recapturing House beginning worry Democratic incumbent Price Mrs. Carson share something else: greater-than-expected peril Election Day. As many congressional race, biggest variable White House scandal, injected fear uncertainty campaign country. Other Democratic incumbent Republican official cite locked contest competitive expected include Reps. Corrine Brown Florida, Vic Snyder Arkansas, Lois Capps Ellen Tauscher California, Martin Frost Texas, Melvin Watt North Carolina, John LaFalce New York Sander Levin Michigan. Here North Carolina's 4th Congressional District, Price, acknowledging poll showed tight race, said: This swing district sensitive tide trend. It's something think lot connection president's trouble. The effort Price Mrs. Carson contain Lewinsky debacle opponents' attempt capitalize offer important clue suggesting Clinton's problem influencing conduct race country. Many Democrats straddling line seems shift bit every new scandal-related disclosure: want appear close president whose conduct embarrasses them, yet, sensing possibility public backlash Republicans, weighing word carefully wary hopping impeachment bandwagon. And publicly Democrats express confidence scandal little impact them, campaign preparing worst placing greater emphasis ever behind-the-efforts prod core constituency vote. In reflection uncertainty Clinton scandal cast Republicans, challenger Price Carson district political novice seeking office first time differing strategies: Tom Roberg, computer executive Raleigh taking Price, broadcast television commercial exploiting scandal. Tom Roberg called Bill Clinton's resignation, narrator say. This time silent, Price. Where stand? But Indianapolis, Gary Hofmeister, conservative jeweler challenging Mrs. Carson Indiana's 10th Congressional District, taking subtle approach: rather mention scandal directly, note Julia vote Clinton almost 100 percent time. Asked much raising scandal directly, Hofmeister said: Don't murder somebody they're process committing suicide. There would danger went overboard. The best evidence discomfort Price Mrs. Carson asked separate interview whether would want Clinton campaign district, said would impossible late date White House schedule visit. What sudden schedule change? Both paused, squirmed bit mustered answer hardly affirmative. Given president's popularity, I doubt hurt me, Mrs. Carson said. And Price? I think would good idea, said. I've never president campaign here, I want start time although eagerly welcoming Erskine Bowles, president's chief staff popular native son North Carolina, stump Sunday.) Making strategy stump complicated anecdotal evidence run counter Democratic fear Republican hope. In three day campaign stop North Carolina Indianapolis, scandal rarely raised voter courted candidate either party. When reporter asked it, many voter said appalled Clinton's behavior, hard time relating decision way vote congressional election five week. As Hofmeister walked parking lot gun knife show Indiana National Guard Armory Indianapolis last Sunday, Billy Derringer, 57-year-old machinist retired disability, called express outrage million dollar spent investigate Clinton. It's pathetic spend money, said Derringer, identified independent. It gotten far. Hofmeister tried best make Republicans' case. There rule law, said. Mrs. Carson said hoped Democrats swing voter alike would become fed Lewinsky inquiry issue might help her. To end, proudly informs audience voted making public report delivered House Kenneth Starr, Whitewater independent counsel. I one 63 member Congress voted putting filth Internet, said, adding Starr's inquiry cruel hoax term fiscal responsibility accountability. The Carson campaign counting voter Timothy Daly, 38-year-old real estate executive voted Republican two year ago favor Mrs. Carson. I'm pulling Democratic ticket I'm tired it: right side Republican Party playing politics, Daly said. We'd see go people's business. Back 4th District, Price reason worried. He first elected House 1986 but, four-term incumbent, ousted Republican sweep 1994 (only win seat back two year later). In addition, district redrawn last year include large Durham section voter know well. Determined midterm casualty Clinton again, Price say waging vigorous get-out-the-vote ground campaign career. Rather engage Roberg Clinton scandal, Price begun broadcasting television commercial emphasizes central issue: education. The congressman's adviser say intentionally produced advertisement appears decidedly nonpolitical feature school child play effort break television clutter scandal. But Price campaign also weapon holding reserve, event Roberg appears riding Clinton scandal advantage: incumbent's adviser say would timid running commercial underscoring earned divinity degree getting doctorate political science. At coffee voter wealthy enclave Raleigh night, Roberg opened remark asserting Clinton lost moral authority lead. Yet none assembled asked scandal; concerned state's plan build highway neighborhood. The last time George Voinovich ran office, re-election Ohio's governor 72 percent vote, stunning optimistic supporter setting 20th-century record victory margin Ohio politics. This year, Voinovich, Republican barred seeking third term, running again, time Senate seat held John Glenn, Democrat retiring. And expect Voinovich repeat electoral benchmark four year ago, politician party generally acknowledge well positioned increase Republican majority Senate. That prevented Voinovich's Democratic opponent, Mary Boyle, undertaking vigorous campaign. Ms. Boyle, former commissioner Cuyahoga County, encompasses Cleveland, crisscrossing nation's seventh-most populous state describes grass-roots campaign that, operating comparative shoestring, nonetheless attracted side nationally known Democrats President Clinton foremost campaign trail. Glenn, former astronaut preparing return space month age 77, made endorsement Senate race. Like many candidate year, Ms. Boyle, 55, campaigning hard issue education, seeking portray Voinovich, 61, lackluster steward allowed state's school decline. He promised education governor, said Ms. Boyle. But seven half year failed student state. Her role campaign, said, remind people state Ohio George Voinovich made promise deliver it. Specifically, discus decision last year Ohio Supreme Court cited wide disparity quality state's school ruled unconstitutional formula funding them. She also attacked Republican opponent supporting proposal raise state's sale tax one percent. Under plan, half additional fund would used school improvement remainder earmarked reducing property tax. That statewide ballot initiative last May proved wildly unpopular, 80 percent voter opposing it. While topic tax education hot one political season Ohio, clear Ms. Boyle's emphasis helped campaign. Despite narrowing opinion poll, still trailing Voinovich 10 percentage point poll much 18 point others. There also sharp fund-raising disparity. Ms. Boyle, running first statewide race widespread union support, raised nearly $2 million far, far le nearly $7 million Voinovich taken in. Also, Voinovich, former lieutenant governor, statewide ballot five time last 20 year thus better-known candidate. The electoral dynamic Ohio also aiding Voinovich. The northern half state, history industrial, unionized city, tradition voting largely Democratic candidate, southern tier state considered conservative typically lean Republican. But Voinovich Ms. Boyle share home terrain, depriving Ms. Boyle geographic advantage accompanies Democratic candidate. Indeed, boy, Voinovich delivered newspaper Boyle home working-class Collinwood section Cleveland. And Voinovich, former mayor Cleveland, developed reputation moderate Republican work well Democrats. Voinovich, campaigning vigorously himself, keeping full schedule official duty, assuming role experienced, elected official. If I get Senate, I probably know domestic policy member Senate, said interview Wednesday Canton, sandwiched ribbon-cutting ceremony fund-raising reception vacuum cleaner museum. As mayor, I nose rubbed problem urban America fairly successful dealing them. And, governor, I dealt problem Medicaid, welfare education. I'm person United States president National League Cities chairman National Governors Association. To opponent's charge record education, Voinovich dismissive. I'm probably Republican United States endorsed Ohio Education Association National Education Association, said, adding Ms. Boyle member state Legislature period cited Supreme Court ruling. Mary Boyle vice chairman Ways Means Committee member Democratic leadership year, Voinovich said. They nothing fix building, nothing technology urban school district. Ms. Boyle, begun run campaign commercial television, said status underdog allowed focused, intense. Pausing campaign fund-raising breakfast former Democratic Sen. Bill Bradley New Jersey Wednesday, Ms. Boyle said: This marathon pretty much uphill. But now, we're last three mile. It's tough race. Sen. Alfonse D'Amato, New York Republican running re-election, went Manhattan's Grand Central Terminal morning accept award mass-transit advocate. But reporter gathered showed little interest shiny train car senator's back. Instead, repeatedly asked would vote impeachment President Clinton. Look, I'm going make comment respect subject matter, D'Amato responded. I citizen. I citizen-senator may called make decision. But D'Amato something else well: candidate may tightest Senate race nation. And variation elliptical response heard Senate race country, Republicans Democrats encountering similar question. All suggests House voted Thursday authorize impeachment inquiry, year's 34 race US. Senate become, already were, electoral equivalent jury selection. If House vote impeach Clinton, matter go Senate, must decide two-thirds majority whether convict and, thus, remove office. As result, Monica Lewinsky matter suddenly injected new disruptive force Senate contest. Voters, support Clinton, expect political leader, Republican Democratic, renounce Clinton's behavior, candidate that. But impeachment another matter; poll show nation it. The danger Senate candidate impeachment real possibility, debate may move president's behavior little disagreement problematic issue whether removed office. For strategist involved race, little guidance handle impeachment issue. Advisers candidate party said interview last week perplexed worried, unsure issue gain advantage guard harm. I can't tell one going go, said Mike Russell, spokesman Republican Senatorial Campaign Committee. This surreal environment. Of 34 Senate seat play, 18 held Democrats 16 Republicans, hold 55 seat all. Republicans would win 28 34 race produce 67 vote necessary conviction, assuming vote go party line. Only electoral catastrophe Democrats, seems almost unthinkable, could produce huge loss. Jennifer Duffy, follows Senate race Cook Political Report, nonpartisan newsletter, said far, least, none Senate candidate made explicit appeal vote based would vote presidential jury. But wondering may change. This difficult ground measure. One central question political year Clinton's dealing Ms. Lewinsky might affect turnout. For long time, politician assumed dispirited Democrats would stay home rebuke Clinton, many Republicans November 1974, three month President Richard M. Nixon resigned. But analyst wonder partisan fight Congress last week might effect Democrats. That's problem, said Stuart Rothenberg, editor independent political newsletter Washington. It's know, politician know, general public stand impeachment. The problem know electorate stand impeachment. And asking voter think ahead impeachment proceeding cast ballot Senate race is, word Stuart Stevens, Republican consultant, double bank-shot. Such strategy, said, tend work small number single-minded sophisticated voter. Against complicated backdrop, prevailing thinking use impeachment issue vary race race, state state week week, depending circumstance candidate composition electorate. If Democrats try turn image Clinton dock advantage, would state Democratic edge sizable number black voter, overwhelmingly support president. In contest those, might well prove interest Democratic candidate to, one consultant put it, sit front camera tape advertisement candidate denounces president's behavior solemnly pledge vote impeachment. Strategists party believe kind approach could prove effective. This issue huge disconnect elite public, said Fred Yang, Democratic consultant client Wisconsin Carolinas. That kind Democratic strategy might emerge California, New York, Illinois, Wisconsin, Washington perhaps Arkansas. By contrast, Democrats South Carolina, Georgia Nevada would le likely oppose Clinton's impeachment. On side, Republican consultant telling candidate stress Clinton's misdeed stay away talk impeachment. The last thing party want turn Senate election referendum whether Clinton forced office.

Despite objections tribunal, Yugoslav authorities allowed two-day discussions  organized Belgrade-based, non-governmental Humanitarian Law Center  take place problems. State-run media largely ignored event. Though disagreements, participants discussions generally agreed crimes humanity cannot go unpunished. The indicted The Hague at-large refusal Croatian Yugoslav authorities arrest extradite them, said Mark Ellis, lawyer representative American Bar Association. Present-day Yugoslavia, consisting Serbia Montenegro, cooperates tribunal cases Serbs victims Bosnia Croatia, two former republics fought wars secession. But Yugoslavia questioned tribunal's jurisdiction refuses indict three army officers wanted alleged war crimes Croatia. Last week, also refused allow U.N. investigators probe alleged atrocities Serbia's southern Kosovo province ethnic Albanian separatists fighting government forces. The tribunal founded satanize Serbs, said Miodrag Mitic, former legal adviser Yugoslavia's foreign ministry. He said U.N. court influenced powerful countries dominate international body. On Saturday, David Scheffer, U.S. State Department's ambassador at-large war crimes, demanded Yugoslavia's full cooperation. Some closest combat half year Kosovo conflict, point fighting room room floor floor, occurred village six weeks ago, days 21 women, children elderly members Delijaj clan massacred Serbian forces, mutilated bodies left strewn forest floor. Piecing together happened, surviving family members, ethnic Albanian separatist forces official Serbian information, story emerges fierce guerrilla resistance onslaught Serbian tanks, artillery infantry. The Serbian forces fighting appear suffered unusually heavy losses and, guerrillas finally fled, took revenge civilians, shooting women children close range tried run away pursuers. According relatives found bodies, Pajazit Delijaj, 65, decapitated, brain left display ground. Hava Delijaj, 65, shot one feet cut knife hung thread skin.

I could feel dirt hitting impact bullets, said interview, nose still bloodied said heavy fall flight. First machine guns, grenades, cannon, said. Every time I moved heard leaves rustling, shot. The massacre Delijajs, whose forebears settled Drenica Valley 150 years ago, first conflict ravaged Serbian province March October lulled uneasy truce. Indeed, conflict Serbian forces bent keeping Kosovo Serbia guerrillas fighting independence heavily ethnic Albanian population first drew international attention massacre Jasari clan early March Serbian units Prekaz, central Kosovo. But killing Delijajs, ranging paralyzed patriarch, Fazli, 94, burned bed, slaughter Valmir, 18 months, found shot, thoroughly documented far.

Maloku said knew report made rebel headquarters least 47 Serbian soldiers police officers killed fighting Bajince, three miles east. We took weapons 47 Serbs, said. The state-controlled Serbian media center Kosovo's capital, Pristina, said 10 Serbian police officers killed fighting, including five reservists died vehicle hit antitank mine Sept. 25.

From 1991 1995, wars Croatia Bosnia, Serbs, Croats and, far lesser extent, main victims, Muslims, avenged World War II massacres new blood feuds, driven killing leaders exploited old conflicts carve new fiefs old, Communist Yugoslavia collapsed. In case, appears, Serbian vengeance visited Delijajs. Survivors clan said feared assault collection mud brick homes lining rocky dirt track directly village Likovac, Serbs' base mile away. The Serbs pushed rebels Likovac August guerrillas established new headquarters Bajince, six miles east Obrinje. As Serbs swept nearby Cicavica Mountains, road runs Pristina Klina, clear Obrinje would target. Most women children area moved Apple Valley, 10,000 refugees gathered outdoors, seeking safety numbers.

Together, two men went find happened ravine. There found bodies. First, Ali, 65, who, Imer Delijaj said, cut neck tobacco cutting knife. Then Pajazit, decapitated makeshift tent, brain placed two foam mattresses. Then Hava, 65, sprawled tent. They moved find Jeton, Imer's 10-year-old son, Imer's mother, Hamide, 60, far away. Imer's sister-in-law, Luljeta, seven months pregnant, mutilated, said. A little ravine, Imer said saw wife, Lumnije, 30.

One uncle, Sharif, ravine, still missing, presumed dead. Human Rights Watch, documenting Delijaj massacre, described vicious pattern attacks civilians Serbs Kosovo conflict. (To lesser extent, Albanian guerrillas also attacked Serbian civilians, forcing homes, allegedly carried least two massacres.) The evidence strongly indicates Gornje Obrinje killings followed conscious mutilations carried victims killed, coming report Human Rights Watch says. Delijaj family members told Human Rights Watch monitors saw ethnic Albanian police officer accompanying Serbian police officers fighting. They believe police officer, posted nearby Glogovac police station, used Serbian special police officers guide Obrinje area. This police officer, apparently one small group ethnic Albanians officers remained loyal Serbs, could important witness criminal investigators war-crimes tribunal The Hague, according human rights experts.

Slobodan Milosevic, Yugoslav president, issued handful visas investigators tribunal. Two investigators Kosovo time massacre left six days later visiting site contacting Krasniqi killings. Would Imer Delijaj seek revenge? As sat floor living room group male visitors, replied: It's easy answer. If I see eye eye men I fight them. But men uniform fair fight.

We must respect voters. If win confidence vote, go ahead, otherwise pass baton, Prodi told news conference closing two-day French-Italian summit Florence. Prodi's center-left government, Italy's second-longest World War II, threatened collapse defection Communist ally. The premier address Parliament Wednesday, followed perhaps Friday vote confidence determine whether 2 1/2-year-old, center-left alliance stands falls. The Communist Refoundation Party provoked crisis withdrawing support weekend saying would vote deficit-cutting 1999 budget. But break Prodi's government divided Refoundation. Armando Cossutta, leader moderate wing, resigned party president Monday, saying party's hardline stance wrong dangerous. Prodi hoping profit break. Politicians said Prodi four votes short 316 votes needed majority Chamber Deputies, lower house. The government majority Senate Refoundation's support. After meetings French leaders, Prodi warned political difficulties threaten progress country making cleaning public finances. Prodi's government held together long large part widely shared desire see Italy qualify 1999 debut Europe's common currency, euro. It qualified earlier year  leaving disparate allies clear reason stay together. As is, Prodi outlasted Bettino Craxi, served 3{ years two back-to-back stints 1983 1987. Prodi's Italy's 55th government World War II. Three days collapse Premier Romano Prodi's center-left government, Italy's president began calling political leaders Monday try reach consensus new government. Following talks, expected last several days, President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro could ask Prodi try new majority. He could also name new premier, appoint government technocrats. If Scalfaro feels candidate capable mustering majority, could call early elections. Because president cannot dissolve Parliament last six weeks term, elections would scheduled December. Scalfaro named Prodi caretaker premier interim. Prodi's far-left ally, Communist Refoundation, provoked crisis withdrew support government 1999 deficit-cutting budget, said enough stimulate job creation. Despite help breakaway faction Communists, Sunday formed new party, Prodi lost Friday's vote confidence single vote. Prodi said take job back unless new government could stick policies old one, unlikely scenario given divided Parliament. An alternative Prodi could Massimo D'Alema, leader Democrats Left, largest party Prodi's coalition. In case so-called technical government, names Treasury Minister Carlo Azeglio Ciampi Foreign Minister Lamberto Dini circulated. A government technicians would get Italy volatile period approving 1999 budget launch common European currency, euro, January 1999. Prodi presided cost cuts got Italy debut European Monetary Union, outlasting one post-World War II Italian government process. By one vote, Premier Romano Prodi's center-left coalition lost confidence vote Chamber Deputies Friday, went presidential palace resign. President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro must decide whether call early elections ask Prodi someone else try forge new majority. The vote lower chamber Parliament 313 confidence motion brought government 312 favor. I'm bitter, Prodi said immediately government went down. The swing vote came Prodi's coalition, defecting deputy Foreign Minister Lamberto Dini's tiny Italian Renewal party. The Communist, 6th graf prv By one vote, defector ranks, Premier Romano Prodi's center-left coalition, Italy's second-longest serving government World War II, lost confidence vote Friday Chamber Deputies. Prodi immediately offered resignation President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro, asked stay caretaker premier head state decides whether call early elections ask someone else premier. The vote, 3rd graf prv Italy's Communists Sunday voted withdraw support Premier Romano Prodi's 2 1-2-year-old coalition, move expected trigger collapse one country's longest-lived postwar governments. Prodi said would call confidence vote Communists yanked support. The coalition majority Communists Senate, depended passage key legislation Chamber. MORE Italian politics long enlivened baroque feuds shifting alliances. And time-honored tradition may embattled government Prime Minister Romano Prodi momentary reprieve. A leader Italy's hard-line Marxist faction, known Communist Refounding Party, resigned Monday protest party's decision reject government's 1999 budget imperil Prodi's slender majority Parliament. Prodi must realize majority longer exists, said Armando Cossuta, chairman Communist Refounding Party, fringe group broke mainstream Communists overhauled party collapse Soviet Union 1991. Nevertheless everything possible, last minute, government avoid crisis. Cossuta clearly unwilling join hard-line wing party withdrawing support Prodi risk branded torpedoed first leftist Italian government 50 years. But leader Communist Refounding Party Parliament, Fausto Bertinotti, seems compunctions. On Friday, told journalists worried forcing new elections could return right power. Sometimes take one step back order take two steps forward, said shrug. Until now, however, communist rank file disagreed view. When Bertinotti forced Prodi offer resignation last year proposed budget cuts, rank file protested, forced backpedal. Prodi met Monday President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro coalition leaders devise strategy. He expected go Parliament Wednesday open debate crisis seek enough votes budget. Without it, Italian central bank unlikely cut key lending rates, something Italy must get line Germany bigger European neighbors introduction Jan. 1 single European currency, euro. But gathers enough votes pass budget, Prodi could still left majority. After two half years office, government second-longest postwar era. But fragile center-left coalition held together mostly Italians united last two years effort reduce spending, inflation government borrowing meet requirements membership euro plan. Once goal achieved last spring, dissension quickly revived. Prodi's backers hoping enough members Communist Refounding Party break ranks follow Cossutta coalition. If not, Prodi faced two unappetizing choices. He resign seek new elections, carry risk bringing opposition power. Or could seek form new majority Communists seeking alliance small center-right party Francesco Cossiga. Cossiga's party came Prodi's rescue June, hard-line leftists refused back Prodi NATO expansion. But Prodi repeatedly said govern center-left majority elected 1996. Cossiga also suggested reporters Monday would welcome invitations join coalition led Prodi. We want majority get stained Monica Lewinsky's dress, said. By one vote, center-left prime minister Italy, Romano Prodi, lost confidence vote Parliament Friday toppled power. The collapse government two half years, second-longest tenure World War II, suggested chronic political instability marked Italy decades sprung back life. Though obliged tender resignation, Prodi remain charge caretaker prime minister new government formed. He may get second chance form new majority, does, negotiations end could take days weeks, clouding decisions urgent issues crisis Kosovo. NATO military planners preparing possible air strikes Yugoslavia expected use key air bases Italy. In weakened position, Prodi difficulty persuading Parliament approve NATO strikes. He similar problems passing 1999 budget, necessary Italy cut lending rates, requirement joining single European monetary unit, euro, Jan. 1. Immediately Friday's vote 313-312, tense times raucous session, Prodi met President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro submit resignation discuss options. In coming days Scalfaro consult dozens leaders ascertain whether Prodi enough lingering support try form new government. If not, president expected turn another political leader. If compromise found, Italy could plunged early elections. But parties political stripes may reluctant push things far, opinion polls suggest voters enamored center-right opposition parties governing majority. Prodi, economist, admired Western allies down-to-earth leader vowed tame Italy's bloated economy reckless government borrowing actually lived pledge. By raising taxes, lowering interest rates reducing deficit, Italy met requirements membership euro last spring, feat year considered impossible German French economists. Prodi helped healthy global economy rare consensus industrialists, labor unions taxpayers, feared exclusion euro would condemn Italy Third World status. But fiscal discipline followed reform political system inherently fragile. There 40 parties Italy, government's efforts amend constitution introduce two-party system failed. Unless Italian political system changes, Italy condemned political instability, said Sergio Romano, former diplomat political science professor. The country needs stability credibility, never happen long government hanging thread. In 1996 Prodi patchwork quilt center-left factions mostly made Catholic moderates leftists. He relied fringe Marxist group, Communist Refounding Party, majority lower house. And alliance, fragile beginning, finally frayed breaking point week. The hard-line leader Communist Refounding, Fausto Bertinotti, said party would vote 1999 budget would also end 28-month-old pact center-left coalition. That position drove moderate wing Communist Refounding, worried vote Prodi would open doors center-right government, split away. But 20-odd deputies defied Bertinotti enough squeeze Prodi through. I bitter, Prodi said moments defeat. Even today I received lot support. In end coup de grace delivered one own, member coalition. They treachery one single person, Sergio Mattarella, deputy Prodi's coalition, angrily told reporters, referring Silvio Liotta, member Italian Renewal Party. Foreign Minister Lamberto Dini, heads party, said Liotta would expelled. Prodi said would govern majority center-left one elected 1996. But throughout tenure, forced seek temporary alliances push major policy decisions. He struggled last try keep original majority intact. On Thursday, effort woo moderate Communists side, prime minister, staunch ally United States, warned would oppose NATO strike aimed stopping Serbian violence Kosovo unless U.N.

South African media released preliminary findings Monday, three days official release Thursday Pretoria, capital. The release document milestone South Africa's transformation white minority rule democracy. The commission, power grant amnesty, tasked promoting reconciliation laying bare apartheid-era atrocities. With ANC power facing election mid-1999, condemnation commission could prove damaging electoral chances moral standing. There doubt report's overwhelming blame would laid white governments security forces years scrutiny, 1960-1994. Indeed, news reports Monday said Truth Commission would declare apartheid crime humanity acknowledge ANC radical Pan Africanist Congress conducting legitimate struggle former apartheid state. But preliminary findings sent parties last month, commission also said two movements morally politically accountable gross rights violations, South African Press Association South African Broadcasting Corp. said. The preliminary finding said ANC policy killing civilians, line military civilian targets blurred, SAPA said. It condemned planting landmines rural areas, execution enemy agents, torture mistreatment ANC members exile camps killing political opponents. It said party must accept responsibility activities ANC Women's League president Winnie Madikizela-Mandela, Nelson Mandela's former wife, Mandela United Football Club, accused killings, torture kidnappings. The commission also said PAC guilty deaths civilians strategy 1993 drive white farmers land could reclaimed blacks. Justice Minister Dullah Omar, meeting journalists Pretoria, would comment news reports condemnation ANC. I expect various responses (to report). I expect everyone agree. It lead healthy debate, said. He said commissioners recommends prosecutions anyone abuses, national director prosecutions decide whether proceed. The director appointed government. The commission's work designed help us establish rule law South Africa, establish principle accountability, Omar said. The ANC already prepared ground negative finding, saying weeks ago commission warned harsh judgments offing. The ANC nervous enough report request meeting commissioners earlier month. The panel refused, avoid appearing biased. On Monday, rejected contempt suggestions ANC officials leaked findings. Constand Viljoen, leader tiny right-wing Freedom Front, said ANC done give commission credibility making even-handed. Publicly, party long defended actions committed war. F.W. de Klerk, last apartheid-era president, meanwhile, planned ask court prevent Truth Commission report implicating covering state-sponsored terror. Obviously comply ruling court, Omar said, added would regret court-ordered delay. Facing court challenge, Truth Reconciliation Commission said Wednesday would withhold, least temporarily, parts final report implicate South Africa's last apartheid-era president, F.W. de Klerk, illegal acts. De Klerk, 62, helped negotiate end South Africa's white supremacist government shared 1993 Nobel Peace Prize President Nelson Mandela work, objected finding commission accessory fact bombings headquarters church group labor federation 1980s. The chairman 17-member panel, Archbishop Desmond Tutu, said although took action great reluctance, commission needed time prepare fight legal challenge. He said would take de Klerk's name 3,500-page report avoid delaying release Thursday. It upsets deeply, said statement. We scrupulously fair de Klerk, reject contention engaged vendetta him. De Klerk's challenge part storm criticism prompted leaks report last days. Within hours commission decision withdraw findings de Klerk, facing possibility new suit  time ruling African National Congress. The ANC also wants block commission findings conduct liberation struggle. A spokesman party, Thabo Masebe, said party would seek injunction morning report officially handed Mandela. While commission's report expected lay overwhelming blame former white government atrocities, also found ANC responsible human-rights violations, including torture killing spying suspects, bombings civilian areas killing political enemies, including members rival Zulu-based Inkhata Freedom Party. The decision de Klerk seems certain damage commission's credibility. The panel, created way putting South Africa's brutal rest expense political divisiveness trials, caused controversy start. It held 160 hearings throughout country, listening victims perpetrators seeking amnesty. But many whites say commission witch hunt aiming humiliate former government officials Afrikaners general. De Klerk forced commission officials court apology calling liar. Some political analysts said Wednesday's events would belief panel lacks impartiality. The withdrawal findings can't help seen lack certainty side, said Sampie Terreblanche, economist political analyst University Stellenbosch, supported commission. Whether not, whole report gets knock this. De Klerk's spokesman, David Steward, said former president confident would win case goes trial March. He happy courts rather dealing Truth Commission, Steward said. The fact agreed withdraw creates definite impression specifically concocted case involve Mr. de Klerk negative finding. The ANC accused commission trying criminalize liberation struggle. Whatever efforts besmirch struggle denouncing gross violation human rights, congress said statement. The ANC millions people part struggle always proud insure that, process destruction vile system, resort vile methods struggle basis means justified end. There probably subjects get South Africans excited issue Truth Commission whether worthy cause waste money. The events last days added debate. For some, Pal Martins, 34, former member ANC's armed wing, fact sides political spectrum uproar good thing. The mere fact everyone complaining means Truth Commission done work, said. But say many questions raised panel's competence. The whole affair pale, mockery justice, said Roboy Vonholdt, 56-year-old sheep ostrich farmer believes commission theatrical act. We turn backs move forward. We need need us. Let's make money let good economic conditions prevail. The commission's report supposed broad detailed summary South Africa's human rights history, 1960 1994, elections open races ended white minority rule. It parcel moral condemnations recommend individual prosecutions. While de Klerk alone court Wednesday challenging commission, Tutu said Wednesday threatened legal challenges led fewer individuals named rights violators originally planned. Tutu said 400 people notified would implicated give chance respond. Some 15 successfully argued report could reached therefore deleted report, said. The commission required law give advance notification anyone intends implicate report. The commission expected say although de Klerk order bombings, subsequently came know former Law Order Minister Adriaan Vlok Police Commissioner Johan van der Merwe involved, failed report knowledge police. This could open criminal prosecution. De Klerk applied amnesty matter other. de Klerk said learned bombings, Vlok Van der Merwe already process applying amnesty, think necessary report matter. A panel investigating apartheid-era atrocities said Wednesday implicate last apartheid president, F.W. de Klerk, human rights abuses threatened court challenge. De Klerk said would sue block long-awaited final report Truth Reconciliation Commission, due release Thursday.

Former Archbishop Desmond Tutu, truth panel's chairman, said commission needed time prepare fight legal challenge, would excise de Klerk's name report avoid delaying release. It upsets deeply, Tutu said. We scrupulously fair Mr. de Klerk reject contention engaged vendetta him. But must respect courts rights constitution. We fought hard rights proud South Africa Mr. de Klerk shares them, said statement. All postponing dealing matter, Tutu later told The Associated Press. The name eventually appear hoo-ha died down. De Klerk, reached London, said could comment speaking lawyers matter courts. The commission charged promoting reconciliation laying bare apartheid's horrors. It held hearings country two years, listening victims perpetrators seeking amnesty. The release 3,500-page report represents milestone South Africa's transformation white minority rule democracy. De Klerk's challenge part storm criticism prompted leaks report. The African National Congress, liberation movement helped defeat apartheid runs country, Tuesday angrily rejected finding guilty human rights violations armed struggle.

In commenting newspaper report, Tutu said 400 people notified would implicated give chance respond. Only 15 successfully argued report, said. Criminal prosecutions atrocities committed war white rule could drag least six years, top prosecutor said Monday. Key figures implicated human rights abuses Truth Reconciliation Commission already investigation, official, Jan d'Oliveira, told reporters. They include two unnamed generals apartheid state's security apparatus, President Nelson Mandela's ex-wife Winnie Madikizela-Mandela officials African National Congress, said. The remarks d'Oliveira, recently appointed deputy national director prosecutions, clearest signal criminal cases would brought figures accused commission gross human rights violations. The commission released report Oct. 30. It chronicles human rights abuses committed apartheid governments operatives well African National Congress fighting racist system. The issue continuing prosecutions significant. Many feel dragging criminal reckonings horrors apartheid era prolong bitterness delay reconciliation. But supporters prosecution feel denying justice victims worse evil. On practical level, highly public prosecutions ANC figures could impact national elections next year, party seek consolidate hold power. The panel's chairman, Archbishop Desmond Tutu, called two-year time limit prosecutions; d'Oliveira called period wholly impractical. The prosecutor name targets. We always worked principle prosecute highest rank, said. The commission ability grant amnesty admit misdeeds found acted political motives. The report said individuals sought amnesty prosecuted. Madikizela-Mandela sought amnesty. The commission found accountable human rights violations committed bodyguards, report said killed tortured suspected opponents. Madikizela-Mandela convicted 1991 kidnapping accessory assault four young men. She sentenced six years jail, paid dlrs 3,200 fine appeal. The ANC official prominent anti-apartheid activists. The two generals implicated Truth Commission testimony. Prosecutors ready move forward pending amnesty application one. Torturers bombers carried atrocities defending fighting apartheid need counseling ensure repeat crimes, expert South Africa's reconciliation body said Thursday. Addressing local international experts, Charles Villa-Vicencio, research head Truth Reconciliation Commission, said ignoring psychological needs carried human rights abuses could alienate potentially dangerous sector society. We must give attention healing perpetrators, sake perpetrators, sake nation whole, said. The conference, organized Medical Research Council, examining mental health issues raised Truth Commission, charged probing crimes committed sides anti-apartheid struggle. As commission prepares hand final report end month, South Africans examining painful traumatic exploration bloody past. With power grant amnesty many tortured, bombed maimed innocent civilians, process stage angered people nearly walks life. Many whites see panel favoring black liberation movements, many blacks accuse soft former state officials, especially top ranking ministers. However, Villa-Vicencio appealed tolerance dealing committed crimes, saying potential wrongdoing existed everyone. We all, entire human race, carry us capacity evil, said. Many Thursday's speakers touched figure police death squad leader Eugene de Kock, given jail terms totaling 200 years killing spree costs dozens lives. De Kock applied amnesty crimes. Dan Stein, specialist neurobiology stress disorders, said de Kock typified many killers sides conflict sheer banality evil. Many people found interviews ordinary, likeable person, said man subordinates dubbed Prime Evil. Ginn Fourie, physiotherapist whose student daughter gunned black activists 1993 attack Cape Town bar, said necessary help whose circumstances compelled wrong. Struggling control tears, Fourie told delegates attended amnesty hearings daughter's killers supported successful bid freed long jail sentences. After describing hugged three members black nationalist Pan-Africanist Congress urged seek counseling together victims, Fourie earned standing ovation 50-strong audience. We must take initiative understanding start process reconciliation healing broken land, said, voice shaking emotion. The New York Times said editorial Sunday, Nov. 1: The 3,500-page report South African Truth Reconciliation Commission, released Thursday, comprehensive unsparing examination nation's ugly commission produced. Drawing commission's investigations testimony hundreds applicants amnesty 20,000 victims, report detailed look crimes apartheid era, blames successive white governments vast majority. It fulfilled mandate telling fullest truth possible, one reason every political party South Africa denounced it. Besides accusing government assassinations bombings, report criticizes Inkatha Freedom Party massacres collaboration security forces, blames African National Congress murder civilians crimes. It singles former President P.W. Botha, Chief Mangosuthu Buthelezi, Inkatha leader, Winnie Mandela, others, detailed treatment roles political crimes. One major flaw report absence section accusing F.W. de Klerk, last apartheid president, knowing several bombings fact keeping silent. It excised de Klerk suing commission. The ANC also sued, unsuccessfully, stop publication. The lawsuits disappointing sign South Africa's political parties interested honest look past, free flow information. The controversy added widespread complaints commission helped process reconciliation. This wrong. True reconciliation  occurs society longer paralyzed people work live together  cannot based silence. No society restored health papering much pain South Africans suffered. A noisy informed debate complicity crimes apartheid era necessary, uncomfortable. The report part Truth Commission's contribution healing process. The hearings themselves, allowed victims human rights violations tell stories public, helped country heal opened eyes many whites unpleasant truth apartheid. The amnesty process, permitting many important criminals escape justice, allowing families know exactly happened loved ones dozens cases would likely never gone trial South Africa's fragile judicial system. The process helping victims scholarships necessary aid goes on, although enough. No commission transform society twisted South Africa's was. But Truth Commission best effort world seen, South Africa better it. The deal South Africa's Truth Reconciliation Commission offered simple enough: Confess crimes, apply amnesty go free. If come forward, prosecuted. After two years hearings apartheid-era atrocities, commission last week unveiled 3,500-page report naming dozens people believes elbows gore never applied amnesty. So prosecutions begin soon, right? Not fast. The study barely hands President Nelson Mandela talk new amnesty deals begun. It seems nearly South Africa's political parties  including ruling African National Congress  key officials could end dock report. Suddenly, lots talk country can't withstand politically divisive trials, many political analysts betting agreement mutual benefit offing. Already, three major political parties calling kind new amnesty, ANC closing door. ANC spokesman Thabo Masebe said premature talk general amnesty, acknowledged party discussing amnesty specifically tailored violence black South Africans blacks littered KwaZulu/Natal province bodies late '80s '90s. In choosing truth commission rather Nuremberg-style trial close brutal past, South Africa hoped idealistic reconciliation. People would come clean receive true forgiveness. Society would able move on, wounds cleansed healed. It model watched closely world societies wondering disentangle grudges brutal past. But given chance, hundreds South Africa's perpetrators come forward. Commission officials say frustrated lack cooperation, however exhaustive report may seem. It perhaps late, however, press more. Today's South Africa urgent new problems deal  unemployment, crime, white flight, schools hospitals. So may wind settling pragmatic reconciliation  one gives amnesty unrepentant simply practical concerned move on. In recent years, truth commissions gained popularity many places, notably Chile, Argentina El Salvador. But South Africa's  biggest powerful, able grant amnesty subpoena witnesses  supposed real test. Certainly commission forced nation see gruesome details past, sobbing survivors stone-faced torturers told smashed genitals suffocations. And commission's work added much knowledge happened South Africa 1960 1994. But years effect commission truly judged. Has anyone really forgiven anyone else? Will vendettas persist? No one answer. One thing seems clear, however: Four years South Africa held first non-racial elections, growing number South Africans want done past. Raymond Louw, publisher respected weekly newsletter, Southern Africa Report, says new amnesty proposal could come February session Parliament, time remove issue next year's election campaigns. You simply can't country torn apart prosecutions, says. Everybody going howling amnesty. They already are. Even Archbishop Desmond Tutu, commission's chairman, delivered report, seemed anticipating push new amnesty arguing it. He said move would highly unfair came forward. He suggested instead two-year time limit, anyone indicted would effect get amnesty. To sure, opposition proposals limit prosecutions. More dozen human rights victims advocacy groups already banded together condemn proposals unconscionable. The idea Truth Commission emerged compromise long negotiations brought South Africa's peaceful transition white supremacist state non-racial democracy. During talks, white National Party government pushed blanket amnesty, ANC refused. In end, 250 former police officers came forward, foot soldiers. And two high National Party officials, former Law Order Minister Adriaan Vlok Police Commissioner Johan van der Merwe, confessed  roles ordering bombings. In report, commission called apartheid state primary perpetrator gross human rights violations held high ranking former officials former President P.W. Botha, former army chief, Georg Meiring, former intelligence chief, Niel Barnard, responsible. These men, lower rank, applied amnesty For ANC, embarrassing prospect possible prosecution Mandela's former wife, Winnie Madikizela-Mandela, accused report taking part number assaults abductions. Lesser-known officials could face charges too. The ANC held responsible least 76 deaths KwaZulu/Natal. The ANC's problems complicated efforts make peace largely Zulu-based Inkatha Freedom Party. Virtually one party came forward ask amnesty. Yet report found Inkatha, working white government, responsible widespread slaughter KwaZulu/Natal townships Johannesburg. Inkatha's leader, Chief Mangosuthu Buthelezi, many key party officials stand accused fomenting wide range abuses. But prosecuting Chief Buthelezi could lead new warfare KwaZulu. Part reluctance go forward prosecutions may result still another factor: The judicial system already overwhelmed rising crime evidence apartheid era old. So spend time money? At moment, one political party opposed form new amnesty  tiny influential Democratic Party, liberal group involved violence. Its head, Tony Leon, says new amnesty would prove thuglike behavior, get away with. But concedes lonely voice. At point, says, little enthusiasm anything closing book past. A panel probing apartheid-era abuses accused African National Congress human rights violations, including torture bomb attacks, state broadcaster said Monday. The ANC, led struggle white rule power, previously acknowledged told expect implication right violations. The Truth Reconciliation Commission release final report 2 1-2 years investigation Thursday. The report expected place overwhelming blame era's abuses white governments brutal security services. President Nelson Mandela's office received advance copy Monday ahead handover ceremony, retired Archbishop Desmond Tutu, chaired comission, present Mandela report. South African Broadcasting Corp. radio said leaked preliminary document condemns ANC politically morally responsible gross human rights violations fall apartheid. An ANC spokesman, Thabo Masebe, said believed news report referred commission letter sent advance informing us intention implicate ANC gross human rights violations. Commission officials could immediately reached comment. Justice Minister Dullah Omar told journalists Pretoria heard news report, would comment. Former President F.W. de Klerk, meanwhile, plans ask court prevent Truth Commission report implicating covering state-sponsored terror. Obviously comply ruling court, Omar said, added would regret court-ordered delay. The ANC nervous enough report request meeting commissioners earlier month. The panel refused, avoid appearing embarrassed. The party says accusations likely would center planting land mines border farms, abuses military camps Angola bombings. Omar said expected report's conclusions set debate added would lay basis reconciliation. President Nelson Mandela acknowledged Saturday African National Congress violated human rights apartheid, setting odds deputy president report divided much South Africa. The disagreement stems Thursday's release report Truth Reconciliation Commission horrors committed apartheid. Rather act salve aid reconciliation, report caused divisiveness, former comrades-in-arms fought apartheid. As expected, report called apartheid crime humanity. But also blamed ANC gross human rights violations anti-apartheid struggle, saying group tortured suspected spies dissidents killed innocent civilians land mines bombs. Some suspected traitors killed ANC's camps abroad.

The decision de Klerk seems certain damage commission's credibility. The panel, created way putting South Africa's brutal rest expense political divisiveness trial, caused controversy start. It held 160 hearing throughout country, listening victim perpetrator seeking amnesty. But many white say commission witch hunt aiming humiliate former government official Afrikaners general. De Klerk forced commission official court apology calling liar. Some political analyst said Wednesday's event would belief panel lack impartiality. The withdrawal finding can't help seen lack certainty side, said Sampie Terreblanche, economist political analyst University Stellenbosch, supported commission. Whether not, whole report get knock this. De Klerk's spokesman, David Steward, said former president confident would win case go trial March. He happy court rather dealing Truth Commission, Steward said. The fact agreed withdraw creates definite impression specifically concocted case involve Mr. de Klerk negative finding. The ANC accused commission trying criminalize liberation struggle. Whatever effort besmirch struggle denouncing gross violation human right, congress said statement. The ANC million people part struggle always proud insure that, process destruction vile system, resort vile method struggle basis mean justified end. There probably subject get South Africans excited issue Truth Commission whether worthy cause waste money. The event last day added debate. For some, Pal Martins, 34, former member ANC's armed wing, fact side political spectrum uproar good thing. The mere fact everyone complaining mean Truth Commission done work, said. But say many question raised panel's competence. The whole affair pale, mockery justice, said Roboy Vonholdt, 56-year-old sheep ostrich farmer belief commission theatrical act. We turn back move forward. We need need u. Let's make money let good economic condition prevail. The commission's report supposed broad detailed summary South Africa's human right history, 1960 1994, election open race ended white minority rule. It parcel moral condemnation recommend individual prosecution. While de Klerk alone court Wednesday challenging commission, Tutu said Wednesday threatened legal challenge led fewer individual named right violator originally planned. Tutu said 400 people notified would implicated give chance respond. Some 15 successfully argued report could reached therefore deleted report, said. The commission required law give advance notification anyone intends implicate report. The commission expected say although de Klerk order bombing, subsequently came know former Law Order Minister Adriaan Vlok Police Commissioner Johan van der Merwe involved, failed report knowledge police. This could open criminal prosecution. De Klerk applied amnesty matter other. de Klerk said learned bombing, Vlok Van der Merwe already process applying amnesty, think necessary report matter. A panel investigating apartheid-era atrocity said Wednesday implicate last apartheid president, FW. de Klerk, human right abuse threatened court challenge. De Klerk said would sue block long-awaited final report Truth Reconciliation Commission, due release Thursday. The man helped negotiate end apartheid objected finding commission accessory fact bombing 1980s headquarters church group labor federation. Former Archbishop Desmond Tutu, truth panel's chairman, said commission needed time prepare fight legal challenge, would excise de Klerk's name report avoid delaying release. It upset deeply, Tutu said. We scrupulously fair Mr. de Klerk reject contention engaged vendetta him. But must respect court right constitution. We fought hard right proud South Africa Mr. de Klerk share them, said statement. All postponing dealing matter, Tutu later told The Associated Press. The name eventually appear hoo-ha died down. De Klerk, reached London, said could comment speaking lawyer matter court. The commission charged promoting reconciliation laying bare apartheid's horror. It held hearing country two year, listening victim perpetrator seeking amnesty. The release 3,500-page report represents milestone South Africa's transformation white minority rule democracy. De Klerk's challenge part storm criticism prompted leak report. The African National Congress, liberation movement helped defeat apartheid run country, Tuesday angrily rejected finding guilty human right violation armed struggle. The report broad detailed summary South Africa's human right history, 1960 1994, all-race election ended white minority rule. It parcel moral condemnation recommend individual prosecution. Other threatened legal challenge led fewer individual named right violator planned, The Star Johannesburg reported Wednesday. In commenting newspaper report, Tutu said 400 people notified would implicated give chance respond. Only 15 successfully argued report, said. Criminal prosecution atrocity committed war white rule could drag least six year, top prosecutor said Monday. Key figure implicated human right abuse Truth Reconciliation Commission already investigation, official, Jan d'Oliveira, told reporter. They include two unnamed general apartheid state's security apparatus, President Nelson Mandela's ex-wife Winnie Madikizela-Mandela official African National Congress, said. The remark d'Oliveira, recently appointed deputy national director prosecution, clearest signal criminal case would brought figure accused commission gross human right violation. The commission released report Oct. 30. It chronicle human right abuse committed apartheid government operative well African National Congress fighting racist system. The issue continuing prosecution significant. Many feel dragging criminal reckoning horror apartheid era prolong bitterness delay reconciliation. But supporter prosecution feel denying justice victim worse evil. On practical level, highly public prosecution ANC figure could impact national election next year, party seek consolidate hold power. The panel's chairman, Archbishop Desmond Tutu, called two-year time limit prosecutions; d'Oliveira called period wholly impractical. The prosecutor name target. We always worked principle prosecute highest rank, said. The commission ability grant amnesty admit misdeed found acted political motif. The report said individual sought amnesty prosecuted. Madikizela-Mandela sought amnesty. The commission found accountable human right violation committed bodyguard, report said killed tortured suspected opponent. Madikizela-Mandela convicted 1991 kidnapping accessory assault four young men. She sentenced six year jail, paid dlrs 3,200 fine appeal. The ANC official prominent anti-apartheid activist. The two general implicated Truth Commission testimony. Prosecutors ready move forward pending amnesty application one. Torturers bomber carried atrocity defending fighting apartheid need counseling ensure repeat crime, expert South Africa's reconciliation body said Thursday. Addressing local international expert, Charles Villa-Vicencio, research head Truth Reconciliation Commission, said ignoring psychological need carried human right abuse could alienate potentially dangerous sector society. We must give attention healing perpetrator, sake perpetrator, sake nation whole, said. The conference, organized Medical Research Council, examining mental health issue raised Truth Commission, charged probing crime committed side anti-apartheid struggle. As commission prepares hand final report end month, South Africans examining painful traumatic exploration bloody past. With power grant amnesty many tortured, bombed maimed innocent civilian, process stage angered people nearly walk life. Many white see panel favoring black liberation movement, many black accuse soft former state official, especially top ranking minister. However, Villa-Vicencio appealed tolerance dealing committed crime, saying potential wrongdoing existed everyone. We all, entire human race, carry u capacity evil, said. Many Thursday's speaker touched figure police death squad leader Eugene de Kock, given jail term totaling 200 year killing spree cost dozen life. De Kock applied amnesty crime. Dan Stein, specialist neurobiology stress disorder, said de Kock typified many killer side conflict sheer banality evil. Many people found interview ordinary, likeable person, said man subordinate dubbed Prime Evil. Ginn Fourie, physiotherapist whose student daughter gunned black activist 1993 attack Cape Town bar, said necessary help whose circumstance compelled wrong. Struggling control tear, Fourie told delegate attended amnesty hearing daughter's killer supported successful bid freed long jail sentence. After describing hugged three member black nationalist Pan-Africanist Congress urged seek counseling together victim, Fourie earned standing ovation 50-strong audience. We must take initiative understanding start process reconciliation healing broken land, said, voice shaking emotion. The New York Times said editorial Sunday, Nov. 1: The 3,500-page report South African Truth Reconciliation Commission, released Thursday, comprehensive unsparing examination nation's ugly commission produced. Drawing commission's investigation testimony hundred applicant amnesty 20,000 victim, report detailed look crime apartheid era, blame successive white government vast majority. It fulfilled mandate telling fullest truth possible, one reason every political party South Africa denounced it. Besides accusing government assassination bombing, report criticizes Inkatha Freedom Party massacre collaboration security force, blame African National Congress murder civilian crime. It single former President PW. Botha, Chief Mangosuthu Buthelezi, Inkatha leader, Winnie Mandela, others, detailed treatment role political crime. One major flaw report absence section accusing FW. de Klerk, last apartheid president, knowing several bombing fact keeping silent. It excised de Klerk suing commission. The ANC also sued, unsuccessfully, stop publication. The lawsuit disappointing sign South Africa's political party interested honest look past, free flow information. The controversy added widespread complaint commission helped process reconciliation. This wrong. True reconciliation occurs society longer paralyzed people work live together cannot based silence. No society restored health papering much pain South Africans suffered. A noisy informed debate complicity crime apartheid era necessary, uncomfortable. The report part Truth Commission's contribution healing process. The hearing themselves, allowed victim human right violation tell story public, helped country heal opened eye many white unpleasant truth apartheid. The amnesty process, permitting many important criminal escape justice, allowing family know exactly happened loved one dozen case would likely never gone trial South Africa's fragile judicial system. The process helping victim scholarship necessary aid go on, although enough. No commission transform society twisted South Africa's wa. But Truth Commission best effort world seen, South Africa better it. The deal South Africa's Truth Reconciliation Commission offered simple enough: Confess crime, apply amnesty go free. If come forward, prosecuted. After two year hearing apartheid-era atrocity, commission last week unveiled 3,500-page report naming dozen people belief elbow gore never applied amnesty. So prosecution begin soon, right? Not fast. The study barely hand President Nelson Mandela talk new amnesty deal begun. It seems nearly South Africa's political party including ruling African National Congress key official could end dock report. Suddenly, lot talk country can't withstand politically divisive trial, many political analyst betting agreement mutual benefit offing. Already, three major political party calling kind new amnesty, ANC closing door. ANC spokesman Thabo Masebe said premature talk general amnesty, acknowledged party discussing amnesty specifically tailored violence black South Africans black littered KwaZulu/Natal province body late '80s '90s. In choosing truth commission rather Nuremberg-style trial close brutal past, South Africa hoped idealistic reconciliation. People would come clean receive true forgiveness. Society would able move on, wound cleansed healed. It model watched closely world society wondering disentangle grudge brutal past. But given chance, hundred South Africa's perpetrator come forward. Commission official say frustrated lack cooperation, however exhaustive report may seem. It perhaps late, however, press more. Today's South Africa urgent new problem deal unemployment, crime, white flight, school hospital. So may wind settling pragmatic reconciliation one give amnesty unrepentant simply practical concerned move on. In recent year, truth commission gained popularity many place, notably Chile, Argentina El Salvador. But South Africa's biggest powerful, able grant amnesty subpoena witness supposed real test. Certainly commission forced nation see gruesome detail past, sobbing survivor stone-faced torturer told smashed genitals suffocation. And commission's work added much knowledge happened South Africa 1960 1994. But year effect commission truly judged. Has anyone really forgiven anyone else? Will vendetta persist? No one answer. One thing seems clear, however: Four year South Africa held first non-racial election, growing number South Africans want done past. Raymond Louw, publisher respected weekly newsletter, Southern Africa Report, say new amnesty proposal could come February session Parliament, time remove issue next year's election campaign. You simply can't country torn apart prosecution, say. Everybody going howling amnesty. They already are. Even Archbishop Desmond Tutu, commission's chairman, delivered report, seemed anticipating push new amnesty arguing it. He said move would highly unfair came forward. He suggested instead two-year time limit, anyone indicted would effect get amnesty. To sure, opposition proposal limit prosecution. More dozen human right victim advocacy group already banded together condemn proposal unconscionable. The idea Truth Commission emerged compromise long negotiation brought South Africa's peaceful transition white supremacist state non-racial democracy. During talk, white National Party government pushed blanket amnesty, ANC refused. In end, 250 former police officer came forward, foot soldier. And two high National Party official, former Law Order Minister Adriaan Vlok Police Commissioner Johan van der Merwe, confessed role ordering bombing. In report, commission called apartheid state primary perpetrator gross human right violation held high ranking former official former President PW. Botha, former army chief, Georg Meiring, former intelligence chief, Niel Barnard, responsible. These men, lower rank, applied amnesty For ANC, embarrassing prospect possible prosecution Mandela's former wife, Winnie Madikizela-Mandela, accused report taking part number assault abduction. Lesser-known official could face charge too. The ANC held responsible least 76 death KwaZulu/Natal. The ANC's problem complicated effort make peace largely Zulu-based Inkatha Freedom Party. Virtually one party came forward ask amnesty. Yet report found Inkatha, working white government, responsible widespread slaughter KwaZulu/Natal township Johannesburg. Inkatha's leader, Chief Mangosuthu Buthelezi, many key party official stand accused fomenting wide range abuse. But prosecuting Chief Buthelezi could lead new warfare KwaZulu. Part reluctance go forward prosecution may result still another factor: The judicial system already overwhelmed rising crime evidence apartheid era old. So spend time money? At moment, one political party opposed form new amnesty tiny influential Democratic Party, liberal group involved violence. Its head, Tony Leon, say new amnesty would prove thuglike behavior, get away with. But concedes lonely voice. At point, say, little enthusiasm anything closing book past. A panel probing apartheid-era abuse accused African National Congress human right violation, including torture bomb attack, state broadcaster said Monday. The ANC, led struggle white rule power, previously acknowledged told expect implication right violation. The Truth Reconciliation Commission release final report 2 1-2 year investigation Thursday. The report expected place overwhelming blame era's abuse white government brutal security service. President Nelson Mandela's office received advance copy Monday ahead handover ceremony, retired Archbishop Desmond Tutu, chaired comission, present Mandela report. South African Broadcasting Corp. radio said leaked preliminary document condemns ANC politically morally responsible gross human right violation fall apartheid. An ANC spokesman, Thabo Masebe, said believed news report referred commission letter sent advance informing u intention implicate ANC gross human right violation. Commission official could immediately reached comment. Justice Minister Dullah Omar told journalist Pretoria heard news report, would comment. Former President FW. de Klerk, meanwhile, plan ask court prevent Truth Commission report implicating covering state-sponsored terror. Obviously comply ruling court, Omar said, added would regret court-ordered delay. The ANC nervous enough report request meeting commissioner earlier month. The panel refused, avoid appearing embarrassed. The party say accusation likely would center planting land mine border farm, abuse military camp Angola bombing. Omar said expected report's conclusion set debate added would lay basis reconciliation. President Nelson Mandela acknowledged Saturday African National Congress violated human right apartheid, setting odds deputy president report divided much South Africa. The disagreement stem Thursday's release report Truth Reconciliation Commission horror committed apartheid. Rather act salve aid reconciliation, report caused divisiveness, former comrades-in-arms fought apartheid. As expected, report called apartheid crime humanity. But also blamed ANC gross human right violation anti-apartheid struggle, saying group tortured suspected spy dissident killed innocent civilian land mine bomb.

From nation Tuesday, gay leaders stressed campus homophobia restricted college towns Rocky Mountain West. Last year, survey almost 4,000 Massachusetts high school students, 22 percent gay respondents said skipped school month felt unsafe school, 31 percent said threatened injured school year. These percentages five times greater percentages heterosexual respondents. The survey conducted 58 high schools Massachusetts Department Education. In separate study nearly 500 community college students San Francisco area, 32 percent male respondents said verbally threatened gay people 18 percent said physically threatened assaulted gay people. The study conducted year Karen Franklin, forensic psychologist researcher University Washington. Surveys gay college students conducted late 1980s Yale University, Oberlin College, Rutgers University Penn State found 16 percent 26 percent threatened violence, 40 percent 76 percent verbally harassed, said National Gay Lesbian Task Force, lobbying group based Washington. Last year, student group Des Moines, Iowa, called Concerned Students, recorded hallway classroom conversations five high schools 10 homophobia recording day. They estimated average Des Moines high school student hears 25 anti-gay remarks every day. Nine 10 `teaching tolerance' courses weed gays, Foreman said. There lot people preaching anti-racism anti-semitism. But still much OK make anti-gay jokes, express anti-gay sentiments.

In Fort Collins, hospital officials struggled electronic avalanche condolences, city police detectives investigating different kind e-mail. On Monday, hours Shepard's death, two gay organizations, Rainbow Chorus Lambda Community Center, received identical messages applauding Shepard's murder. The messages closed words: I hope happens often. Matthew Shepard, gay college student kidnapped severely beaten, died Monday, five days found unconscious Wyoming ranch left tied fence 18 hours near-freezing temperatures. His death, announced Poudre Valley Hospital here, fanned outrage followed word last week's attack, spawning nationwide vigils, producing call federal hate-crimes legislation President Clinton fueling debates laws host Western states, including Wyoming, resisted them. From Denver University Maryland, people turned honor The slight, soft-spoken 21-year-old Shepard, freshman University Wyoming, became overnight symbol anti-gay violence found dangling fence passerby. Two men two women charged case. The men charged attempted murder expected face first-degree murder charges could bring death penalty. There incredible symbolism tied fence, said Rebecca Isaacs, political director National Gay Lesbian Task Force Washington. People likened scarecrow. But sounded crucifixion. Gay leaders hope  Christian conservatives fear  Shepard's death galvanize Congress state legislatures pass hate-crime legislation broaden existing laws. Conservatives generally oppose laws favor one group's rights another. In last two decades, 21 states District Columbia passed laws increase penalties crimes committed person's race, religion, color, national origin, sexual orientation. Another 19 states, including Colorado, include sexual orientation hate-crime laws. Ten states, including Wyoming, hate-crime laws all. In Washington, Clinton responded news Shepard's death urging Congress pass federal Hate Crimes Protection Act, would make federal offenses crimes based sex, disability sexual orientation. Wyoming one nation's holdouts, rejecting three hate crimes bills 1994, recently February. But Monday, Shepard's death, Gov. Jim Geringer appealed lawmakers reconsider opposition. I ask collective suggestion anti-bias, anti-hate legislation presented Wyoming Legislature consideration January, Geringer said. The governor met Monday morning Dennis Shepard, slain student's father, said elder Shepard want son's death become media circus use Matt agenda. Geringer said Shepard's father also said: Don't rush passing kinds new hate-crimes laws. Be careful changes sure taking away rights process race this. Leaders gay rights groups interviewed Monday said would respect family's privacy attending burial Casper, Wyo., Saturday. But added hoped death would impact legislators nation. Matthew's death, I hope, bring better deeper understanding hate crime laws, said Elizabeth Birch, executive director Human Rights Campaign, lesbian gay rights group 250,000 members. Matthew's death may lead awakening Wyoming United States Congress need legislation. In 1996, 21 men women killed United States sexual orientation, according Southern Poverty Law Center, Alabama group tracks violence minorities. According FBI, sexual orientation factor 11.6 percent 8,759 hate crimes recorded 1996. But Christian conservatives warn gay leaders want use Shepard's death expand hate rights laws curtail freedom speech. Hate crimes laws nothing perpetrators violent crime everything silencing political opposition, said Steven Schwalm, analyst Family Research Council, Washington group dedicated defending faith, family freedom. It would criminalize pro-family beliefs, Schwalm said. This basically sends message can't disagree political message homosexual activists. Agreement came John Paulk, featured summer series advertisements wife, Anne, overcame homosexuality religious conversion. We every right speak agenda contrary Biblical norms, said Paulk, describes homosexuality specialist Focus Family, Christian group Colorado Springs, Colo. Because standing opposing homosexual agenda, looked advocating violence homosexuals, categorically reject violence homosexuals. Last Thursday, Family Research Council unveiled series television advertisements preach healing homosexuality religious conversion. Gay leaders charge advertisements help create hostile climate homosexuals, climate lead violence. Hate crime laws books 40 states impinged freedom speech, said Brian Levin, criminal justice professor directs Center Hate Extremism Stockton College, Pomona, N.J. Instead, said, hate crime laws send clear message society tolerate attacks minorities. We want deter broken windows simple assaults escalate, said. Referring murders homosexuals, added: These crimes preventable. Offenders get emboldened punished first time. Levin said research indicated homosexuals suffered higher rates violent crime population large. He also said roughly half people attack homosexuals male, aged 22 younger. The two men charged killing Shephard white, Russell Henderson, 21, Aaron McKinney, 22. With crimes, violence means end. With hate crimes, violence becomes unstoppable goal, Levin said. Shepard suffered dozen cuts head, face neck, well massive blow back skull. Because social stature society, gays viewed appropriate targets, Levin added. Citing need hate crime laws send clear message gay bashers, Levin said: The discourse society leaves many people believe socially acceptable. While gay leaders saw crucifixion imagery Shepard's death, saw different symbolism: Old West practice nailing dead coyote ranch fence warning future intruders. This University Wyoming student beaten left die, tied fence animal honest open gay, Beatrice Dorhn, legal director Lambda Legal Defense Education Fund, said Monday, Matthew Shepard's horrible suffering death cannot dismissed simply fault deranged, isolated individuals. His attackers millions Americans constantly hear message gay people worthy basic equal treatment, Ms. Dorhn said. On day Americans learned last week Matthew Shepard, 5-foot-2, 105-pound gay college student, tortured, strung animal left die fence Laramie, Wyo., Family Research Council co-hosting press conference Washington. It latest salvo six-month campaign religious right, tacit, explicit, approval Republican leaders, demonize gay people political gain election year. This particular press conference announce new barrage ads  TV follow-up summer print campaign  alleged former homosexuals changed implore likewise power Jesus Christ. The commercials, gooey style, end slogan: It's hate ... It's hope. But really stirring fear produces hate. If ads truly aimed gay people, broadcast extravagant cost wide general audience reached TV, trumpeted Washington, insuring free national exposure, three weeks Election Day. The ads themselves, sugar-coating hope, ooze malice. In one them, homosexuality linked drug addiction certain death AIDS; implicitly posit homosexuality disease need cure. Matthew Shepard cured, that's sure. As uncle, R.W. Eaton, told The Denver Post, 21-year-old Matt, aspired career diplomacy human rights, small person big heart, mind soul someone tried beat him. Of nephew's shattered body Eaton said, It's something might see war. And war is. Go Family Research Council's Web site find proud description readiness wage war homosexual agenda fight maintain traditional meaning `family.' The head Family Research Council Gary Bauer, GOP power broker putative presidential candidate, disingenuously goes talk shows say organization hates one deplores violence. But wage well-financed media air war people innate difference sexual orientation ceaselessly branded sinful diseased un-American seekers special rights, ground war follow. It's story old history. Once group successfully scapegoated subhuman threat normal values propaganda machine, emboldened thugs take over. Two weeks James Byrd savagely dragged death pickup truck Texas June, I wrote column ugly incident GOP state convention Fort Worth, mob threatened group gay Log Cabin Republicans protesting discriminatory treatment party. The gay-bashers directly preceded steady saber-rattling Republican politicians: Sen.

Thursday's vote put motion agenda indication government's chances survival, said extremely slim. If approved, legislature debate motions Monday hold no-confidence vote Wednesday. The opposition accuses Prime Minister Mesut Yilmaz ties organized crime tampering privatization state bank. He denies charges. Ousting government power open way struggle gangs, said Lutfu Esengun, deputy Islamic Virtue Party, presented one three no-confidence motions Parliament. On Wednesday, 6th graf pvs After failing bring together political rivals coalition, Premier-designate Bulent Ecevit announced Saturday returning mandate Turkish president. In statement reported Anatolia news agency, Ecevit said would see President Suleyman Demirel Monday morning.

Deputies accused Yilmaz, serving acting premier, entertaining ties mob tampering sale state bank. Refusing alliance pro-Islamic Virtue Party, Turkey's largest party Parliament, Ecevit unable create political alliance strong enough survive confidence vote deeply divided legislature. Ecevit tried vain form coalition government two rival center-right wing parties -- one led Yilmaz, former Prime Minister Tansu Ciller. Ecevut's alternate efforts make minority coalition backing Democratic Left Party Parliament also failed. Demirel either ask someone else try form government wait Jan. 10, constitution allows appoint caretaker cabinet lead country parliamentary elections, scheduled April. Such cabinet would face confidence vote. Or Demirel could choose leave current caretaker government, headed Yilmaz, power elections. Bulent Ecevit, asked form new government Wednesday, former prime minister best remembered ordering invasion Cyprus 1974 made overnight hero home. The invasion, short-lived coup supporters union Greece, led division island. Throughout years, Ecevit, 73, remained strong defender cause Turkish Cypriots As long Turkey lives, allow oppression subordination Turkish Cypriots hands Greek Cypriots, said July 1997 23rd anniversary celebrations invasion. Ecevit, prime minister three times 1974, years shed socialist idealism known 70s. During tenure deputy prime minister 17-month government toppled last week corruption scandal, gave backing liberal policies center-right-led coalition. He said carrying duty bring stable government spare Turkey crisis - reference tensions previous Islamic-led government secular military. Though never Marxist, Ecevit early years viewed suspicion big business espousing socialism based heavy government social benefits strong role state sector economy. Recently, however, helped government keep good terms IMF, ordered strict curb public spending, approved number state sell-offs. Under leadership 70's, ties United States tense. He also expressed concern U.S.-led multinational force based Turkey monitors no-fly zone Kurdish-controlled northern Iraq. He argues it helping create Kurdish state. His frequent visits Iraq meet President Saddam Hussein turn raised suspicion Washington. Despite short alliance Islamic party 1974, staunch defender Turkey's secular traditions pushed crackdown Islamic radicalism.

He imprisoned three times carrying political activities ban, mainly wife 51 years, Rahsan, formed Democratic Left Party 1985 led democratic reform 1987 allowed Ecevit back politics. In corruption-tainted Turkish politics, remains known leader cleanest slate. Not alliance Yilmaz ousted alleged ties mob rigging privatization bank, tarnished image. The chances new, strictly secular government Turkey faded Wednesday potential coalition partner insisted giving Islamic party share power. The military, self-appointed guardians Turkey's secular system, adamantly opposed inclusion Islamic Virtue, largest party parliament. Premier-designate Bulent Ecevit needs Turkey's two-center right parties hammer together secular coalition, Tansu Ciller, ex-premier commands 99 votes parliament, rebuffed Wednesday. Ecevit already support arch-rival, outgoing Premier Mesut Yilmaz, head center-right party. But Mrs. Ciller said Wednesday would join forces Yilmaz, whose government collapsed Nov. 25 mafia scandal. Instead, reiterated demand government would include Virtue. We oppose Mr. Ecevit's premiership. We support him, parties represented Parliament included, Mrs. Ciller said. It clear Ecevit's next move would be. He might try form fragile minority coalition. He might also admit defeat return task forming government President Suleyman Demirel. Demirel could choose member parliament head government elections April.

Marilyn Wilson, executive director Canadian Abortion Rights Action League, sees long-term threat fear violence may intimidate young doctors entering field. There almost doctors stopped performing procedures, current reign terror, said. But young doctors families necessarily want this. They may willing put lives risk. The abortion debate one several factors contributing shortage obstetrician-gynecologists Canada. The national society oversees speciality says 1,400 doctors field, shortfall 600, 50s 60s. The society says long hours limits fees paid public health-care system causing burnout deterring medical school graduates choose specialty. Another problem Canadian medical schools offer training abortion. Women Canada's big cities generally adequate access abortions. Those rural areas face long journeys, province Prince Edward Island prohibits abortions six hospitals, forcing women travel New Brunswick Nova Scotia. Abortion-rights groups say situation would improve RU-486 abortion pill available Canada. No drug company applied permission market pill, either fearing boycotts doubting profitability. The government urged make public appeal drug companies, health department says can't done. It would conflict interest, said Bonnie Fox-McIntyre, department spokeswoman. As regulator stay arm's length, judge application impartially. Abortion illegal Canada 1988. Now abortion law sort, 100,000 abortions performed annually, polls indicate roughly three-quarters Canadians favor pro-choice policies. Yet public support spare doctors fear. Dr. Henry Morgentaler, led efforts overturn old abortion law whose Toronto clinic bombed 1993, says colleagues sacrificing personal freedom reluctantly increase security measures. Unfortunately, doctors committed providing services accept certain diminishment enjoyment life, said. In aftermath last month's deadly sniper attack obstetrician upstate New York, Attorney General Janet Reno announced last week setting new investigative unit examine possibility doctor victim broader anti-abortion plot. The unit, National Clinic Violence Task Force, include dozen Justice Department lawyers involve several law-enforcement agencies. But main work looking shooting Dr. Barnett Slepian suburban Buffalo home fits larger pattern organized violence done FBI, jurisdiction domestic terrorism. For many FBI, that's problem. In contrast old image gung-ho FBI agents turning surveillance machinery political groups, number senior FBI agents privately expressed misgivings attorney general's latest task force, second ordered begin broad investigation conspiracy involving anti-abortion violence. FBI officials fear expanding investigation could drive agency ill-defined boundary separates inquiries criminal activity political causes unpopular ideas. Today's agents eager disassociate old J. Edgar Hoover days trampling civil rights political dissidents guise serious investigations. They want agency drawn middle bitter ideological war anti-abortion groups abortion rights advocates, long asserted existence organized campaign clinics doctors. Many calling government help subjects FBI interest anti-war civil rights activists. Senior agency officials, including Director Louis Freeh, starting careers early 1970s watched dismay FBI shaken revelations Cointelpro, counterintelligence program allowed agents spy on, burgle, wiretap infiltrate anti-war civil rights groups Students Democratic Society Student Nonviolence Coordinating Committee. Some officials dubious conspiracy exists kill doctors perform abortions. They came empty handed Reno ordered first federal inquiry 1994 killing Florida doctor bodyguard. The Justice Department conducted two-year grand jury investigation; agents pursued anti-abortion activists using surveillance teams. But investigators never found specific plot abortion clinics staff members. Violence abortion clinics part problem. The FBI recent years found thrown minefield politically tinged cases involving volatile worlds anti-government militias, environmental Christian extremists, white separatists, animal rights activists Islamic fundamentalists. The FBI quick jump investigating crime investigating political association, said David Cole, law professor Georgetown University. When move investigating crimes investigating groups, all-important nexus criminal conduct gets lost, focus gets broader broader start sweeping kinds lawful political activity. In response terrorist attacks bombings World Trade Center 1993, Oklahoma City federal building 1995 Olympic park Atlanta 1996, agency increased efforts deter incidents major prevention program. In cases, Justice Department, FBI law enforcement agencies said operate domestic security guidelines require investigators find reasonable indication group planning break law open inquiry organization. Before authorities use intrusive tactics wiretapping property searches, must specific evidence. Yet FBI agents throughout country quietly evaluated threat posed variety extremist groups links local authorities informal interviews leaders groups. Their conclusion groups pose little real danger. Much difficult investigate lone terrorists inflamed oratory extremist ideology belong group, drifting society's frayed margins, grid, agents describe it, usual ties family, friends work. The profile fits Eric Robert Rudolph, fugitive wanted bombings Atlanta Olympics, gay nightclub two abortion clinics. He kept beliefs mostly himself, although acquaintances hint familiar religious extremism hate groups. In contrast, James Charles Kopp, sought material witness killing Slepian, left trail clues motives. He early follower Randall Terry, leader Operation Rescue. Later, Kopp associated Lambs Christ, another militant anti-abortion group. One law-enforcement official said government best. We investigate violations, said. We investigate groups. Everyone knew Dr. Barnett Slepian knew slight, graying physician endured measure stress would exhaust, break, people. There strangers pawed garbage cans home growled murderer passed grocery store aisle. Demonstrators assailed pregnant patients arrived office checkups, calling baby killer. Outside clinic performed abortions two days week, pickets shouted epithets pig face. Slepian, obstetrician gynecologist training abortion doctor principle, rarely acknowledged strain. He might crack occasional joke expense protesters shadowed work weekends. Then would something unexpected, invite anti-abortion leader breakfast stop chat familiar demonstrator clinic. So killed Oct. 23 sniper's bullet fired kitchen window home Buffalo, N.Y., suburbs, furtive execution fit pattern four earlier attacks abortion providers western New York state Canada, friends relatives wondered much Slepian's work could arouse murderous violence. He predicted much himself. Instead, wondered, again, persisted work, long Buffalo doctors surrendered pressure abortion opponents. He incredibly fatalistic person thought number's up, up, nothing it, said H. Amanda Robb, doctor's 32-year-old niece. And incredibly stubborn. He said women right comprehensive health care women's doctor, going provide them. Slepian third doctor killed last five years bombings shootings killed 7 people wounded 17 abortion clinics nation. To tormentors, simply abortion doctor. To members abortion rights movement, martyr cause. But Slepian far either. In interviews friends family members, emerges one-dimensional abstract  conservative advocated old-fashioned values self-reliance, shy man rare flashes anger, doctor performed abortions patience women multiple abortions women multiple children want could support. He killed performed medical procedure become emotional politicized. Yet nothing life suggest crusader either politics medicine. Rather, obstinate, unassuming man remarkable thing. Out contrariness conscience, say knew him, refused allow anyone dictate kind doctor be, that, paid life. The clues Slepian's flinty brand commitment lie, part, upbringing. His family took success granted teetered edge poverty. To earn money medical school, shoveled muck ranch drove taxi. He made friends, friends life. When wives sick, called repeatedly. When lonely, flew side. Slepian, known Bart, used tell people chose obstetrics specialty exposes doctor least suffering, performed abortions legal alternatives much worse. Slepian expressed exasperation women came abortion abortion. Don't get it? clinic staff recall saying once. He impatience women remembered residency inner-city Buffalo, child child means support. He contempt somebody pulled bootstraps made world, Ms. Robb said. He believed ban abortions or, shameful view, stop teaching young doctors perform them, would correct human imperfections found irritating. There 1.5 million abortions performed country, niece said, felt we're equipped handle 1.5 million unwanted children. When killed, age 52, Bart Slepian owned imposing red brick home quiet suburb Amherst, complete swimming pool piped-in music assortment time-saving gadgets adored. Slepian's trajectory comfortable doctor's life unconventional. His grandfather, Russian Jewish immigrant started selling shoelaces pushcart Boston, propelled five sons Harvard time Jews met university's blue-blood standards. His father, turn, decreed three sons would doctors earn Ph.D's. We grew home tremendous, tremendous, tremendous respect education, said Serena Robb, Slepian's sister, four years older him. If got A, OK If got B, got yelled at. The family's means match expectations. Slepian's father, Philip, joined father's business manufacturing leather soles shoes. Soon Bart born 1946 Boston, company failed, money, father moved family six in-laws' apartment McKeesport, Pa., Rochester, N.Y. Once settled, Slepian's father set freelance writer, crisscrossing country old Studebaker, researching origins prominent citizens Library Congress writing stories small-town newspapers. He sold articles hundreds, still writing death nine years ago age 93. The success expected Bart Slepian come easily. As child, shy cried anyone looked him, sister recalled. An unexceptional student, went local community college transferring University Denver, majored zoology. Rejected medical schools United States  fate two three applicants late 1960s  studied one year Belgium enrolled Autonomous University Medicine Guadalajara, Mexico. His friends remember funny obstinate, thin young man glasses receding hairline beat comers arm-wrestling pool. Bart certain beliefs, strongly held, said Richard Schwarz, old classmate internist Long Island. He always said sit whining things, Schwarz said. He would say, `Go what's what's right.' Bart Slepian's determination surfaced quirky ways. He insisted going top World Trade Center, crippling fear heights. To get window, crawled, inch inch. I said, `You this,'  recalled Schwarz, time. And said, `I want it.' Bart made count. He felt alive. Forced drop school every semesters work, lived Reno sister Serena, widow struggling take care two young daughters. She worked waitress blackjack dealer, sharing tips drove cab, cleaned barns ranch worked laboratory assistant local Veterans Administration hospital. After graduation, moved Buffalo medical residency. There married Lynne Breitbart, registered nurse 10 years junior, scraped together money buy obstetrics practice doctor retire. He soothing, unhurried manner. When patient his, Patti Durlak, diagnosed diabetes, Slepian referred specialist called every days months help overcome fear needles use insulin injections. The doctor said, `Just deal it,' Mrs. Durlak recalled. Not Dr. Slepian. In ways, typical suburban family man, working six days week spending free time Little League games county fairs four sons. But late 1980s, abortion doctors Buffalo siege. In one notorious 1991 incident recorded videotape, Rev. Paul Schenck, one fieriest Buffalo's anti-abortion leaders, threw front doctor's car pulled clinic driveway. Slepian parked street. As pushed way crowd chanting demonstrators, Schenck cupped hands mouth lunged, shouting, Slepian, pig! Slepian's attempts separate abortion conflict private life futile. The protests followed home man bashful boy found himself, uncomfortably, center controversy attention. Once, showed anger. In 1988, demonstrators jeered sidewalk front home opened Hanukkah presents children, doctor came brandishing baseball bat. He denied hurt anyone, town judge ordered repair one protester's smashed van window pay portion another's medical bills. The outburst surprised family friends. It Slepian's style make public fuss, much less acknowledge stress taunted protesters. Stress? oldest brother Paul responded gruffly asked doctor's mood. I never heard word used family, engineering term. He said nuisance. Mrs. Slepian respond requests interview. She expressed rage The Buffalo News shortly shooting. She said whoever killed husband deserved death penalty would happy administer lethal injection herself. She also spoke Schenck's brother, Robert, another anti-abortion leader frequently confronted Slepian, sent bouquet flowers. Mrs. Slepian denounced hypocrite. After confrontation 1988, Slepian turned civil harassment lawsuits, letters levity deal protesters. In 1993, man active anti-abortion effort arrested rifling doctor's garbage cans home, Slepian tried treat incident lightly. They hopefully got bags full dirty diapers, joked. He tried engage critics local newspaper. He told The Buffalo News abortion protesters turn energies helping women avoid unwanted pregnancies birth control counseling. In letter editor warned repeatedly calling murderer, critics inciting violence. Slepian accepted opponents abortion acted moral conviction, friends said, resented personal attacks. He thought tended demonize dehumanize increased danger, said lawyer, Glenn Edward Murray. So Slepian took step nation's beleaguered abortion clinic doctors dared. He insisted tried hard enough, might cut venom. To dismay staff members feared safety, Slepian began year ago stop chat protesters recognized Womenservices abortion clinic Buffalo, worked two days week. He surprised gathering protesters preparing euphemistically called house call, demonstration doctor's home, invited protest's organizer, Rev. Robert Behn, breakfast. Their hourlong conversation next morning inconclusive, Behn said, dismissing Slepian's gesture attempt get people him. He asked Slepian performing abortions affected spiritually. In response, recalled, doctor said, I'm fine spiritually. Slepian, meanwhile, focused time away home family. He planned take cruise next spring. He bought time-share apartment Disney World Florida. He many plans, said Ellen Fink, close friend couple 15 years. He done. He done living yet. Still, sometimes casual conversations, shadow would appear. When wife gave gray African parrot birthday gift, Slepian joked bird would probably outlive would teach eulogy. He would talk funeral wanted, Mrs. Fink said. He said lot friends wanted come separate cars, one car, he'd long procession. In week death, Slepian reasons preoccupied thoughts mortality. A medical checkup revealed blockage heart, Mrs. Fink said, recounting conversation Mrs. Slepian day slaying. A blockage sign probable coronary artery disease. He tests week. I said, `Lynne, relax, going OK,' Mrs. Fink recalled. That day, National Abortion Federation sent fax Womenservices clinic warning pattern sniper attacks abortion doctors occurred early November. Marilynne Buckham, clinic director, sent Slepian. He definitely took seriously, recalled. Typically, doctor share concerns might felt. It normal day, said Tammi Latini, office assistant. We horsing around.' That evening, Slepians went synagogue mark ninth anniversary death Slepian's father. Shortly returned home, sniper's bullet smashed kitchen window, killing Slepian chatted wife sons. The protesters returned clinic five days later, first day reopened. Mrs. Buckham, director, said Slepian would surprised. They routine. So he. He never wanted day end bad note, said. At end day, I would always say, `Thank coming.' And would always turn stupid grin say, `Thanks me.' The slaying Dr. Barnett Slepian home last week eliminated mainstay abortion clinic here, eliminated women's access abortion. That availability abortion Buffalo area, much United States, complex reality, one affected class education, medical training personal convictions individual doctors. Knowledgeable middle-class affluent women find unwanted pregnancy obtain abortion private gynecologists, gynecologist personal objection procedure, referral colleague. Women poor, young uneducated regular relationships doctors rely specialized clinics one Slepian worked in, hospitals. It group  unplanned pregnancies far common prosperous women  faces shrinking universe possibilities result fear set Slepian's killing slayings five doctors clinic workers 1993, medical experts said. If well well connected, get abortion, said Dr. Stephen Wear, co-director center clinical ethics University Buffalo, trains doctors Buffalo area's hospitals. For everybody else, less less available. The number abortions United States declining steadily first years Supreme Court's Roe vs. Wade decision legalized abortion 1973, according Alan Guttmacher Institute, studies reproductive issues. They number roughly 1.5 million year, according reports Guttmacher, 1.4 million, according National Right Life Committee, nation's largest anti-abortion group, calculates estimate partly Guttmacher figures. The number providers identify performing abortions part practice diminishing well. A 1994 Guttmacher study, last one published, found number decreased 18 percent 1982 1992, 2,380 2,908. Moreover, study said, 12 percent nation's residency programs routinely offer training abortions first trimester, though many offer elective courses. Laura Echevarria, director media relations National Right Life Committee, contends, however, teaching hospitals train gynecologists procedures treating miscarriages similar used performing abortions. Only cosmopolitan comparatively liberal cities New York availability abortions continue steady level, experts say, though locales concern decreasing number young doctors emerge residencies fully trained performing abortions. The Guttmacher Institute, keeps nation's precise statistics, said 1992, last year figures, 142,410 abortions New York done 151 providers, including 61 hospitals 44 clinics. Still, provider figure greatly understates number private doctors perform offices, medical experts say. Many obstetricians gynecologists Manhattan provide abortions part palette services, many years, said Dr. Richard Hausknecht, medical director Planned Parenthood. Rich middle-class women always access abortions, always will. The major threat availability city less result anti-abortion violence medical training. The bottom line we're facing impending shortage physicians adequately trained willing procedures, said Dr. John Choate, chairman New York State division American College Obstetricians Gynecologists. But lack training programs also result political pressures hospitals universities antagonists abortion climate fear. Physicians tend lie low, Choate said. They publicize fact them. If them, quietly fear practice lives. One development horizon expected change outlook abortions substantially final federal approval, expected next year, RU-486 pill, drug ends early pregnancy need surgery. When pill introduced France Edinburgh, Scotland, Hausknecht said, number surgical abortions plummeted. In July 1988, Randall Terry drove night home Binghamton, N.Y., Atlanta start series anti-abortion protests would finally put new hard-line group, Operation Rescue, America's front pages, James Charles Kopp van riding alongside him, according former leaders Operation Rescue spoke condition anonymity. And, people say, Terry arrested first day Operation Rescue's Siege Atlanta, Kopp followed jail. Along one hundred Operation Rescue members, according people there, Kopp remained jail 40 days adhered Terry's orders give real name police courts. After release, Kopp returned Operation Rescue's Binghamton headquarters, working alongside Terry group's power influence anti-abortion movement surged late 1988 1989, according former leaders Operation Rescue. Now, Kopp sought federal local law enforcement authorities questioning material witness murder obstetrician performed abortions Buffalo region. The authorities also say may information help solve four sniper attacks doctors performed abortions Canada upstate New York. Some abortion-rights groups seizing Kopp's role Operation Rescue raise new questions connections recent anti-abortion violence hard-line anti-abortion protest groups burst national scene late 1980s. For years, Federal Bureau Investigation Justice Department looked vain evidence determine whether national conspiracy might series clinic bombings shootings doctors clinic staff members began early 1990s. A federal grand jury Alexandria, Va., looked conspiracy allegations ultimately disbanded finding national underground. But federal law enforcement officials say hope Kopp may help provide link. In fact, announcement law enforcement officials looking made Attorney General Janet Reno prepared revive interagency task force look possible conspiracies anti-abortion crimes. Federal law enforcement officials authorities say Kopp suspect sniper attack Oct. 23 killed Dr. Barnett A. Slepian Buffalo. But say Kopp's car seen Slepian's home Amherst, N.Y. weeks doctor shot. One day issuing warrant Kopp's arrest material witness, law enforcement officials least 10 agencies spanning United States Canadian border still located Kopp Thursday. But law enforcement officials said pursuing many tips, including 400 poured FBI's information line: (800) 281-1184. The police gone photographs abortion protesters clinic workers Buffalo country, also reviewing hundreds hours videotapes demonstrations search Kopp's face. At point, officials consider shooting Slepian connected three attacks Canada one Rochester doctors provide abortions. The five attacks, 1994, occurred weeks leading Nov. 11, Veterans Day  called Remembrance Day Canada  holiday become important anti-abortion activists. But attacks spread four years 3,000 miles, Vancouver, British Columbia, Buffalo. As case many early veterans Operation Rescue, Kopp transformed hard-core anti-abortion militant jail Atlanta 1988, according many people jail insisted anonymity. By outward appearances, Dorothy Hayes' life seems ordinary. She family live rambling old home shore Lake Ontario, every morning, gives husband, John, peck cheek goes work. She runs errands, suburban moms, spends much day taking care children. But one thing sets Mrs. Hayes apart neighbors. As devoted opponent abortion, 43-year-old mother nine regularly plays host series traveling speakers, priests protesters  many come Rochester intent spreading word abortion shutting clinics provide it. She one thousands people country loosely associated anti-abortion groups Lambs Christ opened homes Lambs' founder, Rev. Norman Weslin, itinerant demonstrators. While many  including Mrs. Hayes  disavow violent tactics, supporters abortion rights say people bear responsibility protesters help blockade clinics threaten doctors. These people provide Father Weslin food shelter comes town close clinics innocent, said Ann Glazier, director clinic defense Planned Parenthood Federation. It's credible say part extremist activity taking place clinics. They still guilty interfering women's access. But Mary Quinn, local organizer Lambs Christ also offers home protesters, sees matters differing light. Taking people act Christian charity, Mrs. Quinn said. `People travel country work taken us want lose stupid houses. We take people willing make sacrifice. Members Lambs Christ persistent figures protests Buffalo women's clinic Dr. Barnett Slepian worked shot death last month. Although suspect identified shooting several similar attacks New York Canada several years, officials looking question Vermont man whose car seen Dr. Slepian's home. That man, James Charles Kopp, participated abortion protests decade, house guest members Lambs Christ. While Mrs. Hayes says would never much obstruct clinic's door, given refuge qualms so. Weslin, leader Lambs Christ, one benefited Mrs. Hayes' hospitality, modern version generosity Christ Apostles knew well. He prides arrested 60 times protests front medical clinics. And throughout 1980s early '90s, active clinic rescues, protesters tried physically restrain patients trying enter clinics. Weslin stayed Mrs. Hayes' home once, beginning May 1996 first came speak local churches anti-abortion movement. But stay lasted several months, arrested Federal charges blocking access Rochester health clinic abortions performed. He later convicted served two half months prison. During protest clinic, several protesters locked homemade contraption called oven, made cement iron. It took police officers several hours lug device horse trailer carted off. At protest, one man glued head lock gate surrounding clinic, move protesters later said accident. Abortion opponents Mrs. Hayes Mrs. Quinn speak attending peaceful observances abortion clinics offering prayers unborn. They talk counseling women alternatives abortion Roman Catholic pregnancy centers, support anti-abortion candidates. But also say saw nothing wrong Weslin trying block access clinics. They describe activity peaceful resistance meant stop see murders. Weslin house guests Mrs. Hayes Mrs. Quinn come recommended friends members local Catholic churches, said, adding speakers local churches anti-abortion events. And although say would never take homes stranger wanted FBI, Kopp, concede sometimes know little guests. But Mrs. Hayes Mrs. Quinn say know lot Weslin. An Army veteran, leader anti-abortion movement 25 years, say, founded home unwed mothers. Mrs. Hayes said met him, obvious man peace tremendous devotion Blessed Mother basically recognized helpless lambs. Barbara Fredericks, another local abortion opponent developed ties Lambs Weslin came town, added priest epitomized man God. I knew I looked holy shoes simple coat mended 50 times, said. He humble, man higher purpose, trying people sacrifice prayer. opp also robust defenders people housed rode country protest protest. E. Kenny, 20, said parents housed Kopp St. Albans, Vt., home two years spoke local church 1988. During Kopp's stay, pleasure, Kenny said, always helping house. He nice guy, kind uncle us, Kenny said. He'd sit play video games us make us model planes wood. Like Weslin, Kopp consumed need fight abortion talked evils, Kenny said, adding Kopp gentle man wanted become Catholic priest. He always good mood, Kenny said. He never anything violent all. Both Kopp Weslin arrested repeatedly abortion protests. The men moved circles times found arrested events. Mrs. Quinn said Weslin told recent telephone conversation knew Kopp. Weslin could reached comment, clear two men encountered other. Both faced misdemeanor charges blocking Burlington, Vt., health clinic 1990 Kopp called mill. And spent time jail Atlanta 1988 clinic protest. Slepian's death abortion opponents Mrs. Hayes Mrs. Quinn worried, killing portrayed media membership groups Lambs Christ. For long time, felt voice desert heard, Mrs. Hayes said. And horrible tragedy doctor's death becoming face movement. We're saving lives, said. The FBI talked Mrs. Hayes, Kenny said agents spoken him. The Justice Department says Federal task force set week investigate killing Slepian looking evidence connecting anti-abortion violence various clinics. It's fair say investigating events, look connection individuals engaged criminal conduct, Myron Marlin, spokesman department, said. Many local Catholics associated Lambs Christ tried distance killing Slepian. They mailing literature saying killer represent movement. In addition, people associated Lambs offering possible explanations killing. Some say believe killer might someone overcome grief personal experience abortion. Others wondered whether shooter tried wound doctor scare prevent performing abortions. The Lambs also wonder whether abortionist opponents blamed shooting committed disgruntled patient. One idea gaining currency Lambs, prominently displayed Web site, suggests killing result plot abortion supporters discredit abortion opponents last week's elections. Mrs. Hayes says know truth. There wackos travel may front clinic drawn place, said. But know everyone shows turn person next tell belong there. Mrs. Fredericks said anyone would shoot doctor provides abortions someone snapped, perhaps importance situation. Members Lambs Christ opponents abortion Rochester wonder whether killing Slepian hinder efforts. When Weslin first arrived two years ago, brought new focus group done little counsel pregnant women set booths college campuses, said. In many cities, priest life coordinating leading rosary marches abortion, Mrs. Quinn said. But Father Weslin coming here, could finally come together feel something sacrificial group. Mrs. Hayes said felt first pull movement early 1980s, heard women speak choice regard abortion. Then saw Silent Scream, well-known anti-abortion film purports show footage abortion. What I saw end life, said. She began volunteer Catholic pregnancy center encouraged women kill child. She also began house unwed mothers went stand vigil local clinics abortions performed. Mrs. Hayes looked 3-month-old daughter, Bernadette, pointed prenatal image infant, sonogram taken 13 weeks keeps refrigerator door. She described could baby's fate, someone else's child. Two pounds two inches ago, could partial-birth abortion, Mrs. Hayes said, referring controversial late-term abortion procedure. They hardest time getting shoulders out, get head puncture it. It's brutal, expect purpose dead baby? There's question doctors trying murder child. \n","\n","\n","\n","James Kopp, man FBI seeking material witness sniper slaying Dr. Barnett Slepian, known abortion right leader aggressive anti-abortion protester, law enforcement official say arrested several time demonstration abortion clinic.

At clinic Main Street, north downtown Buffalo, odd sense community. Local protester greet Dick, security guard, name. They sometimes see enemy abortion-rights volunteer escort patient clinic supermarket soccer field. Robert Behn, one protest leader, spent two hour talking abortion breakfast last year Slepian. And several said cried heard Slepian's death. Most protester, including Mrs. Lotempio, thousand people arrested 1992, height anti-abortion activity Buffalo. But Operation Rescue return, planned, Spring Life reunion April, Mrs. Lotempio said, there. Instead, plan stay church pray, avoid militancy say find uncomfortable. Glenn Murray, lawyer Womenservices clinic, said: When people town show up, feel danger. The local people known quantity. We know local people name. Buffalo handful hot spot abortion protester last decade. It heavily Catholic city thousand protester country demonstrated two week 1992. They failed close abortion clinic, 500 people arrested rally snarled traffic drew national headline. Those rally, well earlier protest continuing sidewalk vigil, impact, people side abortion issue say. The number clinic performing abortion Buffalo area dropped one three. And Slepian's death retirement week another doctor, two doctor area abortion form significant part practice. The daily demonstrator count progress. But perch clinic mean witness far believe murder call rescue. About 30 woman day might go clinic. After eight year, Mrs. Lotempio count eight woman changed mind get abortion clinic. Inside clinic, protest make hard job harder, many clinic worker say. While demonstrator simply repeat rosary, protester call patient drive parking lot building, walk fortresslike front. They ask question Do know baby look like? Is boy girl? Sometimes accuse people murder torture sin, threaten damnation. Federal law bar protester coming 15 foot clinic entrance, leaning sign wall. Some push limit, frustrating clinic worker guard. The rule protect people physical harassment, distance, turn could quiet conversation catcall taunt. When patient go clinic, protester take different persona, said Melinda DuBois, director Buffalo clinic. They scream yell call u name. They lie. Some day we're immune it, day much. Linda Palm, 51, marching clinic Friday, said identified clinic patient. When 23, said, struggled difficulty unmarried pregnant herself, decided child, married father. She began protesting 1990, attending abortion protest march Albany. While veteran civic leader devote Wednesday's national holiday honoring fallen soldier, Remembrance Day become chilling vigil Canadians front line abortion-rights movement. There immediate fear, anti-abortion gunman believed large. And long-term anxiety, country abortion legal publicly funded, woman may find access diminishing. There speculation sniper's timing linked Remembrance Day anti-abortion activist use day commemorate aborted fetus. Three time 1994, sniper used time year fire home Canadian doctor performs abortion, time wounding target. The attack spread Canada Ontario, Manitoba British Columbia. US. Canadian investigator believe attack linked two shooting abortion-providing doctor upstate New York, including Oct. 23 slaying Dr. Barnett Slepian home Buffalo. An American anti-abortion activist, James Kopp, wanted questioning shooting. Police say know side border on, fueling uneasiness clinic hospital throughout Canada. You must realize Canada largest undefended border world, said Keith McCaskill, police inspector Winnipeg, Manitoba, spokesman investigation. Many women's clinic tightened security, doctor provide abortion urged take precaution. I would suggest extremely aware day-to-day going on, whether business day hour, said Toronto Detective Rick Stubbings. Across Canada, report obstetrician-gynecologists modifying practice deciding stop performing abortion. Some wear bulletproof vest hang sheet window home. Abortion-rights group say doctor backing down. There's great deal sadness, said Susan Fox, director clinic Edmonton, Alberta, provides abortion. But there's also feeling determination deterred scared action. Marilyn Wilson, executive director Canadian Abortion Rights Action League, see long-term threat fear violence may intimidate young doctor entering field. There almost doctor stopped performing procedure, current reign terror, said. But young doctor family necessarily want this. They may willing put life risk. The abortion debate one several factor contributing shortage obstetrician-gynecologists Canada. The national society oversees speciality say 1,400 doctor field, shortfall 600, 50 60. The society say long hour limit fee paid public health-care system causing burnout deterring medical school graduate choose specialty. Another problem Canadian medical school offer training abortion. Women Canada's big city generally adequate access abortion. Those rural area face long journey, province Prince Edward Island prohibits abortion six hospital, forcing woman travel New Brunswick Nova Scotia. Abortion-rights group say situation would improve RU-486 abortion pill available Canada. No drug company applied permission market pill, either fearing boycott doubting profitability. The government urged make public appeal drug company, health department say can't done. It would conflict interest, said Bonnie Fox-McIntyre, department spokeswoman. As regulator stay arm's length, judge application impartially. Abortion illegal Canada 1988. Now abortion law sort, 100,000 abortion performed annually, poll indicate roughly three-quarters Canadians favor pro-choice policy. Yet public support spare doctor fear. Dr. Henry Morgentaler, led effort overturn old abortion law whose Toronto clinic bombed 1993, say colleague sacrificing personal freedom reluctantly increase security measure. Unfortunately, doctor committed providing service accept certain diminishment enjoyment life, said. In aftermath last month's deadly sniper attack obstetrician upstate New York, Attorney General Janet Reno announced last week setting new investigative unit examine possibility doctor victim broader anti-abortion plot. The unit, National Clinic Violence Task Force, include dozen Justice Department lawyer involve several law-enforcement agency. But main work looking shooting Dr. Barnett Slepian suburban Buffalo home fit larger pattern organized violence done FBI, jurisdiction domestic terrorism. For many FBI, that's problem. In contrast old image gung-ho FBI agent turning surveillance machinery political group, number senior FBI agent privately expressed misgiving attorney general's latest task force, second ordered begin broad investigation conspiracy involving anti-abortion violence. FBI official fear expanding investigation could drive agency ill-defined boundary separate inquiry criminal activity political cause unpopular idea. Today's agent eager disassociate old J. Edgar Hoover day trampling civil right political dissident guise serious investigation. They want agency drawn middle bitter ideological war anti-abortion group abortion right advocate, long asserted existence organized campaign clinic doctor. Many calling government help subject FBI interest anti-war civil right activist. Senior agency official, including Director Louis Freeh, starting career early 1970s watched dismay FBI shaken revelation Cointelpro, counterintelligence program allowed agent spy on, burgle, wiretap infiltrate anti-war civil right group Students Democratic Society Student Nonviolence Coordinating Committee. Some official dubious conspiracy exists kill doctor perform abortion. They came empty handed Reno ordered first federal inquiry 1994 killing Florida doctor bodyguard. The Justice Department conducted two-year grand jury investigation; agent pursued anti-abortion activist using surveillance team. But investigator never found specific plot abortion clinic staff member. Violence abortion clinic part problem. The FBI recent year found thrown minefield politically tinged case involving volatile world anti-government militia, environmental Christian extremist, white separatist, animal right activist Islamic fundamentalist. The FBI quick jump investigating crime investigating political association, said David Cole, law professor Georgetown University. When move investigating crime investigating group, all-important nexus criminal conduct get lost, focus get broader broader start sweeping kind lawful political activity. In response terrorist attack bombing World Trade Center 1993, Oklahoma City federal building 1995 Olympic park Atlanta 1996, agency increased effort deter incident major prevention program. In case, Justice Department, FBI law enforcement agency said operate domestic security guideline require investigator find reasonable indication group planning break law open inquiry organization. Before authority use intrusive tactic wiretapping property search, must specific evidence. Yet FBI agent throughout country quietly evaluated threat posed variety extremist group link local authority informal interview leader group. Their conclusion group pose little real danger. Much difficult investigate lone terrorist inflamed oratory extremist ideology belong group, drifting society's frayed margin, grid, agent describe it, usual tie family, friend work. The profile fit Eric Robert Rudolph, fugitive wanted bombing Atlanta Olympics, gay nightclub two abortion clinic. He kept belief mostly himself, although acquaintance hint familiar religious extremism hate group. In contrast, James Charles Kopp, sought material witness killing Slepian, left trail clue motif. He early follower Randall Terry, leader Operation Rescue. Later, Kopp associated Lambs Christ, another militant anti-abortion group. One law-enforcement official said government best. We investigate violation, said. We investigate group. Everyone knew Dr. Barnett Slepian knew slight, graying physician endured measure stress would exhaust, break, people. There stranger pawed garbage can home growled murderer passed grocery store aisle. Demonstrators assailed pregnant patient arrived office checkup, calling baby killer. Outside clinic performed abortion two day week, picket shouted epithet pig face. Slepian, obstetrician gynecologist training abortion doctor principle, rarely acknowledged strain. He might crack occasional joke expense protester shadowed work weekend. Then would something unexpected, invite anti-abortion leader breakfast stop chat familiar demonstrator clinic. So killed Oct. 23 sniper's bullet fired kitchen window home Buffalo, N.Y., suburb, furtive execution fit pattern four earlier attack abortion provider western New York state Canada, friend relative wondered much Slepian's work could arouse murderous violence. He predicted much himself. Instead, wondered, again, persisted work, long Buffalo doctor surrendered pressure abortion opponent. He incredibly fatalistic person thought number's up, up, nothing it, said H. Amanda Robb, doctor's 32-year-old niece. And incredibly stubborn. He said woman right comprehensive health care women's doctor, going provide them. Slepian third doctor killed last five year bombing shooting killed 7 people wounded 17 abortion clinic nation. To tormentor, simply abortion doctor. To member abortion right movement, martyr cause. But Slepian far either. In interview friend family member, emerges one-dimensional abstract conservative advocated old-fashioned value self-reliance, shy man rare flash anger, doctor performed abortion patience woman multiple abortion woman multiple child want could support. He killed performed medical procedure become emotional politicized. Yet nothing life suggest crusader either politics medicine. Rather, obstinate, unassuming man remarkable thing. Out contrariness conscience, say knew him, refused allow anyone dictate kind doctor be, that, paid life. The clue Slepian's flinty brand commitment lie, part, upbringing. His family took success granted teetered edge poverty. To earn money medical school, shoveled muck ranch drove taxi. He made friend, friend life. When wife sick, called repeatedly. When lonely, flew side. Slepian, known Bart, used tell people chose obstetrics specialty expose doctor least suffering, performed abortion legal alternative much worse. Slepian expressed exasperation woman came abortion abortion. Don't get it? clinic staff recall saying once. He impatience woman remembered residency inner-city Buffalo, child child mean support. He contempt somebody pulled bootstrap made world, Ms. Robb said. He believed ban abortion or, shameful view, stop teaching young doctor perform them, would correct human imperfection found irritating. There 1.5 million abortion performed country, niece said, felt we're equipped handle 1.5 million unwanted child. When killed, age 52, Bart Slepian owned imposing red brick home quiet suburb Amherst, complete swimming pool piped-in music assortment time-saving gadget adored. Slepian's trajectory comfortable doctor's life unconventional. His grandfather, Russian Jewish immigrant started selling shoelace pushcart Boston, propelled five son Harvard time Jews met university's blue-blood standard. His father, turn, decreed three son would doctor earn PhD's. We grew home tremendous, tremendous, tremendous respect education, said Serena Robb, Slepian's sister, four year older him. If got A, OK If got B, got yelled at. The family's mean match expectation. Slepian's father, Philip, joined father's business manufacturing leather sol shoe. Soon Bart born 1946 Boston, company failed, money, father moved family six in-laws' apartment McKeesport, Pa., Rochester, NY. Once settled, Slepian's father set freelance writer, crisscrossing country old Studebaker, researching origin prominent citizen Library Congress writing story small-town newspaper. He sold article hundred, still writing death nine year ago age 93. The success expected Bart Slepian come easily. As child, shy cried anyone looked him, sister recalled. An unexceptional student, went local community college transferring University Denver, majored zoology. Rejected medical school United States fate two three applicant late 1960s studied one year Belgium enrolled Autonomous University Medicine Guadalajara, Mexico. His friend remember funny obstinate, thin young man glass receding hairline beat comer arm-wrestling pool. Bart certain belief, strongly held, said Richard Schwarz, old classmate internist Long Island. He always said sit whining thing, Schwarz said. He would say, `Go what's what's right.' Bart Slepian's determination surfaced quirky way. He insisted going top World Trade Center, crippling fear height. To get window, crawled, inch inch. I said, `You this,' recalled Schwarz, time. And said, `I want it.' Bart made count. He felt alive. Forced drop school every semester work, lived Reno sister Serena, widow struggling take care two young daughter. She worked waitress blackjack dealer, sharing tip drove cab, cleaned barn ranch worked laboratory assistant local Veterans Administration hospital. After graduation, moved Buffalo medical residency. There married Lynne Breitbart, registered nurse 10 year junior, scraped together money buy obstetrics practice doctor retire. He soothing, unhurried manner. When patient his, Patti Durlak, diagnosed diabetes, Slepian referred specialist called every day month help overcome fear needle use insulin injection. The doctor said, `Just deal it,' Mrs. Durlak recalled. Not Dr. Slepian. In way, typical suburban family man, working six day week spending free time Little League game county fair four son. But late 1980s, abortion doctor Buffalo siege. In one notorious 1991 incident recorded videotape, Rev. Paul Schenck, one fieriest Buffalo's anti-abortion leader, threw front doctor's car pulled clinic driveway. Slepian parked street. As pushed way crowd chanting demonstrator, Schenck cupped hand mouth lunged, shouting, Slepian, pig! Slepian's attempt separate abortion conflict private life futile. The protest followed home man bashful boy found himself, uncomfortably, center controversy attention. Once, showed anger. In 1988, demonstrator jeered sidewalk front home opened Hanukkah present child, doctor came brandishing baseball bat. He denied hurt anyone, town judge ordered repair one protester's smashed van window pay portion another's medical bill. The outburst surprised family friend. It Slepian's style make public fuss, much le acknowledge stress taunted protester. Stress? oldest brother Paul responded gruffly asked doctor's mood. I never heard word used family, engineering term. He said nuisance. Mrs. Slepian respond request interview. She expressed rage The Buffalo News shortly shooting. She said whoever killed husband deserved death penalty would happy administer lethal injection herself. She also spoke Schenck's brother, Robert, another anti-abortion leader frequently confronted Slepian, sent bouquet flower. Mrs. Slepian denounced hypocrite. After confrontation 1988, Slepian turned civil harassment lawsuit, letter levity deal protester. In 1993, man active anti-abortion effort arrested rifling doctor's garbage can home, Slepian tried treat incident lightly. They hopefully got bag full dirty diaper, joked. He tried engage critic local newspaper. He told The Buffalo News abortion protester turn energy helping woman avoid unwanted pregnancy birth control counseling. In letter editor warned repeatedly calling murderer, critic inciting violence. Slepian accepted opponent abortion acted moral conviction, friend said, resented personal attack. He thought tended demonize dehumanize increased danger, said lawyer, Glenn Edward Murray. So Slepian took step nation's beleaguered abortion clinic doctor dared. He insisted tried hard enough, might cut venom. To dismay staff member feared safety, Slepian began year ago stop chat protester recognized Womenservices abortion clinic Buffalo, worked two day week. He surprised gathering protester preparing euphemistically called house call, demonstration doctor's home, invited protest's organizer, Rev. Robert Behn, breakfast. Their hourlong conversation next morning inconclusive, Behn said, dismissing Slepian's gesture attempt get people him. He asked Slepian performing abortion affected spiritually. In response, recalled, doctor said, I'm fine spiritually. Slepian, meanwhile, focused time away home family. He planned take cruise next spring. He bought time-share apartment Disney World Florida. He many plan, said Ellen Fink, close friend couple 15 year. He done. He done living yet. Still, sometimes casual conversation, shadow would appear. When wife gave gray African parrot birthday gift, Slepian joked bird would probably outlive would teach eulogy. He would talk funeral wanted, Mrs. Fink said. He said lot friend wanted come separate car, one car, he'd long procession. In week death, Slepian reason preoccupied thought mortality. A medical checkup revealed blockage heart, Mrs. Fink said, recounting conversation Mrs. Slepian day slaying. A blockage sign probable coronary artery disease. He test week. I said, `Lynne, relax, going OK,' Mrs. Fink recalled. That day, National Abortion Federation sent fax Womenservices clinic warning pattern sniper attack abortion doctor occurred early November. Marilynne Buckham, clinic director, sent Slepian. He definitely took seriously, recalled. Typically, doctor share concern might felt. It normal day, said Tammi Latini, office assistant. We horsing around.' That evening, Slepians went synagogue mark ninth anniversary death Slepian's father. Shortly returned home, sniper's bullet smashed kitchen window, killing Slepian chatted wife son. The protester returned clinic five day later, first day reopened. Mrs. Buckham, director, said Slepian would surprised. They routine. So he. He never wanted day end bad note, said. At end day, I would always say, `Thank coming.' And would always turn stupid grin say, `Thanks me.' The slaying Dr. Barnett Slepian home last week eliminated mainstay abortion clinic here, eliminated women's access abortion. That availability abortion Buffalo area, much United States, complex reality, one affected class education, medical training personal conviction individual doctor. Knowledgeable middle-class affluent woman find unwanted pregnancy obtain abortion private gynecologist, gynecologist personal objection procedure, referral colleague. Women poor, young uneducated regular relationship doctor rely specialized clinic one Slepian worked in, hospital. It group unplanned pregnancy far common prosperous woman face shrinking universe possibility result fear set Slepian's killing slaying five doctor clinic worker 1993, medical expert said. If well well connected, get abortion, said Dr. Stephen Wear, co-director center clinical ethic University Buffalo, train doctor Buffalo area's hospital. For everybody else, le le available. The number abortion United States declining steadily first year Supreme Court's Roe v. Wade decision legalized abortion 1973, according Alan Guttmacher Institute, study reproductive issue. They number roughly 1.5 million year, according report Guttmacher, 1.4 million, according National Right Life Committee, nation's largest anti-abortion group, calculates estimate partly Guttmacher figure. The number provider identify performing abortion part practice diminishing well. A 1994 Guttmacher study, last one published, found number decreased 18 percent 1982 1992, 2,380 2,908. Moreover, study said, 12 percent nation's residency program routinely offer training abortion first trimester, though many offer elective course. Laura Echevarria, director medium relation National Right Life Committee, contends, however, teaching hospital train gynecologist procedure treating miscarriage similar used performing abortion. Only cosmopolitan comparatively liberal city New York availability abortion continue steady level, expert say, though locale concern decreasing number young doctor emerge residency fully trained performing abortion. The Guttmacher Institute, keep nation's precise statistic, said 1992, last year figure, 142,410 abortion New York done 151 provider, including 61 hospital 44 clinic. Still, provider figure greatly understates number private doctor perform office, medical expert say. Many obstetrician gynecologist Manhattan provide abortion part palette service, many year, said Dr. Richard Hausknecht, medical director Planned Parenthood. Rich middle-class woman always access abortion, always will. The major threat availability city le result anti-abortion violence medical training. The bottom line we're facing impending shortage physician adequately trained willing procedure, said Dr. John Choate, chairman New York State division American College Obstetricians Gynecologists. But lack training program also result political pressure hospital university antagonist abortion climate fear. Physicians tend lie low, Choate said. They publicize fact them. If them, quietly fear practice life. One development horizon expected change outlook abortion substantially final federal approval, expected next year, RU-486 pill, drug end early pregnancy need surgery. When pill introduced France Edinburgh, Scotland, Hausknecht said, number surgical abortion plummeted. In July 1988, Randall Terry drove night home Binghamton, N.Y., Atlanta start series anti-abortion protest would finally put new hard-line group, Operation Rescue, America's front page, James Charles Kopp van riding alongside him, according former leader Operation Rescue spoke condition anonymity. And, people say, Terry arrested first day Operation Rescue's Siege Atlanta, Kopp followed jail. Along one hundred Operation Rescue member, according people there, Kopp remained jail 40 day adhered Terry's order give real name police court. After release, Kopp returned Operation Rescue's Binghamton headquarters, working alongside Terry group's power influence anti-abortion movement surged late 1988 1989, according former leader Operation Rescue. Now, Kopp sought federal local law enforcement authority questioning material witness murder obstetrician performed abortion Buffalo region. The authority also say may information help solve four sniper attack doctor performed abortion Canada upstate New York. Some abortion-rights group seizing Kopp's role Operation Rescue raise new question connection recent anti-abortion violence hard-line anti-abortion protest group burst national scene late 1980s. For year, Federal Bureau Investigation Justice Department looked vain evidence determine whether national conspiracy might series clinic bombing shooting doctor clinic staff member began early 1990s. A federal grand jury Alexandria, Va., looked conspiracy allegation ultimately disbanded finding national underground. But federal law enforcement official say hope Kopp may help provide link. In fact, announcement law enforcement official looking made Attorney General Janet Reno prepared revive interagency task force look possible conspiracy anti-abortion crime. Federal law enforcement official authority say Kopp suspect sniper attack Oct. 23 killed Dr. Barnett A. Slepian Buffalo. But say Kopp's car seen Slepian's home Amherst, NY. week doctor shot. One day issuing warrant Kopp's arrest material witness, law enforcement official least 10 agency spanning United States Canadian border still located Kopp Thursday. But law enforcement official said pursuing many tip, including 400 poured FBI's information line: (800) 281-1184. The police gone photograph abortion protester clinic worker Buffalo country, also reviewing hundred hour videotape demonstration search Kopp's face. At point, official consider shooting Slepian connected three attack Canada one Rochester doctor provide abortion. The five attack, 1994, occurred week leading Nov. 11, Veterans Day called Remembrance Day Canada holiday become important anti-abortion activist. But attack spread four year 3,000 mile, Vancouver, British Columbia, Buffalo. As case many early veteran Operation Rescue, Kopp transformed hard-core anti-abortion militant jail Atlanta 1988, according many people jail insisted anonymity. By outward appearance, Dorothy Hayes' life seems ordinary. She family live rambling old home shore Lake Ontario, every morning, give husband, John, peck cheek go work. She run errand, suburban mom, spends much day taking care child. But one thing set Mrs. Hayes apart neighbor. As devoted opponent abortion, 43-year-old mother nine regularly play host series traveling speaker, priest protester many come Rochester intent spreading word abortion shutting clinic provide it. She one thousand people country loosely associated anti-abortion group Lambs Christ opened home Lambs' founder, Rev. Norman Weslin, itinerant demonstrator. While many including Mrs. Hayes disavow violent tactic, supporter abortion right say people bear responsibility protester help blockade clinic threaten doctor. These people provide Father Weslin food shelter come town close clinic innocent, said Ann Glazier, director clinic defense Planned Parenthood Federation. It's credible say part extremist activity taking place clinic. They still guilty interfering women's access. But Mary Quinn, local organizer Lambs Christ also offer home protester, see matter differing light. Taking people act Christian charity, Mrs. Quinn said. `People travel country work taken u want lose stupid house. We take people willing make sacrifice. Members Lambs Christ persistent figure protest Buffalo women's clinic Dr. Barnett Slepian worked shot death last month. Although suspect identified shooting several similar attack New York Canada several year, official looking question Vermont man whose car seen Dr. Slepian's home. That man, James Charles Kopp, participated abortion protest decade, house guest member Lambs Christ. While Mrs. Hayes say would never much obstruct clinic's door, given refuge qualm so. Weslin, leader Lambs Christ, one benefited Mrs. Hayes' hospitality, modern version generosity Christ Apostles knew well. He pride arrested 60 time protest front medical clinic. And throughout 1980s early '90s, active clinic rescue, protester tried physically restrain patient trying enter clinic. Weslin stayed Mrs. Hayes' home once, beginning May 1996 first came speak local church anti-abortion movement. But stay lasted several month, arrested Federal charge blocking access Rochester health clinic abortion performed. He later convicted served two half month prison. During protest clinic, several protester locked homemade contraption called oven, made cement iron. It took police officer several hour lug device horse trailer carted off. At protest, one man glued head lock gate surrounding clinic, move protester later said accident. Abortion opponent Mrs. Hayes Mrs. Quinn speak attending peaceful observance abortion clinic offering prayer unborn. They talk counseling woman alternative abortion Roman Catholic pregnancy center, support anti-abortion candidate. But also say saw nothing wrong Weslin trying block access clinic. They describe activity peaceful resistance meant stop see murder. Weslin house guest Mrs. Hayes Mrs. Quinn come recommended friend member local Catholic church, said, adding speaker local church anti-abortion event. And although say would never take home stranger wanted FBI, Kopp, concede sometimes know little guest. But Mrs. Hayes Mrs. Quinn say know lot Weslin. An Army veteran, leader anti-abortion movement 25 year, say, founded home unwed mother. Mrs. Hayes said met him, obvious man peace tremendous devotion Blessed Mother basically recognized helpless lamb. Barbara Fredericks, another local abortion opponent developed tie Lambs Weslin came town, added priest epitomized man God. I knew I looked holy shoe simple coat mended 50 time, said. He humble, man higher purpose, trying people sacrifice prayer. opp also robust defender people housed rode country protest protest. E. Kenny, 20, said parent housed Kopp St. Albans, Vt., home two year spoke local church 1988. During Kopp's stay, pleasure, Kenny said, always helping house. He nice guy, kind uncle u, Kenny said. He'd sit play video game u make u model plane wood. Like Weslin, Kopp consumed need fight abortion talked evil, Kenny said, adding Kopp gentle man wanted become Catholic priest. He always good mood, Kenny said. He never anything violent all. Both Kopp Weslin arrested repeatedly abortion protest. The men moved circle time found arrested event. Mrs. Quinn said Weslin told recent telephone conversation knew Kopp. Weslin could reached comment, clear two men encountered other. Both faced misdemeanor charge blocking Burlington, Vt., health clinic 1990 Kopp called mill. And spent time jail Atlanta 1988 clinic protest. Slepian's death abortion opponent Mrs. Hayes Mrs. Quinn worried, killing portrayed medium membership group Lambs Christ. For long time, felt voice desert heard, Mrs. Hayes said. And horrible tragedy doctor's death becoming face movement. We're saving life, said. The FBI talked Mrs. Hayes, Kenny said agent spoken him. The Justice Department say Federal task force set week investigate killing Slepian looking evidence connecting anti-abortion violence various clinic. It's fair say investigating event, look connection individual engaged criminal conduct, Myron Marlin, spokesman department, said. Many local Catholics associated Lambs Christ tried distance killing Slepian. They mailing literature saying killer represent movement. In addition, people associated Lambs offering possible explanation killing. Some say believe killer might someone overcome grief personal experience abortion. Others wondered whether shooter tried wound doctor scare prevent performing abortion. The Lambs also wonder whether abortionist opponent blamed shooting committed disgruntled patient. One idea gaining currency Lambs, prominently displayed Web site, suggests killing result plot abortion supporter discredit abortion opponent last week's election. Mrs. Hayes say know truth. There wacko travel may front clinic drawn place, said. But know everyone show turn person next tell belong there. Mrs. Fredericks said anyone would shoot doctor provides abortion someone snapped, perhaps importance situation. Members Lambs Christ opponent abortion Rochester wonder whether killing Slepian hinder effort. When Weslin first arrived two year ago, brought new focus group done little counsel pregnant woman set booth college campus, said. In many city, priest life coordinating leading rosary march abortion, Mrs. Quinn said. But Father Weslin coming here, could finally come together feel something sacrificial group. Mrs. Hayes said felt first pull movement early 1980s, heard woman speak choice regard abortion. Then saw Silent Scream, well-known anti-abortion film purport show footage abortion. What I saw end life, said. She began volunteer Catholic pregnancy center encouraged woman kill child. She also began house unwed mother went stand vigil local clinic abortion performed. Mrs. Hayes looked 3-month-old daughter, Bernadette, pointed prenatal image infant, sonogram taken 13 week keep refrigerator door. She described could baby's fate, someone else's child. Two pound two inch ago, could partial-birth abortion, Mrs. Hayes said, referring controversial late-term abortion procedure. They hardest time getting shoulder out, get head puncture it. It's brutal, expect purpose dead baby? There's question doctor trying murder child. \n","A fire turned Swedish dance hall jammed teen-age Halloween revelers deathtrap, killing least 60 people injuring 180.

But Strawberry, still hopeful returning play 1999, sounded confident 1998 Yankees, wearing number 39 back caps inspiration. They look really good, said Strawberry. It's going easy, I think they're ready. The best thing making World Series know go anywhere else that. You've made point go best do. That's about. As Bernie Williams starts could final series Yankees Game 1 World Series Yankee Stadium Saturday night, wants free mind. Free worrying extremely uncertain future undisclosed personal matter made post-season perplexing pleasing. But easy keep mind uncluttered. Williams know sign Yankees return center field next season, wants test free agency. There good chance Yankees offer lavish contract, Williams might forced decide fattest paycheck new situation baseball city choice pretty fat paycheck familiar situation Bronx. Scott Boras, Williams' agent, compared client players $10 million-a-year bracket last season, price tag surely escalated Williams American League batting title .339 average drilling 26 homers knocking 97 runs. Williams asked agreed theory teams outbid Yankees. I know, said Williams, aloof post-season, declined discuss why. And I'm thinking little I would to. I would keep focus series. It issue Williams Yankees wants study Saturday coming days, team four victories away championship. Still, issue hovers Yankees ominously owner George Steinbrenner hovers general manager Brian Cashman. It's tough thing, Cashman said balancing excitement World Series reality trying re-sign Williams. You know ugliness future right front you. Although Williams adamant discussing future, relented slightly Friday. When reporter asked reasons would staying Yankees, Williams' answer included escape clause. Just fact I've whole career, Williams said. That lot it. The relationships I've come know years, I think would hard, impossible, start scratch somewhere else. Williams continued: But I think reality game day age things happen. You can't really write things stone they're going happen. People get traded. People become free agents go teams. I make decision really thinking people I'm accountable for. When Williams asked better situation could player center fielder Yankees, winning batting crown World Series, 30-year-old stumped. Wow, that's pretty good right there, Williams said. It's funny mention that, I really thought that. I think, point season, I going sit think, wow, bad year all. While Cashman would discuss financial matters, another Yankee official said team offer Williams much $12 million year  unless Steinbrenner gets generous possible championship. It likely Yanks would offer Williams $10 million-a-year range. I'd hate speculate something point, Cashman said. We'll give best effort sign level we're comfortable with. Hopefully, enough. Then we'll marriage. If not, we'll divorce. While Williams earned right become free agent pursue contract wants city wants, interesting choices make. When reporter asked Williams would respond someone suggested accept less Yankees remain city popular, likes teammates manager, team post-season four straight years, hesitate answer. My response would time right start thinking that, Williams said. If I start thinking that, it'll distract I need World Series. Williams talked Yankees end remarkable season want situation disrupt that. But, Williams' status uncertain, asked next four seven games would bittersweet, could ending 13-year association Yankees. I want talk that, Williams said. I'm going lot fun there. I'm going go out. Then Williams walked away interview. The New York Times said editorial Saturday, Oct. 17: It fitting memorable baseball seasons conclude World Series opens Saturday night Yankee Stadium, aging still grand cathedral sport. Bedecked bunting banners, revered ballpark always elevates game aura history accomplishment. That makes perfect venue part championship series determine whether 1998 Yankees one greatest teams modern era, talented squad owned regular season folded World Series. New Yorkers boisterous, boastful bunch, patter city week loud arrogant, must seem anyone venturing San Diego root Padres. The word sidewalks subways Padres measure Yankees. Sure, lethal starting pitchers Kevin Brown Andy Ashby, one game's best closers Trevor Hoffman, mention prolific hitters Tony Gwynn Greg Vaughn, hobbling still dangerous. But match Yankees' World Series starting rotation David Wells, Orlando Hernandez, David Cone Andy Pettitte, bullpen flamethrower Mariano Rivera, deepest batting order baseball? Yet truth Yankees fans terrified team crumple. Baseball fans, Yankee fans, spend lifetime waiting see home team historic caliber, Yankee team reach sanctified status unless ends record-setting season winning World Series. The doubts keep creeping up. The team pitiful plate playoffs. Tino Martinez, top run producer, numbing slump. Bernie Williams, American League batting champ, hit well pennant series Cleveland Indians, seemed distracted personal matters. Shane Spencer, rookie slugging sensation September, turned new Mr. October. Pettitte struggling August. The curious thing team, games regular season team American League history, quiet unobtrusive be. It sports dominant superstar, swaggering clubhouse leader, one seems belong New York. So Yankees start drift field, fans tend fear team might simply fade away. Until Indians surged temporarily ahead playoffs, Yankees faced serious test resiliency season. New Yorkers already taste ticker-tape parade Broadway. But every mighty cheer stadium Saturday night lurk fear curtain falls season, unheralded unlegendary team San Diego one remembered. The last time seen field Yankee Stadium, inadvertently influencing outcome game sent Cleveland Indians home Yankees World Series. That's say umpires mess World Series, shown eminently capable interfering natural progression postseason games. All right, Ted Hendry World Series; umpires' collective bargaining agreement leagues allow umpire work league championship series World Series. Joe Brinkman either, though agreement allow umpire work division series World Series. The three American League umpires six-man World Series crew work first playoffs. One them, Richie Garcia, crew chief plate Saturday night's opener Yankee Stadium. Gene Budig, AL president, Friday called Garcia, 24-year veteran, one league's respected umpires. But Saturday night, Garcia move right field Sunday night Game 2. Now combination sound familiar, Richie Garcia right field? Ah yes, last time Garcia worked post-season series Yankee Stadium, umpire Game 1 league championship series two years ago young fan New Jersey  name, please; over-glorified enough  reached fence caught Derek Jeter's fly ball Tony Tarasco, Baltimore's right fielder, prepared catch it. Garcia ruled interference, home run, said oops watching television replay clearly showing interference. Too late. The call helped Yankees win first game set tone series. Even though made mistake, know best there, baseball official, speaking condition anonymity, said. That knowledge comes small consolation Orioles. Budig, too, acknowledged umpires, players managers, perfect. Major league umpires skilled do, human, said telephone interview. Day day good job Major League Baseball. Rounds one two difficult, happens time time. The umpires human American League playoffs happened time time time time. The Cleveland Indians suffered brunt fallibility umpires. We highlight reel umpires getting knocked baseballs, general manager John Hart said Indians' final game Yankees. The umpires lose game us, share controversies two playoff series umpires. In division series Boston, Brinkman, plate umpire, bad calls pitches plays plate immediately provoked disputes led ejecting Mike Hargrove, Indians' manager, three pitches Game 2, Dwight Gooden, starting pitcher, 19 pitches later. Hendry right wrong, depending one's point view, noncall interference Travis Fryman 12th inning Game 2 ALCS. That ruling went favor Indians. Little else did. In Game 4, Jeter stealing second fifth inning on-target throw Sandy Alomar Jr. hit Jim McKean, jumped try get way instead kicked ball right field. A batted ball, Omar Vizquel's line drive, struck Hendry Game 6. But worst call Game 6 Hendry's force play second base. Hendry called Bernie Williams safe, ruling Vizquel's foot came base caught ball. Members Yankees indicated Friday they, too, thought call wrong. I know, Williams said asked thought, I'll take it. It big play. But think out? I'd rather comment that, said. It stir lot controversy. I want get that. When player believes safe, says worry subsequent controversy. If Williams implying thought out, another member Yankees said doubt Williams out. I sure first, uniformed member team said, I saw Hendry, I said uh-oh. I also thought Omar smooth think come bag. Then I saw replay. He out. The game today faster used be, observer said. The umpires sharper. Maybe Garcia, Dale Scott Tim Tschida American League, Jerry Crawford, Dana DeMuth Mark Hirschbeck National League, sharp 18th century French guillotine four seven games. Leonard Coleman, NL president, said thought umpires first-rate division league series added three splendid umpires working World Series. Budig said: The World Series crew proven first-rate. We total confidence them. The umpires let players make errors managers bad decisions. Then everyone talk players managers umpires. A strong sign city going bonkers Padres came Friday morning 680 fans agreed shave heads radio promotion raffle return 1-in-680 chance skybox tickets post-season play. This show support team one ticket, said Tommy Sablan, producer Jeff Jer show. It symbolic efforts bald Padres  Tony Gwynn, Wally Joyner, Greg Vaughn, Jim Leyritz. About thousand people showed  men, women children. We 10 barbers 20 hairdressers took six hours lines either get buzzed straight-razored. We shocked turnout. But bandwagon town. `Buy ticket day concert' type public. You'll see bigger bandwagon Monday they've hopefully play Yankees real World Series. After Padres beat Braves, 3-0, Game 2 National League Championship Series Thursday night Atlanta take two-game lead four-of-seven-game series, San Diego fans began gearing shot World Series traditional ways. It would team's first World Series appearance 1984, downtown business district Friday, marquees banners read Go Padres lunch-hour rally attended several hundred fans. The Padres set attendance record 2,555,901 season, half-million last year nearly million half three years ago. It stemmed part effort John Moores, Padres owner, Larry Lucchino, team's president, put family entertainment park bought team December 1994. This diversified group fans I saw Atlanta, Lucchino said. Their crowd seemed yuppified. We're proud three generations families come games. Donna McMahon, 63-year-old homemaker La Jolla, fan 10 Pacific Coast League Padres played Lane Field harbor. She would take streetcar school meet father, would buy bleacher seats. Later, brought four children Jack Murphy Stadium National League Padres 2,500 people crowd. Now, brings grandchildren sold-out Qualcomm Stadium. There different groups stands, said, upper class, middle class, business person, beer-drinking fan, children, Mexican fans border. We true fans  us. San Diego Mayor Susan Golding agrees, also giving credit balmy weather. Padre fans cross-section county, said. Downtown, suburban, rural, east, north, ranchers farmers high-tech engineers, yuppies new kids  X generation. A lot border. The Padres extremely popular Tijuana. We perfect weather long baseball season. Playing World Series October got better New York. Carlos Carrion, born San Diego baseball fan 25 years, brings 10- 8-year-old sons stadium. This great chance let children see players work, Carrion said. They look guys understand character work ethic. The Padres ticket office estimates average, 15,000 fans 65,000-seat stadium Latin Americans San Diego, Baja California state Sonora. The Padres first major league baseball souvenir store Tijuana. A new shipment bats arrived Tino Martinez Friday, massaged handles make sure thin enough, knocked barrels listened certain sound swung slowly again. Martinez excited fresh bats, reacted Little Leaguer wielding aluminum bat first time. You saving World Series trees now, right? Martinez said representative bat company. These World Series trees, they? Martinez could joke bats specially designed World Series Yankees began quest second title three years play host San Diego Padres Game 1 Yankee Stadium Saturday night. Major leaguer players watching television could imitate David Letterman joke World Series wood. Even though Martinez struggled numerous bats post-season, could joke Yankees still alive title. Martinez still alive. For now, Martinez, power hitter mostly missing action, could joke around. For now. You always get fresh start post-season game game, said Martinez. If win, got another game next day forget bad at-bats. It's easier post-season next at-bat could biggest at-bat season. Normally, Martinez plate biggest at-bat season would pleasing sight Yankees. But calendar flips October. Martinez experienced another frustrating post-season. He 5 30 10 strikeouts, homers 1 run batted hitting-starved team batted .229 still winning 7 9 post-season games superior pitching. Can Yankees continue win Martinez, valuable run producer, sometime singles hitter? We've gotten two good series, said Paul O'Neill. The Yankees series. You focus one guy. You focus winning. The whole team won. As much Joe Torre talked Martinez needing one line-drive hit get groove, 30-year-old first baseman career drought post-season. Since joining Yankees, Martinez 20 107 (.187) one homer 4 RBI 29 post-season games. Those puny statistics, especially player driven 381 runs 455 regular season games last three years. I would guess Tino would great series, O'Neill said. Baseball way evening things out. You bad series, come back great series. In season, that's easier do. In post-season, gets tougher. It cannot get much tougher Martinez, dropped fifth sixth order American League Championship Series Cleveland Indians remain spot notice. Martinez blamed paucity production impatience trying much. He sometimes flailed poor pitches hitter's counts 3-1 2-0, instead working count, admitted previous failures post-season caused pursue obviously unattainable five-run homer. Actually, Martinez already made alterations, reached base 7 times last 10 plates appearances double, single, hit-by-pitch 4 walks. It enough pacify George Steinbrenner, something cling to. Until last night, anyway, Martinez face Kevin Brown, nasty right-hander retired 30 34 career at-bats. If I getting good pitches missing them, I'd say I bad swing working, said Martinez. But I've swinging bad pitches. Right now, I've got patient wait. The Yankees wait him. They to. In 1996 World Series, Torre started Cecil Fielder Martinez first Games 3, 4 5. It difficult decision Martinez paced team RBI Fielder join Yankees July 31. But Yankees grabbed three games worked. Torre attractive replacement season Luis Sojo. So Yankees stay Martinez, better worse, tries stay positive finally produce. It's World Series, said Martinez. You got go fun it. Big games big games. You want go enjoy game try best win game. You think might lose day. Chuck Knoblauch Tino Martinez popular squeegee men week ago, speculation rampant one or might exiled Yankees' historic year crumbled post-season. Two big hits midst big inning changed Saturday night Game 1 World Series. The Yankees trailed San Diego, 5-2, seventh inning, Knoblauch hit three-run home run tie score, five batters later, Martinez smashed grand slam. The seven-run explosion rocketed Yankees 9-6 victory opener four-of-seven-game series, 56,712 Yankee Stadium. Orlando Hernandez pitch Andy Ashby Game 2 Sunday night Stadium. Beyond seizing advantage series, Yankees able neutralize Padres' ace, Kevin Brown, driving mound seventh. Brown, seen many San Diego's best hope World Series upset, pitch Game 4, earliest. Brown pitching three-run lead top fifth, Tony Gwynn Greg Vaughn banged back-to-back homers. One seventh, however, Jorge Posada hit single, Brown walked Ricky Ledee. Brown, thrown whopping 64 pitches first three innings, went out, reliever Donne Wall came face Knoblauch. This Yankees done season, force starter game middle innings, exploiting middle reliever. Knoblauch, course, earned notoriety gaffe Game 2 American League Championship Series Cleveland, standing waiting interference call ball rolled stop decisive run scored. The Yankees came back win series, however; Knoblauch got reprieve talked much experience helped him. Facing Wall one-ball, no-strike count, Knoblauch duck runaway fastball. Two balls, strikes. Wall throw strike, Knoblauch swung hard lifted high fly left-field line. Off bat, look much. But kept carrying, Vaughn drifting back left looking up, see ball disappear stands. Tie game. Yankee Stadium shook. Knoblauch rounded bases, crossed home plate thrust arms air, yelling crowd, hyped Olympic weightlifter successfully hoisted half-ton. He stomped dugout, helmet on, teammates banging happily. When Derek Jeter singled, nobody really noticed. Wall left game, Mark Langston took over. Paul O'Neill flied out, Jeter advanced wild pitch, Bernie Williams intentionally walked. Chili Davis drew walk. Bases loaded, more, Martinez coming plate, exactly one run batted in first 76 career at-bats league championship World Series games. With count two balls two strikes, Langston threw pitch corner thought strike. Instead, Garcia called ball. Langston glared, snapping return throw. Langston Martinez everyone field understood bases loaded 3-2 count, Langston would throw players refer cookie  tasty pitch middle. Martinez ate cookie. The ball soared upper deck right field, lifting three years post-season misery back Yankees' first baseman, grand slam. The crowd called Martinez dugout again. Like Knoblauch, Martinez pumped arms, later crowd would chant name, Martinez would wave cap. San Diego's lead long gone. The Yankees taken 2-0 lead Brown second inning, forcing throw 32 pitches second. They loaded bases single two walks, Ledee, rookie left fielder playing none Torre's left fielders hitting, pulled sinking fastball right field line two outs. The fans foul line stood, waving push ball fair body English, ball landed line, skipping wall two runners scored. The Yankees early edge, jumped Brown, best pitcher mound. San Diego's Chris Gomez led second inning blooper shortstop, ball falling single. Quilvio Veras flied right, Gwynn grounded Gomez took second, bringing Vaughn plate. David Wells got ahead count, balls two strikes, change-up fastball, trying run fastball Vaughn, hit 50 home runs regular season. Vaughn attacked pitch: line drive landed second deck, foul way, frightening mistake. Jorge Posada, Yankees' catcher, jogged mound re-think strategy, perhaps remind Wells conventional wisdom: must pitch Vaughn outer edge plate. Posada returned plate, called fastball, Wells threw. Vaughn's swing short quick, ball making click sound bat, well-struck golf ball, carrying wall right-center field. Tie game. Wells retired first two batters fifth inning, jamming Veras fastball. Veras' bat snapped contact, enough send looper short center field, single. Gwynn stepped in, hit single first two at-bats, looked sign third base coach Tim Flannery. With runner first, likes try pull ball right side infield. Wells fired fastball, Gwynn turned pitch ripped it, line drive crashed facing upper deck right field. The Padres jumped dugout, celebrating, Wells turned away, disgusted, asking new baseball. He got one, delivered another fastball, Vaughn slugged deep left field stands. Two pitches, two home runs, first back-to-back home runs allowed Wells April 30. San Diego led, 5-2, Yankee Stadium silent. It would stay way. The moment truth Chuck Knoblauch came bottom first inning name announced Yankee Stadium first time neglected chase memorable loose ball last Wednesday. There boos. It warm ovation. They liked him. They really liked him. Knoblauch exhaled. Knoblauch emphasized game concerned winning rumbling World Series, fans. But surely made Knoblauch feel home realized fans forgiven him. Victories, time, healed malice Knoblauch could play second base earplugs. When Yankees defeated Indians, 9-5, Game 6 Tuesday night advance second World Series three years, Knoblauch easily relieved player field. The awful mistake made Game 2 would forgotten. The Yankees pennant, Knoblauch celebrating much anyone. To act tremendous, said Knoblauch, response received. It great feeling, really helped out. Knoblauch wearing cap declared Yankees champions American League 1998; Champagne dripped brim spoke. He look up, continued talk learned lot vilified making mistake Little Leaguers expected make. Just face things take man answer questions, although they're tough, Knoblauch said. You see made bounce back something that. That's basically I learned. If Yankees lost ALCS, Knoblauch's teammates said would branded villain failing pursue ball glanced Travis Fryman's back running baseline. Knoblauch argued umpire go ahead run scored first Indians won, 4-1. Now Knoblauch watch television read newspapers getting queasy. That's huge him, David Cone said. That's huge me. I let back game, would tough one would come back beat us. And Knobbie, I'm sure he's feeling lot better now. Knoblauch, two hits five at-bats, working second bottle Champagne five minutes reporters allowed clubhouse. He flashed sort smile shown much recently and, Yankees World Series, Knoblauch expect teased mistake. Maybe go way, we'll that, Derek Jeter said. I know I'll say, I'll think something good. YANKEES Pitching The starting pitching enabled Yankees advance Cleveland American League Championship Series. David Wells 7-1 career postseason additional edge Padres' lineup generally less effective left-handed pitching. Orlando Hernandez four terrific pitches, pitched seven shutout innings pivotal Game 4 ALCS earned start Game 2 series. David Cone benefit six days' worth rest starts Game 3, well able pitch warm Southern California. Mariano Rivera's stuff might good year, Mike Stanton continues dominant postseason pitcher. Reasons concern: erratic Andy Pettitte, needs home-plate umpire call strikes pitches low away, Jeff Nelson, lost command last brief outing. Offense There signs ALCS offense coming collective slump  Chuck Knoblauch getting base consistently, Derek Jeter back driving ball right field middle, Bernie Williams three hits Game 6, Scott Brosius consistent force bottom lineup. But Yankees holes: Chili Davis hard-pressed catch fastballs Kevin Brown Andy Ashby, Tino Martinez's postseason funk problem. The Yankees could use contribution Jorge Posada, start Games 1 2 may get chance drive pitches low strike zone, hit power. Defense The Yankees best defense baseball, excellent middle Jeter Knoblauch, third Brosius. Nobody's really taken advantage fact Williams poor arm center field, rest assured Ken Caminiti, Steve Finley Greg Vaughn try. The Indians expose fact Yankees' pitchers trouble preventing baserunners stealing second third base. Baserunning The Yankees run well take extra bases, particularly Paul O'Neill, Brosius, Jeter Knoblauch going first-to-third; Williams make mistakes. The Yankees probably able steal Kevin Brown, effective slide step, could aggressive Andy Ashby, combination Sterling Hitchcock Jim Leyritz. PADRES Hitting Except Jim Leyritz, one San Diego lineup particularly hot particularly frightening moment. Tony Gwynn consistent is, Ken Caminiti Greg Vaughn streaky. But Padres veteran team capable putting ball play, getting runners base moving along, long getting exceptional pitching, that's really need. Quilvio Veras, leadoff hitter, adept drawing walks Steve Finley, become pull conscious last two years, could try take aim right field stands Yankee Stadium. Vaughn's power could factor Yankees' pitchers jam enough keep leaning plate. Pitching Kevin Brown best pitcher series, capable winning three games necessary, Padres manager Bruce Bochy choose start Games 1, 4 7. But point, San Diego need big outing either Andy Ashby Sterling Hitchcock. When Ashby's right, he's hitting corners sinking fastball slider, command suspect, gets pounded. Hitchcock used split-fingered fastball great effectiveness right-handed batters first two rounds playoffs, Yankees' left-handed hitters may cause concern. San Diego's middle relief weakest aspect team, Randy Myers Mark Langston left side (the stuff waned). But lead delivered hands closer Trevor Hoffman, he'll keep it. Defense They mostly catch ball avoid mistakes, though unspectacular. Shortstop Chris Gomez second baseman Veras adept turning double plays, Caminiti Gold Glove third base last year; Wally Joyner good hands first; center fielder Steve Finley extremely quick tracking base hits returning ball infield. Tony Gwynn's range better right field line, nearly good balls hit gaps. The Yankees able run arm Vaughn left field. Baserunning Veras steal bases (24) year, Finley tight spot, well. In general, however, Padres slow, plodding team, though Caminiti Vaughn good going first-to-third, Gwynn make mistakes bases. PITCHING TO THE PADRES Quilvio Veras: A switch-hitter power right-handed; try pitch down-and-in breaking balls he's hitting right-handed, jam fastballs he's batting left-handed. Steve Finley: A left-handed hitter likes pull ball. Left-handers David Wells beat breaking balls low outside. Tony Gwynn: When he's hot, he's impossible. When he's hitting well, anxious early count, fed breaking balls strike zone. Greg Vaughn: Big-time power anything high plate. Because likes pull ball, must pitch outer edge, occasionally jamming keep honest. Ken Caminiti: More power right-handed, better hitter left-handed. These days, he's good lowball hitter beat fastballs zone. Wally Joyner: With runners base, he'll try jump fastball early count. Is strong hitter jammed. Chris Gomez: Like Derek Jeter, likes hit pitches out, right field middle. He hit power make mistake breaking ball. Ruben Rivera: An impatient hitter chase pitches strike zone. Carlos Hernandez: Looks first-pitch fastball upper half strike zone. Can struggle breaking balls. Jim Leyritz: No apparent holes right now, hit fastballs away. Best bet get ahead count try get chase breaking balls. PITCHING TO THE YANKEES Chuck Knoblauch: Hard throwers jam fastballs stands top plate, gets hit often. Derek Jeter: Sometimes tendency chase pitches feet, get ball far enough, hammer ball wall right. Paul O'Neill: The Yankees' best pure hitter, sometimes chase fastballs away, particularly one strike. Bernie Williams: A switch-hitter trouble resisting chest-high fastballs. When lays them, much better hitter, last game Cleveland series. Chili Davis: Has great eye work pitcher deep count, overpowered fastballs belt. Cheats get bat started, making vulnerable off-speed pitches. Tino Martinez: Nothing seems right moment. Is anxious chases pitches strike zone falls count, taking advantage mistakes they're made. Scott Brosius: A great breaking ball hitter, also drive fastball long way anticipates, Cleveland's Charles Nagy knows. Jorge Posada: When batting left-handed, fares poorly splitters, curveballs sliders. Ricky Ledee: Like young hitters, tendency expand strike zone chase pitches strike zone falling count. Kevin Brown likely attack aggressively. SATURDAY'S PITCHERS Kevin Brown: Best sinking fastball game (91-93) mph, four-seam fastball 95-97 mph throw high strike zone, slider breaks away right-handed batters, forkball dives 88-89 mph. Holds runners well. David Wells: Aggressive, aggressive, aggressive, challenging hitters fastballs. His curveball exceptional, changeup improved. Throw strikes: Allowed many home runs (29) walks (29), allowed three-run homer grand slam year. Talk high expectations. It's man Tampa anymore. Knowing baseball well do, everybody Joe Torre family passed tickets divisional series league championship series much parsley plate life. The pressure get World Series, I see people, Torre, Yankees' manager, saying New York went play here-we-are, let's-go-for-it San Diego Padres Stadium Saturday night. Now Yankees Series, Florida-based owner fans see nothing appropriate four victories. Anything less 125 would feel emptiness. But Yankees different six teams already fell bus World Series? The gloom doom six cities compare letdown would grip New York owner's insatiable little heart Yanks come short. The three-tiered playoff system practically turned baseball football, survival-of-the-fittest mentality produces one exalted Super Bowl champion league full chumps losers, condemned nether world Parcells-like demons kicking sore spots eternity. The World Series used short sweet reward excellence, eight teams league, winners met daylight early October. Even Yankees clubbed poor Brooklyn Dodgers submission again, well, always next year. But 1969, baseball began league championship series, 1995 began two-layered playoff system. The World Series still different, resist babble post-season records flung us hyperactive computers hyperactive broadcasters dozens different networks carry baseball. The World Series still competition one league encourages pitchers athletes another league relatively devoid strategy. Somehow playoffs leave everybody feeling inadequate. Think it. The Houston Astros going feeling cannot perform post-season. The Texas Rangers sulking best hitting league could hardly touch Yankee pitching counted. In Chicago, glory winning special playoff wild-card spot Sammy Sosa's 66 home runs pre-empted. The city beat Cubs 1969 eastern title held parade Sosa Saturday canyons Lindbergh John Glenn 1969 Mets hailed. Speaking indignity, Red Sox, whose occasional qualification playoffs merely signal nothing good come it. In Atlanta, team '90s exactly one World Series, management keep repeating that: The main goal get Series. This recorded announcement. This recorded announcement. This recorded announcement. In Cleveland, fans live phrase Nineteen forty-eight! chanted Indians Bronx Yankees put Indians misery. That leaves Padres team virtually nothing lose. This good, bad. Bruce Bochy, manager, reserve 1984 San Diego World Series team, said: A lot players team said, looking back, wish would little different attitude instead saying, `Hey, World Series.' And year, I think see players playing win. Torre recalled underdog 1996, said Yankees felt could beat Braves. I sure way Padres feel right now, maybe people predicting lot them, I sure themselves, Torre said. I think getting pressure is, Torre added. You want win, getting World Series tough playing 162 games getting post-season fight, bite scratch everything else get here. Torre continued: You think spring training want go win World Series. You want get World Series. Then get there, well, played well enough enough games, course, want win. As far legitimizing season  I hate think negative terms, San Diego happens win World Series, sure takes little bit luster accomplished getting here, I think goal, initially. The key word sentence initially. The Yankees built insatiable demand victories  World Series tickets Torre family. While they're it, Yankees better win whole thing. They victim excellence. \n","\n","\n","\n","Hours Darryl Strawberry released Columbia Presbyterian Medical Center Friday, spoke happily able play two young child, joked eating small amount chicken potato sounded relieved home Fort Lee, N.J., instead hospital. I'm really feeling good, said Strawberry, telephone interview. It's nice home kid kick back. That's I'm going do. This feel good. Strawberry, underwent surgery remove cancer colon Oct. 3, said remain New Jersey another 10 12 day returning home Rancho Mirage, Calif. The 36-year old outfielder, lost significant amount weight 215-pound frame, said enough strength attend World Series game content watching teammate play Padres television. My heart them, said Strawberry, spoke several Yankees American League championship. I'm going relax home watch game. I'm looking forward it. I may there, it'll feel I am. Paul O'Neill echoed sentiment many Yankees saying, Everything we're going game. This life. Any time get good news Darryl uplifting. We're praying him. Since cancerous cell found one 36 lymph node removed abdomen operation, Strawberry said doctor told need six month chemotherapy treatment return California. The 36-year-old outfielder said doctor told need one treatment least one hour week. I never scared, said Strawberry. I emotional anything. At time it, I played this. I wanted keep playing I knew going get World Series. At point, Strawberry stopped laughed, probably Yankees made World Series expected. I wanted that's play for, said Strawberry. I think I ever scared. It's something I wanted deal head on. I talked Eric Davis chemo. He said bad people say. Although discovery cancer one lymph node proved cancer spread, Strawberry remained optimistic future said, It worry me. I got information doctor. One 36 good. It spreading. It run get crazy cancer can. When Strawberry released hospital wheelchair Friday, hundred fan congregated chanted, Darryl, Darryl. Strawberry, struggled cry, hugged nurse, thanked everyone supporting him, rose wheelchair carefully entered car. Wow, I never thought day would come, Strawberry said. But ha. Unlike David Wells, Saturday night's starter World Series predicted Yankees would throttle Padres five game, Strawberry refused make prediction whether soon getting third World Series ring. But Strawberry, still hopeful returning play 1999, sounded confident 1998 Yankees, wearing number 39 back cap inspiration. They look really good, said Strawberry. It's going easy, I think they're ready. The best thing making World Series know go anywhere else that. You've made point go best do. That's about. As Bernie Williams start could final series Yankees Game 1 World Series Yankee Stadium Saturday night, want free mind. Free worrying extremely uncertain future undisclosed personal matter made post-season perplexing pleasing. But easy keep mind uncluttered. Williams know sign Yankees return center field next season, want test free agency. There good chance Yankees offer lavish contract, Williams might forced decide fattest paycheck new situation baseball city choice pretty fat paycheck familiar situation Bronx. Scott Boras, Williams' agent, compared client player $10 million-a-year bracket last season, price tag surely escalated Williams American League batting title .339 average drilling 26 homer knocking 97 run. Williams asked agreed theory team outbid Yankees. I know, said Williams, aloof post-season, declined discus why. And I'm thinking little I would to. I would keep focus series. It issue Williams Yankees want study Saturday coming day, team four victory away championship. Still, issue hovers Yankees ominously owner George Steinbrenner hovers general manager Brian Cashman. It's tough thing, Cashman said balancing excitement World Series reality trying re-sign Williams. You know ugliness future right front you. Although Williams adamant discussing future, relented slightly Friday. When reporter asked reason would staying Yankees, Williams' answer included escape clause. Just fact I've whole career, Williams said. That lot it. The relationship I've come know year, I think would hard, impossible, start scratch somewhere else. Williams continued: But I think reality game day age thing happen. You can't really write thing stone they're going happen. People get traded. People become free agent go team. I make decision really thinking people I'm accountable for. When Williams asked better situation could player center fielder Yankees, winning batting crown World Series, 30-year-old stumped. Wow, that's pretty good right there, Williams said. It's funny mention that, I really thought that. I think, point season, I going sit think, wow, bad year all. While Cashman would discus financial matter, another Yankee official said team offer Williams much $12 million year unless Steinbrenner get generous possible championship. It likely Yanks would offer Williams $10 million-a-year range. I'd hate speculate something point, Cashman said. We'll give best effort sign level we're comfortable with. Hopefully, enough. Then we'll marriage. If not, we'll divorce. While Williams earned right become free agent pursue contract want city want, interesting choice make. When reporter asked Williams would respond someone suggested accept le Yankees remain city popular, like teammate manager, team post-season four straight year, hesitate answer. My response would time right start thinking that, Williams said. If I start thinking that, it'll distract I need World Series. Williams talked Yankees end remarkable season want situation disrupt that. But, Williams' status uncertain, asked next four seven game would bittersweet, could ending 13-year association Yankees. I want talk that, Williams said. I'm going lot fun there. I'm going go out. Then Williams walked away interview. The New York Times said editorial Saturday, Oct. 17: It fitting memorable baseball season conclude World Series open Saturday night Yankee Stadium, aging still grand cathedral sport. Bedecked bunting banner, revered ballpark always elevates game aura history accomplishment. That make perfect venue part championship series determine whether 1998 Yankees one greatest team modern era, talented squad owned regular season folded World Series. New Yorkers boisterous, boastful bunch, patter city week loud arrogant, must seem anyone venturing San Diego root Padres. The word sidewalk subway Padres measure Yankees. Sure, lethal starting pitcher Kevin Brown Andy Ashby, one game's best closer Trevor Hoffman, mention prolific hitter Tony Gwynn Greg Vaughn, hobbling still dangerous. But match Yankees' World Series starting rotation David Wells, Orlando Hernandez, David Cone Andy Pettitte, bullpen flamethrower Mariano Rivera, deepest batting order baseball? Yet truth Yankees fan terrified team crumple. Baseball fan, Yankee fan, spend lifetime waiting see home team historic caliber, Yankee team reach sanctified status unless end record-setting season winning World Series. The doubt keep creeping up. The team pitiful plate playoff. Tino Martinez, top run producer, numbing slump. Bernie Williams, American League batting champ, hit well pennant series Cleveland Indians, seemed distracted personal matter. Shane Spencer, rookie slugging sensation September, turned new Mr. October. Pettitte struggling August. The curious thing team, game regular season team American League history, quiet unobtrusive be. It sport dominant superstar, swaggering clubhouse leader, one seems belong New York. So Yankees start drift field, fan tend fear team might simply fade away. Until Indians surged temporarily ahead playoff, Yankees faced serious test resiliency season. New Yorkers already taste ticker-tape parade Broadway. But every mighty cheer stadium Saturday night lurk fear curtain fall season, unheralded unlegendary team San Diego one remembered. The last time seen field Yankee Stadium, inadvertently influencing outcome game sent Cleveland Indians home Yankees World Series. That's say umpire mess World Series, shown eminently capable interfering natural progression postseason game. All right, Ted Hendry World Series; umpires' collective bargaining agreement league allow umpire work league championship series World Series. Joe Brinkman either, though agreement allow umpire work division series World Series. The three American League umpire six-man World Series crew work first playoff. One them, Richie Garcia, crew chief plate Saturday night's opener Yankee Stadium. Gene Budig, AL president, Friday called Garcia, 24-year veteran, one league's respected umpire. But Saturday night, Garcia move right field Sunday night Game 2. Now combination sound familiar, Richie Garcia right field? Ah yes, last time Garcia worked post-season series Yankee Stadium, umpire Game 1 league championship series two year ago young fan New Jersey name, please; over-glorified enough reached fence caught Derek Jeter's fly ball Tony Tarasco, Baltimore's right fielder, prepared catch it. Garcia ruled interference, home run, said oops watching television replay clearly showing interference. Too late. The call helped Yankees win first game set tone series. Even though made mistake, know best there, baseball official, speaking condition anonymity, said. That knowledge come small consolation Orioles. Budig, too, acknowledged umpire, player manager, perfect. Major league umpire skilled do, human, said telephone interview. Day day good job Major League Baseball. Rounds one two difficult, happens time time. The umpire human American League playoff happened time time time time. The Cleveland Indians suffered brunt fallibility umpire. We highlight reel umpire getting knocked baseball, general manager John Hart said Indians' final game Yankees. The umpire lose game u, share controversy two playoff series umpire. In division series Boston, Brinkman, plate umpire, bad call pitch play plate immediately provoked dispute led ejecting Mike Hargrove, Indians' manager, three pitch Game 2, Dwight Gooden, starting pitcher, 19 pitch later. Hendry right wrong, depending one's point view, noncall interference Travis Fryman 12th inning Game 2 ALCS. That ruling went favor Indians. Little else did. In Game 4, Jeter stealing second fifth inning on-target throw Sandy Alomar Jr. hit Jim McKean, jumped try get way instead kicked ball right field. A batted ball, Omar Vizquel's line drive, struck Hendry Game 6. But worst call Game 6 Hendry's force play second base. Hendry called Bernie Williams safe, ruling Vizquel's foot came base caught ball. Members Yankees indicated Friday they, too, thought call wrong. I know, Williams said asked thought, I'll take it. It big play. But think out? I'd rather comment that, said. It stir lot controversy. I want get that. When player belief safe, say worry subsequent controversy. If Williams implying thought out, another member Yankees said doubt Williams out. I sure first, uniformed member team said, I saw Hendry, I said uh-oh. I also thought Omar smooth think come bag. Then I saw replay. He out. The game today faster used be, observer said. The umpire sharper. Maybe Garcia, Dale Scott Tim Tschida American League, Jerry Crawford, Dana DeMuth Mark Hirschbeck National League, sharp 18th century French guillotine four seven game. Leonard Coleman, NL president, said thought umpire first-rate division league series added three splendid umpire working World Series. Budig said: The World Series crew proven first-rate. We total confidence them. The umpire let player make error manager bad decision. Then everyone talk player manager umpire. A strong sign city going bonkers Padres came Friday morning 680 fan agreed shave head radio promotion raffle return 1-in-680 chance skybox ticket post-season play. This show support team one ticket, said Tommy Sablan, producer Jeff Jer show. It symbolic effort bald Padres Tony Gwynn, Wally Joyner, Greg Vaughn, Jim Leyritz. About thousand people showed men, woman child. We 10 barber 20 hairdresser took six hour line either get buzzed straight-razored. We shocked turnout. But bandwagon town. `Buy ticket day concert' type public. You'll see bigger bandwagon Monday they've hopefully play Yankees real World Series. After Padres beat Braves, 3-0, Game 2 National League Championship Series Thursday night Atlanta take two-game lead four-of-seven-game series, San Diego fan began gearing shot World Series traditional way. It would team's first World Series appearance 1984, downtown business district Friday, marquee banner read Go Padres lunch-hour rally attended several hundred fan. The Padres set attendance record 2,555,901 season, half-million last year nearly million half three year ago. It stemmed part effort John Moores, Padres owner, Larry Lucchino, team's president, put family entertainment park bought team December 1994. This diversified group fan I saw Atlanta, Lucchino said. Their crowd seemed yuppified. We're proud three generation family come game. Donna McMahon, 63-year-old homemaker La Jolla, fan 10 Pacific Coast League Padres played Lane Field harbor. She would take streetcar school meet father, would buy bleacher seat. Later, brought four child Jack Murphy Stadium National League Padres 2,500 people crowd. Now, brings grandchild sold-out Qualcomm Stadium. There different group stand, said, upper class, middle class, business person, beer-drinking fan, child, Mexican fan border. We true fan u. San Diego Mayor Susan Golding agrees, also giving credit balmy weather. Padre fan cross-section county, said. Downtown, suburban, rural, east, north, rancher farmer high-tech engineer, yuppie new kid X generation. A lot border. The Padres extremely popular Tijuana. We perfect weather long baseball season. Playing World Series October got better New York. Carlos Carrion, born San Diego baseball fan 25 year, brings 10- 8-year-old son stadium. This great chance let child see player work, Carrion said. They look guy understand character work ethic. The Padres ticket office estimate average, 15,000 fan 65,000-seat stadium Latin Americans San Diego, Baja California state Sonora. The Padres first major league baseball souvenir store Tijuana. A new shipment bat arrived Tino Martinez Friday, massaged handle make sure thin enough, knocked barrel listened certain sound swung slowly again. Martinez excited fresh bat, reacted Little Leaguer wielding aluminum bat first time. You saving World Series tree now, right? Martinez said representative bat company. These World Series tree, they? Martinez could joke bat specially designed World Series Yankees began quest second title three year play host San Diego Padres Game 1 Yankee Stadium Saturday night. Major leaguer player watching television could imitate David Letterman joke World Series wood. Even though Martinez struggled numerous bat post-season, could joke Yankees still alive title. Martinez still alive. For now, Martinez, power hitter mostly missing action, could joke around. For now. You always get fresh start post-season game game, said Martinez. If win, got another game next day forget bad at-bat. It's easier post-season next at-bat could biggest at-bat season. Normally, Martinez plate biggest at-bat season would pleasing sight Yankees. But calendar flip October. Martinez experienced another frustrating post-season. He 5 30 10 strikeout, homer 1 run batted hitting-starved team batted .229 still winning 7 9 post-season game superior pitching. Can Yankees continue win Martinez, valuable run producer, sometime single hitter? We've gotten two good series, said Paul O'Neill. The Yankees series. You focus one guy. You focus winning. The whole team won. As much Joe Torre talked Martinez needing one line-drive hit get groove, 30-year-old first baseman career drought post-season. Since joining Yankees, Martinez 20 107 (.187) one homer 4 RBI 29 post-season game. Those puny statistic, especially player driven 381 run 455 regular season game last three year. I would guess Tino would great series, O'Neill said. Baseball way evening thing out. You bad series, come back great series. In season, that's easier do. In post-season, get tougher. It cannot get much tougher Martinez, dropped fifth sixth order American League Championship Series Cleveland Indians remain spot notice. Martinez blamed paucity production impatience trying much. He sometimes flailed poor pitch hitter's count 3-1 2-0, instead working count, admitted previous failure post-season caused pursue obviously unattainable five-run homer. Actually, Martinez already made alteration, reached base 7 time last 10 plate appearance double, single, hit-by-pitch 4 walk. It enough pacify George Steinbrenner, something cling to. Until last night, anyway, Martinez face Kevin Brown, nasty right-hander retired 30 34 career at-bat. If I getting good pitch missing them, I'd say I bad swing working, said Martinez. But I've swinging bad pitch. Right now, I've got patient wait. The Yankees wait him. They to. In 1996 World Series, Torre started Cecil Fielder Martinez first Games 3, 4 5. It difficult decision Martinez paced team RBI Fielder join Yankees July 31. But Yankees grabbed three game worked. Torre attractive replacement season Luis Sojo. So Yankees stay Martinez, better worse, try stay positive finally produce. It's World Series, said Martinez. You got go fun it. Big game big game. You want go enjoy game try best win game. You think might lose day. Chuck Knoblauch Tino Martinez popular squeegee men week ago, speculation rampant one or might exiled Yankees' historic year crumbled post-season. Two big hit midst big inning changed Saturday night Game 1 World Series. The Yankees trailed San Diego, 5-2, seventh inning, Knoblauch hit three-run home run tie score, five batter later, Martinez smashed grand slam. The seven-run explosion rocketed Yankees 9-6 victory opener four-of-seven-game series, 56,712 Yankee Stadium. Orlando Hernandez pitch Andy Ashby Game 2 Sunday night Stadium. Beyond seizing advantage series, Yankees able neutralize Padres' ace, Kevin Brown, driving mound seventh. Brown, seen many San Diego's best hope World Series upset, pitch Game 4, earliest. Brown pitching three-run lead top fifth, Tony Gwynn Greg Vaughn banged back-to-back homer. One seventh, however, Jorge Posada hit single, Brown walked Ricky Ledee. Brown, thrown whopping 64 pitch first three inning, went out, reliever Donne Wall came face Knoblauch. This Yankees done season, force starter game middle inning, exploiting middle reliever. Knoblauch, course, earned notoriety gaffe Game 2 American League Championship Series Cleveland, standing waiting interference call ball rolled stop decisive run scored. The Yankees came back win series, however; Knoblauch got reprieve talked much experience helped him. Facing Wall one-ball, no-strike count, Knoblauch duck runaway fastball. Two ball, strike. Wall throw strike, Knoblauch swung hard lifted high fly left-field line. Off bat, look much. But kept carrying, Vaughn drifting back left looking up, see ball disappear stand. Tie game. Yankee Stadium shook. Knoblauch rounded base, crossed home plate thrust arm air, yelling crowd, hyped Olympic weightlifter successfully hoisted half-ton. He stomped dugout, helmet on, teammate banging happily. When Derek Jeter singled, nobody really noticed. Wall left game, Mark Langston took over. Paul O'Neill flied out, Jeter advanced wild pitch, Bernie Williams intentionally walked. Chili Davis drew walk. Bases loaded, more, Martinez coming plate, exactly one run batted in first 76 career at-bat league championship World Series game. With count two ball two strike, Langston threw pitch corner thought strike. Instead, Garcia called ball. Langston glared, snapping return throw. Langston Martinez everyone field understood base loaded 3-2 count, Langston would throw player refer cookie tasty pitch middle. Martinez ate cookie. The ball soared upper deck right field, lifting three year post-season misery back Yankees' first baseman, grand slam. The crowd called Martinez dugout again. Like Knoblauch, Martinez pumped arm, later crowd would chant name, Martinez would wave cap. San Diego's lead long gone. The Yankees taken 2-0 lead Brown second inning, forcing throw 32 pitch second. They loaded base single two walk, Ledee, rookie left fielder playing none Torre's left fielder hitting, pulled sinking fastball right field line two out. The fan foul line stood, waving push ball fair body English, ball landed line, skipping wall two runner scored. The Yankees early edge, jumped Brown, best pitcher mound. San Diego's Chris Gomez led second inning blooper shortstop, ball falling single. Quilvio Veras flied right, Gwynn grounded Gomez took second, bringing Vaughn plate. David Wells got ahead count, ball two strike, change-up fastball, trying run fastball Vaughn, hit 50 home run regular season. Vaughn attacked pitch: line drive landed second deck, foul way, frightening mistake. Jorge Posada, Yankees' catcher, jogged mound re-think strategy, perhaps remind Wells conventional wisdom: must pitch Vaughn outer edge plate. Posada returned plate, called fastball, Wells threw. Vaughn's swing short quick, ball making click sound bat, well-struck golf ball, carrying wall right-center field. Tie game. Wells retired first two batter fifth inning, jamming Veras fastball. Veras' bat snapped contact, enough send looper short center field, single. Gwynn stepped in, hit single first two at-bat, looked sign third base coach Tim Flannery. With runner first, like try pull ball right side infield. Wells fired fastball, Gwynn turned pitch ripped it, line drive crashed facing upper deck right field. The Padres jumped dugout, celebrating, Wells turned away, disgusted, asking new baseball. He got one, delivered another fastball, Vaughn slugged deep left field stand. Two pitch, two home run, first back-to-back home run allowed Wells April 30. San Diego led, 5-2, Yankee Stadium silent. It would stay way. The moment truth Chuck Knoblauch came bottom first inning name announced Yankee Stadium first time neglected chase memorable loose ball last Wednesday. There boo. It warm ovation. They liked him. They really liked him. Knoblauch exhaled. Knoblauch emphasized game concerned winning rumbling World Series, fan. But surely made Knoblauch feel home realized fan forgiven him. Victories, time, healed malice Knoblauch could play second base earplug. When Yankees defeated Indians, 9-5, Game 6 Tuesday night advance second World Series three year, Knoblauch easily relieved player field. The awful mistake made Game 2 would forgotten. The Yankees pennant, Knoblauch celebrating much anyone. To act tremendous, said Knoblauch, response received. It great feeling, really helped out. Knoblauch wearing cap declared Yankees champion American League 1998; Champagne dripped brim spoke. He look up, continued talk learned lot vilified making mistake Little Leaguers expected make. Just face thing take man answer question, although they're tough, Knoblauch said. You see made bounce back something that. That's basically I learned. If Yankees lost ALCS, Knoblauch's teammate said would branded villain failing pursue ball glanced Travis Fryman's back running baseline. Knoblauch argued umpire go ahead run scored first Indians won, 4-1. Now Knoblauch watch television read newspaper getting queasy. That's huge him, David Cone said. That's huge me. I let back game, would tough one would come back beat u. And Knobbie, I'm sure he's feeling lot better now. Knoblauch, two hit five at-bat, working second bottle Champagne five minute reporter allowed clubhouse. He flashed sort smile shown much recently and, Yankees World Series, Knoblauch expect teased mistake. Maybe go way, we'll that, Derek Jeter said. I know I'll say, I'll think something good. YANKEES Pitching The starting pitching enabled Yankees advance Cleveland American League Championship Series. David Wells 7-1 career postseason additional edge Padres' lineup generally le effective left-handed pitching. Orlando Hernandez four terrific pitch, pitched seven shutout inning pivotal Game 4 ALCS earned start Game 2 series. David Cone benefit six days' worth rest start Game 3, well able pitch warm Southern California. Mariano Rivera's stuff might good year, Mike Stanton continues dominant postseason pitcher. Reasons concern: erratic Andy Pettitte, need home-plate umpire call strike pitch low away, Jeff Nelson, lost command last brief outing. Offense There sign ALCS offense coming collective slump Chuck Knoblauch getting base consistently, Derek Jeter back driving ball right field middle, Bernie Williams three hit Game 6, Scott Brosius consistent force bottom lineup. But Yankees holes: Chili Davis hard-pressed catch fastball Kevin Brown Andy Ashby, Tino Martinez's postseason funk problem. The Yankees could use contribution Jorge Posada, start Games 1 2 may get chance drive pitch low strike zone, hit power. Defense The Yankees best defense baseball, excellent middle Jeter Knoblauch, third Brosius. Nobody's really taken advantage fact Williams poor arm center field, rest assured Ken Caminiti, Steve Finley Greg Vaughn try. The Indians expose fact Yankees' pitcher trouble preventing baserunners stealing second third base. Baserunning The Yankees run well take extra base, particularly Paul O'Neill, Brosius, Jeter Knoblauch going first-to-third; Williams make mistake. The Yankees probably able steal Kevin Brown, effective slide step, could aggressive Andy Ashby, combination Sterling Hitchcock Jim Leyritz. PADRES Hitting Except Jim Leyritz, one San Diego lineup particularly hot particularly frightening moment. Tony Gwynn consistent is, Ken Caminiti Greg Vaughn streaky. But Padres veteran team capable putting ball play, getting runner base moving along, long getting exceptional pitching, that's really need. Quilvio Veras, leadoff hitter, adept drawing walk Steve Finley, become pull conscious last two year, could try take aim right field stand Yankee Stadium. Vaughn's power could factor Yankees' pitcher jam enough keep leaning plate. Pitching Kevin Brown best pitcher series, capable winning three game necessary, Padres manager Bruce Bochy choose start Games 1, 4 7. But point, San Diego need big outing either Andy Ashby Sterling Hitchcock. When Ashby's right, he's hitting corner sinking fastball slider, command suspect, get pounded. Hitchcock used split-fingered fastball great effectiveness right-handed batter first two round playoff, Yankees' left-handed hitter may cause concern. San Diego's middle relief weakest aspect team, Randy Myers Mark Langston left side (the stuff waned). But lead delivered hand closer Trevor Hoffman, he'll keep it. Defense They mostly catch ball avoid mistake, though unspectacular. Shortstop Chris Gomez second baseman Veras adept turning double play, Caminiti Gold Glove third base last year; Wally Joyner good hand first; center fielder Steve Finley extremely quick tracking base hit returning ball infield. Tony Gwynn's range better right field line, nearly good ball hit gap. The Yankees able run arm Vaughn left field. Baserunning Veras steal base (24) year, Finley tight spot, well. In general, however, Padres slow, plodding team, though Caminiti Vaughn good going first-to-third, Gwynn make mistake base. PITCHING TO THE PADRES Quilvio Veras: A switch-hitter power right-handed; try pitch down-and-in breaking ball he's hitting right-handed, jam fastball he's batting left-handed. Steve Finley: A left-handed hitter like pull ball. Left-handers David Wells beat breaking ball low outside. Tony Gwynn: When he's hot, he's impossible. When he's hitting well, anxious early count, fed breaking ball strike zone. Greg Vaughn: Big-time power anything high plate. Because like pull ball, must pitch outer edge, occasionally jamming keep honest. Ken Caminiti: More power right-handed, better hitter left-handed. These day, he's good lowball hitter beat fastball zone. Wally Joyner: With runner base, he'll try jump fastball early count. Is strong hitter jammed. Chris Gomez: Like Derek Jeter, like hit pitch out, right field middle. He hit power make mistake breaking ball. Ruben Rivera: An impatient hitter chase pitch strike zone. Carlos Hernandez: Looks first-pitch fastball upper half strike zone. Can struggle breaking ball. Jim Leyritz: No apparent hole right now, hit fastball away. Best bet get ahead count try get chase breaking ball. PITCHING TO THE YANKEES Chuck Knoblauch: Hard thrower jam fastball stand top plate, get hit often.

Now Yankees Series, Florida-based owner fan see nothing appropriate four victory. Anything le 125 would feel emptiness. But Yankees different six team already fell bus World Series? The gloom doom six city compare letdown would grip New York owner's insatiable little heart Yanks come short. The three-tiered playoff system practically turned baseball football, survival-of-the-fittest mentality produce one exalted Super Bowl champion league full chump loser, condemned nether world Parcells-like demon kicking sore spot eternity. The World Series used short sweet reward excellence, eight team league, winner met daylight early October. Even Yankees clubbed poor Brooklyn Dodgers submission again, well, always next year. But 1969, baseball began league championship series, 1995 began two-layered playoff system. The World Series still different, resist babble post-season record flung u hyperactive computer hyperactive broadcaster dozen different network carry baseball. The World Series still competition one league encourages pitcher athlete another league relatively devoid strategy. Somehow playoff leave everybody feeling inadequate. Think it.

You want win, getting World Series tough playing 162 game getting post-season fight, bite scratch everything else get here. Torre continued: You think spring training want go win World Series. You want get World Series. Then get there, well, played well enough enough game, course, want win. As far legitimizing season I hate think negative term, San Diego happens win World Series, sure take little bit luster accomplished getting here, I think goal, initially.

Both sides amiable emerged two-hour session, little report indicated relatively early departure, compared last three nights, interpreted sign crisis imminent peace budget talks. Sunday's discussions focused education President Clinton's request $1.1 billion hire 100,000 teachers, aides said bargainers delve much detail nothing resolved. I think made real progress today, still significant difference area education, said Erskine Bowles, Clinton's chief staff top negotiator, Sunday's meeting. We're going try plow next two days. Asked far apart two sides education, Rep. Dick Armey Texas, Republican majority leader, replied: I know. We're together. He said two sides made progress, enough. The talks came another day escalated political confrontation congressional Democrats Republicans, painfully aware three weeks Election Day, tried take advantage static budget situation. Congress passed six 13 required spending bills negotiating White House final omnibus package contain remaining seven bills major issues including conduct census year 2000, much money provide International Monetary Fund conditions provided, much emergency money provide items increased security U.S. embassies world American farmers. Also resolved host issues little financing ideology, including environmental matters, contraception national student testing. Republicans said president disengaged process, irked said swooping 11th hour pushing education agenda apparently successful portrayal guardian popular topic. Democrats countered Republican-led Congress done nothing year, cast Republicans extremists blocking president's plea money hire teachers modernize schools. In fact, Republican bargainers said Saturday night would provide money local governments, Washington, could decide money would used. Armey one many castigated president apparent disengagement, indirect reminder Clinton steeped sex scandal facing impeachment inquiry House. The scant number congressional Republicans leave town weekend used House floor press message. What president? asked Rep. Tom DeLay Texas, majority whip. Maybe Martha's Vineyard? Aspen? Camp David? Where president? I bet American people know spent 152 days 283 days year fund raising, traveling vacation. Republicans said Clinton participated 98 fund-raising events far year two events Monday New York, supporting Senate campaign Rep. Charles Schumer, would bring 100. Clinton said White House prepared takes reach resolution spending bills, dispatched aides Capitol Hill. He also said would postpone Monday morning Monday afternoon departure fund-raising tour New York, canceled fund-raising appearance Florida. But high-level budget bargaining concluded Sunday afternoon, sides agreed would need extend deadline midnight Monday, temporary financing government expires third time Oct. 1 start fiscal year. Congressional Democrats struck back Republicans, saying held slack schedule themselves. Rep. George Miller, D-Calif., said Congress session 108 days far year, unusually abbreviated period one consumed month drive hold impeachment hearings president. Most Americans, Miller said, worked 225 days. They say, `Where president?' Miller said. The president waiting budget. This first Congress 1974 budget, said, referring broad blueprint supposed guide spending. This Congress can't pass seven appropriations bills, said, largely divisive splits conservative moderate Republicans. Struggling meet fourth deadline federal budget, congressional Republicans White House officials wrestled Tuesday differences education, politically high-stakes element budget battle. Negotiators ended late-night session resolving disagreements education, census contraceptives. These biggest issues still separated two sides tried formulate message take home voters Nov. 3 elections. On education, issue President Clinton propelled forefront Republicans want appear recalcitrant, sides agreed spend $1 billion spend it. The president insists money spent hire 100,000 teachers country average class reduced 18 students. Republicans, railing Beltway bureaucrats, say local school districts decide money spent, whether teachers computers. As two sides broke Tuesday night, White House chief staff Erskine Bowles, president's top negotiator, emerged session saying: We deal. We made good progress. The biggest issue, still, 100,000 teachers. He added: There still open issues agreement reached, sounded optimistic session scheduled Wednesday morning. I think we've got chance wrapping tomorrow, said. The two sides remained apart several ideological matters, including whether allow federal health plans cover contraceptives whether allow plans religious affiliations refuse cover contraceptives religious grounds moral grounds well. They also split conduct census 2000, one thorniest issues. It one moves voters, vital parties helps determine relative strength Congress. House Speaker Newt Gingrich Bowles met much day speaker's office, shuttling ante-rooms lieutenants giving clues nitty-gritty details talks. They given another deadline midnight Wednesday wrap $500 billion worth spending items, could easily extend deadline another day two. They missed spending bills place Oct. 1 start fiscal year, providing temporary financing federal government Oct. 9, Oct. 12, Wednesday. Some central issues, financing International Monetary Fund, nailed down, neither side ready declare final deal elements budget package place. We're splitting infinitives, House Majority Leader Dick Armey said approving money IMF. As worked several issues, Republican leaders appeared calculating differences party might sour final deal arrives House floor  concern Senate floor Senate fewer differences Republicans White House. Some conservative Republicans said concerned emerging shape final package, particularly elements dealing family planning emergency spending. They say president's proposals emergency spending, items peacekeeping mission Bosnia, fixing year 2000 computer bug providing relief American farmers, break limits last year's balanced-budget agreement. The administration said money would come corresponding cuts elsewhere budget, conservatives say comes raiding surplus. If Republican leaders cannot count conservatives, need support Democrats pass final package. And Democrats Tuesday expressed concern White House positions, issues census apparent compromise Republicans aid farmers. Rep. David McIntosh, R-Ind., leader House conservatives, said believed Republican leaders ceding quickly White House. He said president appeared getting way issues really seemed winning war public relations. The president getting wants; he's controlling situation, McIntosh lamented. When Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott appears television, McIntosh said, reaction president. Nonetheless, McIntosh suggested could vote final accord. Most conservatives holding better deal we're hearing, said, we'll probably give vote see much better alternative happening goes down. Others distressed, particularly two contraceptive issues. One would require federal health plans cover contraceptives. The would bar overseas family-planning organizations lobbying change abortion laws countries. Rep. Tom Coburn, R-Okla., said wanted see final language health plan measure. As passed House Senate, allowed health plans religious affiliation decline offer contraceptive coverage; Coburn wants plans able refuse coverage moral grounds well. The plan covers five specific types contraception. Coburn said wanted two  Depo-Provera intrauterine devices  eliminated coverage said interfered fertilization therefore considered cause abortions. Democrats Rep. Nita Lowey, D-N.Y., introduced contraceptive plan House, said strongly objected Coburn's position. She said health plans based decisions offer profits, morals. The question whether White House insist keeping contraceptive coverage final package oppose moral exception. If administration allows moral exception, could alienate House Democrats. House Democrats also worried direction talks taking census. This always loomed one biggest issues separating Democrats Republicans. The results census help determine future power two political parties. But fact two sides finally talking indicates covering full range budget matters need resolved. The White House proposed buying time matter financing Commerce, State Justice departments five months. The Commerce Department contains Census Bureau. White House officials said would put nettlesome issue allowing resolution entire spending package, House Democrats worry would prelude giving Republicans road. Republican leaders idea postponing decision say financing restricted Census Bureau. On several touchy environmental issues prompted repeated veto threats White House, two sides appeared opting compromise confrontation, several disputes resolved. But particularly difficult issues remained negotiation. A compromise struck White House Alaskan lawmakers logging Tongass National Forest. But compromise still eluded question building road wilderness refuge connect two communities Alaska. A sticking point White House congressional budget negotiators issue 2000 census conducted, White House finding negotiating issue much House Democrats House Republican leaders. On Monday, White House negotiators, led chief staff Erskine Bowles, tried determine whether Democrats would accept deal finance six months departments State, Justice Commerce, oversees Census Bureau. The deal would put next March contentious issue whether next census would use statistical sampling supplement traditional methods counting people. Bowles told group Democrats House Republicans willing give number outstanding issues stalling final agreement budget, digging heels came financing census six months. The Democrats met office Minority Leader Dick Gephardt. The rationale half-year financing next March Supreme Court expected rule whether using sampling legal constitutional. The Supreme Court already agreed review two lower court rulings said sampling would violate federal law. Oral arguments cases set November. But House Democrats balked idea six months' financing census, arguing Supreme Court allowed sampling, Republicans would obligation approve money census included sampling. The general feeling many Democrats case, would lot less leverage March, especially issue left debated, said House Democratic official insisted anonymity. Democrats contend time press Republicans, want complete work budget go home campaign. Rep. Lucille Roybal-Allard, D-Calif., attended meeting Monday, said, It was, sort of, are. We've able accomplish great things, think? We made clear unless census included, issues, school construction, deal acceptable. Statistical sampling would allow Census Bureau estimate populations difficult count, would largest effect counting African-Americans cities blacks Hispanics rural areas, groups traditionally undercounted standard means. Republicans fear, Democrats hope, method would raise count people living traditionally Democratic areas, giving party advantage new boundaries election districts drawn 2000 census. At Monday's meeting, Democrats reminded administration officials Clinton promised would veto legislation restricted Census Bureau's ability conduct accurate census. I can't think way restricts census fully fund it, said Rep. Carolyn Maloney, D-N.Y. The willingness House Democrats, including Gephardt, press president issue represents realization leverage Clinton, need support coming impeachment inquiry. Gephardt major player now, irony helped make that, said Rep. Christopher Shays, R-Conn., supports use sampling census. The Democrats' position also indicates little trust many White House issue. The proposal finance departments Commerce, Justice State six months similar one reached last November Bowles House Speaker Newt Gingrich. The idea holding three departments hostage census fight would place maximum pressure sides work differences sampling. But House Democrats consulted agreement struck later grumbled it. At meeting Democratic caucus Tuesday, Ms. Maloney briefed lawmakers dealings White House declared Clinton promised would hold firm census believed him, participant said. The statement greeted laughter. There certain level suspicion times cut out,said House Democratic official. But I say, much evidence that, time. Struggling meet fourth deadline federal budget, congressional Republicans White House officials wrestled Tuesday differences education, politically high-stakes element budget battle.

But particularly difficult issues remained negotiation. A compromise struck White House Alaskan lawmakers logging Tongass National Forest. But compromise still eluded question building road wilderness refuge connect two communities Alaska. House Senate negotiators agreed Thursday require federal health plans cover prescription contraceptives women, giving unusual victory Capitol Hill advocates abortion rights. But future measure doubt attached spending bill includes controversial provision Federal Election Commission. That provision could scuttle spending bill, would finance Treasury Department Postal Service still must approved House Senate. The contraceptive measure would require federal health plans, affect 1.2 million female federal employees child-bearing age, cover five methods contraception approved Food Drug Administration use country  birth control pills, diaphragms, inter-uterine devices, Norplant Depo-Provera. Currently, 19 percent federal health plans cover methods. The House Senate approved contraceptive measure earlier year. But opponents abortion furious approval persuaded Republican leaders negotiators reopen discussion matter. The cost contraceptives driven out-of-pocket cost health care women. And many male members Congress seemed persuaded support coverage contraceptives women, almost 285 federal health plans cover Viagra, male impotency drug. Thursday, pressure building resolve spending bills Oct. 9, temporary financing government expires, negotiators agreed include contraceptive measure conference report $13.4 billion bill Treasury Department Postal service. Rep. Nita Lowey, D-N.Y., pushed contraceptive measure House, hailed Thursday's agreement first major accomplishment abortion rights advocates Republicans took control Congress 1994. She said negotiators agreed include measure election year want perceived opposing contraception seen rejecting measure passed House Senate. But many Democrats said upset bill contains provision seen interfering independence Federal Election Commission. That provision would require four-vote majority seven federal election commissioners every four years retain general counsel staff director. The provision aimed getting rid Lawrence Noble, current general counsel, investigated campaign finance practices groups Christian Coalition. The contraceptive measure one four related matters helped stall four spending bills. The three bills stalled part abortion-related matters include agriculture bill, dispute whether federal Food Drug Administration use taxpayer money approve drugs RU-486, induce abortions. The foreign operations bill also stalled whether finance international family planning programs may also promote abortion, labor health bill delayed provision would block access minors contraception. Addressing measure insurance coverage contraceptives, Helen Alvarez, spokeswoman National Conference Catholic Bishops, said bill bad policy. She said contraception failed stem number abortions, teen-age pregnancies out-of-wedlock births. Public-relations-wise, good tactic them, conceded, terms social policy, failure. For first time decades, Congress White House negotiated tax spending legislation year budget surplus. The result chaos. The lawmakers never able agree budget resolution  framework tax spending bills supposed fit. This happened congressional budget procedures established 1974. Then, discipline overall plan, Senate House could pass eight 13 spending bills needed keep government running. So lawmakers stay session week longer hoped. Finally, lumped eight bills together week announced agreement. But way could get far resort gimmicks. One designate $20 billion emergency expenditures programs cut elsewhere offset new spending. This use one-quarter anticipated budget surplus current fiscal year. Another gimmick extended tax break Individual Retirement Accounts couples incomes $100,000 $150,000. This actually raise small amount revenue next five years  period covered budget accounting  make picture considerably worse later years. As hard negotiate budget bad old days budget deficits, say politicians involved, exponentially difficult year. At least years past, common goal. As much disagreed policy principle, aiming reduction deficit. This year, members Congress wanted use surplus big tax cut. Others wanted pay national debt. Others wanted spend part medical research, schools weapons Pentagon. Others wanted spend large sums highways. Still wanted continue cutting government spending. And Republicans. The Democrats ideas budget, President Clinton laid marker saving surplus way found shore Social Security system. In budget terms, said Robert Reischauer, former director congressional budget office, end Cold War. There differences well way things negotiated budget surplus. In 1990, 1993 1995, politicians staked careers striking budget deal lower deficit, fundamental question divide bitter medicine taxes less spending. Republicans, part, opposed tax increases favored cutting spending social programs. Democrats wanted raise taxes, especially rich, protect social spending. In end, balances carefully drawn. But plenty politicians  President George Bush, name one  lost jobs process. This year, Democrats Republicans alike claiming victory, burning issue parcel candy. Democrats got money education farm assistance. Republicans got money military extension popular tax breaks businesses. Some $20 billion eat surplus really go emergencies, relief victims Hurricane Georges. But much money, $90 million pay six new helicopters national police Colombia use drug interdiction, designated emergency spending simply way get budget. For politicians, new way fun. It hard imagine anyone voted office year's budget. But make easier reach agreement. The big difference principal fights year money all. They involved delicate policy issues needle exchanges, contraception, global warming, immigration census. In Congress, consensus matters. So way policy could set wrap giant spending bill. It may pleasant debate policy money. But probably harder find way split difference. As long surplus lasts, lack discipline characterized budget-writing year likely continue. This distressing devoted controlling government spending. The temptation, said L. Ari Fleischer, spokesman House Ways Means Committee, grab loot spend it. Some conservatives sounded notes discord Friday federal spending agreement, also said would probably vote $500 billion package boosted defense spending provided aid farmers. However, one vote package yet, finished. The deal President Clinton Republican leaders hailed Thursday broad outline areas agreement final portion $1.7 trillion budget, written document. That crafted chairmen spending committees aides, said Friday still disputes needed resolved final document could run 3,000 pages. For example, still unresolved dispute whether airlines create peanut-free zone protect passengers allergic peanuts. House Speaker Newt Gingrich members Georgia, major peanut-producing state, fighting proposal, would force airlines ban peanuts three rows someone allergy. Congress gave midnight Tuesday vote final bill, agreeing President Clinton fifth extension temporary financing keep government open. The budget due Oct. 1, start new fiscal year. The vote initially expected Friday, bill nowhere written. Only handful top-level bargainers  including Gingrich, Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott White House chief staff Erskine Bowles  room final deal. Excluded committee chairmen heads appropriation committees, must write language put deal law. Almost everyone Capitol Hill expects budget pass eventually, biggest defections coming conservatives object $20 billion taken surplus address so-called emergencies package's failure offer voters serious tax cut. The lag time bill officially closed making conservatives nervous members try add provisions expand bill already consider overly bloated. And worry hometown pork stuffed bill publicly revealed, voters could put pressure members support it. The elections Nov. 3. But several conservatives said problems, expected support bill anyway. Rep. Mark Souder, R-Ind., said: `Most friends, predominantly activist conservatives, split 50-50. If tax cuts primary thing, unhappy, many conservatives mixed agenda. My position is, hold nose vote yes. We tax cuts far much spending I oppose, that's nature compromise. Every member little different focus. Souder said liked extra money defense spending, liked price supports farmers. Hog farmers district, whose biggest customers Japan China, hit hard collapse Asian markets. Several Republicans said bill seemed skewed favor Democrats. They cited two reasons: Clinton needed curry favor Democrats shore support House votes impeach him, Republican leaders feared stood Clinton, might forced government shutdown Republicans would blamed. Clinton buying votes, said Rep. David Hobson, R-Ohio. He sucking liberal Democrats would support impeachment. Rep. W.J. (Billy) Tauzin, R-La., said leaders seemed motivated desire avoid political damage incurred partial government shutdowns 1995 1996. He also cited president's need placate left adding costly domestic programs. The combination lessons learned three years ago scandal president's side yielded inevitable result, budget leans way left, Tauzin said. Still, said would probably support bill. It enthusiastically, said. It holding nose either. I would preferred spend money tax cut. I think would gotten tax cut, scandal. If president caught scandal, probably would followed Dick Morris strategy moved center. Gingrich said recognized conservatives wary agreement. But sought reassure package served interests. He cited $9 billion increase defense spending. And noted Republicans blocked several items, including needle-exchange programs District Columbia, national education testing U.S. contributions United Nations program pays family planning China, many Congress object China policy coercing abortions forcing sterilization. Gingrich said agreement best could achieved conservative Republican Congress liberal Democratic president. Some conservatives especially critical understanding Thursday. Rep. David McIntosh, R-Ind., leader conservatives House, denounced bill earlier Great Society type big-spending program. Friday, meeting Republicans, said, Our leadership found bad situation good job. A remained outright hostile bill, much hasty way cobbled together contained. Rep. Joe Barton, R-Texas, said: `I'm voting `no' unless something revolutionary happens Tuesday. I think process gives president ability stonewall end hold us ransom. The Republican leadership House Senate good job limiting highway robbery, still gone far spending caps. Also angry rushed endgame Rep. Gene Taylor, D-Miss., took House floor said could support final bill. I'm going urge colleagues vote `no,'  Taylor said. We stayed long. We stay little bit longer. And I going encourage colleagues continue vote given adequate time study measure brought us. Voting mainly party lines question become touchstone debate development preservation wilderness, Senate Thursday approved gravel road remote wildlife habitat Alaska. The road, barely 30 miles long, would slice edge wildlife refuge wilderness area Aleutian Peninsula, would connect isolated village called King Cove long-range air strip town Cold Bay. Without road, backers say, 700 residents King Cove must continue use unreliable air boat service emergencies, risking dangerous winds seas seek medical evacuation Anchorage. Opponents road call project unjustifiable precedent threatens seasonal breeding grounds protected migratory birds, say improved air sea service would better alternative. The vote Thursday, 59-38, victory state's congressional delegation. But President Clinton likely veto measure, final outcome may depend whether sponsors insert road proposal huge spending bill likely emerge Congress heads home Nov. 3 elections. Three Republicans voted bill, six Democrats voted it. The Clinton administration repeatedly warned veto big spending bill contains array anti-environmental provisions consideration. Indeed, White House seems itching partisan fight environmental priorities. But many Republicans Congress still appear reluctant engage broad fight, willing Thursday cast lot Senate's two powerful Alaskans, Ted Stevens Frank Murkowski, Republicans. A companion bill House, sponsored Rep. Don Young Alaska, also Republican, come floor. Even Sen. John Chafee Rhode Island, leader Republican environmentalists, voted road. Last February Chafee's staff assembled score environmental lobbyists office plan strategy opposing road, environmental advocates said Thursday. They speculated senator changed position deference power Stevens, chairman Appropriations Committee exerts tremendous influence time dozen spending bills final stages. A Chafee aide said Chafee voted reluctantly road Alaska's senators convinced merits. Stevens said angry tones Thursday two-thirds Alaska's land limits development vital health services denied state's residents. We can't use permission bureaucrat compelled extreme environmentalists, said. They extreme say 330,000-acre Izembek refuge, smallest wilderness Alaska, sacrosanct can't move border 60 feet. But Sen. Dale Bumpers, D-Ark., called road project dangerous precedent. Building road wilderness Alaska, matter short long, would first time nation voted deliberately authorize road wilderness area, Bumpers said. And go road, nobody knows going end.

Armey one many castigated president apparent disengagement, indirect reminder Clinton steeped sex scandal facing impeachment inquiry House. The scant number congressional Republicans leave town weekend used House floor press message. What president? asked Rep. Tom DeLay Texas, majority whip. Maybe Martha's Vineyard? Aspen? Camp David? Where president? I bet American people know spent 152 day 283 day year fund raising, traveling vacation. Republicans said Clinton participated 98 fund-raising event far year two event Monday New York, supporting Senate campaign Rep. Charles Schumer, would bring 100. Clinton said White House prepared take reach resolution spending bill, dispatched aide Capitol Hill. He also said would postpone Monday morning Monday afternoon departure fund-raising tour New York, canceled fund-raising appearance Florida. But high-level budget bargaining concluded Sunday afternoon, side agreed would need extend deadline midnight Monday, temporary financing government expires third time Oct. 1 start fiscal year. Congressional Democrats struck back Republicans, saying held slack schedule themselves. Rep. George Miller, D-Calif., said Congress session 108 day far year, unusually abbreviated period one consumed month drive hold impeachment hearing president. Most Americans, Miller said, worked 225 day. They say, `Where president?' Miller said. The president waiting budget. This first Congress 1974 budget, said, referring broad blueprint supposed guide spending. This Congress can't pas seven appropriation bill, said, largely divisive split conservative moderate Republicans. Struggling meet fourth deadline federal budget, congressional Republicans White House official wrestled Tuesday difference education, politically high-stakes element budget battle. Negotiators ended late-night session resolving disagreement education, census contraceptive. These biggest issue still separated two side tried formulate message take home voter Nov. 3 election. On education, issue President Clinton propelled forefront Republicans want appear recalcitrant, side agreed spend $1 billion spend it. The president insists money spent hire 100,000 teacher country average class reduced 18 student. Republicans, railing Beltway bureaucrat, say local school district decide money spent, whether teacher computer. As two side broke Tuesday night, White House chief staff Erskine Bowles, president's top negotiator, emerged session saying: We deal. We made good progress. The biggest issue, still, 100,000 teacher. He added: There still open issue agreement reached, sounded optimistic session scheduled Wednesday morning. I think we've got chance wrapping tomorrow, said. The two side remained apart several ideological matter, including whether allow federal health plan cover contraceptive whether allow plan religious affiliation refuse cover contraceptive religious ground moral ground well. They also split conduct census 2000, one thorniest issue. It one move voter, vital party help determine relative strength Congress. House Speaker Newt Gingrich Bowles met much day speaker's office, shuttling ante-rooms lieutenant giving clue nitty-gritty detail talk. They given another deadline midnight Wednesday wrap $500 billion worth spending item, could easily extend deadline another day two. They missed spending bill place Oct. 1 start fiscal year, providing temporary financing federal government Oct. 9, Oct. 12, Wednesday. Some central issue, financing International Monetary Fund, nailed down, neither side ready declare final deal element budget package place. We're splitting infinitive, House Majority Leader Dick Armey said approving money IMF. As worked several issue, Republican leader appeared calculating difference party might sour final deal arrives House floor concern Senate floor Senate fewer difference Republicans White House. Some conservative Republicans said concerned emerging shape final package, particularly element dealing family planning emergency spending. They say president's proposal emergency spending, item peacekeeping mission Bosnia, fixing year 2000 computer bug providing relief American farmer, break limit last year's balanced-budget agreement. The administration said money would come corresponding cut elsewhere budget, conservative say come raiding surplus. If Republican leader cannot count conservative, need support Democrats pas final package. And Democrats Tuesday expressed concern White House position, issue census apparent compromise Republicans aid farmer. Rep. David McIntosh, R-Ind., leader House conservative, said believed Republican leader ceding quickly White House. He said president appeared getting way issue really seemed winning war public relation. The president getting wants; he's controlling situation, McIntosh lamented. When Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott appears television, McIntosh said, reaction president. Nonetheless, McIntosh suggested could vote final accord. Most conservative holding better deal we're hearing, said, we'll probably give vote see much better alternative happening go down. Others distressed, particularly two contraceptive issue. One would require federal health plan cover contraceptive. The would bar overseas family-planning organization lobbying change abortion law country. Rep. Tom Coburn, R-Okla., said wanted see final language health plan measure. As passed House Senate, allowed health plan religious affiliation decline offer contraceptive coverage; Coburn want plan able refuse coverage moral ground well. The plan cover five specific type contraception. Coburn said wanted two Depo-Provera intrauterine device eliminated coverage said interfered fertilization therefore considered cause abortion. Democrats Rep. Nita Lowey, D-N.Y., introduced contraceptive plan House, said strongly objected Coburn's position. She said health plan based decision offer profit, moral. The question whether White House insist keeping contraceptive coverage final package oppose moral exception. If administration allows moral exception, could alienate House Democrats. House Democrats also worried direction talk taking census. This always loomed one biggest issue separating Democrats Republicans. The result census help determine future power two political party. But fact two side finally talking indicates covering full range budget matter need resolved. The White House proposed buying time matter financing Commerce, State Justice department five month. The Commerce Department contains Census Bureau. White House official said would put nettlesome issue allowing resolution entire spending package, House Democrats worry would prelude giving Republicans road. Republican leader idea postponing decision say financing restricted Census Bureau. On several touchy environmental issue prompted repeated veto threat White House, two side appeared opting compromise confrontation, several dispute resolved. But particularly difficult issue remained negotiation. A compromise struck White House Alaskan lawmaker logging Tongass National Forest. But compromise still eluded question building road wilderness refuge connect two community Alaska. A sticking point White House congressional budget negotiator issue 2000 census conducted, White House finding negotiating issue much House Democrats House Republican leader. On Monday, White House negotiator, led chief staff Erskine Bowles, tried determine whether Democrats would accept deal finance six month department State, Justice Commerce, oversees Census Bureau. The deal would put next March contentious issue whether next census would use statistical sampling supplement traditional method counting people. Bowles told group Democrats House Republicans willing give number outstanding issue stalling final agreement budget, digging heel came financing census six month. The Democrats met office Minority Leader Dick Gephardt. The rationale half-year financing next March Supreme Court expected rule whether using sampling legal constitutional. The Supreme Court already agreed review two lower court ruling said sampling would violate federal law. Oral argument case set November. But House Democrats balked idea six months' financing census, arguing Supreme Court allowed sampling, Republicans would obligation approve money census included sampling. The general feeling many Democrats case, would lot le leverage March, especially issue left debated, said House Democratic official insisted anonymity. Democrats contend time press Republicans, want complete work budget go home campaign. Rep. Lucille Roybal-Allard, D-Calif., attended meeting Monday, said, It wa, sort of, are. We've able accomplish great thing, think? We made clear unless census included, issue, school construction, deal acceptable. Statistical sampling would allow Census Bureau estimate population difficult count, would largest effect counting African-Americans city black Hispanics rural area, group traditionally undercounted standard mean. Republicans fear, Democrats hope, method would raise count people living traditionally Democratic area, giving party advantage new boundary election district drawn 2000 census. At Monday's meeting, Democrats reminded administration official Clinton promised would veto legislation restricted Census Bureau's ability conduct accurate census. I can't think way restricts census fully fund it, said Rep. Carolyn Maloney, D-NY. The willingness House Democrats, including Gephardt, press president issue represents realization leverage Clinton, need support coming impeachment inquiry. Gephardt major player now, irony helped make that, said Rep. Christopher Shays, R-Conn., support use sampling census. The Democrats' position also indicates little trust many White House issue. The proposal finance department Commerce, Justice State six month similar one reached last November Bowles House Speaker Newt Gingrich. The idea holding three department hostage census fight would place maximum pressure side work difference sampling. But House Democrats consulted agreement struck later grumbled it. At meeting Democratic caucus Tuesday, Ms. Maloney briefed lawmaker dealing White House declared Clinton promised would hold firm census believed him, participant said. The statement greeted laughter. There certain level suspicion time cut out,said House Democratic official. But I say, much evidence that, time.

But compromise still eluded question building road wilderness refuge connect two community Alaska. House Senate negotiator agreed Thursday require federal health plan cover prescription contraceptive woman, giving unusual victory Capitol Hill advocate abortion right. But future measure doubt attached spending bill includes controversial provision Federal Election Commission. That provision could scuttle spending bill, would finance Treasury Department Postal Service still must approved House Senate. The contraceptive measure would require federal health plan, affect 1.2 million female federal employee child-bearing age, cover five method contraception approved Food Drug Administration use country birth control pill, diaphragm, inter-uterine device, Norplant Depo-Provera. Currently, 19 percent federal health plan cover method. The House Senate approved contraceptive measure earlier year. But opponent abortion furious approval persuaded Republican leader negotiator reopen discussion matter. The cost contraceptive driven out-of-pocket cost health care woman. And many male member Congress seemed persuaded support coverage contraceptive woman, almost 285 federal health plan cover Viagra, male impotency drug. Thursday, pressure building resolve spending bill Oct. 9, temporary financing government expires, negotiator agreed include contraceptive measure conference report $13.4 billion bill Treasury Department Postal service. Rep. Nita Lowey, D-N.Y., pushed contraceptive measure House, hailed Thursday's agreement first major accomplishment abortion right advocate Republicans took control Congress 1994. She said negotiator agreed include measure election year want perceived opposing contraception seen rejecting measure passed House Senate. But many Democrats said upset bill contains provision seen interfering independence Federal Election Commission. That provision would require four-vote majority seven federal election commissioner every four year retain general counsel staff director. The provision aimed getting rid Lawrence Noble, current general counsel, investigated campaign finance practice group Christian Coalition. The contraceptive measure one four related matter helped stall four spending bill. The three bill stalled part abortion-related matter include agriculture bill, dispute whether federal Food Drug Administration use taxpayer money approve drug RU-486, induce abortion. The foreign operation bill also stalled whether finance international family planning program may also promote abortion, labor health bill delayed provision would block access minor contraception. Addressing measure insurance coverage contraceptive, Helen Alvarez, spokeswoman National Conference Catholic Bishops, said bill bad policy. She said contraception failed stem number abortion, teen-age pregnancy out-of-wedlock birth. Public-relations-wise, good tactic them, conceded, term social policy, failure. For first time decade, Congress White House negotiated tax spending legislation year budget surplus. The result chaos. The lawmaker never able agree budget resolution framework tax spending bill supposed fit. This happened congressional budget procedure established 1974. Then, discipline overall plan, Senate House could pas eight 13 spending bill needed keep government running. So lawmaker stay session week longer hoped. Finally, lumped eight bill together week announced agreement. But way could get far resort gimmick. One designate $20 billion emergency expenditure program cut elsewhere offset new spending. This use one-quarter anticipated budget surplus current fiscal year. Another gimmick extended tax break Individual Retirement Accounts couple income $100,000 $150,000. This actually raise small amount revenue next five year period covered budget accounting make picture considerably worse later year. As hard negotiate budget bad old day budget deficit, say politician involved, exponentially difficult year. At least year past, common goal. As much disagreed policy principle, aiming reduction deficit. This year, member Congress wanted use surplus big tax cut. Others wanted pay national debt. Others wanted spend part medical research, school weapon Pentagon. Others wanted spend large sum highway. Still wanted continue cutting government spending. And Republicans. The Democrats idea budget, President Clinton laid marker saving surplus way found shore Social Security system. In budget term, said Robert Reischauer, former director congressional budget office, end Cold War. There difference well way thing negotiated budget surplus. In 1990, 1993 1995, politician staked career striking budget deal lower deficit, fundamental question divide bitter medicine tax le spending. Republicans, part, opposed tax increase favored cutting spending social program. Democrats wanted raise tax, especially rich, protect social spending. In end, balance carefully drawn. But plenty politician President George Bush, name one lost job process. This year, Democrats Republicans alike claiming victory, burning issue parcel candy. Democrats got money education farm assistance. Republicans got money military extension popular tax break business. Some $20 billion eat surplus really go emergency, relief victim Hurricane Georges. But much money, $90 million pay six new helicopter national police Colombia use drug interdiction, designated emergency spending simply way get budget. For politician, new way fun. It hard imagine anyone voted office year's budget. But make easier reach agreement. The big difference principal fight year money all. They involved delicate policy issue needle exchange, contraception, global warming, immigration census. In Congress, consensus matter. So way policy could set wrap giant spending bill. It may pleasant debate policy money. But probably harder find way split difference. As long surplus last, lack discipline characterized budget-writing year likely continue. This distressing devoted controlling government spending. The temptation, said L. Ari Fleischer, spokesman House Ways Means Committee, grab loot spend it. Some conservative sounded note discord Friday federal spending agreement, also said would probably vote $500 billion package boosted defense spending provided aid farmer. However, one vote package yet, finished. The deal President Clinton Republican leader hailed Thursday broad outline area agreement final portion $1.7 trillion budget, written document. That crafted chairman spending committee aide, said Friday still dispute needed resolved final document could run 3,000 page. For example, still unresolved dispute whether airline create peanut-free zone protect passenger allergic peanut. House Speaker Newt Gingrich member Georgia, major peanut-producing state, fighting proposal, would force airline ban peanut three row someone allergy. Congress gave midnight Tuesday vote final bill, agreeing President Clinton fifth extension temporary financing keep government open. The budget due Oct. 1, start new fiscal year. The vote initially expected Friday, bill nowhere written. Only handful top-level bargainer including Gingrich, Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott White House chief staff Erskine Bowles room final deal. Excluded committee chairman head appropriation committee, must write language put deal law. Almost everyone Capitol Hill expects budget pas eventually, biggest defection coming conservative object $20 billion taken surplus address so-called emergency package's failure offer voter serious tax cut. The lag time bill officially closed making conservative nervous member try add provision expand bill already consider overly bloated. And worry hometown pork stuffed bill publicly revealed, voter could put pressure member support it. The election Nov. 3. But several conservative said problem, expected support bill anyway. Rep. Mark Souder, R-Ind., said: `Most friend, predominantly activist conservative, split 50-50. If tax cut primary thing, unhappy, many conservative mixed agenda. My position is, hold nose vote yes. We tax cut far much spending I oppose, that's nature compromise. Every member little different focus. Souder said liked extra money defense spending, liked price support farmer. Hog farmer district, whose biggest customer Japan China, hit hard collapse Asian market. Several Republicans said bill seemed skewed favor Democrats. They cited two reasons: Clinton needed curry favor Democrats shore support House vote impeach him, Republican leader feared stood Clinton, might forced government shutdown Republicans would blamed. Clinton buying vote, said Rep. David Hobson, R-Ohio. He sucking liberal Democrats would support impeachment. Rep. WJ. (Billy) Tauzin, R-La., said leader seemed motivated desire avoid political damage incurred partial government shutdown 1995 1996. He also cited president's need placate left adding costly domestic program. The combination lesson learned three year ago scandal president's side yielded inevitable result, budget lean way left, Tauzin said. Still, said would probably support bill. It enthusiastically, said. It holding nose either. I would preferred spend money tax cut. I think would gotten tax cut, scandal. If president caught scandal, probably would followed Dick Morris strategy moved center. Gingrich said recognized conservative wary agreement. But sought reassure package served interest. He cited $9 billion increase defense spending. And noted Republicans blocked several item, including needle-exchange program District Columbia, national education testing US. contribution United Nations program pay family planning China, many Congress object China policy coercing abortion forcing sterilization. Gingrich said agreement best could achieved conservative Republican Congress liberal Democratic president. Some conservative especially critical understanding Thursday. Rep. David McIntosh, R-Ind., leader conservative House, denounced bill earlier Great Society type big-spending program. Friday, meeting Republicans, said, Our leadership found bad situation good job. A remained outright hostile bill, much hasty way cobbled together contained. Rep. Joe Barton, R-Texas, said: `I'm voting `no' unless something revolutionary happens Tuesday. I think process give president ability stonewall end hold u ransom. The Republican leadership House Senate good job limiting highway robbery, still gone far spending cap. Also angry rushed endgame Rep. Gene Taylor, D-Miss., took House floor said could support final bill. I'm going urge colleague vote `no,' Taylor said. We stayed long. We stay little bit longer. And I going encourage colleague continue vote given adequate time study measure brought u. Voting mainly party line question become touchstone debate development preservation wilderness, Senate Thursday approved gravel road remote wildlife habitat Alaska. The road, barely 30 mile long, would slice edge wildlife refuge wilderness area Aleutian Peninsula, would connect isolated village called King Cove long-range air strip town Cold Bay. Without road, backer say, 700 resident King Cove must continue use unreliable air boat service emergency, risking dangerous wind sea seek medical evacuation Anchorage. Opponents road call project unjustifiable precedent threatens seasonal breeding ground protected migratory bird, say improved air sea service would better alternative. The vote Thursday, 59-38, victory state's congressional delegation. But President Clinton likely veto measure, final outcome may depend whether sponsor insert road proposal huge spending bill likely emerge Congress head home Nov. 3 election. Three Republicans voted bill, six Democrats voted it. The Clinton administration repeatedly warned veto big spending bill contains array anti-environmental provision consideration. Indeed, White House seems itching partisan fight environmental priority. But many Republicans Congress still appear reluctant engage broad fight, willing Thursday cast lot Senate's two powerful Alaskans, Ted Stevens Frank Murkowski, Republicans. A companion bill House, sponsored Rep. Don Young Alaska, also Republican, come floor. Even Sen. John Chafee Rhode Island, leader Republican environmentalist, voted road. Last February Chafee's staff assembled score environmental lobbyist office plan strategy opposing road, environmental advocate said Thursday. They speculated senator changed position deference power Stevens, chairman Appropriations Committee exerts tremendous influence time dozen spending bill final stage. A Chafee aide said Chafee voted reluctantly road Alaska's senator convinced merit. Stevens said angry tone Thursday two-thirds Alaska's land limit development vital health service denied state's resident. We can't use permission bureaucrat compelled extreme environmentalist, said. They extreme say 330,000-acre Izembek refuge, smallest wilderness Alaska, sacrosanct can't move border 60 foot. But Sen. Dale Bumpers, D-Ark., called road project dangerous precedent. Building road wilderness Alaska, matter short long, would first time nation voted deliberately authorize road wilderness area, Bumpers said. And go road, nobody know going end.

But judging advance copy manuscript, Justice Department 20 states suing software giant find support arguments book well. To cite one example, Microsoft contends industry-standard Windows operating system Internet Explorer browser single integrated product. In suit, government asserts two separate products Microsoft bundled together get unfair edge rival, Netscape Communications Corp., market software used browse Internet's World Wide Web. In Competing Internet Time: Lessons Netscape Its Battle Microsoft, authors, Michael A. Cusumano Massachusetts Institute Technology's Sloan School Management David B. Yoffie Harvard business school, quote Microsoft executive saying third version Microsoft's browser integrated Windows. Microsoft hurried first browser offerings market, book says, race catch Netscape, took ambitious approach Internet Explorer 3.0, introduced August 1996. In version changed software design use programming modules, components, could put together rearragned building blocks. In book, Ben Slivka, Microsoft general manager, quoted saying, IE 3.0 key thing componentized browser, He added, We really made Internet Explorer part Windows platform. The timing could legally significant suit government cites evidence requests August 1996 personal computer makers wanted load Netscape's browser machines instead Microsoft's browser. Microsoft denied requests, insisting browers Windows single, integrated product. Microsoft's legal team obtained early manuscript new book last month, issuing subpoena Netscape executive given confidential copy authors review. Microsoft also sought transcripts 44 current former Netscape employees interviewed authors. A federal judge Boston last week denied Microsoft access research materials, company may appeal ruling. The new book, published Free Press imprint Simon &AMP; Schuster, hurried print shipped days start Microsoft trial Oct. 19. But already, quotes Netscape executives leaked out. The authors decided send complete manuscript The New York Times three news organizations Monday, material could read context. Microsoft intends use material book evidence Netscape's troubles resulted largely missteps rather alleged predatory practices Microsoft. The book detail Netscape stumbled, shifting strategy running obstacles software development efforts. In private antitrust suits, argument competitor worst enemy established defense. But legal experts say defense may well far less effective federal case government seeking court-mandated changes Microsoft's business practices rather monetary damages goal plaintiffs private cases. It seems debate Netscape's mistakes total sideshow, said Robert Litan, former senior official Justice Department's antitrust division, Brookings Institution. But Microsoft big legal team, seems working every defense find. The book quotes former Netscape executive, Ram Shriram, saying company bungled chance win sizable share browser business America Online Inc. But second-chance deal America Online, leading online service. The government's case focuses earlier deal March 1996, America Online chose Internet Explorer preferred browser; bargain Microsoft agreed place startup icon online service main Windows desktop screen  prime real estate computing. For book entitled Competing Internet Time, intriguing one central themes Netcape got wedded notion Internet revolution would change everything quickly. Microsoft, contrast, stuck three-year planning horizon enabled company, authors write, mesh short-run tactical plans broader strategic view win war. The book quotes Steve Ballmer, Microsoft's president, saying, The fact matter customers can't take cataclysmic change every three months. The organization also can't. You ship products quickly. But can't say, `Oh, radically new strategy' every three months. The government's antitrust scrutiny Microsoft, world's largest independent software company, spanned Republican Democratic administrations involved hundreds government lawyers investigators. But means example consistent, coordinated public policy. Nor, accounts, politics. Instead, software industry itself, government's pursuit Microsoft taken leaps, hit dead ends evolved ways one could controlled predicted back started 1989. It November year, hot afternoon computer-industry convention Las Vegas, Nev., Bill Gates, Microsoft's chairman, looked he'd dragged news conference senior executive IBM  time dominated Microsoft entire computer industry. The two companies  IBM, leading maker personal computers Microsoft, leader PC operating system software  collaborating design marketing new operating system called OS/2. But Microsoft also beginning sell competing product, Windows. The industry trade press full worried articles: system going become new standard? With Gates standing uncomfortably side, James Cannavino, IBM divisional president, said two companies wanted clear air. OS/2 future, said. As Windows, added, would remain niche product under-equipped computers. Windows, asserted, would never receive advanced features OS/2. Gates certainly look happy. But disagree. The news conference got little attention, articles deep newspapers trade publications. But weeks later, Norris Washington, senior antitrust lawyer Federal Trade Commission, happened read one articles, Byte magazine. IBM Microsoft defined unified vision graphical operating environments, article said, looks sort U.S. economic model, divided lower-, middle- upper-class products. As Washington saw it, IBM Microsoft colluding divide operating-system market  potential violation antitrust law. Soon FTC staff opened investigation Microsoft IBM And small first step, Microsoft unrelenting scrutiny federal antitrust investigators constantly evolving series allegations charges, month month, year year, last nine years. Now comes antitrust trial scheduled begin Monday, multiplicity charges woven threads drawn dozen different investigative inquiries nine-year span. Microsoft, today feared company software business carrying stock-market value nearly $234 billion, presents huge highly visible antitrust target. Yet, company's allies ask, What Clinton administration's political agenda going Microsoft? answer seems none. In interviews, dozen current former senior antitrust officials  whether friends government Microsoft  say Justice Department's antitrust suit natural outgrowth previous investigations. As politics, officials agreed antitrust division operates independent administration's political considerations. Charles Rule assistant attorney general headed antitrust division Bush administration, Washington lawyer serves adviser advocate Microsoft. When I there, Rule said Justice days, White House punctilious terms never getting involved decided do. There communication antitrust branches government. Asked believed policy changed Clinton administration, said: Not really. I've seen nothing suggest it. Joel Klein heads antitrust division now, interview dealing division's role Clinton administration's technology policy, specifically relating Microsoft case, said: There statutory restriction, practical matter, civil criminal prosecutions invariably carried political contact. Klein said, way examples, might discuss merger cases involving military aviation industries Defense Department Transportation Department. But never White House, said. For significant case, might call White House say `An hour going hold press conference.'  The last time interference, added, Dita Beard-ITT case. Mrs. Beard, lobbyist ITT Corp., accused 1972 written memo saying $400,000 donation Republican National Convention gone long way settling antitrust suits brought company Nixon administration's Justice Department. The authenticity memo never proved, Mrs. Beard always denied writing it. In case, Klein says, Watergate, immaculate. In case Microsoft, neither President Clinton Vice President Al Gore ever volunteered comment. In answer question news conference May, suit filed, Clinton said: I taken view I comment matters Justice Department. At time, I think I depart policy case, though obviously big impact important sector economy. But I say, based I know date, I confidence way antitrust division Justice Department handled matter. Since then, Clinton said nothing else case, publicly least. And Gore, generally represents administration technology issues, never commented all. In Rule's opinion, administration would foolish involve itself, politically acceptable so. It would little odd administration push Justice Department suit, said. It would policy mistake political mistake. I would hard pressed explain would that. Taking sides highly charged technology world dangerous, particularly Democrats rely Silicon Valley companies political donations support. In fact, present former government officials said suit simply natural extension inquiries conducted last nine years. They began FTC. Soon Washington read article Byte, FTC staff opened investigation Windows-OS/2 question. But happened years, turns market made initial inquiry irrelevant. Microsoft abandoned agreement IBM, Windows quickly grew industry standard, OS/2 remained cipher. But issue faded, government investigators began looking Microsoft found things troubled them. In 1991 Washington, still works FTC, informed Microsoft investigation expanded. The agency, letter said, trying determine whether Microsoft using dominant position operating-systems software stifle competition areas. That general idea lies heart present suit. One former senior FTC official said commission staff confidence case realized Reagan-era commissioners, approve suit, might different view. We knew commission might difficulty monopolization case, former official said. They brought case years. And fact, 1993 commission voted 2-2 question whether file formal charges. The deadlock served dismissal. Then, months later, Justice Department decided pick case. It farther cases got, recalled Robert Litan, former senior official Justice Department's antitrust division Brookings Institution. Usually case would two three people complaining documents, said. But fully researched record. They gave us files briefed us done. The Justice Department lawyers picked thread. The general idea inquiry, Litan said, allowed use monopoly operating systems cement monopoly areas. In 1995, Microsoft government reached consent agreement company promised stop forcing PC makers buy one copy Microsoft operating system every computer sold  instead one every computer operating system, MS-DOS Windows, installed. The company also agreed stop tying sale one software product sale another. The charges present suit similar many ways. Even agreement, government investigations continued. That year, Justice Department investigators showed offices Netscape Communications Corp. first time ask questions next line inquiry. America Online complaining, senior Netscape executive recalled, Microsoft bundling Microsoft Network, competing online service, Windows. Once more, market forces overtook investigation. The Microsoft Network never grew particularly popular America Online prospered grew. But, surprisingly, new complaints filled void. In May 1995, Anne Bingaman, assistant attorney general headed antitrust division, remarked: We get complaints Microsoft time. We become kind Microsoft complaints center. And take seriously. In 1996, Netscape's first complaint arrived. In letter Justice Department, Netscape said Microsoft using dominance personal-computer operating systems force persuade computer makers favor Microsoft's browser, used explore World Wide Web, one marketed Netscape. The next year Justice Department formally charged Microsoft violating consent agreement tying sales Windows installation company's Web browser new computers. It seemed slam-dunk violation consent decree, natural extension case, recalled Litan, left department then. A Federal District Court judge agreed, Appeals Court panel overturned ruling summer. In meantime, last May Justice Department 20 state attorneys general filed new suit Microsoft, scheduled trial Monday. It contends Microsoft engaged bundling, tying predatory behavior similar many ways numerous previous allegations investigations last nine years. A good part case Round II case dealt Round I, early 1990s, Litan said. Or, former senior FTC official put it, there's certainly common thread runs way here. But years thread twisted, pulled spun hundreds different hands. The case United States vs. Microsoft Corp., government's aggressive move monopolist almost 25 years, playing century antitrust laws broadly worded court rulings ambiguous sides citing rulings support opposing arguments. Whatever outcome trial, scheduled begin Monday U.S. District Court Washington, almost certain appeal leave Supreme Court task bringing legal order 100 years clashing antitrust doctrines. The case focuses Microsoft's Windows, operating system controls 90 percent personal computers sold today. The government says objective curb illegal monopolistic business practices threaten render large parts economy vulnerable vicissitudes single company. Microsoft asserts case intended give government control features added Windows. However grand economic stakes, legal dispute narrow. The government says Microsoft's contracts computer manufacturers companies provide access Internet illegally stifle competition. The contracts prohibit manufacturers substituting Netscape Communications Corp.'s Navigator browser Microsoft's Internet Explorer. They also prohibit removing Windows main screen, desktop, links sites World Wide Web run Microsoft partners. Microsoft's contracts companies connect people Internet businesses sell goods services Web require favored treatment Internet Explorer Navigator exchange links Windows desktop. In wake lawsuit, Microsoft voluntarily dropped requirements, though could reinstate will. Microsoft says contracts legal produce tangible benefits customers, including easier Internet access. The Justice Department says bundling Explorer Windows 95 inclusion browser part Windows 98 amount tying, illegal practice forces customers one product purchase another. The contracts manufacturers Internet services illegal, government says, intended create monopoly browser market protect Microsoft's existing monopoly operating systems. The latter threat key, according Justice Department. Browsers potential, operating system, act software platform programs run. So contracts intended drive browsers market would also insulate Windows monopoly. Many antitrust experts say problem facing Justice Department courts provided clear definition tying clear guidelines determining contracts illegally exclusionary. Professor Lawrence White New York University, chief economist Justice Department's antitrust division early 1980s, says courts treat tying unusual practice fact ubiquitous. No one, said, would challenge right manufacturers tie erasers tip pencils, tires automobile buttons shirts. His point, shared widely economists, tying benefits consumers if, example, results products easier use enables company recover development costs. But tying bad locks monopoly power. The courts, White says, offered enough guidance distinguishing good tying bad, nub legal dispute. Microsoft says needs show bundling Windows Explorer passes might called gross consumer benefits test  offers immediate benefit, whether causes long-term damage competition and, therefore, ultimately consumers. The Justice Department says Microsoft's practices must clear higher hurdle: yielding net consumer benefits immediate large enough balance possible long-term harm competition. So test consumer benefits satisfies antitrust laws? The simple answer one knows sure, sides reasonably cite cases fear embarrassment. Consider 1985 case, Aspen Skiing Co. vs. Aspen Highlands Skiing Corp., 1951 case, Lorain Journal Co. vs. United States. In first, Aspen Skiing, owner three major ski runs Aspen, Colo.  monopolist  years sold ticket cooperation Aspen Highlands, competitor, gave skiers access companies' runs. When Aspen Skiing unilaterally canceled agreement, rival's revenues shriveled rival sued. The Supreme Court ruled Aspen Skiing violated antitrust laws evidence action helped consumers. In Lorain Journal case, local newspaper Lorain, Ohio, refused sell advertising companies advertised new radio station. Here, too, Supreme Court ruled exclusionary practice nothing benefit consumers. Indeed, Aspen Skiing, court forced monopolist business rival, precedent augurs well Justice Department, seeks force Microsoft install Netscape's browser alongside own. But Charles Rule, legal consultant Microsoft, says cases courts threw exclusionary practices offered consumer benefit. The courts, argues, never pounced practices resulted lower prices better products service. Nor courts either case call balancing immediate benefits hypothetical long-term harm. Rule argues Microsoft's practices produce demonstrable consumer benefits. Besides, says, actions taken The Lorain Journal Aspen Skiing, Microsoft's contracts prevent consumers installing Netscape's browser using Web sites Microsoft's rivals. In truth, though, neither case answered consumer benefit test apply product design. In Jefferson Parish Hospital District No. 2 et al. vs. Hyde, another case cited sides, Supreme Court 1984 recognized surgeons anesthesiologists provide integrated service. Yet, court said, hospital monopoly power would still allowed force surgical patients use panel anesthesiologists consumers wanted purchase two services separately. That principle could undercut Microsoft's defense functional interdependence Windows Explorer requires bundling. But Microsoft point strong concurring opinion called tougher standard government meet alleges tying. Microsoft also draw support several court rulings allowed IBM change design computers ways made hard vendors attach peripheral equipment. But perhaps Microsoft's best argument nowhere government identified single case courts explicitly called throwing tied product basis balancing test. The courts, Microsoft emphasize, steer clear redesigning technically sophisticated products. The Justice Department's rejoinder note sole purpose antitrust law protect consumers, makes sense bless practices provide dollar's worth benefits today but, stamping competition, drive prices $1,000 tomorrow. The Justice Department ask court least insist monopolists use least exclusionary means possible achieve services provide customers. Experts agree courts subject Microsoft's restrictive contracts Internet companies balancing test. But exactly court decide whether consumers helped hurt grabs. A balancing test would courts weigh immediate benefits consumers one-click access Internet sites features bundled Windows-Explorer package harm time diminished competition markets browsers operating systems. But test makes good sense theory prove fiendishly difficult use practice. Balancing tests impossibly difficult arbitrary, said Rep. Thomas Campbell, R-Calif., former law professor Stanford University. The practical effect balancing hand defendants Microsoft almost certain victory. Microsoft argues  many antitrust experts agree  courts fact gravitated away balancing test simpler predation test exclusionary contracts. Under standard, contract illegal intended drive competition thus pave way monopolist raise prices later. Microsoft easier time defending charge predation, amounts victimizing customers, would defending charge bundled product consumers slightly harm good. The antitrust record, says William Baxter, headed antitrust division President Reagan, littered contradictory, ambiguous sometimes nonsensical verdicts. He legal experts agree nothing else, record leaves plenty legal leeway Supreme Court, hear Microsoft case, stiffen spine antitrust law. The legal tool government using assault Microsoft Corp.

But trusts, large national holding corporations, viewed many engines modernization industrialization. Economists time opposed Sherman Act, law Congress passed vaguely worded compromise. No one knew impact would have, one senator, quoted Matthew Josephson's The Robber Barons, explained nearly everyone agreed something must flung appease restive masses. The act's two key provisions, Sections 1 2, mention conspiracy, restraint trade attempt monopolize. Yet Sherman Act interpreted Magna Carta competition, never uses term. After passed, critics trusts derided impenetrable language Sherman Act called Swiss Cheese Act. But early 1900s, political climate changed. The growing antagonism trusts, especially income gaps widened, tapped avowed trustbuster, Theodore Roosevelt, became president 1901. The Sherman Act always elastic piece social legislation, used attack perceived exploitation aggregation power, said Eleanor Fox, professor New York University Law School. The model trust  principal target trustbusters  Standard Oil. Shrewdly, Roosevelt made distinction good trusts, thrived superior efficiency, bad trusts, grew result inevitable economic forces unfair business practices. Throughout 1880s '90s, Standard Oil's rivals complained company business practices founder, John D. Rockefeller. But years, price kerosene  burned light nation's homes declined steadily. So Standard Oil, could could reasonably argued, enterprising monopoly. In early 1900s, though, Standard Oil raised prices United States prop profits time engaged price war Royal Dutch/Shell Europe, Standard Oil face genuine competition. When consumers hurt Standard Oil monopoly, popular support antitrust action company swelled, encouraged Roosevelt successor, William Howard Taft. The federal suit Standard Oil filed 1906, Supreme Court approved breakup company 1911. Standard Oil Microsoft case, historians observe, common themes. Both dominant companies day, Bill Gates, Microsoft chairman, called modern Rockefeller. But presidential involvement real consumer dissatisfaction Microsoft case, said Ron Chernow, author Titan, best-selling biography Rockefeller. And Rockefeller, Chernow added, never went kind honeymoon period widespread public adulation favorable press coverage Bill Gates had. In summer 1995, whiff revolution air Silicon Valley. The Internet offered new deal computing, fresh opportunity entrepreneurs try break Microsoft Corp.'s firm grip personal computer software business. Leading challenge Netscape Communications Corp., whose software browsing World Wide Web ignited Internet boom. Netscape chairman James Clark spoke boldly attacking Microsoft head-on. He borrowed imagery movie Star Wars, referring Microsoft Death Star Netscape leader rebel alliance. Microsoft answered vengeance. It dispatched hundreds programmers work competing browser poured many millions dollars marketing it. It prodded computer makers distribute browser, folded browser industry-dominant Windows operating system gave browser away free  campaign intended cut air supply, senior Microsoft executive described it. But competitors Netscape encountered Microsoft's force. Microsoft's partners, corporate customers professional investors finance new ventures collided it. A close look Microsoft's no-holds-barred push Internet software business offers window ways company uses market muscle influence behavior virtually every player industry. Some cases recounted figure prominently suit brought Justice Department 20 states, scheduled go trial month, charging Microsoft times went far  violated antitrust laws. Regardless legal outcome, previously unreported details incidents suit examples provide complete picture Microsoft action.  When Compaq Computer Corp. considered loading Netscape's browser instead Microsoft's personal computers, Microsoft threatened stop selling Windows operating system Compaq. The company quickly changed mind.  After Spyglass Inc. began supplying Microsoft early browser technology, Microsoft announced would give away browser free. The timing came rude surprise partner Spyglass. The company lost revenues almost overnight, technology, also licensing companies Microsoft, suddenly became available free.  When America Online Inc., competes fiercely Microsoft's online service electronic commerce divisions, went shopping browser technology, Microsoft made offer good pass up: If America Online used Microsoft's browser main one millions subscribers, Microsoft would give America Online prime placement desktop screen personal computers using Windows.  When Intel Corp. began developing Internet software, Microsoft complained. Intel, leading maker microprocessors serve electronic brains personal computers running Windows, pulled back. The chip maker decided lucrative hand-in-glove partnership Microsoft took priority.  Microsoft's reach computing become pervasive nearly every year now, Silicon Valley's top venture capitalists meet privately team top Microsoft executives learn company's plans. The goal, one venture investor observed, stay way steamroller. Microsoft adamantly denies broken laws similar situations. The company plays game business hard, executives acknowledge apology. Yes, Microsoft says, rivals may suffer partners may irritated occasionally. But company insists actions guided main corporate goal bringing new technology inexpensively conveniently millions people use software. Most people computer industry say living Microsoft's world means routinely making accommodations it. Microsoft's power emanates near-monopoly market personal computer operating systems, master control programs run computers. Because owns operating system, Microsoft essential utility information age, said James Moore, president Geopartners Research Inc., technology consulting firm. It acts kind gatekeeper pipeline computing innovation, sitting deciding whether help innovation slow down. For months, Microsoft Netscape talked off, circling warily. But event would define unflinching rivals meeting June 21, 1995, second-floor conference room Netscape's headquarters Mountain View, Calif. That meeting, according Justice Department 20 states suing Microsoft, high-tech equivalent storied gatherings smoke-filled railroad cars inspired passage nation's antitrust laws century ago. On day, say, Microsoft made Netscape illegal offer divvy market Internet browsing software, collusion pact Netscape rejected. Microsoft replies prosecutors misinterpreting routine meeting software business company never tried divide browser market. Bill Gates, Microsoft's chairman principal strategist, attend Mountain View gathering, consulted telephone Microsoft team. Two people attend June meeting named witnesses trial scheduled begin next week: Netscape president James Barksdale Daniel Rosen, Microsoft's general manager new technology. In trial, government contend Microsoft presented Netscape all-or-nothing offer, according people questioned federal investigation. Relying heavily notes taken meeting Netscape executive vice president Marc Andreessen testimony Barksdale, prosecutors expected assert Microsoft proposal several elements, incentives requirements. Microsoft, according people questioned government, would invest Netscape, taking 15 20 percent stake, give Netscape technical information fine-tune Microsoft's operating systems Netscape's software would run better Windows. In return, people say, Netscape would give Microsoft seat board, license technology Microsoft, give Microsoft advance knowledge product-development efforts make browser next generation Microsoft operating system, Windows 95, shipped two months June 1995 meeting. And Microsoft, people added, always denied  used access technology powerful lever business negotiations, offering Netscape preferential access Windows application program interfaces, APIs, links enable companies' programs run smoothly Windows operating system. By turning deal, Netscape, say, would preferred access Microsoft technology  threat Microsoft fiercely denies making. Barksdale, Netscape's 55-year-old chief executive, told colleague encounter Microsoft June 1995 damnedest meeting I've ever attended 35 years business. Had Netscape accepted Microsoft's offer, would Microsoft's money endorsement. Netscape would also free sell browser use earlier versions Windows use operating systems Apple's Macintosh Unix, powerful system used mainly corporations research labs. But licensed technology Microsoft stepped aside, best could hoped becoming company sales $100 million hoping bought Microsoft, said Clark, former computer scientist Stanford University founded Silicon Graphics Inc., computer graphics pioneer, starting Netscape. We start Netscape that. For company, meeting Microsoft charged affair. Every computing device keyboards disk drives, every software program games browsers, must mesh smoothly Microsoft's Windows operating system. This necessary make computers reliable easier use, also gives Microsoft role industry's gatekeeper. And Microsoft makes manner software products operating system, companies put uneasy position requiring Microsoft's cooperation able compete it. And software industry, every program rendered digital code 1's 0's, lines divide competition cooperation blurred. The talk line Microsoft-Netscape meeting focused division operating system  platform, computer terms  application programs, sometimes called solutions, run top operating system. The government suit states sworn testimony, Chris Jones, Microsoft manager attended meeting, admitted Microsoft `absolutely' intended persuade Netscape compete. Microsoft reads Jones' testimony differently, evidence mainly company's clarifying position. If Netscape stayed applications solutions side operating system, two companies could partners, Microsoft said. But Netscape tried become player platform space, would compete. Microsoft released portions Jones deposition September evidence government quoted Microsoft manager context. Q. Do recall discussion desire anybody part Microsoft participating able persuade influence Netscape compete? A. Absolutely. But again, persuade sense force persuade sense of, hey, think great business relationship together. Later deposition, Justice Department lawyer asked Jones whether Microsoft executives intended suggest would consequences Netscape business Netscape chose go platform direction described earlier opposed solutions direction. Jones replied: The conversation something following: `We're platform business. We're going invest heavily part platform feel critical technologies. That's done deal.' And we're asking them: `What business? Is business platforms solutions? If platforms, we're platforms business. We're competing.' Microsoft portrays comments innocuous statements fact. But Netscape, remarks could taken warning, threat. This Internet browsing software potential become alternative platform Windows operating system. The browser, sitting top operating system, could supplant Windows main desktop screen users' machines main layer programming starting software applications. In addition, Netscape's browser could serve powerful platform distributing running Java, Internet programming language developed Sun Microsystems Inc., Microsoft rival. In technical terms, Netscape's upstart platform could replace Microsoft's APIs essential utility computing. Indeed, Andreessen boasted public Netscape's ambition relegate Microsoft's Windows much software plumbing browser. By June meeting, Microsoft certainly viewed Netscape serious potential challenger Windows, corporate crown jewel. On May 26, 1995, internal memo, The Internet Tidal Wave, Gates wrote: A new competitor `born' Internet Netscape. Their browser dominant 70 percent usage share, allowing determine network extensions catch on. Netscape's strategy, Gates wrote, move key API browser commoditize underlying operating system. THE BROADER INQUIRY: GOVERNMENT SEES ARM-TWISTING The federal government states recently broadened allegations Microsoft adding evidence tried bully Intel, Apple Computer Inc. companies squelch competition. They say Netscape meeting new evidence fits pattern behavior Microsoft, repeatedly tried limit competition strong-arming competitors partners. One episode fits pattern, prosecutors contend, effort Microsoft pressure Intel shelve development multimedia Internet software limit cooperation Netscape. Intel's main business making microprocessor chips act electronic brains computers run Windows operating system. Indeed, fortunes Intel Microsoft closely aligned two companies sometimes referred single, powerful entity, Wintel. But Intel also employs hundreds software engineers, mainly Intel Architecture Labs Hillsboro, Ore. And Intel Microsoft partners, also conflicts, typically direction pace certain innovations introduced personal computer industry, dominate together. Federal state investigators focused Microsoft's strong reaction work done Intel's software engineers  sentiment expressed uncertain terms meeting Intel's Santa Clara, Calif., headquarters Aug. 2, 1995. The contentious session attended several executives Intel Microsoft, including Gates Intel chairman Andrew Grove. An internal Intel memo stated Gates made vague threats supporting Intel's competitors livid Intel's investments Internet wanted stopped. Later, Intel pull back multimedia Internet software development. Steven McGeady, Intel vice president attended August 1995 meeting, scheduled appear witness government. Microsoft replies government's accounts meetings Netscape Intel fanciful distortions, created using biased selection documents witnesses. The government's case, Microsoft asserts, betrays utter failure accept computer-industry reality Microsoft routinely meets companies make sure software equipment work well Windows. Sometimes talks, Microsoft says, go include levels cooperation licensing technology Microsoft investment, company discussed Netscape. In trial, Microsoft expected argue advance browser market result business acumen Netscape's missteps. To document Netscape's errors, Microsoft issued subpoena last month obtained unpublished manuscript new book, Competing Internet Time: Lessons From Netscape Its Battle With Microsoft, based hundreds interviews current former Netscape executives. The book chronicle mistakes made Netscape. But authors, Michael Cusumano Massachusetts Institute Technology's Sloan School Management David Yoffie Harvard Business School, think Microsoft hardly blameless. Microsoft's take-no-prisoners strategy backfired, inviting retaliation competitors, government customers, Yoffie said. Emphasizing offering legal judgment, Yoffie added, I think Microsoft could achieved 90 percent crossing line much did. THE SPYGLASS LINK: REWARDS AND PERILS OF A PARTNERSHIP On April 6, 1994, Gates 20 Microsoft executives gathered daylong retreat far company's headquarters Redmond, Wash. The subject Internet might revolutionize computer software business. Few concrete plans made day, Microsoft executives insist direction set. Our vision outset unite two worlds Windows desktop Internet, said Steven Sinofsky, Microsoft executive attended meeting. Yet Microsoft badly trailed Netscape browser field. To hasten entry, Microsoft licensed early browsing software Spyglass Inc. Naperville, Ill. The first meeting two companies initiated Spyglass April 1994. At time, tiny company eager deal Microsoft. Spyglass selected commercial licensee browser technology developed National Center Supercomputing University Illinois. In summer 1994, Douglas Colbeth, president Spyglass, met Clark Netscape O'Hare International Airport Chicago. The two men talked United Airlines Red Carpet Room, reserved business-class passengers, Colbeth recalled Clark telling him, We're going take Microsoft head-on. At time, Colbeth recalled thinking himself, Great, Microsoft really want license me. Today, noted: Remember, company couple dozen people almost money bank. Netscape Jim Clark, money reputation, big-time venture capital backing Silicon Valley. Netscape different agenda. By July 1994, Microsoft become quite interested Spyglass technology, Colbeth says, two companies signed first licensing agreement December. Microsoft, Colbeth recalls, always told would eventually fold browser technology operating system, timing accelerated Netscape's rapid rise. Microsoft initially hoping charge browser, Colbeth said. But Dec. 7, 1995, Gates declared Microsoft would deeply integrate browser Windows would give away. The announcement caught industry, Colbeth, surprise. At time, Spyglass licensed technology 82 companies, including IBM Digital Equipment, use software products  licensing revenue stream $20 million year. As result Microsoft's move, Spyglass saw revenues vanish year, smaller Internet software companies went business big customers shifted Microsoft's free browser. Spyglass slashed payroll scrambled new niches software industry replace lost sales, succeeded eventually. Whenever license technology Microsoft, understand someday build itself, drop operating system put business, Colbeth said. THE NONOPTION COMPAQ: SUDDENLY SEES THE LIGHT Well 1996, Netscape's share browser market continued rise, Microsoft made little headway, though browser free. Industry analysts trade magazines agreed Netscape's browser clear technical leader. In April 1996, Netscape's Navigator used 87 percent people browsing Web, compared 4 percent using Microsoft's Internet Explorer, according Zona Research. So biggest personal computer maker, Compaq, thought made sense give customers Netscape's browser instead Microsoft's. But Microsoft would stand  Compaq choice give in. In June 1996, Compaq wanted load popular Netscape browser machines also remove icon Microsoft's Internet Explorer, delivered computer maker Windows 95. Microsoft informed Compaq removed Internet Explorer, computer maker would lose license Windows, said Stephen Decker, Compaq's director software procurement, testimony federal investigators. The ultimatum Microsoft delivered bluntly letter headed, Notice Intent Terminate License Agreement. Faced denied essential operating system, Compaq quickly reversed course kept Internet Explorer icon. Microsoft asserts Windows Internet Explorer single product Microsoft alone defines product. Nothing contracts, Microsoft adds, prohibits computer makers including competing technologies. While cutoff letter Microsoft sent Compaq seems unnecessarily hardball tactic dealing largest corporate customer, Microsoft chief operating officer Bob Herbold insists take one letter one snippet e-mail try portray Microsoft arrogant company unfair. Noting Compaq executive witness Microsoft, Herbold said, We totally dependent tremendous relationships key companies Compaq. At Netscape, however, Compaq episode watershed. That singular act got going Justice Department, Barksdale recalled. Barksdale said regarded Microsoft's tactic forcing Compaq buy browser condition obtaining essential product, Windows operating system, illegal act absolute proof Microsoft monopolist. After investigating incident, Justice Department states agreed Barksdale Microsoft illegally tying sale one product another. Microsoft replies long history adding new features operating system. And outset, Microsoft says, intended Windows Internet Explorer browser would seamlessly integrated, Windows 98. Thus, Microsoft insists, product-tying violation antitrust laws. In separate case, federal appeals court sided Microsoft, upholding principle company could put wanted operating system declare single product. But June 1996, Compaq wanted offer Netscape product instead Microsoft's browser, industry experts viewed browser operating system two different software programs. It took long time integration strategy play out, said former senior Microsoft researcher. Back then, integration basically bolting browser Windows. THE `BALANCING ACT': AMERICA ONLINE TOSSES IN TOWEL America Online chairman Stephen Case refers dealing Microsoft delicate balancing act. That balance swung sharply fall 1995 spring 1996, Microsoft used lure giving America Online featured place Windows desktop ultimate bargaining chip. To gain access computing's coveted real estate, America Online agreed make Microsoft's Internet Explorer main browser online subscribers, number 13 million. Yet throughout 1995, Microsoft prepared introduce Windows 95, significant improvement ever operating system, Case knocking door Justice Department. His complaint Microsoft going place new online service, Microsoft Network, direct competitor America Online, prominently desktop screen Windows 95, introduced August. This bundling tactic using industry-dominant operating system market Microsoft Network, MSN, Case argued, gave Microsoft unfair advantage young fast-growing online business. The Justice Department listened investigated. But ultimately, government decided taking action. At America Online's headquarters Vienna, Va., Microsoft feared loathed time. America Online designated Microsoft watcher, young M.B.A. tracked adversary's every move. Above desk small, windowless office picture Gates. Beneath picture, large block letters, words THE ENEMY. Though America Online clear leader online services business, ample reason worry all-out assault rival rich aggressive Microsoft. When visited Microsoft headquarters couple years earlier, Case recalled, Gates bluntly assessed Microsoft's options saying could buy 20 percent America Online, enter online business bury you. A threat merely statement facts? A bit both, Case said recently. But mainly articulating everybody meeting kind intuitively understood. Yet 1996, Microsoft America Online found reason cooperate. With exploding popularity Internet's World Wide Web, conventional online companies, America Online Compuserve, provide customers Internet access well services. America Online browser, keep pace rapidly advancing technology made sense deal Netscape Microsoft. For software companies, deal America Online, 5 million subscribers time, could mean big surge browser use market share. Netscape seemed natural partner America Online, companies Microsoft rivals. On March 11, America Online announce would buy Netscape technology, standard licensing deal based payment-for-use formula. The next day, America Online announced significant deal Microsoft making browser default technology  browser America Online subscribers would use unless specifically asked Netscape's Navigator. To win deal, Microsoft offered give America Online start-up icon Windows desktop  precisely kind equal treatment main Windows screen Case asked Justice Department require Microsoft. After agreed Internet Explorer browser, Microsoft allowed us bundled Windows desktop, Case said. It example Microsoft's pragmatic side. The pragmatic decision paramount corporate goal increase browser market share protect mainstay software business. As result, new online service, MSN, would sacrifice important marketing advantage main rival, America Online. It Bill's decision, said former MSN general manager Russell Siegelman, referring Gates. He sent e-mail it. He said think would hurt MSN much. I disagreed him. To Microsoft executives, Gates expressed different view likely impact MSN. He told senior vice president Brad Silverberg putting America Online Windows desktop would amount putting bullet MSN's head, according deposition taken Justice Department. In antitrust suit, government asserts America Online deal shows Microsoft used power Windows monopoly give edge browser war Netscape. David Colburn, senior vice president America Online took part browser negotiations Microsoft, witness government. Today, Microsoft overhauled Internet strategy focus mainly building popular special-interest Web sites fields travel, personal finance, automobile retailing news. And putting sites, e-mail search features, all-in-one site uses name MSN.com. I still regard Microsoft primary threat, Case observed. Microsoft history getting right long run, there's reason think business well. We always Microsoft's cross hairs. THE LESSON: DON'T CONFRONT A STEAMROLLER At Netscape's headquarters Silicon Valley, strategy today one avoiding head-to-head competition Microsoft whenever possible. Don't something Microsoft's path  that's lesson learned, observed Clark, Netscape chairman. Silicon Valley's venture capitalists, investors finance many nation's high-tech startups, generally follow Netscape formula days. Yet still leaves ample room prosper. For competing directly Microsoft dangerous, software industry whole engine wealth creation, job generation technical innovation. And ambivalent side venture community's relationship Microsoft. For start-up cannot steer clear Microsoft entirely, favored option bought Microsoft, scooped many fledgling companies way acquiring promising technology people. Microsoft understands start-up innovation co-opt start-up innovation better high-tech company, said James Breyer, managing partner Accel Partners, venture capital firm. As Microsoft grown, come seen merely competitor force nature shapes business environment, weather front. Microsoft incredibly pervasive, said Stewart Alsop, partner New Enterprise Associates, venture capital firm Menlo Park, Calif. At board meetings companies firm invested, two issues always come up, said: One price company's stock, Microsoft going do. In last years, Microsoft offered guidance almost yearly meetings senior Microsoft executives leading venture capitalists. The meetings part Microsoft's effort improve sometimes prickly relations Silicon Valley. We work hard provide clarity we're going we're going, said Greg Maffei, Microsoft's chief financial officer. Last year's conference took place October Quadrus office building Sand Hill Road Menlo Park, Wall Street high-tech venture investing. Maffei led team five Microsoft executives appeared group 40 venture capitalists, one stood asked question seemed minds many peers: How I invest company stays way steamroller? Maffei, recalled one person attended meeting, stood delivered brief lecture businesses Microsoft likely avoid. His list included specialized software manufacturing, human resources management, computer-aided design others. But, person noted, broad swaths industry appeared designated limits  including new software platforms might compete Microsoft's personal computer operating system. At one point, Ruthann Quindlen, partner Institutional Venture Partners, leaned Vinod Khosla, co-founder Sun Microsystems partner venture capital firm Kleiner Perkins Caufield &AMP; Byers, said quietly, I guess leaves us washing machines toasters. Following text first two sections Sherman Act, passed Congress 1890. As foundation federal antitrust law built, act amended several times  elevating crime felony, increasing fines prison terms individuals setting fines corporations convicted violating it. In case Microsoft, government invoked Sherman Act file civil suit seeks change company's business practices, criminal suit seeks financial penalties. An Act Protect Trade And Commerce Against Unlawful Restraints Monopolies: Section 1. Every contract, combination form trust otherwise, conspiracy, restraint trade commerce several States, foreign nations, hereby declared illegal. Every person shall make contract engage combination conspiracy, shall deemed guilty misdemeanor, and, conviction thereof, shall punished fine exceeding five thousand dollars, imprisonment exceeding one year, said punishments, discretion court. Section 2. Every person shall monopolize, attempt monopolize, combine conspire person persons, monopolize part trade commerce several States, foreign nations, shall deemed guilty misdemeanor, and, conviction thereof, shall punished fine exceeding five thousand dollars, imprisonment exceeding one year, said punishments, discretion court. Will matter consumers Bill Gates nice guy? Until last week, Americans thought Gates, chairman Microsoft Corp., genius innovator. A nerd perhaps  also self-styled visionary almost single-handedly unlocked power personal computer. Monday, however, Washington courtroom, Justice Department began painting different, darker portrait Gates. In antitrust suit brought department 20 states, man whose company commands 97 percent share market personal computer operating systems depicted Nixonian schemer go almost length crush competition. Product innovation, suit argues, sufficient weapon Gates. Flashing back forth snippets Gates' videotaped deposition e-mail messages sent contradicted testimony, government sought establish pattern threats offers payments Microsoft chairman. It also sought cast Gates obsessed man feared tiny Netscape Communications Corp. potential threat domination market Internet browsers, software used navigate World Wide Web. Gates portrayed Justice Department litigator David Boies schoolyard bully rides roughshod computer industry crudeness stark contrast popular image benevolent dictator high-technology guru. According document presented Boies, example, Gates asked America Online executives 1996: How much need pay damage Netscape? This lucky day. The implication, Boies said, amount irrelevant, Microsoft, deep pockets market dominance, makes many offers can't refuse needed achieve goals. Microsoft officials closely watching market surveys hint new image bare-knuckled Gates might detracting company's world-famous brand name, insist public continue draw distinction allegations anticompetitive business tactics company's software. Despite reading press, people judge us products, said Mich Matthews, head Microsoft's corporate public-relations office. Our experience people vote pocketbooks. So far, consumers casting positive votes. Last week Microsoft reported quarterly profits $1.52 billion, stunning 58 percent increase level year earlier. Despite record profits, marketing experts say public comes view Gates Rockefeller-style robber baron, company brand name may suffer. When company visible chief executive, CEO really driver brand, said David Aaker, brand marketing expert Haas School Business University California Berkeley. There question going affect Microsoft's brand recognition. Already early warning signals, political cartoons newspapers country bashed Gates last week. One showed holding globe saying, If play way, I'll take ball go home; another portrayed Microsoft chairman standing next henchman dangling someone window Microsoft secretary says caller, I'm sorry, Mr. Gates busy teaching competitor Windows. But industry analysts believe new view Bill Gates knows play hardball may bad thing company. The he-said, she-said e-mail messages dragged court cases Washington Silicon Valley, Microsoft locked legal battle archrival, Sun Microsystems Inc., viewed little different exaggerated trash talking goes professional sports. It's taking Charles Barkley Michael Jordan say ball court turning something sinister really is, said Paul Andrews, co-author Stephen Manes Gates (Doubleday, 1993). Indeed, evidence darker view Gates company far taken root District Columbia Silicon Valley, computer industry long felt impact Gates' tactics, bitterness distrust Microsoft deep. In rest country, Gates continues enjoy great popularity. Two weeks ago, speaking crowd almost 7,000 students Indiana University, questioner asked Justice Department's suit roundly booed. BILL GATES, WHIPPING BOY c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service Is Bill Gates high-tech Machiavelli, Public Enemy No. 1 threat known universe? All three, judging numerous political cartoons popped newspapers country last week. From Chattanooga Boston, cartoonists took delight demonizing Gates, facing unexpected public relations challenge Microsoft's antitrust trial unfolds Washington. Other cartoons ran gamut predictable (a worker, pointing aquarium large fish gobbling smaller ones, saying visitors, Welcome Microsoft's research development department) weird (a dweebish man hunched front computer screen staring words: Our beloved leader, Mr. Gates, attack. Leave possessions. Go desert. Await spaceship). And Week One trial. Stay tuned. A federal judge Friday pushed back starting date antitrust trial Microsoft Corp. four days, Oct. 19, also ordering company comply Justice Department's request examine Microsoft's financial records. Microsoft argued allowing army government attorneys come make demands make difficult us remain business. But winning assurances government lawyers would make narrow, targeted searches records, Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson U.S. District Court District Columbia ordered Microsoft open database perusal. Microsoft asked trial delayed several months prepare defense said last minute broadening case Justice Department, added new evidence. Last month, government said process preparing trial discovered Microsoft tried persuade Apple Computer market Quicktime multimedia software Windows customers. On Thursday, Justice Department 20 states added two new people witness list testify Microsoft dealings Apple Sun Microsystems. Avi Tevanian, former Apple executive, added witness list part describe Microsoft's proposal, Microsoft denies ever made. The new witness James Gosling, Sun executive led development Java, Internet programming language Microsoft sees potential threat company's dominance software market. The government charging Microsoft took illegal steps prevent Java gaining wide acceptance. To counter that, Microsoft named two new witnesses Friday, Robert Muglia, senior Microsoft executive worked Sun, Chris Engstrom, executive handled Microsoft's dealings Apple. At time, John Warden, Microsoft's lawyer, argued new allegations place case. The Justice Department, Warden told judge, trying turn something approximating plenary monopoly case IBM case. It becomes clearer clearer clearer new filing trying turn broader case, said. You can't bait-and-switch file complaint alleging A, B, C, talk whole alphabet three times over. As result, Warden said, Microsoft wanted, minimum, another two-week delay, though normal schedule would trial start next year. The judge respond. Instead entered order setting Oct. 19 trial date. Late Friday, Microsoft entered formal motion asking another two-week delay. A response expected next week. The case United States vs. Microsoft Corp., government's aggressive move monopolist almost 25 years, playing century antitrust laws broadly worded court rulings ambiguous sides citing rulings support opposing arguments. Whatever outcome trial, scheduled begin Monday U.S. District Court Washington, almost certain appeal leave Supreme Court task bringing legal order 100 years clashing antitrust doctrines. The case focuses Microsoft's Windows, operating system controls 90 percent personal computers sold today. The government says objective curb illegal monopolistic business practices threaten render large parts economy vulnerable vicissitudes single company. Microsoft asserts case intended give government control features added Windows. However grand economic stakes, legal dispute narrow. The government says Microsoft's contracts computer manufacturers companies provide access Internet illegally stifle competition. The contracts prohibit manufacturers substituting Netscape Communications Corp.'s Navigator browser Microsoft's Internet Explorer. They also prohibit removing Windows main screen, desktop, links sites World Wide Web run Microsoft partners. Microsoft's contracts companies connect people Internet businesses sell goods services Web require favored treatment Internet Explorer Navigator exchange links Windows desktop. In wake lawsuit, Microsoft voluntarily dropped requirements, though could reinstate will. Microsoft says contracts legal produce tangible benefits customers, including easier Internet access. The Justice Department says bundling Explorer Windows 95 inclusion browser part Windows 98 amount tying, illegal practice forces customers one product purchase another. The contracts manufacturers Internet services illegal, government says, intended create monopoly browser market protect Microsoft's existing monopoly operating systems. The latter threat key, according Justice Department. Browsers potential, operating system, act software platform programs run. So contracts intended drive browsers market would also insulate Windows monopoly. Many antitrust experts say problem facing Justice Department courts provided clear definition tying clear guidelines determining contracts illegally exclusionary. Professor Lawrence White New York University, chief economist Justice Department's antitrust division early 1980s, says courts treat tying unusual practice fact ubiquitous. No one, said, would challenge right manufacturers tie erasers tip pencils, tires automobile buttons shirts. His point, shared widely economists, tying benefits consumers if, example, results products easier use enables company recover development costs. But tying bad locks monopoly power. The courts, White says, offered enough guidance distinguishing good tying bad, nub legal dispute. Microsoft says needs show bundling Windows Explorer passes might called gross consumer benefits test  offers immediate benefit, whether causes long-term damage competition and, therefore, ultimately consumers. The Justice Department says Microsoft's practices must clear higher hurdle: yielding net consumer benefits immediate large enough balance possible long-term harm competition. So test consumer benefits satisfies antitrust laws? The simple answer one knows sure, sides reasonably cite cases fear embarrassment. Consider 1985 case, Aspen Skiing Co. vs. Aspen Highlands Skiing Corp., 1951 case, Lorain Journal Co. vs. United States. In first, Aspen Skiing, owner three major ski runs Aspen, Colo.  monopolist  years sold ticket cooperation Aspen Highlands, competitor, gave skiers access companies' runs. When Aspen Skiing unilaterally canceled agreement, rival's revenues shriveled rival sued. The Supreme Court ruled Aspen Skiing violated antitrust laws evidence action helped consumers. In Lorain Journal case, local newspaper Lorain, Ohio, refused sell advertising companies advertised new radio station. Here, too, Supreme Court ruled exclusionary practice nothing benefit consumers. Indeed, Aspen Skiing, court forced monopolist business rival, precedent augurs well Justice Department, seeks force Microsoft install Netscape's browser alongside own. But Charles Rule, legal consultant Microsoft, says cases courts threw exclusionary practices offered consumer benefit. The courts, argues, never pounced practices resulted lower prices better products service. Nor courts either case call balancing immediate benefits hypothetical long-term harm. Rule argues Microsoft's practices produce demonstrable consumer benefits. Besides, says, actions taken The Lorain Journal Aspen Skiing, Microsoft's contracts prevent consumers installing Netscape's browser using Web sites Microsoft's rivals. In truth, though, neither case answered consumer benefit test apply product design. In Jefferson Parish Hospital District No. 2 et al. vs. Hyde, another case cited sides, Supreme Court 1984 recognized surgeons anesthesiologists provide integrated service. Yet, court said, hospital monopoly power would still allowed force surgical patients use panel anesthesiologists consumers wanted purchase two services separately. That principle could undercut Microsoft's defense functional interdependence Windows Explorer requires bundling. But Microsoft point strong concurring opinion called tougher standard government meet alleges tying. Microsoft also draw support several court rulings allowed IBM change design computers ways made hard vendors attach peripheral equipment. But perhaps Microsoft's best argument nowhere government identified single case courts explicitly called throwing tied product basis balancing test. The courts, Microsoft emphasize, steer clear redesigning technically sophisticated products. The Justice Department's rejoinder note sole purpose antitrust law protect consumers, makes sense bless practices provide dollar's worth benefits today but, stamping competition, drive prices $1,000 tomorrow. The Justice Department ask court least insist monopolists use least exclusionary means possible achieve services provide customers. Experts agree courts subject Microsoft's restrictive contracts Internet companies balancing test. But exactly court decide whether consumers helped hurt grabs. A balancing test would courts weigh immediate benefits consumers one-click access Internet sites features bundled Windows-Explorer package harm time diminished competition markets browsers operating systems. But test makes good sense theory prove fiendishly difficult use practice. Balancing tests impossibly difficult arbitrary, said Rep. Thomas Campbell, R-Calif., former law professor Stanford University. The practical effect balancing hand defendants Microsoft almost certain victory. Microsoft argues  many antitrust experts agree  courts fact gravitated away balancing test simpler predation test exclusionary contracts. Under standard, contract illegal intended drive competition thus pave way monopolist raise prices later. Microsoft easier time defending charge predation, amounts victimizing customers, would defending charge bundled product consumers slightly harm good. The antitrust record, says William Baxter, headed antitrust division President Reagan, littered contradictory, ambiguous sometimes nonsensical verdicts. He legal experts agree nothing else, record leaves plenty legal leeway Supreme Court, hear Microsoft case, stiffen spine antitrust law. Shortly government filed antitrust suit Microsoft Corp. May, Joel Klein, assistant attorney general charge Justice Department's antitrust division, met Silicon Valley executive. The executive recalls telling Klein unless case went Internet browser market, would little effect Microsoft's power stifle competition computer industry. Klein replied understood computer executive's concerns. But said time running short strongest evidence hand involved Microsoft's battle Netscape Communications Corp. market so-called browser software used navigating Internet. This Netscape case, executive recalls Klein saying. But five months later, case government bringing trial Monday extends well Netscape browser war embrace described recent court filing broad pattern anti-competitive conduct Microsoft. Netscape, government insists, still prime example pattern  one several examples. The 12-person witness list Justice Department 20 states suing Microsoft reflects new evidence added case May. James Barksdale, Netscape's president chief executive, appear first, followed executives representing cross section nation's high-technology companies including Intel, IBM, Sun Microsystems, Apple Computer, America Online Intuit. In bringing ambitious, complicated case trial one filed May, government chosen high-risk strategy. The law states new evidence added suit filed, new charges. And so, federal courtroom Washington, U.S.District Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson could decide rule new evidence ranging far afield original suit. But government wins broadened case, court-ordered remedies would doubt far tougher Microsoft. In May, government's suggested steps amounted equal treatment Netscape's browser Microsoft's browser. But government recently asked judge hold separate hearing remedies, wins case. The remedies consideration include basic changes Microsoft's business practices  perhaps breakup company  intended loosen Microsoft's grip computing. That would precisely kind sweeping reform Microsoft's foes would applaud. The government doubled bet doubled stakes, said David Yoffie, professor Harvard business school co-author book, Competing Internet Time: Lessons From Netscape Its Battle With Microsoft. Meanwhile, Microsoft camp, government's strategy dismissed desperate act  taken court ruling June threatened undermine antitrust suit. That ruling came separate case, involving interpretation consent decree Microsoft signed Justice Department 1995. In June ruling, federal appeals court said Microsoft could bundle browser industry-standard Windows operating system call one product. The appeals-court ruling would seem undercut assertion government's current antitrust case browser operating system two separate products, bundled together given away effort thwart competition browser market. With appeals-court ruling June, government lost heart case, said Charles Rule, former senior official Justice Department, consultant Microsoft. So taken blunderbuss approach scrambling throw everything find  evidence Justice Department years  gun barrel see hits. The June appellate ruling shake prosecution team. But mostly strengthened hand Justice Department urging case broadened, according people worked investigation. At time, say, new evidence coming investigation moved ahead prosecutors raced meet accelerated trial schedule approved court. Speed priority outset, say. The Justice Department states filed suit May move Microsoft's new operating system, Windows 98, introduced June. While seeking block release Windows 98, government lawyers wanted get the courtroom early possible PC makers computer users adopt latest version Microsoft's Windows operating system, functions central nervous system 90 percent personal computers sold. The key allegations, government lawyers note, changed May  namely, Microsoft illegally used market power operating systems defend monopoly position try extend new markets. But thing wrapped bow time May filing browser, said one person worked case. The real game plan always get broader case. What more, one person noted, prosecution team full strength shortly suit filed. David Boies, renowned courtroom litigator former partner Cravath, Swaine &AMP; Moore successfully defended IBM 13-year confrontation government, named special counsel Justice Department last December. But Boies, left Cravath last year, start working full-time Justice Department mid-April, still finishing private cases firm, Boies &AMP; Schiller. The antitrust suit filed May leaned heavily Netscape story, mentioning Microsoft's main rival browser market 130 times complaint supporting memorandum. But also prominently mentioned Microsoft's tactics Sun Microsystems, creator Java, Internet programming language, cited example Microsoft's behavior. It crafted template could added much stretching, one person involved case said. And so, new evidence piled seemed fit pattern, Klein step step approved widening case, person said. And explains, person continued, evidence hands Justice Department years added case May; gathering new evidence become apparent older material fit pattern current case. For example, government added contention Microsoft pressured Intel Corp., big microchip maker close partner Microsoft, curb development efforts multimedia Internet software might conflict Microsoft's plans. The government contends arm-twisting occurred meetings two companies three years ago, especially one Aug. 2, 1995, attended Andrew Grove, Intel chairman, Bill Gates, Microsoft chairman. Part government's evidence Intel-Microsoft episode copies handwritten notes taken Steven McGeady, Intel vice president attended meetings, memo written Aug. 28, 1995. The memo, still court seal, said Gates made vague threats livid Intel's investments Internet wanted stopped. A handwritten note, also court seal, quotes Paul Maritz, Microsoft executive, saying Netscape common enemy Intel's role fill stuff Microsoft's strategy. These documents sent Intel Justice Department's office San Francisco November 1995, response Civil Investigative Demand  civil subpoena  served Intel Nov. 10, 1995. On own, Intel material intriguing, became part antitrust suit evidence surfaced, one person close case said. The government contending Microsoft also tried urge Apple stop selling Quicktime multimedia software Windows market tried convince Real Networks Inc. pull back market so-called streaming software. The government case also broadened, people involved case say, witnesses industry increasingly willing testify. In beginning, people industry believed government would lose Microsoft would retaliate came forward, one person said. But strength case perceived improve, people willing come forward, things snowballed. You get Intel, easier get Apple on. \n","\n","\n","\n","Microsoft Corp. said material unpublished book two business school professor crucial part defense antitrust trial scheduled begin next week. But judging advance copy manuscript, Justice Department 20 state suing software giant find support argument book well. To cite one example, Microsoft contends industry-standard Windows operating system Internet Explorer browser single integrated product. In suit, government asserts two separate product Microsoft bundled together get unfair edge rival, Netscape Communications Corp., market software used browse Internet's World Wide Web. In Competing Internet Time: Lessons Netscape Its Battle Microsoft, author, Michael A. Cusumano Massachusetts Institute Technology's Sloan School Management David B. Yoffie Harvard business school, quote Microsoft executive saying third version Microsoft's browser integrated Windows. Microsoft hurried first browser offering market, book say, race catch Netscape, took ambitious approach Internet Explorer 3.0, introduced August 1996. In version changed software design use programming module, component, could put together rearragned building block. In book, Ben Slivka, Microsoft general manager, quoted saying, IE 3.0 key thing componentized browser, He added, We really made Internet Explorer part Windows platform. The timing could legally significant suit government cite evidence request August 1996 personal computer maker wanted load Netscape's browser machine instead Microsoft's browser. Microsoft denied request, insisting browers Windows single, integrated product. Microsoft's legal team obtained early manuscript new book last month, issuing subpoena Netscape executive given confidential copy author review. Microsoft also sought transcript 44 current former Netscape employee interviewed author. A federal judge Boston last week denied Microsoft access research material, company may appeal ruling. The new book, published Free Press imprint Simon &AMP; Schuster, hurried print shipped day start Microsoft trial Oct. 19. But already, quote Netscape executive leaked out. The author decided send complete manuscript The New York Times three news organization Monday, material could read context. Microsoft intends use material book evidence Netscape's trouble resulted largely misstep rather alleged predatory practice Microsoft. The book detail Netscape stumbled, shifting strategy running obstacle software development effort. In private antitrust suit, argument competitor worst enemy established defense. But legal expert say defense may well far le effective federal case government seeking court-mandated change Microsoft's business practice rather monetary damage goal plaintiff private case. It seems debate Netscape's mistake total sideshow, said Robert Litan, former senior official Justice Department's antitrust division, Brookings Institution. But Microsoft big legal team, seems working every defense find. The book quote former Netscape executive, Ram Shriram, saying company bungled chance win sizable share browser business America Online Inc. But second-chance deal America Online, leading online service. The government's case focus earlier deal March 1996, America Online chose Internet Explorer preferred browser; bargain Microsoft agreed place startup icon online service main Windows desktop screen prime real estate computing. For book entitled Competing Internet Time, intriguing one central theme Netcape got wedded notion Internet revolution would change everything quickly. Microsoft, contrast, stuck three-year planning horizon enabled company, author write, mesh short-run tactical plan broader strategic view win war. The book quote Steve Ballmer, Microsoft's president, saying, The fact matter customer can't take cataclysmic change every three month. The organization also can't. You ship product quickly. But can't say, `Oh, radically new strategy' every three month. The government's antitrust scrutiny Microsoft, world's largest independent software company, spanned Republican Democratic administration involved hundred government lawyer investigator. But mean example consistent, coordinated public policy. Nor, account, politics. Instead, software industry itself, government's pursuit Microsoft taken leap, hit dead end evolved way one could controlled predicted back started 1989. It November year, hot afternoon computer-industry convention Las Vegas, Nev., Bill Gates, Microsoft's chairman, looked he'd dragged news conference senior executive IBM time dominated Microsoft entire computer industry. The two company IBM, leading maker personal computer Microsoft, leader PC operating system software collaborating design marketing new operating system called OS/2. But Microsoft also beginning sell competing product, Windows. The industry trade press full worried articles: system going become new standard? With Gates standing uncomfortably side, James Cannavino, IBM divisional president, said two company wanted clear air. OS/2 future, said. As Windows, added, would remain niche product under-equipped computer. Windows, asserted, would never receive advanced feature OS/2. Gates certainly look happy. But disagree. The news conference got little attention, article deep newspaper trade publication. But week later, Norris Washington, senior antitrust lawyer Federal Trade Commission, happened read one article, Byte magazine. IBM Microsoft defined unified vision graphical operating environment, article said, look sort US. economic model, divided lower-, middle- upper-class product. As Washington saw it, IBM Microsoft colluding divide operating-system market potential violation antitrust law. Soon FTC staff opened investigation Microsoft IBM And small first step, Microsoft unrelenting scrutiny federal antitrust investigator constantly evolving series allegation charge, month month, year year, last nine year. Now come antitrust trial scheduled begin Monday, multiplicity charge woven thread drawn dozen different investigative inquiry nine-year span. Microsoft, today feared company software business carrying stock-market value nearly $234 billion, present huge highly visible antitrust target. Yet, company's ally ask, What Clinton administration's political agenda going Microsoft? answer seems none. In interview, dozen current former senior antitrust official whether friend government Microsoft say Justice Department's antitrust suit natural outgrowth previous investigation. As politics, official agreed antitrust division operates independent administration's political consideration. Charles Rule assistant attorney general headed antitrust division Bush administration, Washington lawyer serf adviser advocate Microsoft. When I there, Rule said Justice day, White House punctilious term never getting involved decided do. There communication antitrust branch government. Asked believed policy changed Clinton administration, said: Not really. I've seen nothing suggest it. Joel Klein head antitrust division now, interview dealing division's role Clinton administration's technology policy, specifically relating Microsoft case, said: There statutory restriction, practical matter, civil criminal prosecution invariably carried political contact. Klein said, way example, might discus merger case involving military aviation industry Defense Department Transportation Department. But never White House, said. For significant case, might call White House say `An hour going hold press conference.' The last time interference, added, Dita Beard-ITT case. Mrs. Beard, lobbyist ITT Corp., accused 1972 written memo saying $400,000 donation Republican National Convention gone long way settling antitrust suit brought company Nixon administration's Justice Department. The authenticity memo never proved, Mrs. Beard always denied writing it. In case, Klein say, Watergate, immaculate. In case Microsoft, neither President Clinton Vice President Al Gore ever volunteered comment. In answer question news conference May, suit filed, Clinton said: I taken view I comment matter Justice Department. At time, I think I depart policy case, though obviously big impact important sector economy. But I say, based I know date, I confidence way antitrust division Justice Department handled matter. Since then, Clinton said nothing else case, publicly least. And Gore, generally represents administration technology issue, never commented all. In Rule's opinion, administration would foolish involve itself, politically acceptable so. It would little odd administration push Justice Department suit, said. It would policy mistake political mistake. I would hard pressed explain would that. Taking side highly charged technology world dangerous, particularly Democrats rely Silicon Valley company political donation support. In fact, present former government official said suit simply natural extension inquiry conducted last nine year. They began FTC. Soon Washington read article Byte, FTC staff opened investigation Windows-OS/2 question. But happened year, turn market made initial inquiry irrelevant. Microsoft abandoned agreement IBM, Windows quickly grew industry standard, OS/2 remained cipher. But issue faded, government investigator began looking Microsoft found thing troubled them. In 1991 Washington, still work FTC, informed Microsoft investigation expanded. The agency, letter said, trying determine whether Microsoft using dominant position operating-systems software stifle competition area. That general idea lie heart present suit. One former senior FTC official said commission staff confidence case realized Reagan-era commissioner, approve suit, might different view. We knew commission might difficulty monopolization case, former official said. They brought case year. And fact, 1993 commission voted 2-2 question whether file formal charge. The deadlock served dismissal. Then, month later, Justice Department decided pick case. It farther case got, recalled Robert Litan, former senior official Justice Department's antitrust division Brookings Institution. Usually case would two three people complaining document, said. But fully researched record. They gave u file briefed u done. The Justice Department lawyer picked thread. The general idea inquiry, Litan said, allowed use monopoly operating system cement monopoly area. In 1995, Microsoft government reached consent agreement company promised stop forcing PC maker buy one copy Microsoft operating system every computer sold instead one every computer operating system, MS-DOS Windows, installed. The company also agreed stop tying sale one software product sale another. The charge present suit similar many way. Even agreement, government investigation continued. That year, Justice Department investigator showed office Netscape Communications Corp. first time ask question next line inquiry. America Online complaining, senior Netscape executive recalled, Microsoft bundling Microsoft Network, competing online service, Windows. Once more, market force overtook investigation. The Microsoft Network never grew particularly popular America Online prospered grew. But, surprisingly, new complaint filled void. In May 1995, Anne Bingaman, assistant attorney general headed antitrust division, remarked: We get complaint Microsoft time. We become kind Microsoft complaint center. And take seriously. In 1996, Netscape's first complaint arrived. In letter Justice Department, Netscape said Microsoft using dominance personal-computer operating system force persuade computer maker favor Microsoft's browser, used explore World Wide Web, one marketed Netscape. The next year Justice Department formally charged Microsoft violating consent agreement tying sale Windows installation company's Web browser new computer. It seemed slam-dunk violation consent decree, natural extension case, recalled Litan, left department then. A Federal District Court judge agreed, Appeals Court panel overturned ruling summer. In meantime, last May Justice Department 20 state attorney general filed new suit Microsoft, scheduled trial Monday. It contends Microsoft engaged bundling, tying predatory behavior similar many way numerous previous allegation investigation last nine year. A good part case Round II case dealt Round I, early 1990s, Litan said. Or, former senior FTC official put it, there's certainly common thread run way here. But year thread twisted, pulled spun hundred different hand. The case United States v. Microsoft Corp., government's aggressive move monopolist almost 25 year, playing century antitrust law broadly worded court ruling ambiguous side citing ruling support opposing argument. Whatever outcome trial, scheduled begin Monday US. District Court Washington, almost certain appeal leave Supreme Court task bringing legal order 100 year clashing antitrust doctrine. The case focus Microsoft's Windows, operating system control 90 percent personal computer sold today. The government say objective curb illegal monopolistic business practice threaten render large part economy vulnerable vicissitude single company. Microsoft asserts case intended give government control feature added Windows. However grand economic stake, legal dispute narrow. The government say Microsoft's contract computer manufacturer company provide access Internet illegally stifle competition. The contract prohibit manufacturer substituting Netscape Communications Corp.'s Navigator browser Microsoft's Internet Explorer. They also prohibit removing Windows main screen, desktop, link site World Wide Web run Microsoft partner. Microsoft's contract company connect people Internet business sell good service Web require favored treatment Internet Explorer Navigator exchange link Windows desktop. In wake lawsuit, Microsoft voluntarily dropped requirement, though could reinstate will. Microsoft say contract legal produce tangible benefit customer, including easier Internet access. The Justice Department say bundling Explorer Windows 95 inclusion browser part Windows 98 amount tying, illegal practice force customer one product purchase another. The contract manufacturer Internet service illegal, government say, intended create monopoly browser market protect Microsoft's existing monopoly operating system. The latter threat key, according Justice Department. Browsers potential, operating system, act software platform program run. So contract intended drive browser market would also insulate Windows monopoly. Many antitrust expert say problem facing Justice Department court provided clear definition tying clear guideline determining contract illegally exclusionary. Professor Lawrence White New York University, chief economist Justice Department's antitrust division early 1980s, say court treat tying unusual practice fact ubiquitous. No one, said, would challenge right manufacturer tie eraser tip pencil, tire automobile button shirt. His point, shared widely economist, tying benefit consumer if, example, result product easier use enables company recover development cost. But tying bad lock monopoly power. The court, White say, offered enough guidance distinguishing good tying bad, nub legal dispute. Microsoft say need show bundling Windows Explorer pass might called gross consumer benefit test offer immediate benefit, whether cause long-term damage competition and, therefore, ultimately consumer. The Justice Department say Microsoft's practice must clear higher hurdle: yielding net consumer benefit immediate large enough balance possible long-term harm competition. So test consumer benefit satisfies antitrust law? The simple answer one know sure, side reasonably cite case fear embarrassment. Consider 1985 case, Aspen Skiing Co. v. Aspen Highlands Skiing Corp., 1951 case, Lorain Journal Co. v. United States. In first, Aspen Skiing, owner three major ski run Aspen, Colo. monopolist year sold ticket cooperation Aspen Highlands, competitor, gave skier access companies' run. When Aspen Skiing unilaterally canceled agreement, rival's revenue shriveled rival sued. The Supreme Court ruled Aspen Skiing violated antitrust law evidence action helped consumer. In Lorain Journal case, local newspaper Lorain, Ohio, refused sell advertising company advertised new radio station. Here, too, Supreme Court ruled exclusionary practice nothing benefit consumer. Indeed, Aspen Skiing, court forced monopolist business rival, precedent augur well Justice Department, seek force Microsoft install Netscape's browser alongside own. But Charles Rule, legal consultant Microsoft, say case court threw exclusionary practice offered consumer benefit. The court, argues, never pounced practice resulted lower price better product service. Nor court either case call balancing immediate benefit hypothetical long-term harm. Rule argues Microsoft's practice produce demonstrable consumer benefit. Besides, say, action taken The Lorain Journal Aspen Skiing, Microsoft's contract prevent consumer installing Netscape's browser using Web site Microsoft's rival. In truth, though, neither case answered consumer benefit test apply product design. In Jefferson Parish Hospital District No. 2 et al. v. Hyde, another case cited side, Supreme Court 1984 recognized surgeon anesthesiologist provide integrated service. Yet, court said, hospital monopoly power would still allowed force surgical patient use panel anesthesiologist consumer wanted purchase two service separately. That principle could undercut Microsoft's defense functional interdependence Windows Explorer requires bundling. But Microsoft point strong concurring opinion called tougher standard government meet alleges tying. Microsoft also draw support several court ruling allowed IBM change design computer way made hard vendor attach peripheral equipment. But perhaps Microsoft's best argument nowhere government identified single case court explicitly called throwing tied product basis balancing test. The court, Microsoft emphasize, steer clear redesigning technically sophisticated product. The Justice Department's rejoinder note sole purpose antitrust law protect consumer, make sense bless practice provide dollar's worth benefit today but, stamping competition, drive price $1,000 tomorrow. The Justice Department ask court least insist monopolist use least exclusionary mean possible achieve service provide customer. Experts agree court subject Microsoft's restrictive contract Internet company balancing test. But exactly court decide whether consumer helped hurt grab. A balancing test would court weigh immediate benefit consumer one-click access Internet site feature bundled Windows-Explorer package harm time diminished competition market browser operating system. But test make good sense theory prove fiendishly difficult use practice. Balancing test impossibly difficult arbitrary, said Rep. Thomas Campbell, R-Calif., former law professor Stanford University. The practical effect balancing hand defendant Microsoft almost certain victory. Microsoft argues many antitrust expert agree court fact gravitated away balancing test simpler predation test exclusionary contract. Under standard, contract illegal intended drive competition thus pave way monopolist raise price later. Microsoft easier time defending charge predation, amount victimizing customer, would defending charge bundled product consumer slightly harm good. The antitrust record, say William Baxter, headed antitrust division President Reagan, littered contradictory, ambiguous sometimes nonsensical verdict. He legal expert agree nothing else, record leaf plenty legal leeway Supreme Court, hear Microsoft case, stiffen spine antitrust law. The legal tool government using assault Microsoft Corp. Sherman Antitrust Act 1890 brief, vague malleable. The combination meant bedrock statute antitrust policy turn toothless powerful year, depending politics economics day interpreted court. Sponsored Sen. John Sherman, Ohio Republican younger brother Civil War general William Tecumseh Sherman, act passed nod popular backlash rise industrial trust oil, steel railroad. Farmers, laborer small-business owner sizable voting group resented trust vehicle concentrated power. But trust, large national holding corporation, viewed many engine modernization industrialization. Economists time opposed Sherman Act, law Congress passed vaguely worded compromise. No one knew impact would have, one senator, quoted Matthew Josephson's The Robber Barons, explained nearly everyone agreed something must flung appease restive mass. The act's two key provision, Sections 1 2, mention conspiracy, restraint trade attempt monopolize. Yet Sherman Act interpreted Magna Carta competition, never us term. After passed, critic trust derided impenetrable language Sherman Act called Swiss Cheese Act. But early 1900s, political climate changed. The growing antagonism trust, especially income gap widened, tapped avowed trustbuster, Theodore Roosevelt, became president 1901. The Sherman Act always elastic piece social legislation, used attack perceived exploitation aggregation power, said Eleanor Fox, professor New York University Law School. The model trust principal target trustbuster Standard Oil. Shrewdly, Roosevelt made distinction good trust, thrived superior efficiency, bad trust, grew result inevitable economic force unfair business practice. Throughout 1880s '90s, Standard Oil's rival complained company business practice founder, John D. Rockefeller. But year, price kerosene burned light nation's home declined steadily. So Standard Oil, could could reasonably argued, enterprising monopoly. In early 1900s, though, Standard Oil raised price United States prop profit time engaged price war Royal Dutch/Shell Europe, Standard Oil face genuine competition. When consumer hurt Standard Oil monopoly, popular support antitrust action company swelled, encouraged Roosevelt successor, William Howard Taft. The federal suit Standard Oil filed 1906, Supreme Court approved breakup company 1911. Standard Oil Microsoft case, historian observe, common theme. Both dominant company day, Bill Gates, Microsoft chairman, called modern Rockefeller. But presidential involvement real consumer dissatisfaction Microsoft case, said Ron Chernow, author Titan, best-selling biography Rockefeller. And Rockefeller, Chernow added, never went kind honeymoon period widespread public adulation favorable press coverage Bill Gates had. In summer 1995, whiff revolution air Silicon Valley. The Internet offered new deal computing, fresh opportunity entrepreneur try break Microsoft Corp.'s firm grip personal computer software business. Leading challenge Netscape Communications Corp., whose software browsing World Wide Web ignited Internet boom. Netscape chairman James Clark spoke boldly attacking Microsoft head-on. He borrowed imagery movie Star Wars, referring Microsoft Death Star Netscape leader rebel alliance. Microsoft answered vengeance. It dispatched hundred programmer work competing browser poured many million dollar marketing it. It prodded computer maker distribute browser, folded browser industry-dominant Windows operating system gave browser away free campaign intended cut air supply, senior Microsoft executive described it. But competitor Netscape encountered Microsoft's force. Microsoft's partner, corporate customer professional investor finance new venture collided it. A close look Microsoft's no-holds-barred push Internet software business offer window way company us market muscle influence behavior virtually every player industry. Some case recounted figure prominently suit brought Justice Department 20 state, scheduled go trial month, charging Microsoft time went far violated antitrust law. Regardless legal outcome, previously unreported detail incident suit example provide complete picture Microsoft action. When Compaq Computer Corp. considered loading Netscape's browser instead Microsoft's personal computer, Microsoft threatened stop selling Windows operating system Compaq. The company quickly changed mind. After Spyglass Inc. began supplying Microsoft early browser technology, Microsoft announced would give away browser free. The timing came rude surprise partner Spyglass. The company lost revenue almost overnight, technology, also licensing company Microsoft, suddenly became available free. When America Online Inc., competes fiercely Microsoft's online service electronic commerce division, went shopping browser technology, Microsoft made offer good pas up: If America Online used Microsoft's browser main one million subscriber, Microsoft would give America Online prime placement desktop screen personal computer using Windows. When Intel Corp. began developing Internet software, Microsoft complained. Intel, leading maker microprocessor serve electronic brain personal computer running Windows, pulled back. The chip maker decided lucrative hand-in-glove partnership Microsoft took priority. Microsoft's reach computing become pervasive nearly every year now, Silicon Valley's top venture capitalist meet privately team top Microsoft executive learn company's plan. The goal, one venture investor observed, stay way steamroller. Microsoft adamantly denies broken law similar situation. The company play game business hard, executive acknowledge apology. Yes, Microsoft say, rival may suffer partner may irritated occasionally. But company insists action guided main corporate goal bringing new technology inexpensively conveniently million people use software. Most people computer industry say living Microsoft's world mean routinely making accommodation it. Microsoft's power emanates near-monopoly market personal computer operating system, master control program run computer. Because owns operating system, Microsoft essential utility information age, said James Moore, president Geopartners Research Inc., technology consulting firm. It act kind gatekeeper pipeline computing innovation, sitting deciding whether help innovation slow down. For month, Microsoft Netscape talked off, circling warily. But event would define unflinching rival meeting June 21, 1995, second-floor conference room Netscape's headquarters Mountain View, Calif. That meeting, according Justice Department 20 state suing Microsoft, high-tech equivalent storied gathering smoke-filled railroad car inspired passage nation's antitrust law century ago. On day, say, Microsoft made Netscape illegal offer divvy market Internet browsing software, collusion pact Netscape rejected. Microsoft reply prosecutor misinterpreting routine meeting software business company never tried divide browser market. Bill Gates, Microsoft's chairman principal strategist, attend Mountain View gathering, consulted telephone Microsoft team. Two people attend June meeting named witness trial scheduled begin next week: Netscape president James Barksdale Daniel Rosen, Microsoft's general manager new technology. In trial, government contend Microsoft presented Netscape all-or-nothing offer, according people questioned federal investigation. Relying heavily note taken meeting Netscape executive vice president Marc Andreessen testimony Barksdale, prosecutor expected assert Microsoft proposal several element, incentive requirement. Microsoft, according people questioned government, would invest Netscape, taking 15 20 percent stake, give Netscape technical information fine-tune Microsoft's operating system Netscape's software would run better Windows. In return, people say, Netscape would give Microsoft seat board, license technology Microsoft, give Microsoft advance knowledge product-development effort make browser next generation Microsoft operating system, Windows 95, shipped two month June 1995 meeting. And Microsoft, people added, always denied used access technology powerful lever business negotiation, offering Netscape preferential access Windows application program interface, APIs, link enable companies' program run smoothly Windows operating system. By turning deal, Netscape, say, would preferred access Microsoft technology threat Microsoft fiercely denies making. Barksdale, Netscape's 55-year-old chief executive, told colleague encounter Microsoft June 1995 damnedest meeting I've ever attended 35 year business. Had Netscape accepted Microsoft's offer, would Microsoft's money endorsement. Netscape would also free sell browser use earlier version Windows use operating system Apple's Macintosh Unix, powerful system used mainly corporation research lab. But licensed technology Microsoft stepped aside, best could hoped becoming company sale $100 million hoping bought Microsoft, said Clark, former computer scientist Stanford University founded Silicon Graphics Inc., computer graphic pioneer, starting Netscape. We start Netscape that. For company, meeting Microsoft charged affair. Every computing device keyboard disk drive, every software program game browser, must mesh smoothly Microsoft's Windows operating system. This necessary make computer reliable easier use, also give Microsoft role industry's gatekeeper. And Microsoft make manner software product operating system, company put uneasy position requiring Microsoft's cooperation able compete it. And software industry, every program rendered digital code 1's 0's, line divide competition cooperation blurred. The talk line Microsoft-Netscape meeting focused division operating system platform, computer term application program, sometimes called solution, run top operating system. The government suit state sworn testimony, Chris Jones, Microsoft manager attended meeting, admitted Microsoft `absolutely' intended persuade Netscape compete. Microsoft read Jones' testimony differently, evidence mainly company's clarifying position. If Netscape stayed application solution side operating system, two company could partner, Microsoft said. But Netscape tried become player platform space, would compete. Microsoft released portion Jones deposition September evidence government quoted Microsoft manager context. Q. Do recall discussion desire anybody part Microsoft participating able persuade influence Netscape compete? A. Absolutely. But again, persuade sense force persuade sense of, hey, think great business relationship together. Later deposition, Justice Department lawyer asked Jones whether Microsoft executive intended suggest would consequence Netscape business Netscape chose go platform direction described earlier opposed solution direction. Jones replied: The conversation something following: `We're platform business. We're going invest heavily part platform feel critical technology. That's done deal.' And we're asking them: `What business? Is business platform solution? If platform, we're platform business. We're competing.' Microsoft portrays comment innocuous statement fact. But Netscape, remark could taken warning, threat. This Internet browsing software potential become alternative platform Windows operating system. The browser, sitting top operating system, could supplant Windows main desktop screen users' machine main layer programming starting software application. In addition, Netscape's browser could serve powerful platform distributing running Java, Internet programming language developed Sun Microsystems Inc., Microsoft rival. In technical term, Netscape's upstart platform could replace Microsoft's APIs essential utility computing. Indeed, Andreessen boasted public Netscape's ambition relegate Microsoft's Windows much software plumbing browser. By June meeting, Microsoft certainly viewed Netscape serious potential challenger Windows, corporate crown jewel. On May 26, 1995, internal memo, The Internet Tidal Wave, Gates wrote: A new competitor `born' Internet Netscape. Their browser dominant 70 percent usage share, allowing determine network extension catch on. Netscape's strategy, Gates wrote, move key API browser commoditize underlying operating system. THE BROADER INQUIRY: GOVERNMENT SEES ARM-TWISTING The federal government state recently broadened allegation Microsoft adding evidence tried bully Intel, Apple Computer Inc. company squelch competition. They say Netscape meeting new evidence fit pattern behavior Microsoft, repeatedly tried limit competition strong-arming competitor partner. One episode fit pattern, prosecutor contend, effort Microsoft pressure Intel shelve development multimedia Internet software limit cooperation Netscape. Intel's main business making microprocessor chip act electronic brain computer run Windows operating system. Indeed, fortune Intel Microsoft closely aligned two company sometimes referred single, powerful entity, Wintel. But Intel also employ hundred software engineer, mainly Intel Architecture Labs Hillsboro, Ore. And Intel Microsoft partner, also conflict, typically direction pace certain innovation introduced personal computer industry, dominate together. Federal state investigator focused Microsoft's strong reaction work done Intel's software engineer sentiment expressed uncertain term meeting Intel's Santa Clara, Calif., headquarters Aug. 2, 1995. The contentious session attended several executive Intel Microsoft, including Gates Intel chairman Andrew Grove. An internal Intel memo stated Gates made vague threat supporting Intel's competitor livid Intel's investment Internet wanted stopped. Later, Intel pull back multimedia Internet software development. Steven McGeady, Intel vice president attended August 1995 meeting, scheduled appear witness government. Microsoft reply government's account meeting Netscape Intel fanciful distortion, created using biased selection document witness. The government's case, Microsoft asserts, betrays utter failure accept computer-industry reality Microsoft routinely meet company make sure software equipment work well Windows. Sometimes talk, Microsoft say, go include level cooperation licensing technology Microsoft investment, company discussed Netscape. In trial, Microsoft expected argue advance browser market result business acumen Netscape's misstep. To document Netscape's error, Microsoft issued subpoena last month obtained unpublished manuscript new book, Competing Internet Time: Lessons From Netscape Its Battle With Microsoft, based hundred interview current former Netscape executive. The book chronicle mistake made Netscape. But author, Michael Cusumano Massachusetts Institute Technology's Sloan School Management David Yoffie Harvard Business School, think Microsoft hardly blameless. Microsoft's take-no-prisoners strategy backfired, inviting retaliation competitor, government customer, Yoffie said. Emphasizing offering legal judgment, Yoffie added, I think Microsoft could achieved 90 percent crossing line much did. THE SPYGLASS LINK: REWARDS AND PERILS OF A PARTNERSHIP On April 6, 1994, Gates 20 Microsoft executive gathered daylong retreat far company's headquarters Redmond, Wash. The subject Internet might revolutionize computer software business. Few concrete plan made day, Microsoft executive insist direction set. Our vision outset unite two world Windows desktop Internet, said Steven Sinofsky, Microsoft executive attended meeting. Yet Microsoft badly trailed Netscape browser field. To hasten entry, Microsoft licensed early browsing software Spyglass Inc. Naperville, Ill. The first meeting two company initiated Spyglass April 1994. At time, tiny company eager deal Microsoft. Spyglass selected commercial licensee browser technology developed National Center Supercomputing University Illinois. In summer 1994, Douglas Colbeth, president Spyglass, met Clark Netscape O'Hare International Airport Chicago. The two men talked United Airlines Red Carpet Room, reserved business-class passenger, Colbeth recalled Clark telling him, We're going take Microsoft head-on. At time, Colbeth recalled thinking himself, Great, Microsoft really want license me. Today, noted: Remember, company couple dozen people almost money bank. Netscape Jim Clark, money reputation, big-time venture capital backing Silicon Valley. Netscape different agenda. By July 1994, Microsoft become quite interested Spyglass technology, Colbeth say, two company signed first licensing agreement December. Microsoft, Colbeth recall, always told would eventually fold browser technology operating system, timing accelerated Netscape's rapid rise. Microsoft initially hoping charge browser, Colbeth said. But Dec. 7, 1995, Gates declared Microsoft would deeply integrate browser Windows would give away. The announcement caught industry, Colbeth, surprise. At time, Spyglass licensed technology 82 company, including IBM Digital Equipment, use software product licensing revenue stream $20 million year. As result Microsoft's move, Spyglass saw revenue vanish year, smaller Internet software company went business big customer shifted Microsoft's free browser. Spyglass slashed payroll scrambled new niche software industry replace lost sale, succeeded eventually. Whenever license technology Microsoft, understand someday build itself, drop operating system put business, Colbeth said. THE NONOPTION COMPAQ: SUDDENLY SEES THE LIGHT Well 1996, Netscape's share browser market continued rise, Microsoft made little headway, though browser free. Industry analyst trade magazine agreed Netscape's browser clear technical leader. In April 1996, Netscape's Navigator used 87 percent people browsing Web, compared 4 percent using Microsoft's Internet Explorer, according Zona Research. So biggest personal computer maker, Compaq, thought made sense give customer Netscape's browser instead Microsoft's. But Microsoft would stand Compaq choice give in. In June 1996, Compaq wanted load popular Netscape browser machine also remove icon Microsoft's Internet Explorer, delivered computer maker Windows 95. Microsoft informed Compaq removed Internet Explorer, computer maker would lose license Windows, said Stephen Decker, Compaq's director software procurement, testimony federal investigator. The ultimatum Microsoft delivered bluntly letter headed, Notice Intent Terminate License Agreement. Faced denied essential operating system, Compaq quickly reversed course kept Internet Explorer icon. Microsoft asserts Windows Internet Explorer single product Microsoft alone defines product. Nothing contract, Microsoft add, prohibits computer maker including competing technology. While cutoff letter Microsoft sent Compaq seems unnecessarily hardball tactic dealing largest corporate customer, Microsoft chief operating officer Bob Herbold insists take one letter one snippet e-mail try portray Microsoft arrogant company unfair. Noting Compaq executive witness Microsoft, Herbold said, We totally dependent tremendous relationship key company Compaq. At Netscape, however, Compaq episode watershed. That singular act got going Justice Department, Barksdale recalled. Barksdale said regarded Microsoft's tactic forcing Compaq buy browser condition obtaining essential product, Windows operating system, illegal act absolute proof Microsoft monopolist. After investigating incident, Justice Department state agreed Barksdale Microsoft illegally tying sale one product another. Microsoft reply long history adding new feature operating system. And outset, Microsoft say, intended Windows Internet Explorer browser would seamlessly integrated, Windows 98. Thus, Microsoft insists, product-tying violation antitrust law. In separate case, federal appeal court sided Microsoft, upholding principle company could put wanted operating system declare single product. But June 1996, Compaq wanted offer Netscape product instead Microsoft's browser, industry expert viewed browser operating system two different software program. It took long time integration strategy play out, said former senior Microsoft researcher. Back then, integration basically bolting browser Windows. THE `BALANCING ACT': AMERICA ONLINE TOSSES IN TOWEL America Online chairman Stephen Case refers dealing Microsoft delicate balancing act. That balance swung sharply fall 1995 spring 1996, Microsoft used lure giving America Online featured place Windows desktop ultimate bargaining chip. To gain access computing's coveted real estate, America Online agreed make Microsoft's Internet Explorer main browser online subscriber, number 13 million. Yet throughout 1995, Microsoft prepared introduce Windows 95, significant improvement ever operating system, Case knocking door Justice Department. His complaint Microsoft going place new online service, Microsoft Network, direct competitor America Online, prominently desktop screen Windows 95, introduced August. This bundling tactic using industry-dominant operating system market Microsoft Network, MSN, Case argued, gave Microsoft unfair advantage young fast-growing online business. The Justice Department listened investigated. But ultimately, government decided taking action. At America Online's headquarters Vienna, Va., Microsoft feared loathed time. America Online designated Microsoft watcher, young MBA. tracked adversary's every move. Above desk small, windowless office picture Gates. Beneath picture, large block letter, word THE ENEMY. Though America Online clear leader online service business, ample reason worry all-out assault rival rich aggressive Microsoft. When visited Microsoft headquarters couple year earlier, Case recalled, Gates bluntly assessed Microsoft's option saying could buy 20 percent America Online, enter online business bury you. A threat merely statement fact? A bit both, Case said recently. But mainly articulating everybody meeting kind intuitively understood. Yet 1996, Microsoft America Online found reason cooperate. With exploding popularity Internet's World Wide Web, conventional online company, America Online Compuserve, provide customer Internet access well service. America Online browser, keep pace rapidly advancing technology made sense deal Netscape Microsoft. For software company, deal America Online, 5 million subscriber time, could mean big surge browser use market share. Netscape seemed natural partner America Online, company Microsoft rival. On March 11, America Online announce would buy Netscape technology, standard licensing deal based payment-for-use formula. The next day, America Online announced significant deal Microsoft making browser default technology browser America Online subscriber would use unless specifically asked Netscape's Navigator. To win deal, Microsoft offered give America Online start-up icon Windows desktop precisely kind equal treatment main Windows screen Case asked Justice Department require Microsoft. After agreed Internet Explorer browser, Microsoft allowed u bundled Windows desktop, Case said. It example Microsoft's pragmatic side. The pragmatic decision paramount corporate goal increase browser market share protect mainstay software business. As result, new online service, MSN, would sacrifice important marketing advantage main rival, America Online. It Bill's decision, said former MSN general manager Russell Siegelman, referring Gates. He sent e-mail it. He said think would hurt MSN much. I disagreed him. To Microsoft executive, Gates expressed different view likely impact MSN. He told senior vice president Brad Silverberg putting America Online Windows desktop would amount putting bullet MSN's head, according deposition taken Justice Department. In antitrust suit, government asserts America Online deal show Microsoft used power Windows monopoly give edge browser war Netscape. David Colburn, senior vice president America Online took part browser negotiation Microsoft, witness government. Today, Microsoft overhauled Internet strategy focus mainly building popular special-interest Web site field travel, personal finance, automobile retailing news. And putting site, e-mail search feature, all-in-one site us name MSNcom. I still regard Microsoft primary threat, Case observed. Microsoft history getting right long run, there's reason think business well. We always Microsoft's cross hair. THE LESSON: DON'T CONFRONT A STEAMROLLER At Netscape's headquarters Silicon Valley, strategy today one avoiding head-to-head competition Microsoft whenever possible. Don't something Microsoft's path that's lesson learned, observed Clark, Netscape chairman. Silicon Valley's venture capitalist, investor finance many nation's high-tech startup, generally follow Netscape formula day. Yet still leaf ample room prosper. For competing directly Microsoft dangerous, software industry whole engine wealth creation, job generation technical innovation. And ambivalent side venture community's relationship Microsoft. For start-up cannot steer clear Microsoft entirely, favored option bought Microsoft, scooped many fledgling company way acquiring promising technology people. Microsoft understands start-up innovation co-opt start-up innovation better high-tech company, said James Breyer, managing partner Accel Partners, venture capital firm. As Microsoft grown, come seen merely competitor force nature shape business environment, weather front. Microsoft incredibly pervasive, said Stewart Alsop, partner New Enterprise Associates, venture capital firm Menlo Park, Calif. At board meeting company firm invested, two issue always come up, said: One price company's stock, Microsoft going do. In last year, Microsoft offered guidance almost yearly meeting senior Microsoft executive leading venture capitalist. The meeting part Microsoft's effort improve sometimes prickly relation Silicon Valley. We work hard provide clarity we're going we're going, said Greg Maffei, Microsoft's chief financial officer. Last year's conference took place October Quadrus office building Sand Hill Road Menlo Park, Wall Street high-tech venture investing. Maffei led team five Microsoft executive appeared group 40 venture capitalist, one stood asked question seemed mind many peers: How I invest company stay way steamroller? Maffei, recalled one person attended meeting, stood delivered brief lecture business Microsoft likely avoid. His list included specialized software manufacturing, human resource management, computer-aided design others. But, person noted, broad swath industry appeared designated limit including new software platform might compete Microsoft's personal computer operating system. At one point, Ruthann Quindlen, partner Institutional Venture Partners, leaned Vinod Khosla, co-founder Sun Microsystems partner venture capital firm Kleiner Perkins Caufield &AMP; Byers, said quietly, I guess leaf u washing machine toaster. Following text first two section Sherman Act, passed Congress 1890. As foundation federal antitrust law built, act amended several time elevating crime felony, increasing fine prison term individual setting fine corporation convicted violating it. In case Microsoft, government invoked Sherman Act file civil suit seek change company's business practice, criminal suit seek financial penalty. An Act Protect Trade And Commerce Against Unlawful Restraints Monopolies: Section 1. Every contract, combination form trust otherwise, conspiracy, restraint trade commerce several States, foreign nation, hereby declared illegal. Every person shall make contract engage combination conspiracy, shall deemed guilty misdemeanor, and, conviction thereof, shall punished fine exceeding five thousand dollar, imprisonment exceeding one year, said punishment, discretion court. Section 2. Every person shall monopolize, attempt monopolize, combine conspire person person, monopolize part trade commerce several States, foreign nation, shall deemed guilty misdemeanor, and, conviction thereof, shall punished fine exceeding five thousand dollar, imprisonment exceeding one year, said punishment, discretion court. Will matter consumer Bill Gates nice guy? Until last week, Americans thought Gates, chairman Microsoft Corp., genius innovator. A nerd perhaps also self-styled visionary almost single-handedly unlocked power personal computer. Monday, however, Washington courtroom, Justice Department began painting different, darker portrait Gates. In antitrust suit brought department 20 state, man whose company command 97 percent share market personal computer operating system depicted Nixonian schemer go almost length crush competition. Product innovation, suit argues, sufficient weapon Gates. Flashing back forth snippet Gates' videotaped deposition e-mail message sent contradicted testimony, government sought establish pattern threat offer payment Microsoft chairman. It also sought cast Gates obsessed man feared tiny Netscape Communications Corp. potential threat domination market Internet browser, software used navigate World Wide Web. Gates portrayed Justice Department litigator David Boies schoolyard bully ride roughshod computer industry crudeness stark contrast popular image benevolent dictator high-technology guru. According document presented Boies, example, Gates asked America Online executive 1996: How much need pay damage Netscape? This lucky day. The implication, Boies said, amount irrelevant, Microsoft, deep pocket market dominance, make many offer can't refuse needed achieve goal. Microsoft official closely watching market survey hint new image bare-knuckled Gates might detracting company's world-famous brand name, insist public continue draw distinction allegation anticompetitive business tactic company's software. Despite reading press, people judge u product, said Mich Matthews, head Microsoft's corporate public-relations office. Our experience people vote pocketbook. So far, consumer casting positive vote. Last week Microsoft reported quarterly profit $1.52 billion, stunning 58 percent increase level year earlier. Despite record profit, marketing expert say public come view Gates Rockefeller-style robber baron, company brand name may suffer. When company visible chief executive, CEO really driver brand, said David Aaker, brand marketing expert Haas School Business University California Berkeley. There question going affect Microsoft's brand recognition. Already early warning signal, political cartoon newspaper country bashed Gates last week. One showed holding globe saying, If play way, I'll take ball go home; another portrayed Microsoft chairman standing next henchman dangling someone window Microsoft secretary say caller, I'm sorry, Mr. Gates busy teaching competitor Windows. But industry analyst believe new view Bill Gates know play hardball may bad thing company. The he-said, she-said e-mail message dragged court case Washington Silicon Valley, Microsoft locked legal battle archrival, Sun Microsystems Inc., viewed little different exaggerated trash talking go professional sport. It's taking Charles Barkley Michael Jordan say ball court turning something sinister really is, said Paul Andrews, co-author Stephen Manes Gates (Doubleday, 1993). Indeed, evidence darker view Gates company far taken root District Columbia Silicon Valley, computer industry long felt impact Gates' tactic, bitterness distrust Microsoft deep. In rest country, Gates continues enjoy great popularity. Two week ago, speaking crowd almost 7,000 student Indiana University, questioner asked Justice Department's suit roundly booed. BILL GATES, WHIPPING BOY c.1998 NY. Times News Service Is Bill Gates high-tech Machiavelli, Public Enemy No. 1 threat known universe? All three, judging numerous political cartoon popped newspaper country last week. From Chattanooga Boston, cartoonist took delight demonizing Gates, facing unexpected public relation challenge Microsoft's antitrust trial unfolds Washington. Other cartoon ran gamut predictable (a worker, pointing aquarium large fish gobbling smaller one, saying visitor, Welcome Microsoft's research development department) weird (a dweebish man hunched front computer screen staring words: Our beloved leader, Mr. Gates, attack. Leave possession. Go desert. Await spaceship). And Week One trial. Stay tuned. A federal judge Friday pushed back starting date antitrust trial Microsoft Corp. four day, Oct. 19, also ordering company comply Justice Department's request examine Microsoft's financial record. Microsoft argued allowing army government attorney come make demand make difficult u remain business. But winning assurance government lawyer would make narrow, targeted search record, Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson US. District Court District Columbia ordered Microsoft open database perusal. Microsoft asked trial delayed several month prepare defense said last minute broadening case Justice Department, added new evidence. Last month, government said process preparing trial discovered Microsoft tried persuade Apple Computer market Quicktime multimedia software Windows customer. On Thursday, Justice Department 20 state added two new people witness list testify Microsoft dealing Apple Sun Microsystems. Avi Tevanian, former Apple executive, added witness list part describe Microsoft's proposal, Microsoft denies ever made. The new witness James Gosling, Sun executive led development Java, Internet programming language Microsoft see potential threat company's dominance software market. The government charging Microsoft took illegal step prevent Java gaining wide acceptance. To counter that, Microsoft named two new witness Friday, Robert Muglia, senior Microsoft executive worked Sun, Chris Engstrom, executive handled Microsoft's dealing Apple. At time, John Warden, Microsoft's lawyer, argued new allegation place case. The Justice Department, Warden told judge, trying turn something approximating plenary monopoly case IBM case. It becomes clearer clearer clearer new filing trying turn broader case, said. You can't bait-and-switch file complaint alleging A, B, C, talk whole alphabet three time over. As result, Warden said, Microsoft wanted, minimum, another two-week delay, though normal schedule would trial start next year. The judge respond. Instead entered order setting Oct. 19 trial date. Late Friday, Microsoft entered formal motion asking another two-week delay. A response expected next week. The case United States v. Microsoft Corp., government's aggressive move monopolist almost 25 year, playing century antitrust law broadly worded court ruling ambiguous side citing ruling support opposing argument. Whatever outcome trial, scheduled begin Monday US. District Court Washington, almost certain appeal leave Supreme Court task bringing legal order 100 year clashing antitrust doctrine. The case focus Microsoft's Windows, operating system control 90 percent personal computer sold today. The government say objective curb illegal monopolistic business practice threaten render large part economy vulnerable vicissitude single company. Microsoft asserts case intended give government control feature added Windows. However grand economic stake, legal dispute narrow. The government say Microsoft's contract computer manufacturer company provide access Internet illegally stifle competition. The contract prohibit manufacturer substituting Netscape Communications Corp.'s Navigator browser Microsoft's Internet Explorer. They also prohibit removing Windows main screen, desktop, link site World Wide Web run Microsoft partner. Microsoft's contract company connect people Internet business sell good service Web require favored treatment Internet Explorer Navigator exchange link Windows desktop. In wake lawsuit, Microsoft voluntarily dropped requirement, though could reinstate will. Microsoft say contract legal produce tangible benefit customer, including easier Internet access. The Justice Department say bundling Explorer Windows 95 inclusion browser part Windows 98 amount tying, illegal practice force customer one product purchase another. The contract manufacturer Internet service illegal, government say, intended create monopoly browser market protect Microsoft's existing monopoly operating system. The latter threat key, according Justice Department. Browsers potential, operating system, act software platform program run. So contract intended drive browser market would also insulate Windows monopoly. Many antitrust expert say problem facing Justice Department court provided clear definition tying clear guideline determining contract illegally exclusionary. Professor Lawrence White New York University, chief economist Justice Department's antitrust division early 1980s, say court treat tying unusual practice fact ubiquitous. No one, said, would challenge right manufacturer tie eraser tip pencil, tire automobile button shirt. His point, shared widely economist, tying benefit consumer if, example, result product easier use enables company recover development cost. But tying bad lock monopoly power. The court, White say, offered enough guidance distinguishing good tying bad, nub legal dispute. Microsoft say need show bundling Windows Explorer pass might called gross consumer benefit test offer immediate benefit, whether cause long-term damage competition and, therefore, ultimately consumer. The Justice Department say Microsoft's practice must clear higher hurdle: yielding net consumer benefit immediate large enough balance possible long-term harm competition. So test consumer benefit satisfies antitrust law? The simple answer one know sure, side reasonably cite case fear embarrassment. Consider 1985 case, Aspen Skiing Co. v. Aspen Highlands Skiing Corp., 1951 case, Lorain Journal Co. v. United States. In first, Aspen Skiing, owner three major ski run Aspen, Colo. monopolist year sold ticket cooperation Aspen Highlands, competitor, gave skier access companies' run. When Aspen Skiing unilaterally canceled agreement, rival's revenue shriveled rival sued. The Supreme Court ruled Aspen Skiing violated antitrust law evidence action helped consumer. In Lorain Journal case, local newspaper Lorain, Ohio, refused sell advertising company advertised new radio station. Here, too, Supreme Court ruled exclusionary practice nothing benefit consumer. Indeed, Aspen Skiing, court forced monopolist business rival, precedent augur well Justice Department, seek force Microsoft install Netscape's browser alongside own. But Charles Rule, legal consultant Microsoft, say case court threw exclusionary practice offered consumer benefit. The court, argues, never pounced practice resulted lower price better product service. Nor court either case call balancing immediate benefit hypothetical long-term harm. Rule argues Microsoft's practice produce demonstrable consumer benefit. Besides, say, action taken The Lorain Journal Aspen Skiing, Microsoft's contract prevent consumer installing Netscape's browser using Web site Microsoft's rival. In truth, though, neither case answered consumer benefit test apply product design. In Jefferson Parish Hospital District No. 2 et al. v. Hyde, another case cited side, Supreme Court 1984 recognized surgeon anesthesiologist provide integrated service. Yet, court said, hospital monopoly power would still allowed force surgical patient use panel anesthesiologist consumer wanted purchase two service separately. That principle could undercut Microsoft's defense functional interdependence Windows Explorer requires bundling. But Microsoft point strong concurring opinion called tougher standard government meet alleges tying. Microsoft also draw support several court ruling allowed IBM change design computer way made hard vendor attach peripheral equipment. But perhaps Microsoft's best argument nowhere government identified single case court explicitly called throwing tied product basis balancing test. The court, Microsoft emphasize, steer clear redesigning technically sophisticated product. The Justice Department's rejoinder note sole purpose antitrust law protect consumer, make sense bless practice provide dollar's worth benefit today but, stamping competition, drive price $1,000 tomorrow. The Justice Department ask court least insist monopolist use least exclusionary mean possible achieve service provide customer. Experts agree court subject Microsoft's restrictive contract Internet company balancing test. But exactly court decide whether consumer helped hurt grab. A balancing test would court weigh immediate benefit consumer one-click access Internet site feature bundled Windows-Explorer package harm time diminished competition market browser operating system. But test make good sense theory prove fiendishly difficult use practice. Balancing test impossibly difficult arbitrary, said Rep. Thomas Campbell, R-Calif., former law professor Stanford University. The practical effect balancing hand defendant Microsoft almost certain victory. Microsoft argues many antitrust expert agree court fact gravitated away balancing test simpler predation test exclusionary contract. Under standard, contract illegal intended drive competition thus pave way monopolist raise price later. Microsoft easier time defending charge predation, amount victimizing customer, would defending charge bundled product consumer slightly harm good. The antitrust record, say William Baxter, headed antitrust division President Reagan, littered contradictory, ambiguous sometimes nonsensical verdict. He legal expert agree nothing else, record leaf plenty legal leeway Supreme Court, hear Microsoft case, stiffen spine antitrust law. Shortly government filed antitrust suit Microsoft Corp. May, Joel Klein, assistant attorney general charge Justice Department's antitrust division, met Silicon Valley executive. The executive recall telling Klein unless case went Internet browser market, would little effect Microsoft's power stifle competition computer industry. Klein replied understood computer executive's concern. But said time running short strongest evidence hand involved Microsoft's battle Netscape Communications Corp. market so-called browser software used navigating Internet. This Netscape case, executive recall Klein saying. But five month later, case government bringing trial Monday extends well Netscape browser war embrace described recent court filing broad pattern anti-competitive conduct Microsoft. Netscape, government insists, still prime example pattern one several example. The 12-person witness list Justice Department 20 state suing Microsoft reflects new evidence added case May. James Barksdale, Netscape's president chief executive, appear first, followed executive representing cross section nation's high-technology company including Intel, IBM, Sun Microsystems, Apple Computer, America Online Intuit. In bringing ambitious, complicated case trial one filed May, government chosen high-risk strategy. The law state new evidence added suit filed, new charge. And so, federal courtroom Washington, U.S.District Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson could decide rule new evidence ranging far afield original suit. But government win broadened case, court-ordered remedy would doubt far tougher Microsoft. In May, government's suggested step amounted equal treatment Netscape's browser Microsoft's browser. But government recently asked judge hold separate hearing remedy, win case. The remedy consideration include basic change Microsoft's business practice perhaps breakup company intended loosen Microsoft's grip computing. That would precisely kind sweeping reform Microsoft's foe would applaud. The government doubled bet doubled stake, said David Yoffie, professor Harvard business school co-author book, Competing Internet Time: Lessons From Netscape Its Battle With Microsoft. Meanwhile, Microsoft camp, government's strategy dismissed desperate act taken court ruling June threatened undermine antitrust suit. That ruling came separate case, involving interpretation consent decree Microsoft signed Justice Department 1995. In June ruling, federal appeal court said Microsoft could bundle browser industry-standard Windows operating system call one product. The appeals-court ruling would seem undercut assertion government's current antitrust case browser operating system two separate product, bundled together given away effort thwart competition browser market. With appeals-court ruling June, government lost heart case, said Charles Rule, former senior official Justice Department, consultant Microsoft. So taken blunderbuss approach scrambling throw everything find evidence Justice Department year gun barrel see hit. The June appellate ruling shake prosecution team. But mostly strengthened hand Justice Department urging case broadened, according people worked investigation. At time, say, new evidence coming investigation moved ahead prosecutor raced meet accelerated trial schedule approved court. Speed priority outset, say. The Justice Department state filed suit May move Microsoft's new operating system, Windows 98, introduced June. While seeking block release Windows 98, government lawyer wanted get the courtroom early possible PC maker computer user adopt latest version Microsoft's Windows operating system, function central nervous system 90 percent personal computer sold. The key allegation, government lawyer note, changed May namely, Microsoft illegally used market power operating system defend monopoly position try extend new market. But thing wrapped bow time May filing browser, said one person worked case. The real game plan always get broader case. What more, one person noted, prosecution team full strength shortly suit filed. David Boies, renowned courtroom litigator former partner Cravath, Swaine &AMP; Moore successfully defended IBM 13-year confrontation government, named special counsel Justice Department last December. But Boies, left Cravath last year, start working full-time Justice Department mid-April, still finishing private case firm, Boies &AMP; Schiller. The antitrust suit filed May leaned heavily Netscape story, mentioning Microsoft's main rival browser market 130 time complaint supporting memorandum. But also prominently mentioned Microsoft's tactic Sun Microsystems, creator Java, Internet programming language, cited example Microsoft's behavior. It crafted template could added much stretching, one person involved case said. And so, new evidence piled seemed fit pattern, Klein step step approved widening case, person said. And explains, person continued, evidence hand Justice Department year added case May; gathering new evidence become apparent older material fit pattern current case. For example, government added contention Microsoft pressured Intel Corp., big microchip maker close partner Microsoft, curb development effort multimedia Internet software might conflict Microsoft's plan. The government contends arm-twisting occurred meeting two company three year ago, especially one Aug. 2, 1995, attended Andrew Grove, Intel chairman, Bill Gates, Microsoft chairman. Part government's evidence Intel-Microsoft episode copy handwritten note taken Steven McGeady, Intel vice president attended meeting, memo written Aug. 28, 1995. The memo, still court seal, said Gates made vague threat livid Intel's investment Internet wanted stopped. A handwritten note, also court seal, quote Paul Maritz, Microsoft executive, saying Netscape common enemy Intel's role fill stuff Microsoft's strategy. These document sent Intel Justice Department's office San Francisco November 1995, response Civil Investigative Demand civil subpoena served Intel Nov. 10, 1995. On own, Intel material intriguing, became part antitrust suit evidence surfaced, one person close case said. The government contending Microsoft also tried urge Apple stop selling Quicktime multimedia software Windows market tried convince Real Networks Inc. pull back market so-called streaming software. The government case also broadened, people involved case say, witness industry increasingly willing testify. In beginning, people industry believed government would lose Microsoft would retaliate came forward, one person said. But strength case perceived improve, people willing come forward, thing snowballed. You get Intel, easier get Apple on. \n","An Islamic militant group Thursday threatened retaliate Saudi dissident Osama bin Laden arrested, described Washington's No. 1 enemy hero Muslims worldwide. Bin Laden, believed Afghanistan, top aide indicted Wednesday U.S. District Court U.S. embassy bombings Africa accused conspiring kill Americans United States. The State Department also announced reward dlrs 5 million bin Laden's capture. It challenge entire Muslim world ... Bin Laden hero Muslim world, said Omar Warsi, leader Pakistan's militant Sunni Muslim group, Sipah-e-Sahaba, Guardians Friends Prophet. If anything happens him, America responsible. Many Sipah-e-Sahaba followers fighting neighboring Afghanistan alongside Taliban army, rules 90 percent Afghanistan imposed strict version Islamic law areas. Warsi's group well-armed everything machine guns rocket launchers. In Pakistan, blamed killings hundreds Shiite Muslims, group reviles non-Muslims based centuries-old dispute proper successor Prophet Mohammed. Harakat-ul-Ansar, Pakistan-based organization labeled terrorist group United States, said, however, foreigners Pakistan nothing fear us. Harakat considered strong supporter bin Laden, several Harakat followers killed U.S. missile attack alleged bin Laden terror sites Afghanistan. What United States business, said Abdul Bassit, Harakat follower. He added, however, United States know bin Laden good Muslim, Muslim world thinks good Muslim. The Taliban say bin Laden respected guest extradited. However, set judicial inquiry accept evidence bin Laden's involvement terrorist activity promised prosecute evidence warrants it. Washington blames bin Laden's group, al Qaeda, Aug. 7 bombings U.S. embassies Kenya Tanzania killed 224 people, including 12 Americans, injured estimated 5,000 people. The United States retaliated Aug. 20, firing Tomahawk cruise missiles suspected bin Laden training camps eastern Afghanistan. At least 26 people killed, damage area considered extensive. The U.S. Embassy Pakistan evacuated nonessential staff family members prior August bombing Afghanistan, fearing retaliation. While embassy workers back, dependents 30 percent staff allowed return. Embassy officials said fresh security warnings followed Wednesday's indictment. Security measures already place include cement barricades blocking road leading U.S. Embassy Islamabad razor-sharp barbed wire topping brick-walled compound. In northwestern Pakistani city Peshawar, border Afghanistan, U.S. consulate surrounded barbed wire protected armored personnel carrier dozens armed police. The New York Times said editorial Monday, Oct. 26: Since deadly bombing two American embassies Africa August, troubling accumulation evidence State Department inexplicably ignored warnings possible terrorist attacks installations. The latest disturbing account suggests nine months truck bombing Kenya, department received detailed description planned attack little strengthen security embassy. The pattern negligence demands examination Clinton administration Congress. Shortly bombing, department acknowledged American ambassador Kenya, Prudence Bushnell, earlier recommended embassy moved safer location. Her advice rejected. On Friday, Raymond Bonner James Risen The New York Times reported Egyptian believed directly involved bombings outlined Kenya plot American intelligence officials last November. Mustafa Mahmoud Said Ahmed's account specific  said terrorists planning detonate truck bomb embassy's underground garage  called temporary increase security. Unhappily, discounted, thought ruse lure embassy new security measures terrorists could monitor defeat. The logic hard fathom, harder still explain relatives Americans Kenyans killed attack nearly identical plan Ahmed described. Since bombings, department quick close embassies temporarily attacks seem imminent. It would interesting know intelligence decisions credible Ahmed's warning. No one State Department happy department's handling security matters, tendency blame limited funding bureaucratic inertia disheartening. Of course, additional money would made possible harden defenses embassies, Congress added security budget. But decisive leadership department could assured preventive steps taken East Africa. The Taliban's chief justice accused United States Wednesday looking excuse launch another missile attack war-shattered homeland. And excuse Osama bin Laden, man Washington calls Enemy No. 1 blames Aug. 7 bombings U.S. embassies East Africa, Justice Noor Mohammed Saqib said interview The Associated Press. On Aug. 20 United States retaliated firing Tomahawk missiles suspected terrorist camps eastern Afghanistan, killing 26 people. According U.S. intelligence sources, camps used train members bin Laden's al Qaeda terrorist group. America looking excuse fire rockets dear Afghanistan excuse bin Laden, Saqib said. Washington, posted dlrs 5 million reward bin Laden's arrest, ruled attacks Afghanistan. Saqib, heads judicial inquiry established Taliban investigate terrorism charges bin Laden, says United States become insecure. America fears shadow ... every part world afraid sees every danger connected bin Laden, said interview Afghan capital Kabul. In Afghanistan, bin Laden considered honored guest Taliban hosts. They cite Afghan tradition, demands host guarantee guest protection. So far Saqib says evidence bin Laden's involvement terrorist activities. The Taliban refused turn bin Laden United States, say evidence try Islamic law. In 90 percent Afghanistan ruled Taliban harsh brand Islamic justice imposed, including death penalty. We want good relations United States Muslim non-Muslim countries, respect ways, said. Saqib said inquiry wind Nov. 20 evidence bin Laden case closed  least Taliban. Bin Laden sinful man ... America silent ... given evidence, said. It shameful America seen world reason go bin Laden. The man accused orchestrating U.S. embassy bombings Tanzania Kenya declared free man Friday Afghanistan, lived years permission hard-line Islamic Taliban militia. The Taliban, control 90 percent Afghanistan, Friday closed three-week inquiry allegations Osama bin Laden waging war terror United States. It's over, America presented evidence, Afghanistan's chief justice, Noor Mohammed Saqib, told The Associated Press interview Supreme Court building Afghan capital, Kabul. Without evidence, bin Laden man sin. ... He free man. The Taliban told bin Laden, however, political activity banned agreed respect that, Taliban information minister said statement Friday. The minister, Amir Khan Muttaqi, also disputed U.S. assertions bin Laden rich man, saying Saudi dissident foreign assets frozen, claim immediately corroborated. Police soldiers Friday blocked street front house members terrorist gang believed assembled bomb blew U.S. Embassy, killing 11 people. Wearing gloves masks, detectives Tanzanian Criminal Investigation Division could seen searching yard house surrounded high fence. Residents, questioned Thursday Tanzanian police FBI agents, told reporters Friday four regular visitors house. They came night used white 1989 Suzuki Samuri, police custody. Two men, Tanzanian Rashid Saleh Hemed Egyptian Mustafa Mahmoud Said Ahmed, formally charged Tanzanian magistrate Aug. 7 embassy bombing. Police looking two suspects identified Ahmad Khalfan, Tanzanian Omani origin Fahad, Kenyan Yemeni origin. A relative Hemed told The Associated Press house Bungoni neighborhood Ilala district rented Ahmad Khalfan. The house south center Dar es Salaam 6.5 kilometers (4 miles) southwest embassy building. The relative, spoke condition anonymity, said addition Khalfan, three visitors house Fahad, Ahmed Hussein. He furnish second names them, clear whether Ahmed Egyptian charged Dar es Salaam bombing. Residents said police showed photographs, able identify always dark arrived left. But able identify Suzuki vehicle. Officials believe 1987 Nissan Atlas refrigerator truck actually carried bomb embassy compound. It identified chassis, remains. There speculation two men Suzuiki used remote control device detonate bomb. A nearly simultaneous attack neighboring Kenya killed 213 people, including 12 Americans, U.S. Embassy Nairobi. U.S. authorities charged four people connection Nairobi blast. Three custody New York, fourth fugitive. Mohamed Sadeek Odeh, one three men custody United States Nairobi bombing, told police Pakistan arrested arriving Nairobi Aug. 7 Ahmad Khalfan member group responsible bombing Dar es Salaam. According Pakistani police sources, Odeh identified Fahad involved Nairobi embassy bombing. A federal grand jury Manhattan returned 238-count indictment Wednesday charging Saudi exile Osama bin Laden conspiring bomb two U.S. embassies Africa August committing acts terrorism Americans abroad. Government officials immediately announced offering two rewards $5 million information leading arrest conviction bin Laden another man charged Wednesday, Muhammad Atef, described bin Laden's chief military commander. Bin Laden believed living Afghanistan protection Taliban, Islamic fundamentalist movement rules country. Atef's whereabouts unknown. Prosecutors also unsealed earlier indictment, issued June, included similar less detailed charges bin Laden. That indictment returned embassy bombings result two-year investigation activities Somalia Saudi Arabia, well reports connections circle Islamic militants Brooklyn. The new indictment, supersedes June action, accused bin Laden leading vast terrorist conspiracy 1989 present, said working concert governments, including Sudan, Iraq Iran, terrorist groups, build weapons attack American military installations. But indictment gives details bin Laden's alleged involvement embassy attacks. The indictment not, example, specify whether prosecutors evidence bin Laden gave direct orders carried attacks. Nothing document indicates original indictment kept secret months, secret charges returned time American officials plotting possible raid Afghanistan arrest bin Laden. Mary Jo White, U.S. attorney Manhattan, said, It's common sealed indictments trying apprehend indicted. Both indictments offer new information bin Laden's operations, including one deal said struck Iraq cooperate development weapons return bin Laden's agreeing work country.

Xu Wenli's trial Monday almost certain conviction would deprive nascent opposition political party potent organizer moderate voice. He third influential leader China Democracy Party tried three-week campaign seen least 32 members detained questioned. For organizing party thereby challenging ruling Communist Party, Xu, 55, accused subverting state power, crime punishable 10 years life prison. To prevent supporters rallying Beijing's No. 1 Intermediate People's Court, police detained two Xu's colleagues Sunday kept watch homes least two others, friends Hong Kong-based rights group reported. As police moved Xu's friends, labor rights campaigner Liu Nianchun taken prison camp Beijing and, wife daughter, put plane Canada New York, first taste freedom 3 1/2 years. Authorities released Liu medical parole five months end sentence provided go abroad, said brother, exiled democracy campaigner Liu Qing. His wife claimed two years Liu's health worsening. But last month authorities grant comprehensive exam. Doctors found tumors, perhaps cancerous, 50-year-old's mouth, stomach bowels, Liu Qing said. The timing Liu's exile Xu's trial brazen string high-profile dissident releases calculated influence Western governments. Human rights groups immediately denounced Liu's release cynical manipulative. The Chinese government continues play hostage politics true commitment international human rights standards, said Xiao Qiang Human Rights China, New York-based lobbying group Liu Qing heads. Over two years, China tried woo West, Beijing signed two key U.N. rights treaties praise bringing spotty legal system closer international standards. The ruling Communist Party relaxed controls dissenting views academics. Xu Wenli dissidents saw opportunity open atmosphere. Over six months, dissidents 14 provinces cities tried use Chinese laws set register China Democracy Party. In sign opposition party's appeal, 205 dissidents China issued petition Sunday calling immediate release Xu two leaders, Hong Kong-based Information Center Human Rights Democratic Movement China reported. To wipe opposition movement, authorities violated recently revised laws supposed protect rights criminal suspects. They rushed Xu fellow leader Qin Yongmin trial less four days notice given families, instead 10 required law. Qin third principal organizer, Wang Youcai, also denied legal counsel. Police detained scared prospective lawyers, forcing two argue defenses separate trials Thursday. No verdicts announced. The Beijing court appointed Xu lawyer, wife, He Xintong, suspects merely formality expects show trial. He read whole indictment. How going represent husband? He Xintong said talking lawyer aide. Authorities turned requests Xu's colleagues attend trial, He said given one pass, herself. Xu edited influential dissident journal Democracy Wall movement 20 years ago spent 12 years prison, solitary confinement. Since parole ended last year, Xu played role elder adviser dissidents. He became openly involved China Democracy Party November, organizing group's branch Beijing nearby Tianjin. Shortly arrest, called party members exiled dissidents convene nationwide congress. The trials three outspoken dissidents over, Communist Party leader Jiang Zemin signaled Wednesday China sustain crackdown dissent throughout next year. In second hard-line speech six days, Jiang vowed crush challenges Communist Party rule preserve social stability. He demanded officials talk politics  euphemism party orders. The speech, senior law enforcement officials, used uncompromising language heard less frequently 18 months Chinese leaders sought improve relations abroad. Jiang's harsh tone punctuated summary trials convictions subversion week three political critics tried form opposition party. To underscore party's intolerant mood, national newspapers ran brief accounts Tuesday Wednesday 13-, 12- 11-year prison terms given Xu Wenli, Qin Yongmin Wang Youcai. Dissidents rarely mentioned official media, reports served warning China's 1.2 billion people. In speech, reported state television, Jiang said stability crucial next year. He noted two key events political calendar: 50th anniversary Communist Party rule Oct. 1 China's recovery Portuguese colony Macau Dec. 20. We must strengthen ideological political education officials raise awareness resistance sabotaging acts hostile domestic foreign forces, China Central Television quoted Jiang saying. Whenever element undermines stability raises head, must resolutely nipped bud. Jiang exclusively target political enemies. He likened threat white-collar ordinary criminals ticked list potentially volatile problems  inefficient state industries, legions laid-off workers, stagnating farmers' incomes corrupt officials. The emphasis stability warnings would disrupt reminiscent party pronouncements waning years Jiang's mentor, Deng Xiaoping. After Deng died 1997 Jiang emerged victorious major party conclave, projected confident image. Reform, stability, bywords year. Academic debates year boldest 10 years China's relatively controlled standards. Party leaders touted efforts build comprehensive, predictable legal system praise Western governments signing U.N. rights treaties. Our active developments foreign affairs reached new achievements, Jiang said. Our country's stature risen step higher. By arresting convicting Xu, Qin Wang less three weeks, China trampled legal safeguards criminal suspects raised questions commitments U.N. rights treaties signed 15 months. Despite swift punishments given three, dissidents continued campaign justice. Four elder members dissident community sent letter U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan U.N. human rights commissioner Mary Robinson calling China stop persecuting political critics release political prisoners. We experienced extreme disappointment, worry shock long sentences given Xu, Qin Wang recent detentions several Chinese, four wrote letter dated Tuesday released New York-based Human Rights China Wednesday. In addition, 214 dissidents China planned 100-day series rotating 24-hour fasts beginning Thursday protest sentences, Information Center Human Rights Democratic Movement China reported Wednesday night.

It conveyed behalf European Union, United States, Canada Norway. In stern judgments capping decisive crackdown dissidents, Chinese courts sentenced two prominent democracy campaigners 13 11 years prison Monday trying organize opposition political party. The 13-year prison term given Xu Wenli 3 1/2-hour trial Beijing longest Chinese dissident three years.

Xu's conviction deprives would-be opposition group potent organizer fractured dissident community large strong moderating voice. Xu remained defiant tightly controlled trial subversion charges. He refused answer questions prosecutors judges responded lawyer, court-appointed attorney, Mo Shaoping, said. When court asked would appeal, Xu Wenli said would appeal, Mo said, quoting client saying political persecution. Xu's daughter also criticized verdict. All wanted advocate free speech make sure party registers peacefully. But government failed test, father go jail it, said daughter Xu Jin, graduate student Boston University. Security forces orchestrated concerted crackdown, trampling China's slim legal safeguards crush China Democracy Party. In three weeks, least 32 people detained questioned Xu, Wang another leading member, Qin Yongmin, put trial. All three charged trying subvert China's Communist Party-led system. Xu Qin given less four days prepare defenses. Last Thursday, Wang Qin faced trials legal counsel police detained scared potential lawyers. No verdict announced Qin's case.

The courts ruled two severely punished repeat offenders, Xinhua said indirect reference previous democracy campaigning. Wary China Democracy Party's appeal, scores uniformed plainclothes police sealed Beijing's No. 1 Intermediate People's Court Monday Xu's trial.

Gao, helped Xu organize party's Beijing branch, said authorities would able arrest party's supporters. In six months, party attracted enough try register branches 14 provinces cities. The U.S. government exiled dissidents, many supported party's efforts, denounced sentences called dissidents' release. We deeply disappointed guilty verdict extremely harsh sentence given Mr. Xu, said U.S. Embassy spokesman Bill Palmer. No individual arrested, tried sentenced exercising internationally recognized freedoms. Xu, 55, edited underground journal Democracy Wall movement 20 years ago spent 12 years prison, mostly solitary confinement. Since parole ended last year, behind-the-scenes advisor host dissident activities. He supported Qin Yongmin, another Democracy Wall veteran, setting independent human rights monitor advised run local legislative seats Beijing.

Wang Youcai, student leader Tiananmen Square democracy demonstrations 1989 32, publicly declared China Democracy Party's formation June said group intended challenge Communist Party's 49-year ban opposition politics. Police sporadically detained supporters democracy party. The decisive move came Nov. 30 Chinese Communist Party leader Jiang Zemin returned Japan, ending busy two years diplomatic forays. In speech broadcast nationwide Friday, Jiang warned subversives trying bring system vowed never copy Western democracy. To allay international criticism, China released respected labor rights campaigner, Liu Nianchun, 3 1/2 years prison camps Sunday sent exile United States. German Foreign Minister Joschka Fischer, drew China's anger recently meeting exiled dissident Wei Jingsheng, said China's sentencing two dissidents Monday unacceptable flouted international treaty country recently signed. The reaction Chinese courts totally unacceptable, Fischer said, calling dissidents' immediate release. The accused simply tried peaceful means exercise right free speech assembly, guaranteed China's constitution, United Nations' International Covenant Civil Political Rights China recently signed, Fischer said statement. Chinese courts sentenced dissidents Xu Wenli Wang Youcai 13 11 years trying organize opposition political party. Hours China expected sign key U.N. human rights treaty host British Prime Minister Tony Blair, police hauled prominent human rights campaigner questioning Monday. Qin Yongmin's latest run-in authorities came tried second time week legally register human rights monitoring group.

Paris-based Reporters Without Borders urged Blair call release Gao Yu, Liu Xiaobo Liu Jingsheng. The three 13 journalists imprisoned simply attempting practice profession, said statement. By sentencing two country's prominent democracy campaigners long prison terms, China Monday took harshest steps current crackdown organized political opposition. After trial lasted three half hours, Xu Wenli  55 dean dissident movement, man already spent 12 years prison advocating democracy  sentenced 13 years subversion state power. Xu's alleged crimes included helping organize new political party, calling end Communist rule interviews foreign journalists, calling independent labor unions and, prosecutors said, accepting $500 dissident abroad.

Wang tried subversion charges Thursday brief court session, defense lawyer, eastern city Hangzhou. The punishment third veteran democracy campaigner, Qin Yongmin, 44, announced. His trial began central city Wuhan Thursday may reconvene Tuesday, relatives said. A similarly long sentence expected. Monday's sentences, came six months President Clinton's visit Beijing, publicly challenged China's leaders move quickly political reform, harshly criticized State Department. They also appeared spell effective end China Democracy Party, three men, hundreds lesser-known individuals, tried organize recent months. The long sentences also crushed hopes many liberal intellectuals China's warming relations United States recent years signing global treaties human rights might bring significant easing political controls. Xu tried Monday morning Beijing Intermediate Court. When brief recess three-judge panel announced 13-year sentence, Xu stood shouted, I protest! said wife 28 years, He Xintong. Then, said Ms. He lawyers present, shouted judges unfair would appeal case proceedings illegitimate. With sentencing Xu, China's Communist government silenced one energetic persistent critics, one given adult life cause democracy. Xu first came prominence Democracy Wall movement late 1970s, served 12 years prison, much solitary confinement. In last several months, sensing new opportunity speak making constant use fax machines e-mail, Qin tried draw attention China's obligations two international covenants signed  one economic cultural rights, one civil political rights. In face several temporary detentions stiff warnings, continued activities. Wang, contrast, first became involved dissident activities 1989, graduate student physics Beijing, became leader Tiananmen Square demonstrations. After student movement smashed army, most-wanted list, arrested spent two years prison. During Clinton's visit China June, Wang announced formation China Democracy Party.

But government allowed somewhat freer discussion political topics universities obscure journals last year, allowed challenges  print form organized groups  principle Communist Party rule.

After learning Monday's sentences, American Embassy here, spent last two years building improved relations China United States, issued strong condemnation termed deplorable decisions. We deeply disappointed guilty verdicts extremely harsh sentences, statement said. No individual arrested, tried sentenced exercising internationally recognized freedoms, including guaranteed International Covenant Civil Political Rights, China committed itself. Like Thursday's trials, proceeded defense attorneys prospective lawyers warned police detained, Monday's proceeding showed cases involving security issues, police courts could write rules. According criminal procedure law, defendants notified least 10 days trial, Xu told four days ago trial would Monday. His wife, Monday allowed contact arrest Nov. 30, told three days ago. Under law, defendants also right lawyer choice, Xu assigned lawyer court late last week. Before Monday morning's trial, lawyer, Mo Shaoping, saw client one brief meeting, associate Mo's said.
