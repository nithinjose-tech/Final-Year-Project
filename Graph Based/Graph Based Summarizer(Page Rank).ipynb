We had to watch for everything.The stone-faced scrutiny of the East German border guards helpedgive Checkpoint Charlie its chilling cachet.The checkpoint went up with the Berlin Wall in 1961.With the wall being dismantled daily in anticipation of Germanunification, U.S. officials decided to remove Checkpoint Charliewith a grand flourish.Secretary of State James A. Baker III, Soviet Foreign MinisterEduard Shevardnadze and their counterparts from France, Britain andthe two Germanys presided over the ceremony.While the Berlin Wall is coming down, temporary barricades wereput up to keep the public from the ceremony.\n"]}]}]}
