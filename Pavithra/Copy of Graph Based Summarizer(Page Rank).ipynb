Astronomers are starting to tingle again in anticipation of what the Hubble will be able to accomplish, said Lennard Fisk, head of NASA science activities. Air Force forecasters said there was a 90 percent chance the weather would be favorable for launching the shuttle at the scheduled time of 8:31 a.m. EDT. More than a half million gallons of liquid hydrogen and liquid oxygen were pumped into the space ship's fuel tanks after midnight. The astronauts, wearing bright orange flight suits, climbed into the crew cabin just as dawn was breaking over the Kennedy Space Center. The $1.5 billion telescope, NASA's costliest cargo, will give astronomers a new set of eyes and ears that we don't have, said William Lenoir, head of NASA's space flight program. It's going to change our perspective altogether. I can't say what we're going to learn, but I'll be astounded if we don't learn many new things. Discovery was aiming for an altitude of 380 miles, the highest a shuttle has ever gone, so the telescope can be placed in its proper orbit far above Earth's distorting atmosphere. It is the 35th shuttle mission. Columbia, which journeys into space next month with the Astro observatory, sat on a launch pad 1.6 miles from Discovery, only the second time both pads have been occupied; the first was in 1986 just before the Challenger explosion. Hubble has been waiting to take its place in space since 1983, delayed by technical problems and the Challenger accident. The latest postponement occurred April 10, when Discovery's launch was scrubbed four minutes before liftoff because of a faulty power unit on the shuttle. The mood at the Kennedy Space Center was considerably less festive than during the first launch attempt, when hundreds of astronomers gathered with their families. The day after launch, mission specialist Steven A. Hawley will use the shuttle's mechanical arm to lift the 24,250-pound telescope into space. Veteran spacewalkers Bruce McCandless II and Kathryn Sullivan will assist if a problem develops. Discovery will follow Hubble from 40 miles away for two days until after its lens cap is opened, exposing the finely polished 94.5-inch mirror to starlight. Hubble is not expected to start providing scientific data by satellite for a month or more after liftoff. However, NASA said it will release its first image  an open star cluster in the constellation Carina  a week after launch. In addition to the $1.5 billion cost of Hubble, $500 million has been spent on spare parts, astronaut training and computer software to operate the instrument. The European Space Agency contributed $250 million for 15 percent of the viewing time. NASA estimates it will cost $200 million a year to operate and maintain the telescope in space. During its 15-year working lifetime, the telescope will provide astronomers with 10 times better resolution and 25 times more sensitivity than ground-based observatories. As a result, they will be able to study stars and galaxies so distant their light has been traveling toward Earth for 14 billion years. Astronomers hope to learn whether the universe was created 15 billion years ago as believed and uncover some of the mystery surrounding galaxies, black holes and quasars. Hubble also is expected to shed light on how and when the universe might end. The telescope is named for the late astronomer Edwin P. Hubble, who discovered during the 1920s that the universe is expanding. His work gave rise to the Big Bang theory that the universe was created by a tremendous explosion. In addition to Hubble, Discovery carries a human skull filled with sensors to measure the space radiation that astronauts receive. It is the skull's third trip into space. The shuttle is to end its five-day mission with a landing at Edwards Air Force Base, Calif. Discovery's five astronauts returned Sunday for a second attempt to launch the shuttle with NASA's most valuable and celebrated payload, the $1.5 billion Hubble Space Telescope. Discovery is scheduled to lift off at 8:31 a.m. EDT Tuesday. We feel very confident that things are going to go well this time, said Discovery's commander, Air Force Col. Loren J. Shriver. We're going to come out OK on Tuesday morning and, if not, we'll just keep trying until we do. That's kind of the name of the game here, Shriver said. NASA test director Mike Leinbach said Sunday that the countdown was proceeding smoothly and the shuttle appeared to be in perfect condition. The countdown got under way Saturday afternoon. A faulty power unit forced the first launch attempt to be scrubbed four minutes before liftoff April 10. The unit was replaced with a new one, which tests showed to be fine. Hopefully, we'll get the shuttle off the pad this time, Leinbach said. A 70 percent chance of favorable weather was expected at launch time, with low clouds being the main concern, said the Air Force's Ed Priselac, shuttle weather officer. A weak cold front from the north was expected to pass through the area by Monday night. The outlook is considerably better for Wednesday and Thursday, Priselac said. As Discovery's astronauts arrived from Johnson Space Center in Houston early Sunday afternoon, the shuttle Columbia was being transported to a launch pad 1.6 miles from Discovery. It is only the second time both shuttle launch pads at Kennedy Space Center have been occupied simultaneously. The first time was in January 1986; 16 days after Columbia lifted off, Challenger exploded. Columbia commander Vance Brand said he does not believe the National Aeronautics and Space Administration is moving too fast with his shuttle. NASA expects to launch Columbia with an astronomical observatory called Astro no earlier than May 16, one week later than planned because of Discovery's two-week delay. In some cases, it could be a problem having shuttles on both launch pads, Brand said. In this particular case, everything's fitting together. NASA has until Saturday to get Discovery off the ground. After that, all launch attempts must be halted for eight days so Hubble's batteries can be recharged. The six nickel-hydrogen batteries will power Hubble from the time it is disconnected from Discovery's electrical system until its two energy-collecting solar panels take over in space. Discovery's payload bay was sealed late Saturday night, drastically reducing the risk of contamination to the telescope's finely polished 94.5-inch mirror. Discovery will aim for an altitude of 380 miles, the highest a shuttle has ever gone, so the telescope can be placed in its proper orbit far above Earth's distorting atmosphere. During Hubble's 15-year journey through space, astronomers expect to look back to nearly the beginning of time and solve some of the universe's most perplexing mysteries. Astro will measure ultraviolet radiation undetected by Hubble and thus provide additional targets for the telescope. The $100 million observatory also will focus during Columbia's nine-day mission on Comet Austin, believed to be on its first trip through the solar system. Both Hubble and Astro were scheduled for launch in 1986, but were delayed by the Challenger accident. The Hubble Space Telescope was awakened from its self-induced sleep today but it was still without the use of its high-speed antennas, and its science instruments were on hold, unable to begin any observations. We are out of the `safe-mode' right now, said Steve Terry, a supervisor of the engineers controlling the telescope. He said the telescope was running on a normal control-all mode, where its own computers and sensors guide where it is pointing. Discovery's astronauts, meanwhile, packed their gear for a return to Earth Sunday, made some last-minute observations of Earth and talked with ground-based reporters about their flight. Pilot Charles Bolden said he was especially upbeat about the widespread public awareness of the telescope, which is expected eventually to look back 14 billion light years  nearly to the birth of the universe. It's hard to go somewhere and find someone who has never heard of the Hubble Space Telescope, said Bolden. It makes little kids' eyes light up. It makes little kids want to learn how to add and subtract and study science. The telescope's big eye has remained open, but Hubble had been in a safe mode with all motion stopped because of earlier problems in linking the high-speed dish antennas with a relay satellite. The antennas are the primary links for relaying scientific data to the ground. Terry said that even in the safe mode, one of the tape recorders in the telescope reads telemetry signals from all its systems and that these would be played to Earth and analyzed when the antennas are working properly. We expect to use that data to investigate what happened, he said. Engineers are able to send commands to the telescope via its secondary antennas but the communications system is not useful for scientific data, which must be transmitted at a high rate of speed. We're putting the scientific instruments in a hold mode, in effect a standby mode, he said. Shortly after 6 a.m. EDT, controllers at the Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Md., completed a series of commands that took the telescope out of its safe mode and then began to run a 12-hour computer program to monitor Hubble's health. It will take another day before the $1.5 billion telescope is operating the way it was supposed to at this point in the startup process, said Hubble deputy project manager Jean Olivier. We're backing up to a very deliberate and slow and careful approach to these problems, Olivier said Friday. This is not the time to do anything dumb. The telescope problems have put the flight center several days behind, but the five astronauts who deployed it earlier this week were sticking to their schedule. Landing is scheduled for 9:48 a.m. EDT Sunday at Edwards Air Force Base, Calif., but flight controllers were keeping a close watch on the weather. Winds were predicted to be about 20 mph with gusts up to 29 mph. Mission rules dictate that headwinds cannot exceed 29 mph at touchdown. The shuttle carries enough supplies to stay in orbit three days beyond Sunday if necessary, NASA said. Mission Control awakened the crew members at about 1:30 a.m. EDT today by playing the song, Cosmos. Thanks for the wake-up music, it's pretty appropriate for today, said Commander Loren Shriver. The song was selected in honor of Hubble Space Telescope, which is now open for business, said Mission Control commentator James Hartsfield. The astronauts were to finish up their experiments and photography today and pack for the trip home. They also planned to hold a news conference from space with reporters at the Johnson Space Center. Shriver and pilot Charles Bolden were to run through a series of tests to make certain the shuttle's computers and control jets were ready for return to Earth. The crew deployed Hubble on Wednesday but they had stayed close to the telescope in case there was trouble opening the aperture door. Mission specialists Bruce McCandless and Kathryn Sullivan were prepared to perform a space walk today to crank it open in orbit 380 miles above Earth. But that proved unnecessary when the door was opened Friday morning, exposing the telescope's finely polished 94.5-inch eye to starlight for the first time. Two of Hubble's four position-stabilizing gyroscopes stopped working when the door opened, but engineers later got them back on line. The gyroscopes were knocked out by the motion and that, too, kept the telescope in the safe mode, said Dave Drachlis, director of orbital verifications at Goddard. A colleague, Steve Terry, said Hubble's systems were set at conservative limits for the first operations and that caused many malfunctions. There also were two communications outages totaling several hours. Hubble is designed with safe modes so it can be the master of its own destiny in case contact with an orbiting communications system is lost for extended periods, Terry said. NASA had planned to release its first test image from the telescope on Tuesday, showing an open star cluster in the constellation Carina. But Terry said that would be delayed because of the antenna problems. Scientific data will follow in a month or two. The telescope, named for the late astronomer Edwin P. Hubble, will enable astronomers over its 15-year working lifetime to look back 14 billion years and possibly determine the age of the universe. The universe is believed to have been created about 15 billion years ago in a cosmic explosion. Hubble provided the basis for the big-bang theory of creation. He discovered during the 1920s that the universe is expanding and that the farther the galaxy is from Earth, the faster it is moving away. After years of delay and a last-minute snag, the Hubble Space Telescope was freed from the shuttle Discovery on Wednesday and, glinting in the sunlight, drifted into orbit on its 15-year search for new worlds. Mission specialist Steven Hawley released Hubble from the end of the shuttle's 50-foot-long mechanical arm after a delay in getting one of the telescope's solar wings unfurled. The first of NASA's great observatories is now on station at 330 nautical miles above the Earth, Mission Control's Jeffrey Carr said. The telescope really looked great as we flew away from it, and we sure hope it does good work, Discovery commander Loren J. Shriver said later. The $1.5 billion telescope was released at 3:38 p.m. EDT as the shuttle entered its 20th orbit of Earth, nearly two hours and one orbit later than planned. The shuttle then backed away. Thank you very much for the ride, said Mike Harrington, director of orbital verifications at Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Md. Mission specialists Bruce McCandless and Kathryn Sullivan had been in the shuttle's airlock, ready to walk inspace to free the solar panel. That proved to be unnecessary. Close but no cigar, but better for the Hubble that it went the way it did, Sullivan said. She and McCandless had trained for nearly five years to make such a rescue mission. The first solar array unreeled from its mast at midday Wednesday as the shuttle passed 380 statute miles, or 330 nautical miles, above South America's eastern coast. It started providing power to the telescope's batteries, which otherwise had only eight hours of charge. Deployment of the starboard panel, however, was more troublesome. It wouldn't budge when latches were first released, then moved about a fifth of its 39-foot length, and stopped again. A third attempt rolled the panel out all the way. Houston, we see motion, Commander Loren J. Shriver reported. Hawley began the long process of releasing Hubble shortly after 7 a.m. EDT when he grasped it with Discovery's 50-foot-long mechanical arm and carefully hoisted the 12{-ton telescope high above the shuttle. Hubble was taken off shuttle electrical power just before it was lifted out of the cargo bay and was operating on its own nickel-hydrogen batteries. At one day, seven minutes into the flight of Discovery, Hubble is now on its own internal power, Carr said. The game has begun. The race is on. The clock is ticking. Worries that the telescope's instruments would be starved for electricity eased after the first solar panel was stretched out. Television cameras aboard Discovery showed the first array as it was pulled from its reel slowly but steadily, the sun reflecting off the gold-colored panel and silvery telescope. Discovery was 380 statute miles above Earth, 70 miles higher than any shuttle has ever flown. The orbit was dictated by the need to put the telescope above the Earth's distorting atmosphere. Discovery's five astronauts were awed by the view. I'd like to pass on the quote of the day from the on-board astronomer something to the effect that the big marble sure looks far away today, Shriver said of Hawley. Astronomers have waited seven years for Hubble to take its place in space. The telescope originally was scheduled for launch in 1983, but technical problems and the Challenger explosion pushed it back. The mission was delayed another two weeks when a faulty power unit on Discovery forced the National Aeronautics and Space Administration to halt the first launch attempt four minutes before April 10's scheduled liftoff. On Tuesday, Discovery finally blasted into space, transporting Hubble out of this world and in search of others. The telescope's 10-foot aperture door is to be opened Friday, exposing the finely polished 94.5-inch mirror to starlight. Discovery was following Hubble in case the door does not open properly. If a problem develops, McCandless and Sullivan will be prepared once again to walk in space. Fred Wojtalik, Hubble project manager, said the telescope would be tested Thursday for its ability to maneuever before the aperture door is opened. We want to be in full control so we don't ever endanger the Hubble by putting the aperture door close to the sunlight, he said. The telescope cannot focus into the sun because of the sensitivity of its five instruments. If all goes well, the crew will land Sunday at Edwards Air Force Base, Calif. NASA expects to release its first image from the telescope  of an open star cluster in the constellation Carina  on Tuesday. Data will follow in a month or two. Astronomers hope to look back to almost the beginning of the time, studying stars and galaxies so distant their light has been traveling to Earth for 14 billion years. They expect to determine precisely how and when the universe was formed, currently estimated at 15 billion years ago. The telescope is named for the late American astronomer Edwin P. Hubble, who discovered during the 1920s that the universe was expanding. He also was responsible for helping to form the Big Bang theory of creation. Ground controllers at the Goddard Space Flight Center finally made contact today with the two main antennas on the $1.5 billion Hubble Space Telescope after trying for more than six hours to lock on. Applause erupted in the Hubble control center in Greenbelt, Md., as the glitch that marred Hubble's first full day in space was solved. We have confirmation that we have achieved communication with the Tracking and Data Relay Satellite through the high-gain antenna system, said NASA's Dave Drachlis. Engineers had said all along they believed the antennas were working all right and that the problem was in incorrectly pointing either the satellite or the TDRS, an orbiting communications satellite that acts as a switchboard. In the successful attempt, they nearly doubled the width of the antennas' beams to take in more territory, from a sweep of 6.2 degrees to 10.8 degrees. The telescope's low-gain antennas, which receive and transmit information at a much slower rate and can be used in emergencies, were working well. Space shuttle Discovery was 46 miles away, available to remedy certain problems. The outage was not a problem for which space walkers would have been summoned. The five astronauts were otherwise busy making pictures of storms over Texas from their 380-mile-high perch, and doing experiments. Steve Terry, director of a team calibrating various aspects of the telescope, said the first outage was caused by human error and was not a serious problem. It began between 1 and 1:30 a.m. EDT and lasted 45 minutes to an hour, he said. The second failure occurred at 6:44 a.m. when controllers attempted to send a signal to the telescope's two high-gain antennas through the TDRS. This time it was a pointing problem, said Jim Elliott, a Goddard spokesman. It's a new spacecraft and we think inexperience dealing with it was the cause. The telescope, embarking on a 15-year search for new worlds, was released from the shuttle's cargo bay Wednesday after a last-minute snag that almost sent two astronauts on an emergency spacewalk. Mission Control awakened the crew early today with a loud rendition of the song Shout, a fraternity house favorite. Good morning, Discovery. I guess you're awake after that song, said Kathy Thornton, shuttle communicator. There are a lot of happy people down here. We saw a great deploy yesterday and Hubble had a good night while you were asleep. We appreciate the good words from everybody, replied Discovery Commander Loren Shriver. After Wednesday's deployment, Shriver gently backed Discovery away from the telescope and put the shuttle through a series of maneuvers, the last one completed this morning, to park Discovery in orbit 46 miles behind Hubble. The telescope really looked great as we flew away from it, and we sure hope it does good work, Shriver said Wednesday. Well, it sure is now, Loren, and thanks for all the great work you've done, replied Mission Control. Galileo is real proud of you. Scientists have hailed the Hubble  NASA's most expensive unmanned spacecraft  as the greatest advance in astronomy since Galileo raised a small telescope to his eyes nearly 400 years ago. Discovery and its five astronauts will follow the telescope while controllers at the Goddard center make sure Hubble is operating properly, such as responding to directional commands. The next milestone is Friday, when the telescope's 10-foot aperture door is to be opened, exposing the finely polished 94.5-inch mirror to starlight. Then on Tuesday, NASA expects to release the first image from the telescope: an open star cluster in the constellation Carina. Data will follow in a month or two. If the aperture door doesn't open properly, Discovery could return to the telescope so two astronauts could perform a spacewalk to fix it. Hubble project manager Fred Wojtalik said the telescope would be tested today for its ability to maneuver before the aperture door is opened. We want to be in full control so we don't ever endanger the Hubble by putting the aperture door close to the sunlight, he said. Too much light could damage the telescope's sensitive instruments. On Wednesday, mission specialist Steve Hawley used the shuttle's 50-foot robot arm to gently grasp the 12{-ton telescope and hoist it from the cargo bay. One of the telescope's solar arrays unreeled from its mast as expected and started providing power to the telescope's batteries, which otherwise had only eight hours of charge. But there was trouble with the second panel. It wouldn't budge when the latches were released, and then moved about a fifth of its 39-foot length and stopped again. The panel rolled all the way out on the third attempt. By the final attempt, astronauts Bruce McCandless and Kathryn Sullivan were in their space suits in the airlock, 30 minutes away from taking tools in hand and going on an outer-space maintenance call. Wojtalik said the cause of the problem is unknown. The 8{-hour procedure was performed 380 miles above Earth, 70 miles higher than any shuttle has ever flown. The orbit was dictated by the need to put Hubble above the Earth's distorting atmosphere. Astronomers hope to use the telescope to look back to almost the beginning of the time, studying stars and galaxies so distant their light has taken 14 billions years to reach Earth. They hope to determine how and when the universe was formed, currently estimated at 15 billion years ago. The telescope originally was scheduled for launch in 1983 but was delayed by technical problems and the Challenger accident. Discovery, which blasted into orbit Tuesday, is scheduled to land Sunday at Edwards Air Force Base, Calif. Seven years late, the Hubble Space Telescope is where it belongs, out of this world and in search of others so distant that they may have been formed at the beginning of time. Less than five hours after it rode into space aboard the shuttle Discovery on Tuesday, the $1.5 billion telescope sent its first test radio signal. At the sign of life, applause and cheers erupted in Mission Control in Houston. As near as we can tell, everything looks perfect, said astronaut Steve Hawley from the shuttle. Hawley's job on Wednesday will be to drop the telescope overboard for a 15-year stay in space. Discovery, trailing an arc of white smoke into a brilliant blue sky, carried the silver-colored telescope to an orbit 380 miles above Earth  higher by 70 miles than any previous shuttle. There the Hubble will stay to search for yet-unseen wonders of creation with instruments that can look 14 billion years backward in time. Our window on the universe! NASA launch commentator George Diller exulted as the Discovery rose off its seaside launch pad. It's a beautiful day to have Hubble Space Telescope in orbit instead of here on Earth like it's been for so many years, said NASA administrator Richard Truly. Hubble's in its element and I'm delighted. The telescope was supposed to be launched in 1983, but technical problems and the Challenger accident delayed its deployment. It suffered a further delay two weeks ago when the countdown was stopped at the four-minutes-to-go point because of a faulty hydraulic unit on the shuttle. While it remained on Earth, the telescope cost $7 million a month to exercise and keep in readiness. In its first day in space, that checkout and testing continued remotely under control of the Goddard Space Flight Center in Maryland. On hand to watch the Discovery launching was a contingent of scientists who have hailed the Hubble as the greatest advance in astronomy since Galileo raised a small telescope to his eyes nearly 400 years ago. Truly referred to the early-day astronomer when he was asked about the long delays in getting the telescope to its working station. Somebody the other day said, `Who remembers the day that Galileo picked up his telescope to look at the stars?' said Truly, a former shuttle astronaut. It doesn't matter what day we launch Hubble, it matters that we do it right. The telescope is 43 feet long and 14 feet in diameter, about the size of a railroad tank car. When it flies free, it will receive electrical power for its six scientific instruments from two wing-like solar arrays that extend outward on each side. It is named after the late astronomer Edwin P. Hubble, who theorized that the universe was expanding and that the farther away a galaxy is, the faster it is traveling. That gave support to the theory that a massive explosion  the Big Bang  created the universe 10 to 20 billion years ago. The Hubble is expected to help provide the answer to two major questions: How old is the universe? How big is it? The telescope has two mirrors, one 94.5 inches in diameter, the other 12 inches. Two of the instruments are cameras, two are spectrometers and one is a photometer. In addition, the fine pointing system acts as a sixth instrument by providing precise measurement of distances. On Wednesday, Hawley is to grapple the 12{-ton telescope with the shuttle's mechanical arm, lift it out of the cargo bay, point it, and  after a long checkout  drop it overboard to orbit on its own. In the cargo bay, the telescope receives electrical power from the shuttle. But the juice is cut when the instrument is lifted out and it will depend on internal batteries until the solar panels are extended to receive light from the sun. Should the solar panels not deploy, mission specialists Bruce McCandless and Kathryn Sullivan will be standing by, partially dressed in space suits, ready to go into the open cargo bay to unfurl the arrays manually. Discovery's launch was not without its problems. With 31 seconds left in the countdown, the computer that runs the final moments before liftoff refused to close a fuel valve and stopped the launch process. The problem was overcome and the shuttle lifted off at 8:34 a.m. EDT, about three minutes late. The shuttle is scheduled to land Sunday at 9:49 a.m. EDT at Edwards Air Force Base in California. On the way uphill, as Commander Loren J. Shriver put it, the shuttle's windshield was splattered with several flecks of things. He said the windshield was streaked by the debris and that it also was smeared when the spent booster rockets fell off during the climb to orbit. The astronauts also had problems with their UHF radio circuit, and one of the ship's small rear thrusters was inoperative. Neither problem was considered serious. The shuttle that put the Hubble Space Telescope into orbit also carries an instrument used in the 1920s by astronomer Edwin Hubble: the eyepiece from what once was the world's most powerful telescope. It's a great pleasure to have something of such historical significance and something that so directly symbolizes Edwin Hubble's fundamental contributions to astronomy, astronaut Kathy Sullivan said Friday as she circled the Earth in space shuttle Discovery. The eyepiece from the Mount Wilson Observatory's 100-inch Hooker Telescope was carried into orbit by Sullivan. After she brings the eyepiece back to Earth, it will be placed on display at the observatory. It's basically a symbolic gesture from the past of astronomy to the future of astronomy, said Lyn McAfee, spokeswoman for the Mount Wilson Institute. The Pasadena-based group runs the observatory, located in the San Gabriel Mountains outside Los Angeles. The discoveries made by Hubble on the 100-inch telescope at Mount Wilson gave us a giant leap forward in our understanding of the universe, McAfee said. We believe the Hubble Space Telescope will do the same thing. The Hooker Telescope was the world's most powerful telescope from its construction in 1918 until 1948, when the 200-inch Hale Telescope was placed in operation at Mount Palomar Observatory northeast of San Diego. Using the Hooker Telescope, Hubble was the first to determine the distance to a galaxy outside the Milky Way, the institute said in a statement. This crucial discovery provided the first definite proof that other galaxies existed far beyond the confines of our own local galaxy, the institute said. During the 1920s and 1930s, Hubble and an assistant used the Hooker telescope to take thousands of photographs of faint galaxies, showing that most of them were moving away from each other very quickly. This provided observational evidence for the concept, suggested by Einstein's Theory of Relativity, that the universe is expanding, the institute said. Hubble's work helped convince scientists the universe was created in a giant explosion, called the big bang, an estimated 15 billion years ago. The Hooker Telescope was mothballed in 1985 by the Carnegie Institution, former operator of the observatory, in a money-saving move. The institute hopes to obtain funds to reopen it.\""],"metadata":{"id":"hN1Yb_qSbhuJ"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["pretext=\"Five astronauts boarded Discovery today second try sending Hubble Space Telescope orbit scan outermost reaches universe clues beginning time.

The astronauts, wearing bright orange flight suits, climbed crew cabin dawn breaking Kennedy Space Center. The $1.5 billion telescope, NASA's costliest cargo, give astronomers new set eyes ears have, said William Lenoir, head NASA's space flight program. It's going change perspective altogether. I can't say we're going learn, I'll astounded learn many new things. Discovery aiming altitude 380 miles, highest shuttle ever gone, telescope placed proper orbit far Earth's distorting atmosphere. It 35th shuttle mission. Columbia, journeys space next month Astro observatory, sat launch pad 1.6 miles Discovery, second time pads occupied; first 1986 Challenger explosion. Hubble waiting take place space since 1983, delayed technical problems Challenger accident. The latest postponement occurred April 10, Discovery's launch scrubbed four minutes liftoff faulty power unit shuttle. The mood Kennedy Space Center considerably less festive first launch attempt, hundreds astronomers gathered families. The day launch, mission specialist Steven A. Hawley use shuttle's mechanical arm lift 24,250-pound telescope space. Veteran spacewalkers Bruce McCandless II Kathryn Sullivan assist problem develops. Discovery follow Hubble 40 miles away two days lens cap opened, exposing finely polished 94.5-inch mirror starlight. Hubble expected start providing scientific data satellite month liftoff. However, NASA said release first image  open star cluster constellation Carina  week launch. In addition $1.5 billion cost Hubble, $500 million spent spare parts, astronaut training computer software operate instrument. The European Space Agency contributed $250 million 15 percent viewing time. NASA estimates cost $200 million year operate maintain telescope space. During 15-year working lifetime, telescope provide astronomers 10 times better resolution 25 times sensitivity ground-based observatories. As result, able study stars galaxies distant light traveling toward Earth 14 billion years. Astronomers hope learn whether universe created 15 billion years ago believed uncover mystery surrounding galaxies, black holes quasars. Hubble also expected shed light universe might end. The telescope named late astronomer Edwin P. Hubble, discovered 1920s universe expanding. His work gave rise Big Bang theory universe created tremendous explosion. In addition Hubble, Discovery carries human skull filled sensors measure space radiation astronauts receive. It skull's third trip space. The shuttle end five-day mission landing Edwards Air Force Base, Calif. Discovery's five astronauts returned Sunday second attempt launch shuttle NASA's valuable celebrated payload, $1.5 billion Hubble Space Telescope. Discovery scheduled lift 8:31 a.m. EDT Tuesday. We feel confident things going go well time, said Discovery's commander, Air Force Col. Loren J. Shriver. We're going come OK Tuesday morning and, not, we'll keep trying do. That's kind name game here, Shriver said. NASA test director Mike Leinbach said Sunday countdown proceeding smoothly shuttle appeared perfect condition. The countdown got way Saturday afternoon. A faulty power unit forced first launch attempt scrubbed four minutes liftoff April 10. The unit replaced new one, tests showed fine. Hopefully, we'll get shuttle pad time, Leinbach said. A 70 percent chance favorable weather expected launch time, low clouds main concern, said Air Force's Ed Priselac, shuttle weather officer. A weak cold front north expected pass area Monday night. The outlook considerably better Wednesday Thursday, Priselac said. As Discovery's astronauts arrived Johnson Space Center Houston early Sunday afternoon, shuttle Columbia transported launch pad 1.6 miles Discovery. It second time shuttle launch pads Kennedy Space Center occupied simultaneously. The first time January 1986; 16 days Columbia lifted off, Challenger exploded. Columbia commander Vance Brand said believe National Aeronautics Space Administration moving fast shuttle. NASA expects launch Columbia astronomical observatory called Astro earlier May 16, one week later planned Discovery's two-week delay. In cases, could problem shuttles launch pads, Brand said. In particular case, everything's fitting together. NASA Saturday get Discovery ground. After that, launch attempts must halted eight days Hubble's batteries recharged. The six nickel-hydrogen batteries power Hubble time disconnected Discovery's electrical system two energy-collecting solar panels take space. Discovery's payload bay sealed late Saturday night, drastically reducing risk contamination telescope's finely polished 94.5-inch mirror. Discovery aim altitude 380 miles, highest shuttle ever gone, telescope placed proper orbit far Earth's distorting atmosphere. During Hubble's 15-year journey space, astronomers expect look back nearly beginning time solve universe's perplexing mysteries. Astro measure ultraviolet radiation undetected Hubble thus provide additional targets telescope. The $100 million observatory also focus Columbia's nine-day mission Comet Austin, believed first trip solar system. Both Hubble Astro scheduled launch 1986, delayed Challenger accident. The Hubble Space Telescope awakened self-induced sleep today still without use high-speed antennas, science instruments hold, unable begin observations. We `safe-mode' right now, said Steve Terry, supervisor engineers controlling telescope. He said telescope running normal control-all mode, computers sensors guide pointing. Discovery's astronauts, meanwhile, packed gear return Earth Sunday, made last-minute observations Earth talked ground-based reporters flight. Pilot Charles Bolden said especially upbeat widespread public awareness telescope, expected eventually look back 14 billion light years  nearly birth universe. It's hard go somewhere find someone never heard Hubble Space Telescope, said Bolden. It makes little kids' eyes light up. It makes little kids want learn add subtract study science. The telescope's big eye remained open, Hubble safe mode motion stopped earlier problems linking high-speed dish antennas relay satellite. The antennas primary links relaying scientific data ground. Terry said even safe mode, one tape recorders telescope reads telemetry signals systems would played Earth analyzed antennas working properly. We expect use data investigate happened, said. Engineers able send commands telescope via secondary antennas communications system useful scientific data, must transmitted high rate speed. We're putting scientific instruments hold mode, effect standby mode, said. Shortly 6 a.m. EDT, controllers Goddard Space Flight Center Greenbelt, Md., completed series commands took telescope safe mode began run 12-hour computer program monitor Hubble's health. It take another day $1.5 billion telescope operating way supposed point startup process, said Hubble deputy project manager Jean Olivier. We're backing deliberate slow careful approach problems, Olivier said Friday. This time anything dumb. The telescope problems put flight center several days behind, five astronauts deployed earlier week sticking schedule. Landing scheduled 9:48 a.m. EDT Sunday Edwards Air Force Base, Calif., flight controllers keeping close watch weather. Winds predicted 20 mph gusts 29 mph. Mission rules dictate headwinds cannot exceed 29 mph touchdown. The shuttle carries enough supplies stay orbit three days beyond Sunday necessary, NASA said. Mission Control awakened crew members 1:30 a.m. EDT today playing song, Cosmos. Thanks wake-up music, pretty appropriate today, said Commander Loren Shriver. The song selected honor Hubble Space Telescope, open business, said Mission Control commentator James Hartsfield. The astronauts finish experiments photography today pack trip home. They also planned hold news conference space reporters Johnson Space Center. Shriver pilot Charles Bolden run series tests make certain shuttle's computers control jets ready return Earth. The crew deployed Hubble Wednesday stayed close telescope case trouble opening aperture door. Mission specialists Bruce McCandless Kathryn Sullivan prepared perform space walk today crank open orbit 380 miles Earth. But proved unnecessary door opened Friday morning, exposing telescope's finely polished 94.5-inch eye starlight first time. Two Hubble's four position-stabilizing gyroscopes stopped working door opened, engineers later got back line. The gyroscopes knocked motion that, too, kept telescope safe mode, said Dave Drachlis, director orbital verifications Goddard. A colleague, Steve Terry, said Hubble's systems set conservative limits first operations caused many malfunctions. There also two communications outages totaling several hours. Hubble designed safe modes master destiny case contact orbiting communications system lost extended periods, Terry said. NASA planned release first test image telescope Tuesday, showing open star cluster constellation Carina. But Terry said would delayed antenna problems. Scientific data follow month two. The telescope, named late astronomer Edwin P. Hubble, enable astronomers 15-year working lifetime look back 14 billion years possibly determine age universe. The universe believed created 15 billion years ago cosmic explosion. Hubble provided basis big-bang theory creation. He discovered 1920s universe expanding farther galaxy Earth, faster moving away. After years delay last-minute snag, Hubble Space Telescope freed shuttle Discovery Wednesday and, glinting sunlight, drifted orbit 15-year search new worlds. Mission specialist Steven Hawley released Hubble end shuttle's 50-foot-long mechanical arm delay getting one telescope's solar wings unfurled. The first NASA's great observatories station 330 nautical miles Earth, Mission Control's Jeffrey Carr said. The telescope really looked great flew away it, sure hope good work, Discovery commander Loren J. Shriver said later. The $1.5 billion telescope released 3:38 p.m. EDT shuttle entered 20th orbit Earth, nearly two hours one orbit later planned. The shuttle backed away. Thank much ride, said Mike Harrington, director orbital verifications Goddard Space Flight Center Greenbelt, Md. Mission specialists Bruce McCandless Kathryn Sullivan shuttle's airlock, ready walk inspace free solar panel. That proved unnecessary. Close cigar, better Hubble went way did, Sullivan said. She McCandless trained nearly five years make rescue mission. The first solar array unreeled mast midday Wednesday shuttle passed 380 statute miles, 330 nautical miles, South America's eastern coast. It started providing power telescope's batteries, otherwise eight hours charge. Deployment starboard panel, however, troublesome. It budge latches first released, moved fifth 39-foot length, stopped again. A third attempt rolled panel way. Houston, see motion, Commander Loren J. Shriver reported. Hawley began long process releasing Hubble shortly 7 a.m. EDT grasped Discovery's 50-foot-long mechanical arm carefully hoisted 12{-ton telescope high shuttle. Hubble taken shuttle electrical power lifted cargo bay operating nickel-hydrogen batteries. At one day, seven minutes flight Discovery, Hubble internal power, Carr said. The game begun. The race on. The clock ticking. Worries telescope's instruments would starved electricity eased first solar panel stretched out. Television cameras aboard Discovery showed first array pulled reel slowly steadily, sun reflecting gold-colored panel silvery telescope. Discovery 380 statute miles Earth, 70 miles higher shuttle ever flown. The orbit dictated need put telescope Earth's distorting atmosphere. Discovery's five astronauts awed view. I'd like pass quote day on-board astronomer something effect big marble sure looks far away today, Shriver said Hawley. Astronomers waited seven years Hubble take place space. The telescope originally scheduled launch 1983, technical problems Challenger explosion pushed back. The mission delayed another two weeks faulty power unit Discovery forced National Aeronautics Space Administration halt first launch attempt four minutes April 10's scheduled liftoff. On Tuesday, Discovery finally blasted space, transporting Hubble world search others. The telescope's 10-foot aperture door opened Friday, exposing finely polished 94.5-inch mirror starlight. Discovery following Hubble case door open properly. If problem develops, McCandless Sullivan prepared walk space. Fred Wojtalik, Hubble project manager, said telescope would tested Thursday ability maneuever aperture door opened. We want full control ever endanger Hubble putting aperture door close sunlight, said. The telescope cannot focus sun sensitivity five instruments. If goes well, crew land Sunday Edwards Air Force Base, Calif. NASA expects release first image telescope  open star cluster constellation Carina  Tuesday. Data follow month two. Astronomers hope look back almost beginning time, studying stars galaxies distant light traveling Earth 14 billion years. They expect determine precisely universe formed, currently estimated 15 billion years ago. The telescope named late American astronomer Edwin P. Hubble, discovered 1920s universe expanding. He also responsible helping form Big Bang theory creation. Ground controllers Goddard Space Flight Center finally made contact today two main antennas $1.5 billion Hubble Space Telescope trying six hours lock on. Applause erupted Hubble control center Greenbelt, Md., glitch marred Hubble's first full day space solved. We confirmation achieved communication Tracking Data Relay Satellite high-gain antenna system, said NASA's Dave Drachlis. Engineers said along believed antennas working right problem incorrectly pointing either satellite TDRS, orbiting communications satellite acts switchboard. In successful attempt, nearly doubled width antennas' beams take territory, sweep 6.2 degrees 10.8 degrees. The telescope's low-gain antennas, receive transmit information much slower rate used emergencies, working well. Space shuttle Discovery 46 miles away, available remedy certain problems. The outage problem space walkers would summoned. The five astronauts otherwise busy making pictures storms Texas 380-mile-high perch, experiments. Steve Terry, director team calibrating various aspects telescope, said first outage caused human error serious problem. It began 1 1:30 a.m. EDT lasted 45 minutes hour, said. The second failure occurred 6:44 a.m. controllers attempted send signal telescope's two high-gain antennas TDRS. This time pointing problem, said Jim Elliott, Goddard spokesman. It's new spacecraft think inexperience dealing cause. The telescope, embarking 15-year search new worlds, released shuttle's cargo bay Wednesday last-minute snag almost sent two astronauts emergency spacewalk. Mission Control awakened crew early today loud rendition song Shout, fraternity house favorite. Good morning, Discovery. I guess awake song, said Kathy Thornton, shuttle communicator. There lot happy people here. We saw great deploy yesterday Hubble good night asleep. We appreciate good words everybody, replied Discovery Commander Loren Shriver. After Wednesday's deployment, Shriver gently backed Discovery away telescope put shuttle series maneuvers, last one completed morning, park Discovery orbit 46 miles behind Hubble. The telescope really looked great flew away it, sure hope good work, Shriver said Wednesday. Well, sure now, Loren, thanks great work done, replied Mission Control. Galileo real proud you. Scientists hailed Hubble  NASA's expensive unmanned spacecraft  greatest advance astronomy since Galileo raised small telescope eyes nearly 400 years ago. Discovery five astronauts follow telescope controllers Goddard center make sure Hubble operating properly, responding directional commands. The next milestone Friday, telescope's 10-foot aperture door opened, exposing finely polished 94.5-inch mirror starlight. Then Tuesday, NASA expects release first image telescope: open star cluster constellation Carina. Data follow month two. If aperture door open properly, Discovery could return telescope two astronauts could perform spacewalk fix it. Hubble project manager Fred Wojtalik said telescope would tested today ability maneuver aperture door opened. We want full control ever endanger Hubble putting aperture door close sunlight, said. Too much light could damage telescope's sensitive instruments. On Wednesday, mission specialist Steve Hawley used shuttle's 50-foot robot arm gently grasp 12{-ton telescope hoist cargo bay. One telescope's solar arrays unreeled mast expected started providing power telescope's batteries, otherwise eight hours charge. But trouble second panel. It budge latches released, moved fifth 39-foot length stopped again. The panel rolled way third attempt. By final attempt, astronauts Bruce McCandless Kathryn Sullivan space suits airlock, 30 minutes away taking tools hand going outer-space maintenance call. Wojtalik said cause problem unknown. The 8{-hour procedure performed 380 miles Earth, 70 miles higher shuttle ever flown. The orbit dictated need put Hubble Earth's distorting atmosphere. Astronomers hope use telescope look back almost beginning time, studying stars galaxies distant light taken 14 billions years reach Earth. They hope determine universe formed, currently estimated 15 billion years ago. The telescope originally scheduled launch 1983 delayed technical problems Challenger accident. Discovery, blasted orbit Tuesday, scheduled land Sunday Edwards Air Force Base, Calif. Seven years late, Hubble Space Telescope belongs, world search others distant may formed beginning time. Less five hours rode space aboard shuttle Discovery Tuesday, $1.5 billion telescope sent first test radio signal. At sign life, applause cheers erupted Mission Control Houston. As near tell, everything looks perfect, said astronaut Steve Hawley shuttle. Hawley's job Wednesday drop telescope overboard 15-year stay space. Discovery, trailing arc white smoke brilliant blue sky, carried silver-colored telescope orbit 380 miles Earth  higher 70 miles previous shuttle. There Hubble stay search yet-unseen wonders creation instruments look 14 billion years backward time. Our window universe! NASA launch commentator George Diller exulted Discovery rose seaside launch pad. It's beautiful day Hubble Space Telescope orbit instead Earth like many years, said NASA administrator Richard Truly. Hubble's element I'm delighted. The telescope supposed launched 1983, technical problems Challenger accident delayed deployment. It suffered delay two weeks ago countdown stopped four-minutes-to-go point faulty hydraulic unit shuttle. While remained Earth, telescope cost $7 million month exercise keep readiness. In first day space, checkout testing continued remotely control Goddard Space Flight Center Maryland. On hand watch Discovery launching contingent scientists hailed Hubble greatest advance astronomy since Galileo raised small telescope eyes nearly 400 years ago. Truly referred early-day astronomer asked long delays getting telescope working station. Somebody day said, `Who remembers day Galileo picked telescope look stars?' said Truly, former shuttle astronaut. It matter day launch Hubble, matters right. The telescope 43 feet long 14 feet diameter, size railroad tank car. When flies free, receive electrical power six scientific instruments two wing-like solar arrays extend outward side. It named late astronomer Edwin P. Hubble, theorized universe expanding farther away galaxy is, faster traveling. That gave support theory massive explosion  Big Bang  created universe 10 20 billion years ago. The Hubble expected help provide answer two major questions: How old universe? How big it? The telescope two mirrors, one 94.5 inches diameter, 12 inches. Two instruments cameras, two spectrometers one photometer. In addition, fine pointing system acts sixth instrument providing precise measurement distances. On Wednesday, Hawley grapple 12{-ton telescope shuttle's mechanical arm, lift cargo bay, point it,  long checkout  drop overboard orbit own. In cargo bay, telescope receives electrical power shuttle. But juice cut instrument lifted depend internal batteries solar panels extended receive light sun. Should solar panels deploy, mission specialists Bruce McCandless Kathryn Sullivan standing by, partially dressed space suits, ready go open cargo bay unfurl arrays manually. Discovery's launch without problems. With 31 seconds left countdown, computer runs final moments liftoff refused close fuel valve stopped launch process. The problem overcome shuttle lifted 8:34 a.m. EDT, three minutes late. The shuttle scheduled land Sunday 9:49 a.m. EDT Edwards Air Force Base California. On way uphill, Commander Loren J. Shriver put it, shuttle's windshield splattered several flecks things. He said windshield streaked debris also smeared spent booster rockets fell climb orbit. The astronauts also problems UHF radio circuit, one ship's small rear thrusters inoperative. Neither problem considered serious. The shuttle put Hubble Space Telescope orbit also carries instrument used 1920s astronomer Edwin Hubble: eyepiece world's powerful telescope. It's great pleasure something historical significance something directly symbolizes Edwin Hubble's fundamental contributions astronomy, astronaut Kathy Sullivan said Friday circled Earth space shuttle Discovery. The eyepiece Mount Wilson Observatory's 100-inch Hooker Telescope carried orbit Sullivan. After brings eyepiece back Earth, placed display observatory. It's basically symbolic gesture past astronomy future astronomy, said Lyn McAfee, spokeswoman Mount Wilson Institute. The Pasadena-based group runs observatory, located San Gabriel Mountains outside Los Angeles. The discoveries made Hubble 100-inch telescope Mount Wilson gave us giant leap forward understanding universe, McAfee said. We believe Hubble Space Telescope thing. The Hooker Telescope world's powerful telescope construction 1918 1948, 200-inch Hale Telescope placed operation Mount Palomar Observatory northeast San Diego. Using Hooker Telescope, Hubble first determine distance galaxy outside Milky Way, institute said statement. This crucial discovery provided first definite proof galaxies existed far beyond confines local galaxy, institute said. During 1920s 1930s, Hubble assistant used Hooker telescope take thousands photographs faint galaxies, showing moving away quickly. This provided observational evidence concept, suggested Einstein's Theory Relativity, universe expanding, institute said. Hubble's work helped convince scientists universe created giant explosion, called big bang, estimated 15 billion years ago. The Hooker Telescope mothballed 1985 Carnegie Institution, former operator observatory, money-saving move. The institute hopes obtain funds reopen it.\""],"metadata":{"id":"7K7wUZw1QCmB"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["print(\"\\n\\nSummary:\\n\\n\")\n","print(summarize(text,pretext,num_sentences=6))"],"metadata":{"id":"h-EAz_OSbx_d","colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"outputId":"e7bfd2ee-0fd9-458c-c861-7b69aa7f4ae8","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1680069531008,"user_tz":-330,"elapsed":202079,"user":{"displayName":"Text Summarizer","userId":"10666500115416824286"}}},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["\n","\n","Summary:\n","\n","\n","We're going to come out OK on Tuesday morning and, if not, we'll just keep trying until we do.
