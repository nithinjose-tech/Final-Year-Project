1,"Cambodia's two-party opposition asked the Asian Development Bank Monday to stop providing loan to the incumbent government, which it call illegal. Negotiations to form the next government have become deadlocked, and opposition party leader Prince Norodom Ranariddh and Sam Rainsy are out of the country following threat of arrest from strongman Hun Sen. Hun Sen complained Monday that the opposition wa trying to make it members' return an international issue. Hun Sen's ruling party narrowly won a majority in election in July, but the opposition claiming widespread intimidation and fraud ha denied Hun Sen the two-thirds vote in parliament required to approve the next government. Meanwhile, it say, the old government is holding power illegally. Ranariddh and Sam Rainsy renewed their international lobbying campaign against the old government Monday in a letter to ADB President Mitsuo Sato calling for the bank to stop lending money to it. We respectfully advise the Asian Development Bank not to provide any new loan to the current regime in Cambodia, the two party leader wrote. At best the current regime could be considered a caretaker government a it ha not been approved by the National Assembly. After a meeting between Hun Sen and the new French ambassador to Cambodia, Hun Sen aide Prak Sokhonn said the Cambodian leader had repeated call for the opposition to return, but expressed concern that the international community may be asked for security guarantee. There have been report that there is an attempt to internationalize the return of those member of parliament on the excuse of security problem, Prak Sokhonn said. Some (opposition politician) have wanted the United Nations to help guarantee a safe return for them. The UN. secretary-general's representative office in Phnom Penh provided monitor to opposition politician after they returned to Cambodia to participate in the July election. The monitoring ended Sept. 30. Our office ha not received any official request for that operation to be started up again, UN. diplomat Jonathan Prentice said Monday in reaction to Prak Sokhonn's statement. The opposition ha insisted that any further talk on the next government must take place outside the country, but the ruling party ha rejected allegation of intimidation and recently guaranteed opposition members' safety inside the country. Diplomatic effort to revive the stalled talk appeared to bear fruit Monday a Japanese Foreign Affairs Secretary of State Nobutaka Machimura said King Norodom Sihanouk ha called on Ranariddh and Sam Rainsy to return to Cambodia. Less than two week after abandoning hope that he could influence the party to reach a compromise, Sihanouk is now strongly interested in presiding over a summit meeting of the three party leader in Cambodia, Machimura said. Cambodian politician expressed hope Monday that a new partnership between the party of strongman Hun Sen and his rival, Prince Norodom Ranariddh, in a coalition government would not end in more violence. Hun Sen and Ranariddh, co-prime minister in a coalition formed in 1993 after a landmark U.N.-sponsored election, often clashed over power-sharing and the integration of guerrilla fighter from the crumbling Khmer Rouge. Their argument turned bloody last year when Hun Sen ousted Ranariddh in a coup. The prince fled Cambodia and did not return until a few month before election in July. Hun Sen's Cambodian People's Party narrowly won the poll, but a strong second-place finish by Ranariddh's FUNCINPEC gave the royalist party leverage in post-election negotiation. After a three-month impasse, they agreed last week to a coalition deal that will make Hun Sen sole prime minister and Ranariddh president of the National Assembly. This will not be a repetition of 1993 because there will not be two prime minister, said Hun Sen aide Prak Sokhon, who attended last week's summit. When we had two prime minister, everything moved very slowly and decision were made more politically than technically. Ranariddh said Saturday that the two party agreed to keep the ministry of interior and defense under co-ministers. Senior FUNCINPEC official Ahmad Yahya revealed Monday that it wa also agreed that the CPP would control the foreign affair and finance portfolio. FUNCINPEC will take justice and information. The party are to form working group this week to divide remaining government post and draft a constitutional amendment to form a new Senate. Hun Sen and Ranariddh are scheduled to meet Nov. 23 two day before parliament reopens to review the result of the working group and give their final approval, Ahmad Yahya said. Their ability to repair their relationship and work together will be the key to a stable coalition. I consider this a remarriage, Ahmad Yahya said. They have to be careful with the way they work and what they say. They will have to compromise to achieve result. Ranariddh's ally, Sam Rainsy, whose party placed a distant third in the election, wa left out of last week's deal. Sam Rainsy, a virulent critic of Hun Sen, and his party's 14 other member of parliament have remained outside Cambodia since September amid fear for their security. In a letter to King Norodom Sihanouk released Monday, Sam Rainsy complained that Hun Sen had not responded to his query on security, making it unsafe for his people to return for the reconvening of parliament. Sam Rainsy said he had been told by Ranariddh that his party and former Khmer Rouge guerrilla had been implicated by Hun Sen in a rocket attack on the Sept. 24 opening of parliament. Authorities have called it an assassination attempt on Hun Sen. A police general investigating the attack said Monday that likely suspect have been identified, but he would not reveal name or their political affiliation. Cambodia's ruling party responded Tuesday to criticism of it leader in the US. Congress with a lengthy defense of strongman Hun Sen's human right record. The Cambodian People's Party criticized a non-binding resolution passed earlier this month by the US. House of Representatives calling for an investigation into violation of international humanitarian law allegedly committed by Hun Sen. Events mentioned in the resolution include Hun Sen's coup last year against his co-prime minister, Prince Norodom Ranariddh, and his violent crackdown in September against anti-government demonstration. A copy of the resolution ha since been submitted to the US. Senate Committee on Foreign Relations. The CPP would like to launch an appeal to US. senator to wisely and realistically consider this draft resolution and give justice to the CPP, Hun Sen and the Cambodian people by not approving it, the party said in a statement. It defended Hun Sen's ouster of Ranariddh a a proper response to the prince's attempt at the time to negotiate the defection of senior Khmer Rouge rebel. It also repeated claim that the prince's party had moved rebel soldier into Phnom Penh, a contention that remains unproved. The killing of nearly 100 of Ranariddh's supporter documented by UN. human right worker in the aftermath of the coup were dismissed by the CPP a mostly fabrication meant to distort the political situation. Ranariddh and his core supporter did not return to Cambodia until a few month before an election in July this year that the ruling party narrowly won. Ranariddh and his opposition ally, Sam Rainsy, refused to accept the election result, alleging widespread intimidation and fraud by the CPP. When their claim were dismissed by a Hun Sen-friendly court, they rallied their supporter into the street of Phnom Penh. After two week of tolerating the demonstration, Hun Sen ordered a violent crackdown that resulted in the death of at least four protester. UN. human right worker later discovered more than 20 body many bearing sign of torture in and around the capital, prompting speculation that the death toll could be much higher. The ruling party supported the police action in it statement, noting that public property wa damaged by protester and that grenade were thrown at Hun Sen's home after Sam Rainsy suggested in a speech that the US. government should fire cruise missile at Hun Sen. The opposition claim the grenade attack wa staged a an excuse to begin the crackdown. The leader of illegal demonstration are the one who must bear responsibility for the consequence deriving from the protest, the CPP said Tuesday, referring to the deadly violence a minor incident. The ruling party also reminded the United States that Washington supported a Cambodian exile government dominated by the brutal Khmer Rouge in the 1980s. The Khmer Rouge wa responsible for the death of a many a 2 million people during the guerrilla group's 1975-79 rule of Cambodia. After a series of border clash, the Khmer Rouge wa ousted from power by an invading Vietnamese army that set up a surrogate Cambodian communist government later led by Hun Sen. The ruling party accused US. policy-makers of not taking timely action to save the Cambodian people from the Khmer Rouge. They must not make unjust accusation against those who led the struggle to liberate the people from genocide, it added. Cambodia's bickering political party broke a three-month deadlock Friday and agreed to a coalition government leaving strongman Hun Sen a sole prime minister, King Norodom Sihanouk announced. In a long-elusive compromise, opposition leader Prince Norodom Ranariddh will become president of the National Assembly resulting from disputed election in July, even though Hun Sen's party hold a majority of 64 seat in the 122-member chamber. Hun Sen's Cambodian People's Party dropped insistence on a joint assembly chairmanship shared by Ranariddh and party bos Chea Sim, the current speaker. It wa one of the main stumbling block in month of discord. Instead, Sihanouk announced, the constitution will be modified to create a new Senate, which Chea Sim will head. Chea Sim will still serve a acting head of state during the king's frequent absence from the country. The major political crisis in the country ha been resolved and the political deadlock facing the nation ha also come to an end, the king said in his statement. The Senate will initially be appointed by the king. The agreement did not say how many seat there would be, nor how they would be divided. The party will hammer out detail later. Pok Than, one of Ranariddh's negotiator, said the Senate would serve a mostly advisory role to the assembly. The senior Senate leader will join those of the assembly, the prime minister and the country's top two Buddhist monk in a delicate balance of power on the council that will choose Cambodia's next king after Sihanouk dy. The two party said that the assembly would convene again Nov. 25. The agreement came surprisingly quickly following Ranariddh's return Thursday from Thailand, where he had been holed up with other opposition figure for week amid fear for their safety if they stayed in Cambodia. The deal should allow rapid formation of a government between the CPP and Ranariddh's royalist FUNCINPEC to allow international donor and business to again operate in the poverty-stricken country, which is in desperate need of aid. It could also hasten Cambodia's entry into the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, put on hold last year after Hun Sen deposed Ranariddh a co-prime minister in a bloody coup. Earlier, a both side arrived at the Royal Palace for a second day of meeting, Sihanouk said they had agreed in principle to form a coalition and made important concession. The king, the sole force in Cambodian politics able to broker a deal, pressured both side to reach agreement before he leaf Saturday for medical treatment in Beijing. Sihanouk reported that Hun Sen responded positively to a request by Ranariddh for five of his key supporter to receive political pardon. All five were convicted of political crime by court that are widely seen a loyal to Hun Sen. The king ha power to grant pardon, but ha awaited agreement from Hun Sen in politically sensitive case. Former battlefield enemy, the CPP and FUNCINPEC have been at loggerhead since the CPP narrowly won parliamentary election in July. The vote failed to put an end to instability that followed last year's coup. The CPP fell short of the two-thirds majority needed to form a government alone. Ranariddh's party and opposition ally Sam Rainsy held back their support, claiming the CPP won due to fraud and intimidation. The opposition organized protest in Phnom Penh seeking Hun Sen's ouster that were violently dispersed. Sam Rainsy, under investigation by a Phnom Penh court for his role in the demonstration, ha remained abroad. His 15 seat in the 122-seat assembly are irrelevant to forming a working government. Cambodian leader Hun Sen on Friday rejected opposition parties' demand for talk outside the country, accusing them of trying to internationalize the political crisis. Government and opposition party have asked King Norodom Sihanouk to host a summit meeting after a series of post-election negotiation between the two opposition group and Hun Sen's party to form a new government failed. Opposition leader Prince Norodom Ranariddh and Sam Rainsy, citing Hun Sen's threat to arrest opposition figure after two alleged attempt on his life, said they could not negotiate freely in Cambodia and called for talk at Sihanouk's residence in Beijing. Hun Sen, however, rejected that. I would like to make it clear that all meeting related to Cambodian affair must be conducted in the Kingdom of Cambodia, Hun Sen told reporter after a Cabinet meeting on Friday. No-one should internationalize Cambodian affair. It is detrimental to the sovereignty of Cambodia, he said. Hun Sen's Cambodian People's Party won 64 of the 122 parliamentary seat in July's election, short of the two-thirds majority needed to form a government on it own. Ranariddh and Sam Rainsy have charged that Hun Sen's victory in the election wa achieved through widespread fraud. They have demanded a thorough investigation into their election complaint a a precondition for their cooperation in getting the national assembly moving and a new government formed. Hun Sen said on Friday that the opposition concern over their safety in the country wa just an excuse for them to stay abroad. Both Ranariddh and Sam Rainsy have been outside the country since parliament wa ceremonially opened on Sep. 24. Sam Rainsy and a number of opposition figure have been under court investigation for a grenade attack on Hun Sen's Phnom Penh residence on Sep. 7. Hun Sen wa not home at the time of the attack, which wa followed by a police crackdown on demonstrator contesting Hun Sen's election victory. The Sam Rainsy Party, in a statement released Friday, accused Hun Sen of being unwilling to make any compromise on negotiation to break the deadlock. A meeting outside Cambodia, a suggested by the opposition, could place all party on more equal footing, said the statement. But the ruling party refuse to negotiate unless it is able to threaten it negotiating partner with arrest or worse. Worried that party colleague still face arrest for their politics, opposition leader Sam Rainsy sought further clarification Friday of security guarantee promised by strongman Hun Sen. Sam Rainsy wrote in a letter to King Norodom Sihanouk that he wa eager to attend the first session of the new National Assembly on Nov. 25, but complained that Hun Sen's assurance were not strong enough to ease concern his party member may be arrested upon their return to Cambodia. Hun Sen announced a government guarantee Wednesday of all politicians' safety and their right to conduct political activity in accordance with the law in force. Sam Rainsy, who earlier called Hun Sen's statement full of loophole, asked Sihanouk for his help in obtaining a promise from Hun Sen that all member of the Sam Rainsy Party were free from prosecution for their political activity during and after last July's election. Sam Rainsy, a staunch critic of Hun Sen, wa forced to take refuge in a UN. office in September to avoid arrest after Hun Sen accused him of being behind a plot against his life. The alleged assassination attempt came during massive street demonstration organized by the opposition after Hun Sen's Cambodian People's Party narrowly won the election. The opposition, alleging widespread fraud and intimidation, refused to accept the result of the poll. Fearing for their safety, Sam Rainsy and his then-ally Prince Norodom Ranariddh led an exodus of opposition lawmaker out of Cambodia after parliament wa ceremonially opened in late September. Ranariddh, whose FUNCINPEC party finished a close second in the election, returned last week and struck a deal with Hun Sen to form a coalition government. The agreement will make Hun Sen prime minister and Ranariddh president of the National Assembly. The two party have formed three working group to hammer out detail of the agreement, including the establishment of a Senate to be the upper house of parliament. Sok An, representing Hun Sen's party, said Friday that one working group had completed it work on a joint political platform to be implemented by the new government. The platform is said to emphasize administrative, economic and judicial reform, but Sok An would not reveal detail, saying Hun Sen would announce it when he present his Cabinet choice to the National Assembly. King Norodom Sihanouk on Tuesday praised agreement by Cambodia's top two political party previously bitter rival to form a coalition government led by strongman Hun Sen. In a short letter sent to news agency, the king said he had received copy of cooperation agreement signed Monday that will place Hun Sen and his Cambodian People's Party in firm control of fiscal and administrative function in the government. The protocol on cooperation between the CPP and FUNCINPEC will certainly bring peace and progress to our nation and people, Sihanouk wrote. Uncompromising enemy just a few month ago, Hun Sen and FUNCINPEC President Prince Norodom Ranariddh agreed Nov. 13 to form a government at a summit convened by Sihanouk. The deal, which will make Hun Sen prime minister and Ranariddh president of the National Assembly, ended more than three month of political deadlock that followed a July election narrowly won by Hun Sen. Key to the agreement wa the formation of a Senate a the upper house of Parliament, to be led by CPP President Chea Sim, the outgoing head of the National Assembly. Sihanouk, recalling procedure used in a past government, suggested Tuesday that he should appoint the first two member of the upper house. The remaining senator, he said, should be selected by a method agreed upon by the new government and the National Assembly. Hun Sen said Monday that the CPP and FUNCINPEC had agreed that the Senate would be half a large a the 122-seat National Assembly. Other detail of the Senate, including how much power it will be given in the promulgation of legislation, have yet to be ironed out by the two party. King Norodom Sihanouk ha declined request to chair a summit of Cambodia's top political leader, saying the meeting would not bring any progress in deadlocked negotiation to form a government. Cambodian leader Hun Sen's ruling party and the two-party opposition had called on the monarch to lead top-level talk, but disagreed on it location. Papa will not preside over any summit meeting between the three party, whether it is held in Phnom Penh or Beijing, because such a meeting will certainly achieve no result, Sihanouk wrote in an Oct. 17 letter to his son, Prince Norodom Ranariddh, leader of the senior opposition FUNCINPEC party. A copy of the letter wa obtained Thursday. In it, the king called on the three party to make compromise to end the stalemate: Papa would like to ask all three party to take responsibility before the nation and the people. Hun Sen used Thursday's anniversary of a peace agreement ending the country's civil war to pressure the opposition to form a coalition government with his party. Only those who want to prolong the anarchy and instability prevent effort to set up a new government, Hun Sen said in a televised speech marking the anniversary of the 1991 Paris Peace Accords. Hun Sen's party won 64 of the 122 seat in parliament in July's national election, but not the two-thirds majority necessary to form a government on it own. Opposition party led by Ranariddh and former finance minister Sam Ram Rainsy have refused to enter into a coalition with Hun Sen until their allegation of election fraud have been thoroughly investigated. International monitor said the election wa relatively free and fair. Hun Sen said his current government would remain in power a long a the opposition refused to form a new one. Ranariddh and Sam Rainsy have remained outside the country since the Sept. 24 ceremonial convening of parliament. Citing Hun Sen's threat to arrest opposition politician following two alleged attempt on his life, Ranariddh and Sam Rainsy have said they do not feel safe negotiating inside the country and asked the king to chair the summit at his residence in Beijing. Hun Sen ha rejected the opposition's reservation, saying it would be inappropriate to hold a summit outside the country. Negotiations so far have proved fruitless except for the opening of parliament after a Sept. 22 summit led by the king. Hun Sen implied Thursday that the opposition failed to follow through on promise made at the summit. If those result are strictly respected, there seems no reason to hold another summit, Hun Sen said in a speech on the anniversary of the 1991 Paris Peace Accords. Sihanouk is reportedly set to fly to Beijing next month to receive medical treatment from his Chinese doctor. The 75-year-old monarch suffers from a variety ailment and periodically make extended trip to Beijing. He wa diagnosed with colon cancer in 1993, but it ha since gone into remission. In September, thousand of people filled the street of Phnom Penh to protest against the alleged election fraud. Hun Sen ordered police to break up the demonstration. At least four demonstrator were killed by police, but the discovery of more than 20 body in the aftermath ha prompted speculation that the death tally could be much higher. In his speech, Hun Sen blamed the violence on opposition leader, saying the demonstration instigated social and economic chaos. Cambodia's leading opposition party ruled out sharing the presidency of Parliament with it arch foe Saturday, insisting it alone must occupy the top position in the legislative body. Disputes over the presidency have been a major stumbling block in talk between the two-party opposition bloc and the Cambodian People's Party to form a new government. Cambodian leader Hun Sen, who head the CPP, ha offered to share the legislature's top job with the royalist FUNCINPEC party of Prince Norodom Ranariddh in order to break the impasse. The prince's party, in a statement dated Friday and seen Saturday, said such a scenario wa unconstitutional. Co-sharing anything with the CPP mean surrendering full power to them. Furthermore, such a proposal is unconstitutional, the faxed statement said. The royalist party also rejected Hun Sen's call to hold bilateral talk, insisting that Ranariddh's main ally Sam Rainsy also be included. No party with seat at the National Assembly should be left out if transparency and a check and balance system is to be used in government, the statement said, adding that the Sam Rainsy Party should also be given chairmanship of one of the national assembly's nine commission. Noting that FUNCINPEC allowed the CPP to hold the presidency despite it win in the 1993 general election, the statement said it wa now it turn to take the post. In the most recent election, held in July, Hun Sen's party collected 64 of the 122 parliamentary seat, but wa short of the two-thirds majority needed to set up a new government. Fearing arrest, many opposition member of Parliament left Cambodia after the ceremonial opening of the National Assembly on Sep. 24. A series of negotiation to forge a new government have failed. The talk have been complicated by the CPP-FUNCINPEC quarrel over the Parliament's top job. Hun Sen's party recently called on Ranariddh to return to the negotiation table and said it wa willing to make an appropriate concession to break the deadlock over forming a government. FUNCINPEC ha demanded from Hun Sen written guarantee for the safety of it member and activity a a precondition for re-entering negotiation. Cambodian leader Hun Sen ha guaranteed the safety and political freedom of all politician, trying to ease the fear of his rival that they will be arrested or killed if they return to the country. The assurance were aimed especially at Sam Rainsy, leader of a vocally anti-Hun Sen opposition party, who wa forced to take refuge in the UN. office in September to avoid arrest after Hun Sen accused him of being behind a plot against his life. Sam Rainsy and the 14 member of parliament from his party have been holed up overseas for two month. But a deal reached between Hun Sen and his chief rival, Prince Norodom Ranariddh, on forming a new government last week ha opened the door for their return. In a letter to King Norodom Sihanouk the prince's father and Cambodia's head of state that wa broadcast on television Tuesday, Hun Sen said that guarantee of safety extended to Ranariddh applied to all politician. His assurance come a week before the first session of Cambodia's new parliament, the National Assembly. Sam Rainsy said Wednesday that he wa unsatisfied with the guarantee. He said it contained indirect language and loophole that suggest he and his Sam Rainsy Party member are still under threat of arrest from Hun Sen's ruling party. It should be easy for them to say, `Rainsy and the SRP member of the assembly have no charge against them and will not be arrested,' the opposition leader said in a statement. But instead they make roundabout statement, full of loophole that can easily be exploited by a legal system that is completely in their control. Ranariddh told reporter Wednesday that he believed it wa safe for Sam Rainsy in Cambodia. Speaking upon his return from a brief stay in Bangkok, the prince said he would soon meet with Hun Sen to discus the apportioning of ministry in the new coalition government. Last week, Hun Sen's Cambodian People's Party and Ranariddh's FUNCINPEC party agreed to form a coalition that would leave Hun Sen a sole prime minister and make the prince president of the National Assembly. The deal assures the two-thirds vote in parliament needed to approve a new government. The men served a co-prime minister until Hun Sen overthrew Ranariddh in a coup last year. I think Hun Sen ha got everything. He's got the premiership and legitimacy through the election and recognition from his majesty the king. I don't think there is any benefit for Hun Sen to cause instability for our country, Ranariddh said. The prince also said that his top general, Nhek Bunchhay, would not be given back his previous position a the second-ranking general in the Cambodian military's general staff. Nhek Bunchhay's outnumbered force in the capital put up tough but unsuccessful resistance to last year's coup.

2,"Hurricane Mitch cut through the Honduran coast like a ripsaw Thursday, it devastating wind whirling for a third day through resort island and mainland community. At least 32 people were killed and widespread flooding prompted more than 150,000 to seek higher ground. Mitch, once among the century's most powerful hurricane, weakened today a it blasted this Central American nation, bringing downpour that flooded at least 50 river. It also kicked up huge wave that pounded seaside community. The storm's power wa easing and by 1200 GMT, it had sustained wind of 80 mph (130 kph), down from 100 mph (160 kph) around midnight and well below it 180 mph (290 kph) peak of early Tuesday. After remaining virtually stationary for more than a day, the US. National Hurricane Center said Thursday the center of the 350-mile-wide (560-kilometer-wide) storm had moved slightly to the south but remained just off the Honduran coast. Hurricane-force wind whirled up to 30 mile (50 kilometer) from the center, with rain-laden tropical storm wind extending well beyond that. Caught near the heart of the storm were the Bay Islands, about 25 mile (40 kilometer) off Honduras' coast and popular with diver and beachcomber. The hurricane ha destroyed almost everything, said Mike Brown, a resident of Guanaja Island, 20 mile (32 kilometer) off the coast. Few house have remained standing. Honduran official said 14 people had died on that small island alone, and at least nine had died elsewhere in the country. More than 72,000 people had been evacuated to shelter. Nine other death had been reported elsewhere in the region by early Thursday more than a day after Mitch drifted to just off the coast and seemed to park there. An American wa thrown from his boat south of Cancun, Mexico, on Monday and wa presumed dead. Eight others died in Nicaragua in flooding. Honduran official said more than 200 town and village had been isolated by the storm, left without power, telephone or clean drinking water. Agriculture Minister Pedro Arturo Sevilla said crucial grain, citrus and banana crop had been damaged and the economic future of Honduras is uncertain. Rain-swollen river knocked out bridge and road, isolating La Ceiba, a coastal city of 40,000 people located 80 mile (128 kilometer) from the Bay Islands. About 10,000 resident fled to crowded shelter in school, church and firehouse. While supply of food and gasoline seemed to hold up, driver worried about the coming day formed long line to fill their tank at gas station and some supermarket took measure to limit panic buying. La Ceiba official appealed for pure water for those in shelter and some resident set out plastic bucket to collect rainwater. Only a few hotel and office with their own generator had electricity. Wind-whipped wave almost buried some house near the shore. People evacuated low-lying house by wading through chest-deep water with sodden bag of belonging on their head. In neighboring Belize, most of the 75,000 resident of coastal Belize City had left by Wednesday, turning the country's largest city into a ghost town. Police and soldier patrolled the street, and a few people wandered amid the boarded-up house. The cable television company wa broadcasting only The Weather Channel. With the storm seemingly anchored off Honduras, official in Mexico to the north eased emergency measure on the Caribbean coast of the Yucatan Peninsula, where hundred of people remained in shelter a a precaution Wednesday night. More than 20,000 tourist had abandoned Cancun and nearby resort area, leaving hotel at about 20 percent of capacity. Houston accountant Kathy Montgomery said that she and her friend Nina Devries had tried to leave Cancun but found all the flight full. It's been horrible, said Montgomery, a she and her friend drank cocktail at an outdoor restaurant. We couldn't go out on a boat, we couldn't go snorkeling.

Agency for International Development sent two helicopter each to Belize and Honduras to help in search, rescue and relief effort. At it peak, Mitch wa the fourth-strongest Caribbean hurricane in this century, behind Gilbert in 1988, Allen in 1980 and the Labor Day hurricane of 1935. BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) - The European Union on Tuesday approved 6.4 million European currency unit (dlrs 7.7 million) in aid for thousand of victim of the devastation caused by Hurricane Mitch in Central America. EU spokesman Pietro Petrucci said the fund will be used to provide basic care such a medicine, food, water sanitation and blanket to thousand of people whose home were destroyed by torrential rain and mudslide. The aid will be distributed in Nicaragua, El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala which have most suffered from Mitch's deadly passage, the EU executive Commission said in a statement. Officials in Central America estimated Tuesday that about 7,000 people have died in the region. The greatest loss were reported in Honduras, where an estimated 5,000 people died and 600,000 people 10 percent of the population were forced to flee their home after last week's storm. El Salvador's National Emergency Committee listed 174 dead, 96 missing and 27,000 homeless. But it own regional affiliate in San Miguel province reported 125 dead there alone. Guatemala reported 100 storm-related death. The latest EU aid follows an initial 400,000 ecu (dlrs 480,000). the EU approved for the region on Friday.

Honduras braced for potential catastrophe Tuesday a Hurricane Mitch roared through the northwest Caribbean, churning up high wave and intense rain that sent coastal resident scurrying for safer ground. President Carlos Flores Facusse declared a state of maximum alert and the Honduran military sent plane to pluck resident from their home on island near the coast. At 0900 GMT Tuesday, Mitch wa 95 mile (152 kilometer) north of Honduras, near the Swan Islands. With wind near 180 mph (289 kph), and even higher gust, it wa a Category 5 monster the highest, most dangerous rating for a storm. The 350-mile (560-kilometer) wide hurricane wa moving west at 8 mph (12 kph). Mitch is closing in, said Monterrey Cardenas, mayor of Utila, an island 20 mile (32 kilometer) off the Honduran coast. And God help u. Mitch posed no immediate threat to the United States, forecaster said, but wa expected to remain in the northwest Caribbean for five day. The US. National Weather Service in Miami said Mitch could weaken somewhat, but warned it would still remain a very dangerous hurricane capable of causing catastrophic damage. The entire coast of Honduras wa under a hurricane warning and up to 15 inch (38 centimeter) of rain wa forecast in mountain area. The Honduran president closed school and public office on the coast Monday and ordered all air force plane and helicopter to evacuate people from the Islas de la Bahia, a string of small island off the country's central coast. The head of the Honduran armed force, Gen. Mario Hung Pacheco, said 5,000 soldier were standing by to help victim of the storm, but he warned the military could not reach everyone. For that humanitarian work, we would need more than 300 Hercules C-137 plane, he said. Honduras doesn't have them. A hurricane warning wa also in effect for the Caribbean coast of Guatemala. In Belize, a hurricane watch wa in place and the government also closed school and sent worker home early Monday. Panic buying stripped bread from the shelf of some store and some gasoline station ran dry. Coastal Belize City wa hit so hard by Hurricane Hattie in 1961 that the country built a new capital inland at Belmopan. Mexico mobilized troop and emergency worker Monday on the east coast of the Yucatan peninsula, which wa also under a hurricane watch, and Cuba said it had evacuated 600 vacationer from the Island of Youth. Jerry Jarrell, the weather center director, said Mitch wa the strongest hurricane to strike the Caribbean since 1988, when Gilbert killed more than 300 people. In La Ceiba, on Honduras' northern coast, people stood in long line at filling station Monday to buy gasoline under a steady rain. Maria Gonzalez said she needed the gas to cook with when her firewood get wet. Still, she bought only 37 cent worth all she could afford. I have six child, and we live in a riverbed, she said. If it get really bad, we'll go to the church and see what the architect of the world ha in store for u. Swinwick Jackson, a fisherman on Utila, had tied up his boat and wa taking his family to stay with a relative on higher ground. National police spokesman Ivan Mejia said the Coco, Segovia and Cruta river all overflowed their bank Monday along Honduras' eastern coast. Frightened people are moving into the mountain to search for shelter, he said. In El Progreso, 100 mile (160 kilometer) north of the Honduran capital of Tegucigalpa, the army evacuated more than 5,000 people who live in low-lying banana plantation along the Ulua River, said Nolly Soliman, a resident. Before bearing down on Honduras, Mitch swept past Jamaica and the Cayman Islands. Rain squall flooded street in the Jamaican capital, Kingston, and government office and school closed in the Caymans, a British colony of 28,000 people. The strongest hurricane to hit Honduras in recent memory wa Fifi in 1974, which ravaged Honduras' Caribbean coast, killing at least 2,000 people. Better information from Honduras' ravaged countryside enabled official to lower the confirmed death toll from Hurricane Mitch from 7,000 to about 6,100 on Thursday, but leader insisted the need for help wa growing. President Carlos Flores declared Hurricane Mitch had set back Honduras' development by 50 year. He urged the more than 1.5 million Hondurans affected by the storm to help with the recovery effort. The county is semi-destroyed and awaits the maximum effort and most fervent and constant work of every one of it child, he said. In the capital, Tegucigalpa, Mexican rescue team began searching for avalanche victim. Honduran doctor dispensed vaccination to prevent disease outbreak in shelter crammed with refugee. As of Thursday, Mitch had killed 6,076 people in Honduras down from officials' earlier estimate of 7,000. The number of missing dropped from an estimated 11,000 to 4621, Government Minister Delmer Urbizo said. We have more access to place affected by the storm, Urbizo explained. Until now, we have had a short amount of time and few resource to get reliable information. In Nicaragua, around 2,000 people were killed, most of those swept away when a volcano crater lake collapsed a week ago. El Salvador reported 239 dead; Guatemala said 194 of it people had been killed. Six people died in southern Mexico and seven in Costa Rica. Aid group and government have called for other country to send medicine, water, canned food, roofing material and equipment to help deliver supply. In Washington on Thursday, President Bill Clinton ordered dlrs 30 million in Defense Department equipment and service and dlrs 36 million in food, fuel and other aid be sent to Honduras, Nicaragua, El Salvador and Guatemala. The White House also said Clinton wa dispatching Tipper Gore, wife of Vice President Al Gore, to Central America on a mission to show the US. commitment to providing humanitarian relief. Hillary Rodham Clinton also will travel to the region, visiting Nicaragua and Honduras on Nov. 16. She later will stop in El Salvador and Guatemala before continuing on to Haiti and the Dominican Republic for a visit that had been canceled due to Hurricane Georges, which struck the Caribbean in October. Mitch, which sat off the Honduran coast for several day last week, destroyed score of Central American community before moving northwest. The weakened storm crossed southern Florida on Thursday, damaging mobile home and building and injuring at least seven people. Countries overwhelmed by the storm's devastation have only just begun to calculate the damage. Honduran authority still don't know how many shelter have been set up across the Central American country. Surveyors have yet to evaluate roughly 10 percent of the most affected area the department of Cortes, Atlantida, Colon and Yoro in the north, southern Choluteca and Valle, and the central department of Francisco Morazan, which includes the capital. Numbers still can vary wildly. The estimated number of homeless dropped from 580,000 to 569,000 Thursday. Mitch damaged or destroyed at least 90 bridge on major highway, including most span on Highway 5, the main north-south route, official said. Urbizo said Honduran official hoped the scale of need in next-door Nicaragua wouldn't overshadow Honduras' plight. Our problem is that all of the country ha been affected, he said. Thursday's relief operation paled in comparison to the scope of the disaster. A total of 14 helicopter relief mission were delivering aid to stricken town, said Col. Roger Antonio Caceres of the government's Operation Mitch emergency response task force. We can manage with the number of aircraft we have because there is little to distribute, Caceres said. More help wa on the way. Mexico wa sending 700 ton of food, 11 ton of medicine, at least 12 helicopter, four cargo plane and 475 soldier to help in relief operation. The United States committed 19 Blackhawk and Chinook helicopter, two C-27 aircraft and one C-130 cargo plane. France said it wa sending 250 rescue worker to Central America, along with a ship loaded with construction material and equipment. The UN. World Food Program said Thursday it wa diverting ship, some already at sea, to rush their cargo of donated food to Central America. It also wa pulling food from warehouse at it base in Rome, probably for delivery by emergency relief flight, spokesman Trevor Rowe said. We're trying to move food a fast a possible to help people a soon a possible, Rowe said. Searches for the missing continued, and some decomposed body, once found, were being buried in common graf. About 100 victim had been buried around Tegucigalpa, Mayor Nahum Valladeres said. In the flood-ravaged Tegucigalpa neighborhood of Nueva Esperanza, Mexican military rescuer loaded search dog on their back and forded a muddy river to look for people believed buried in a 200-foot (60-meter) avalanche that occurred last Friday. Dozens of home were swept into the river. This is the first place we've been with the dog, Honduran army Maj. Freddy Diaz Celaya said. From here we'll continue searching downriver. Concerned that crowded shelter condition could produce outbreak of hepatitis, respiratory infection and other ailment, the Health Ministry announced an inoculation campaign, especially for child. Doctors volunteering at a shelter housing 4,000 people at Tegucigalpa's Polytechnic Development Institute said they'd heard of the campaign but had yet to receive word or medicine from the Health Ministry. We have to vaccinate the child, said Dr. Mario Soto, who ha treated at least 300 child at the shelter for diarrhea, conjunctivitis and bacterial infection. Aid worker struggled Friday to reach survivor of Hurricane Mitch, who are in danger of dying from starvation and disease in the wake of the storm that official estimate killed more than 10,000 people. Foreign aid and pledge of assistance poured into Central America, but damage to road and bridge reduced the amount of supply reaching hundred of isolated community to a trickle: only a much a could be dropped from a helicopter, when the aircraft can get through. In the Aguan River Valley in northern Honduras, floodwaters have receded, leaving a carpet of mud over hundred of acre (hectares). In many nearby village, resident have gone day without potable water or food. A 7-month-old baby died in the village of Olvido after three day without food. Residents feared more child would die. The worst thing, the saddest thing, are the child. The child are suffering, even dying, said the Rev. Cecilio Escobar Gallindo, the parish priest. A score of cargo aircraft landed Thursday at the normally quiet Toncontin airport in the Honduran capital of Tegucigalpa, delivering aid from Mexico, the United States, Japan and Argentina. Former US. President Jimmy Carter and his wife, Rosalynn, intended to visit Nicaragua on Friday to learn more about the hurricane's impact, The Carter Center in Atlanta announced. We hope this visit will help call attention to the suffering and humanitarian need this disaster ha created, Carter said in a statement. US. President Bill Clinton requested a global relief effort to help Central America and boosted US. emergency aid to dlrs 70 million. Clinton is dispatching a delegation next week led by Tipper Gore, wife of Vice President Al Gore, to deliver some of the supply destined for Honduras, Nicaragua, El Salvador and Guatemala. First lady Hillary Rodham Clinton added Nicaragua and Honduras to a trip she plan to the region beginning Nov. 16. Taiwan said today it will donate dlrs 2.6 million in relief to Honduras, Nicaragua, El Salvador and Guatemala. The four country are among a dwindling number of nation that recognize Taiwan, which China claim is a breakaway province. Two British ship that were in the area on an exercise were on their way to Honduras to join relief effort, the Defense Ministry said Friday. It's a coincidence that the ship are there but they've got men and equipment that can be put to work in an organized way, said International Development Secretary Clare Short. Nicaragua said Friday it will accept Cuba's offer to send doctor a long a the communist nation fly them in on it own helicopter and with their own supply. Nicaraguan leader previously had refused Cuba's offer of medical help, saying it did not have the mean to transport or support the doctor. Nicaragua's leftist Sandinistas, who maintained close relation with Fidel Castro during their 1979-90 rule, had criticized the refusal by President Arnoldo Aleman's administration. Hurricane Mitch paused in it whirl through the western Caribbean on Wednesday to punish Honduras with 120-mph (205-kph) wind, topping tree, sweeping away bridge, flooding neighborhood and killing at least 32 people. Mitch wa drifting west at only 2 mph (3 kph) over the Bay Islands, Honduras' most popular tourist area. It also wa only 30 mile (50 km) off the coast, and hurricane-force wind stretched outward 105 mile (165 kms); tropical storm-force wind 175 mile (280 kms). That meant the Honduran coast had been under hurricane condition for more than a day. The hurricane ha destroyed almost everything, said Mike Brown, a resident of Guanaja Island which wa within mile (kms) of the eye of the hurricane. Few house have remained standing. At it, 4th graf pvs In Honduras, at least 231 death have been blamed on Mitch, the National Emergency Commission said Saturday. El Salvador where 140 people died in flash flood declared a state of emergency Saturday, a did Guatemala, where 21 people died when flood swept away their home. Mexico reported one death from Mitch last Monday. In the Caribbean, the US. Coast Guard widened a search for a tourist schooner with 31 people aboard that hasn't been heard from since Tuesday. By late Sunday, Mitch's wind, once near 180 mph (290 kph), had dropped to near 30 mph (50 kph), and the storm now classified a a tropical depression wa near Tapachula, on Mexico's southern Pacific coast near the Guatemalan border. Mitch wa moving west at 8 mph (13 kph) and wa dissipating but threatened to strengthen again if it moved back out to sea. Pope John Paul II appealed for aid Wednesday for the Central American country stricken by hurricane Mitch and said he feel close to the thousand who are suffering. Speaking during his general audience, the pope urged all public and private institution and all men of good will to do all they can in this grave moment of destruction and death. Hurricane Mitch killed an estimated 9,000 people throughout Central America in a disaster of such proportion that relief agency have been overwhelmed. Among those attending the audience were six Russian cosmonaut taking a special course in Italy. As a gift, they gave John Paul a spacesuit.

3,"Margaret Thatcher entertained former Children dictator Gen. Augusto Pinochet at her home two week before he wa arrested in his bed in a London hospital, the ex-prime minister's office said Tuesday, amid growing diplomatic and domestic controversy over the move. Pinochet, who ha vowed to fight attempt to extradite him to Spain on allegation of murder, genocide and torture, had drink with Lady Thatcher and her husband, Denis, in their home in London's elite Belgravia district four day before he wa hospitalized for back surgery performed Oct. 9. She regarded it a a private meeting, said Mark Worthington, spokesman for the Lady Thatcher, Conservative Party prime minister from 1979-90. The 82-year-old Pinochet wa arrested Friday at a Spanish magistrate's request. In Conservative government day, Pinochet wa welcomed on regular visit that included tea with the prime minister. He wa the only Latin American leader to support Britain in it 1982 war against Argentina to reclaim the Falkland Islands. Pinochet and Lady Thatcher also implemented similar brand of right-wing economics. The current visit is Pincohet's first since Prime Minister Tony Blair's Labor Party administration wa elected 18 month ago, ending 18 year of Conservative Party rule. Chile's ambassador delivered a formal protest to the Foreign Office on Monday, saying Britain ha violated Pinochet's diplomatic immunity. He arrived last month on a diplomatic passport and is also a senator-for-life in Chile, which protects him from prosecution there. Pinochet's 17-year-rule wa marked by torture and other human right abuse against political opponent in which, the Chilean government ha said, 4,299 people were killed or vanished. He remained Chilean army commander-in-chief until March. The magistrate broadened his charge Monday to include killing of Chileans a well a Spaniards, and genocide for which there is no diplomatic immunity. Chilean Ambassador Mario Artaza, himself an exile during Pinochet's rule, said Chile had a duty to protect a citizen with diplomatic immunity and senator status. We are not protecting the dictator of the '70s, Artaza said in a British Broadcasting Corp. radio interview Tuesday. What we are fighting for and discussing with the (British) government is the special situation of a senator in our transition who many people do not understand and many people don't like. We're not discussing his record during his period of dictatorship, that the present government doe not support at all, added the ambassador. A Chilean specialist in international law wa traveling to London for further meeting with British official, Artaza said. Pinochet, expected to be hospitalized for perhaps two more week face a long battle through British court to avoid extradition, questioning by two Spanish judge who instigated the proceeding, and an appearance at London's Bow Street magistrate's court. British Conservative Party lawmaker accuse the Labor government of gesture politics and pandering to the party's left-wing. The wife of former Chilean dictator Augusto Pinochet appealed for his release, saying he is too sick to be extradited to Spain to face charge of genocide. This is very painful for our family, a tearful Lucia Pinochet told reporter late Friday outside the private London Clinic, where her husband is under arrest a he recuperates from back surgery. 'I would like to ask for compassion for a person who is very, very, very, ill. Pinochet, 82, had surgery Oct. 9 for a herniated disc, a painful spinal disorder which had hindered his movement. He wa arrested Oct. 16 at the instigation of a Spanish magistrate seeking to extradite him on charge of genocide, terrorism and torture. The Spanish warrant cited 94 victim, but could be broadened to include some 3,000 people who were killed or disappeared during his 17-year-rule. Chile argues that Pinochet must be released because a a senator he enjoys diplomatic immunity and because he is in poor health. Unconfirmed medium report in Chile this week indicated that Pinochet, who ha worn a pacemaker for year and is diabetic, also ha a urinary tract infection. There have also been report that he is suffering from depression. In a separate attempt to block his extradition, lawyer for the former strongman went to court Friday to argue that British police acted illegally in accepting the Spanish warrant. The case resume Monday. Pinochet ruled from 1973 until 1990 but remained army commander until last March. Then, he moved to congress a a senator for life, a permitted by the constitution his regime drafted. The Spanish and British government appeared Wednesday to be seeking shelter from the political storm brewing over the possible extradition of former Chilean dictator Augusto Pinochet to Spain. Despite everything that ha been written, this is not a decision for the British government or the Spanish government, British Prime Minister Tony Blair said in an interview published by a Spanish newspaper on Wednesday. In a similar vein, Spanish Foreign Ministry spokesman Joaquin Perez said Wednesday: The government should not have any opinion about the extradition. British police, acting on an international arrest warrant from Spanish judge Baltasar Garzon on Friday, detained the ailing general in the London clinic where he wa recovering from back surgery. The detention and the possible extradition of Pinochet to Spain to stand trial for genocide, terrorism and torture during his 17-year dictatorship wa warmly welcomed by human right activist worldwide. But it sparked protest from the Chilean government, and fear it could damage economic relation. In 1997, seven year after Pinochet left power, Spain wa the biggest single investor in Chile, followed closely by Britain. Blair quoted in the El Mundo newspaper said that Pinochet's detention wa unrelated to his government's so-called Ethical Foreign Policy, apparently ignoring pressure from leftist within his Labor party to support move to prosecute the former dictator. This is about two legal system united by an extradition treaty but nobody seems to understand this, he said. Blair added that should Home Secretary Jack Straw would use only strictly legal criterion and act a if he were a judge, should he be required to make a decision on an extradition request from Spain. The tone of the British Prime Minister's first public comment on the issue contrasted sharply with Sunday's emotional statement from influential Trade Secretary Peter Mandelson who said most Britons would find diplomatic immunity for Pinochet gut-wrenching. The European extradition convention give Garzon 40 day to present a formal extradition request to the British authority via the Spanish government. But while Spanish Prime Minister Jose Maria Aznar ha promised his government would rubber stamp the process if it reach his desk, he appears to be hoping he will never have to do so. Public prosecutor from Spain's National Court have appealed the judicial investigation into human right abuse in Chile and Argentina that underpin Garzon's arrest warrant. Depending on the result of the appeal it is possible that it (the extradition request) will never reach the government so perhaps the government will never have to pronounce on it, Aznar wa quoted a saying in Wednesday's edition of the Madrid newspaper El Pais. The appeal argue that crime committed during Pinochet's 1973-1990 dictatorship are none of Spain's business, and should be left to the Chilean or international court. A ruling on the appeal is expected next week, and a decision in their favor would nullify Garzon's extradition attempt. Europe's top official said Friday that he hoped former Chilean dictator Augusto Pinochet would be extradited to Spain to be tried for crime committed during his 17-year rule. Sometimes it should be made clear that crime, wherever they take place, cannot be left unpunished, European Commission President Jacques Santer said. Pinochet wa detained by British police in London on Oct. 16 by request of a Spanish magistrate a a first step toward his extradition to stand trial for genocide and terrorism. The dictatorship caused great suffering and sent many citizen into exile, Santer said, referring to the 1973-90 Pinochet regime. Santer wa speaking to reporter in the northern Spanish city of Oviedo where he wa due to receive the Prince of Asturias Prize for social science one of the eight annual prize named after the heir to the Spanish throne. Meanwhile, a Spanish newspaper reported Friday that Pinochet is not fully aware of his predicament. Daily El Mundo said the ailing retired general's family and aide have been shielding him from the detail for fear he would fly into a rage that would kill him. Pinochet wa detained in the London clinic while recovering from back surgery. El Mundo said it reporter accompanied Chilean politician seeking his release during a visit to the clinic Thursday. The reporter said he talked briefly to Pinochet's wife, Lucia Hiriart, and daughter Veronica. If Augusto knew the truth, he would have an attack of rage and die, El Mundo quoted Hiriart a saying to others while waiting for permission from Scotland Yard to visit her husband on the eighth floor of the clinic. She said she wa particularly concerned because he is also suffering from a urinary infection, heart problem and diabetes, the newspaper reported. El Mundo reported that the family had asked police guard to stand outside the former dictator's room and keep out of sight. The paper said the room lacked television, radio or telephone. According to the report Pinochet wa informed of the arrest order from two policeman, but is convinced it wa a mistake and that he is protected by diplomatic immunity. Meanwhile, a Chilean television station reported Friday that a Chilean army officer close to Pinochet told the former military chief about his situation after flying to London Thursday. TV13 reported that the unidentified officer said Pinochet reacted calmly to the news imparted a one soldier to another. Cuban President Fidel Castro said Sunday he disagreed with the arrest in London of former Chilean dictator Augusto Pinochet, calling it a case of international meddling. It seems to me that what ha happened there (in London) is universal meddling, Castro told reporter covering the Ibero-American summit being held here Sunday. Castro had just finished breakfast with King Juan Carlos of Spain in a city hotel. He said the case seemed to be unprecedented and unusual. Pinochet, 82, wa placed under arrest in London Friday by British police acting on a warrant issued by a Spanish judge. The judge is probing Pinochet's role in the death of Spaniards in Chile under his rule in the 1970s and 80. The Chilean government ha protested Pinochet's arrest, insisting that a a senator he wa traveling on a diplomatic passport and had immunity from arrest. Castro, Latin America's only remaining authoritarian leader, said he lacked detail on the case against Pinochet, but said he thought it placed the government of Chile and President Eduardo Frei in an uncomfortable position while Frei is attending the summit. Castro compared the action with the establishment in Rome in August of an International Criminal Court, a move Cuba ha expressed reservation about. Castro said the court ought to be independent of the UN. Security Council, because we already know who command there, an apparent reference to the United States. The United States wa one of only seven country that voted against creating the court. The (Pinochet) case is serious . the problem is delicate and the reaction of the Chilean Parliament and armed force bear watching, Castro said. He expressed surprise that the British had arrested Pinochet, especially since he had provided support to England during it 1982 war with Argentina over the Falkland Islands. Although Chile maintained neutrality during the war, it wa accused of providing military intelligence to the British. Castro joked that he would have thought police could have waited another 24 hour to avoid having the arrest of Pinochet overshadow the summit being held here. Now they are talking about the arrest of Pinochet instead of the summit, he said. Pinochet left government in 1990, but remained a army chief until March when he became a senator-for-life. The Swiss government ha ordered no investigation of possible bank account belonging to former Chilean dictator Augusto Pinochet, a spokesman said Wednesday. Weekend newspaper report in Spain said a Spanish judge who ordered Pinochet's arrest ha issued a petition aimed at freezing any account the 82-year-old general might have in Luxembourg and Switzerland. But government spokesman Achille Casanova said no account have so far been frozen in Switzerland and no investigation order ha been given to federal banking authority. Pinochet ha been held at a London clinic since his arrest earlier this month. Spanish magistrate Baltasar Garzon is seeking his extradition on charge of genocide, torture and terrorism during his 17-year rule which ended 1990. On Monday, Switzerland also requested Pinochet's arrest and extradition on charge of murder, kidnapping and torture. The move followed a criminal complaint filed in Geneva last week by the widow of Alexis Jaccard, a student of Swiss-Chilean dual nationality who disappeared in May 1977. Swiss authority said the Spanish effort to extradite Pinochet should be given priority. A Spanish request for legal assistance from Switzerland, made Friday, ha been passed on to Geneva authority. No detail have been given of the content of the Spanish request. As his lawyer in London tried to quash a Spanish arrest warrant for Gen. Augusto Pinochet, the former Chilean dictator, effort began in Geneva and Paris to have him extradited. In London, where Pinochet ha been under arrest in a clinic for the last 10 day, a phalanx of British lawyer argued before the High Court of Justice that the arrest order sent from Spain wa illegal because the general, 82, is not a Spanish citizen. They also maintained that a a former head of state, the general had diplomatic immunity for action taken while in office. His lawyer, Clive Nicholls, said that if a bid to extradite the general succeeded, by the same token Queen Elizabeth II could be extradited to Argentina to face trial for the death of Argentine soldier in the Falklands war in 1982. On the opposing side, Alun Jones, a British government lawyer acting a prosecutor in the case, defended the Spanish warrant, which led to the general's detention in London. The prosecutor argued that the the right-wing general wa responsible for killing at least 4,000 people and had set out to destroy a national group Chilean national who did not share his ideological value. After hearing the argument in a court crowded with Chilean exile in the public gallery, Lord Bingham, Britain's senior judge, said the court wa expected to decide the matter on Tuesday. The Chilean air force ha sent an ambulance plane to Britain in hope of the general's early release. But effort to prevent that gathered strength elsewhere in Europe. In Geneva, a public prosecutor, Bernard Bertossa, said Monday that he had issued a warrant for Pinochet's arrest in connection with the kidnapping and presumed death of a Swiss-Chilean citizen in 1977. Bertossa said he had opened a judicial investigation in response to a complaint by the widow of the victim, Alexei Jaccard, who wa 25 when he wa tortured in Chile and subsequently disappeared. The prosecutor said he wa asking the Swiss federal government to seek Pinochet's extradition from Britain to face trial in Geneva. At the same time in Paris Monday, the family of three French citizen, of whom two disappeared and one wa killed in Chile during the 1973-90 dictatorship, filed suit in a French court. In addition, a human right group in Paris said Monday that it had filed a suit with a Paris court on behalf of Anne Marie Pesle, whose father, Etienne Pesle, disappeared in Chile in 1973. In Madrid, Baltasar Garzon, the Spanish investigating magistrate who first obtained Pinochet's arrest in London, said he had formally requested the government of Switzerland and Luxemburg to block bank account held by the general. Court official in Madrid said Garzon wanted any account blocked with a view to their possible use later a compensation to relative of victim. In London, British official keep insisting that Pinochet's case will be decided by the court and not politically, yet the issue ha stirred intense political activity both in Britain and in Chile. Supporters and opponent of the dictator have traveled to the London clinic where he is being held. From Chile have come six right-wing senator, the deputy foreign minister, aide and legal expert who file in and out of the private clinic in central London. From Europe have come dozen of longtime opponent of the general who were forced into exile after his 1973 coup against the elected Socialist president, Salvador Allende Gossens. The exile, along with others, stand daily outside the clinic holding up photograph of missing relative and shouting anti-Pinochet slogan. On occasion there have been shouting match between the two side. He is ill, and in a few day he will be 83, Mariano Fernandez, Chile's deputy foreign minister, said after visiting Pinochet who had minor surgery for a back ailment. After his surgery on Oct. 9, the general wa arrested by Scotland Yard during the night of Oct. 16. The diplomatic and judicial entanglement that ensued now involve at least five government. The political and legal imbroglio could end if Britain's home secretary, Jack Straw, decides that the general should be released on compassionate ground because of his age and failing health. Last week he said that in exercising his power under the 1989 Extradition Act, he would consider whether the offense are of a political character and he would take into account any compassionate circumstance. Britain ha defended it arrest of Gen. Augusto Pinochet, with one lawmaker saying that Chile's claim that the former Chilean dictator ha diplomatic immunity is ridiculous. Chilean official, meanwhile, issued strong protest and sent a delegation to London on Sunday to argue for Pinochet's release. The former strongman's son vowed to hire top attorney to defend his 82-year-old father, who ruled Chile with an iron fist for 17 year. British police arrested Pinochet in his bed Friday at a private London hospital in response to a request from Spain, which want to question Pinochet about allegation of murder during the decade after he seized power in 1973. Pinochet had gone to the hospital to have a back operation Oct. 9. The idea that such a brutal dictator a Pinochet should be claiming diplomatic immunity I think for most people in this country would be pretty gut-wrenching stuff, Trade Secretary Peter Mandelson said in a British Broadcasting Corp. television interview Sunday. Home Office Minister Alun Michael acknowledged Sunday that Pinochet entered Britain on a diplomatic passport, but said, That doe not necessarily convey diplomatic immunity. The Foreign Office said only government official visiting on official business and accredited diplomat have immunity. Pinochet ha been a regular visitor to Britain, generally without publicity. His arrest this time appeared to reflect a tougher attitude toward right-wing dictator by Prime Minister Tony Blair's Labor Party government, which replaced a Conservative Party administration 18 month ago and promised an ethical foreign policy. However, Michael Howard, a Conservative spokesman and former Cabinet minister, said he wa concerned that Pinochet wa arrested a a result of pressure from Labor lawmaker and lobby group. Chilean President Eduardo Frei criticized the arrest, saying the Spanish magistrate's arrest order wa tantamount to not recognizing Chile's institution. Spain also lived under an authoritarian for 40 year and many of it present institution are inherited from that regime, Frei said in Porto, Portugal, where he wa attending the Ibero-American Summit. Would a Chilean court be allowed to start a trial for abuse that occurred under the Spanish authoritarian regime (of Francisco Franco)? Frei asked. It is only for Chilean court to try event that occurred in Chile. Franco's reign ended in 1975. Pinochet's family issued a statement Sunday calling the arrest an insult and thanking the Chilean government, rightist politician and the military for their support. In London, police guard were deployed Sunday outside the London Clinic, where Pinochet is believed to still be a patient. About 100 Chilean demonstrator pleased with the arrest gathered outside, chanting and waving placard bearing faded black and white portrait with the caption Disappeared in Chile. Across the Atlantic, the Chilean capital of Santiago wa the scene of dueling demonstration Sunday, reflecting the long-standing division of public opinion over Pinochet. The rally were mostly peaceful, although riot police used tear gas and water cannon on some pro-Pinochet protester trying to break through police line into the British embassy on Sunday evening. No arrest or injury were reported. The envoy sent to London to argue for Pinochet's release, Santiago Benadava, would offer only diplomatic advice, said Chilean Foreign Minister Jose Miguel Insulza. Any legal defense would be up to Pinochet's family. Pinochet's son, Augusto, said the family would hire the best legal team available in London. Several right-wing Chilean politician, including some who held post in the Pinochet regime, also were flying to London to show their support to their former bos. Under extradition law, Spain ha 40 day from last Friday to formally apply for extradition. The final decision lie with British Home Secretary Jack Straw. There wa no immediate word on when Pinochet would be questioned. But police source, speaking on condition of anonymity, said questioning wa not expected for a week or two. Pinochet ha been widely accused of running a ruthless regime marked by disappearance and death of political opponent. His arrest wa prompted by application last week to question him by two Spanish judge investigating human right violation. One of them, Baltasar Garzon, also want to question Pinochet about the disappearance of Chilean dissident in Argentina. The arrest warrant, however, referred only to questioning about allegation that he killed Spaniards in Chile between 1973 and 1983. In Chile, seven Spaniards have been identified a missing or dead under the Pinochet regime, including two Catholic priest and a UN. official. According to a Chilean government report, a total of 4,299 political opponent died or disappeared during Pinochet's term. Pinochet, commander-in-chief of the Chilean army until March, ha immunity from prosecution in Chile a a senator-for-life under a new constitution that his government crafted. He is also covered under an amnesty for crime committed before 1978 when most of the human right abuse took place. A delegation of Chilean legislator lobbying against the possible extradition of Augusto Pinochet to Spain to face trial, warned Thursday that Chile wa on the brink of political turmoil. There is a climate of division, confrontation and instability in Chile, parliamentary deputy Alberto Espina told reporter in Madrid after meeting the Chilean ambassador. Pinochet wa arrested in London on Oct. 16 at the instigation of Spanish magistrate Baltasar Garzon who is seeking to extradite the former dictator on charge of genocide, terrorism and torture. In Chile, the detention triggered both celebration by relative of victim of Pinochet's 1973-1990 regime and protest from the retired general's supporter. Espina also warned that the issue wa damaging relation between Chile Spain and Britain. Spain wa the biggest single investor in Chile last year, followed closely by Britain. The deputy arrived in Madrid late Wednesday accompanied by the senator Jovino Movoa and Julio Lagos. The delegation is an offshoot of a larger group of Chilean parliamentarian currently protesting the detention in London on behalf of the opposition party Independent Democratic Union and the National Renovation Party. Espina, Movoa and Lagos were hoping to talk to official from the Spanish Foreign Ministry and other government representative. All we ask is that Spain stop meddling in our internal affair, Espina said, arguing that Chilean problem should be dealt with by Chilean court. We stopped being a Spanish colony 188 year ago and we have no intention of becoming one again, he added. Government spokesman Josep Pique said Prime Minister Jose Maria Aznar had no plan to meet the delegation, the state-owned news agency EFE reported. Aznar ha promised his government will rubber stamp a formal extradition request to the British government if asked to do so by the judicial authority. But the extradition attempt could be annulled by legal challenge in Spain well before the deadline for presenting it in Britain. The deadline is set for November 25th coincidentally Pinochet's 83rd birthday. On Thursday the head prosecutor from the National Court set in motion appeal against several ruling made by Judge Garzon related to Pinochet's detention in the London clinic where he wa recovering from back surgery. The court's plenary is expected to meet next week to decide on an earlier challenge of the Spanish judicial investigation into human right abuse in Chile and Argentina that underpin Garzon's arrest warrant. A ruling that the investigation are outside the jurisdiction of Spanish law would made any extradition request difficult. The decision is likely to hang on how genocide and terrorism are interpreted, a these crime are specifically mentioned in the Spanish legal code. The British and Spanish prime minister said Sunday that the fate of former Chilean dictator Gen. Augusto Pinochet is in the hand of their judicial authority and they will not interfere. Both myself and Mr. Aznar agree this is not a matter for u to discus, British Prime Minister Tony Blair said, referring to Spanish leader Jose Maria Aznar. I've avoided commenting on that judicial process and I don't intend to do so. Aznar made similar comment when he meet journalist on the margin of a European Union summit in this Alpine lakeside resort. Pinochet is under arrest in a London hospital where he'd gone for back surgery. He wa detained on a warrant from a Spanish magistrate seeking to extradite him on charge of genocide, terrorism and torture during his 1973-90 rule. The Chilean government ha urged Britain to release Pinochet on humanitarian ground, and argued that a a senator, he is entitled to diplomatic immunity. Aznar dismissed report that the bid to try Pinochet will damage Spain's relation with Latin America. It's important we don't talk nonsense about this issue. This is stupid. ","Pinochet arrested in London on Oct. 16 at a Spanish judge's request for atrocities against Spaniards in Chile during his rule.Castro, Chilean legislators and Pinochet's lawyers protested and claimed he had diplomatic immunity.His wife asked for his release because he was recovering from recent back surgery.Pinochet visited Thatcher before his surgery.The British and Spanish governments defended the arrest, saying it was strictly a legal matter.The EC president hoped Pinochet would stand trial.None of his Swiss accounts have been frozen yet.The Swiss government also asked for his arrest for the 1977 disappearance of a Swiss-Chilean student.","On Oct. 16, 1998 British police arrested former Chilean dictator Pinochet on a Spanish warrant charging murder of Spaniards in Chile, 1973-1983.Fidel Castro denounced the arrest.The Chilean government protested strongly.While the British government defended the arrest, it and the Spanish government took no stand on extradition of Pinochet to Spain, leaving it to the courts.Chilean legislators lobbied in Madrid against extradition, while others endorsed it.Then new charges were filed for crimes against Swiss and French citizens.Pinochet's wife and family pleaded that he was too sick to face extradition.As of Oct. 28 the matter was not resolved.","Former Chilean dictator Augusto Pinochet has been arrested in London at the request of the Spanish government.Pinochet, in London for back surgery, was arrested in his hospital room.Spain is seeking extradition of Pinochet from London to Spain to face charges of murder in the deaths of Spanish citizens in Chile under Pinochet's rule in the 1970s and 80s.The arrest raised confusion in the international community as the legality of the move is debated.Pinochet supporters say that Pinochet's arrest is illegal, claiming he has diplomatic immunity.The final outcome of the extradition request lies with the Spanish courts.","Britain caused international controversy and Chilean turmoil by arresting former Chilean dictator Pinochet in London for Spain's investigation of Spanish citizen deaths under Pinochet's 17-year rule of torture and political murder.Claims are Pinochet had diplomatic immunity, extradition is international meddling or illegal because Pinochet is not a Spanish citizen, also his crimes should be punished.Spain and Britain, big Chilean investors, fear damage to economic relations and let courts decide extradition.The Swiss haven't investigated Pinochet accounts despite a Spanish request.Pinochet is shielded from details, said too sick to be extradited."
5,"NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) FBI agent this week began questioning relative of the victim of the Aug. 7 US. Embassy bombing a well a the seriously injured on request of the US. Attorney's office for the Southern District of New York, a US. official said Thursday. The blast at the embassy building in downtown Nairobi killed 213 people, 12 of them Americans, and injured 5,400. In an nearly simultaneous bombing of the US. Embassy in Dar e Salaam in neighboring Tanzania, 11 people were killed and 85 were injured, none of them Americans. The official, who could not be further identified, said the questioning wa aimed at gathering recorded testimony to be used by the prosecution in the pre-sentencing phase of the trial of the six men indicted in connection with the attack. Wadih El Hage, Mohamed Sadeek Odeh and Mohamed Rashed Daoud Al-'Owhali are being held by the US. District Court in the Southern District of New York. All three have pleaded innocent. Fazul Abdullah Mohammed is a fugitive. Saudi exile Osama bin Laden, the alleged mastermind of a conspiracy to attack US. target around the world, and Muhammad Atef, the alleged military commander of bin Laden's terrorist organization, Al-Qaeda, were charged in a separate 238-page indictment with murder and conspiracy in the bombing. Bin Laden is believed to be living in Afghanistan. US. law provides for the trial in the United States of those charged in terror attack against American citizen, even if carried out on foreign soil. The United States ha obtained new evidence to link the owner of a Sudanese factory destroyed in a US. cruise missile strike last month to a terrorist group backed by Osama bin Laden, the suspected mastermind of the bombing of two US. embassy in East Africa, according to US. intelligence official. The evidence, the official said last week, show that Salih Idris, the owner of Al Shifa pharmaceutical plant in Khartoum, ha had financial dealing with member of Islamic Jihad, an Egypt-based group responsible for the assassination there of President Anwar Sadat in 1981. Islamic Jihad, in turn, receives money and sponsorship from bin Laden and ha been absorbed into his terror network, the official added. This evidence wa uncovered after the United States destroyed Idris' factory in a missile attack following the bombing of the US. embassy, the official said. A spokesman for Idris denied the accusation, saying Idris had no tie either to bin Laden or to any Islamic terrorist group. In a statement provided by Tim Pendry, his London-based adviser, Idris said: I have absolutely no relationship with any Islamic terrorist organization anywhere in the world. I have never met Mr. bin Laden, I have never spoken with him, I have never had any financial or business relationship with him, nor knowingly with anyone acting a his agent. US. official say they have also received new report of an increase in the Iraqi presence in Sudan since the missile attack. Officials said they were not certain what the Iraqis were now doing in Khartoum. But intelligence agent previously obtained evidence that the manager of the Shifa plant made frequent trip to Iraq, where he visited the head of the chemical weapon program. In addition, a soil sample that the CIA clandestinely took at the Shifa plant showed the presence of a chemical used in the production of VX nerve gas, a process used only by Iraq. The new evidence come a President Clinton face attack over his decision to strike the Shifa plant. Some State Department and CIA official have objected to the decision, arguing that it wa based on tenuous evidence of a connection between the plant and bin Laden. The criticism is also based on the suspicion that the United States ha poor data on Sudan, a the CIA station there ha been closed since 1995 and the entire US. Embassy since 1996. In addition, more than 100 intelligence report from a CIA informer in Sudan were withdrawn in January 1996 because they proved to be fabrication. That year a second informer warned of several terrorist threat, including one against Anthony Lake, then the national security adviser, but his report proved impossible to confirm. Senior administration official say that at the time of the cruise missile strike they had evidence of Sudan's involvement with bin Laden in a chemical weapon program, but no direct evidence linking the Shifa plant directly to that effort. Now they say that the new evidence against Idris ha confirmed their initial suspicion about Al Shifa. At the time of the Aug. 20 cruise missile attack, Clinton administration official acknowledge, they did not know that Idris owned the Shifa factory. The CIA, which had begun to scrutinize the plant 18 month earlier, believed the plant's ownership wa irrelevant. What we knew about the ownership wa that a lot of it couldn't be reliably established, said one senior US. intelligence official. Still, after the missile strike, when Idris wa publicly identified a the owner, US. intelligence began to investigate his possible connection to chemical weapon and terrorism. A Sudanese expatriate who now life in Jidda, Saudi Arabia, Idris, 46, wa previously a senior manager of the National Commercial Bank of Saudi Arabia. He bought the Shifa plant in March. Officials say US. intelligence ha received report that Idris launders money for international Islamic group, and that he also ha a stake in a company in Sudan that is 40 percent owned by the Military Industrial Corporation, a government entity that the United States say control Sudanese chemical weapon development. Bin Laden ha helped finance the Military Industrial Corp. in his effort to use Sudan a a base for chemical weapon production, and talked to Sudanese leader about testing poisonous gas against US. troop in Saudi Arabia, according to US. intelligence. But Pendry denied that Idris owned any business with the Military Industrial Corp. US. intelligence official declined to provide detail about the report of Idris' financial dealing with member of Islamic Jihad. But they said that Islamic Jihad had now been consolidated into bin Laden's terrorist campaign. Police arrested two journalist and charged them with writing article to encourage Muslim youth to stage an Islamic revolution in Bangladesh after the Taliban model in Afghanistan, a police officer said Thursday. Mufti Abdul Hye and Manzoor Ahmed, editor at Jago Mujahid or Wake Up Mujahid, a monthy magazine published from Dhaka, the Bangladeshi capital, were jailed for a month shortly after their arrest on Wednesday. They were arrested under a 1974 law that allows police to detain any one for offense related to national security, the officer said on condition of anonymity. Those arrested need not be taken to court for trial for up to three month. Police seized copy of the newspaper for reproducing a foreign newspaper interview of Afghanistan-based Saudi billionaire Osama Bin Laden, who ha been accused by the United States of masterminding bombing attack on the US. embassy in Kenya and Tanzania in August. Under Taliban rule woman may not study or work outside their house, and all kind of light entertainment including music are banned. Men must grow beard of a certain length and criminal are subjected to amputation and public execution Even though Bangladesh is a predominantly Muslim country, it is governed by secular law. Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina's liberal government hasn't recognized the Taliban government in Afghanistan. Albania say it ha uncovered a terrorist network operated by Osama Bin Laden, the Islamic fundamentalist accused of masterminding the August embassy bombing in Africa, and that it's member have infiltrated other part of Europe, The Sunday Times reported. The newspaper quoted Fatos Klosi, the head of Shik, the Albanian intelligence service, a saying that Bin Laden's network had sent unit to fight in Kosovo, the neighboring Serbian province. Egyptians, Saudi Arabians, Algerians, Tunisians, Sudanese and Kuwaitis they come from several different organization, Klosi wa quoted a telling The Sunday Times. He said he believed terrorist had already infiltrated other part of Europe from base in Albania through a traffic in illegal immigrant, who have been smuggled across the Mediterranean to Italy in huge number. Interpol belief more than 100,000 blank Albanian passport were stolen in riot last year, providing ample opportunity for terrorist to acquire false paper, the newspaper said. Apparent confirmation of the Bin Laden's activity came earlier this month during the murder trial of Claude Kader, 27, a French national and self-confessed member of Bin Laden's Albanian network, the newspaper said. Kader claimed during the trial that he had visited Albania to recruit and arm fighter for Kosovo, and that four of his associate were still at large. Bin Laden is believed to have established an Albanian operation in 1994 after telling the government that he wa head of a wealthy Saudi humanitarian agency wishing to help in Albania, the newspaper reported. MUNICH, Germany (AP) US. prosecutor have asked for a 20-day extension to provide Germany with paperwork necessary to extradite a top lieutenant of Saudi terrorist suspect Osama bin Laden, official said Saturday. Mamdouh Mahmud Salim, 40, of Sudan, ha been jailed since his arrest near Munich on Sept. 16 by Bavarian authority acting on a US. warrant. Under German law, US. official have 40 day after the arrest to turn over supporting evidence so a German court can rule on their extradition request. A Bavarian Justice Ministry spokesman, Gerhard Zierl, said US. authority a few day ago asked the court hearing the case for an extra 20 day to provide the necessary material. Quoting unidentified Bavarian law enforcement source, Focus newsmagazine reported Saturday that the evidence turned over so far wa not very strong. The magazine said much of it wa based on the testimony of an FBI informant, a former bin Laden associate, who made only vague connection between Salim and terrorist activity. Zierl declined to comment on the report, but said US. authority probably asked for more time just a precautionary measure. US. authority charge Salim helped finance, train and arm member of a terrorist organization, including the alleged bomber of the US. embassy in Kenya and Tanzania. A criminal complaint unsealed Sept. 25 in US. District Court in New York charge him with murder conspiracy and use of weapon of mass destruction. Sometime in the summer of 1997, an operative for Osama bin Laden sat down at his personal computer in a hideaway in Kenya. He wa worried, he wrote in an angry dispatch, about the security of the East Africa network of bin Laden, the Saudi exile accused of masterminding a worldwide terrorist conspiracy against Americans. The organization, the author complained, had declared war against the United States, yet he had learned of that only from the news medium. The writer, who federal authority believe wa Haroun Fazil, who wa to become one of the central suspect in the bombing of the US. Embassy in Nairobi a year later, noted with alarm British press report about the arrest of an aide to bin Laden. Striking almost bureaucratic tone, he said he wa worried that an important man with close link to bin Laden, seemed to have fallen into the enemy's hand. He said the Americans were breathing down the neck of his associate in Nairobi and that he had to take precaution. The cell is at 100 percent danger, the operative warned. The letter, an extraordinary bit of digital evidence in a cloak-and-dagger case, wa retrieved from a computer in a house where Fazil had been staying, according to paper filed in US. District Court in New York City. The paper said the computer wa seized in August 1997 in a raid by Kenyan authority that wa attended by an FBI agent. The document did not make clear whether the FBI had translated and read the document before or after the bombing of the US. Embassies in Nairobi and Dar e Salaam, Tanzania, on Aug. 7 of this year. The timing is potentially important because there have been mounting question since the bombing about whether the United States adequately followed up warning of a possible terrorist attack on American target in Kenya. Officials of the FBI and the US. attorney's office in New York City refused to say Tuesday night at what point FBI agent learned of the computer file, nor would they make any other comment. Fazil eluded American investigator after the bombing a he traveled from Kenya to his home in the Comoros Islands and then to the Middle East. He remains a fugitive. The dispatch provides a remarkable insight into the working of a terrorist network in the twilight of the 20th century. The author talk of how he and his fellow operative follow event on CNN and use the Internet to communicate. He refers to himself a the medium information officer of the East Africa cell and complains that he is not being kept in the loop on big decision. Along the way, in an almost casual fashion, the document seems to confirm two of the central charge of the federal case against bin Laden: That he had planted a terrorist cell in Nairobi and that his operative carried out another of the crime laid at bin Laden's door by federal authority the attack on American soldier in Somalia in 1993 and 1994. The writer of the document warned that the follower of bin Laden, whom he referred to a the sheik, had become America's primary target. He said his comrade in East Africa should know that there is an American-Kenyan-Egyptian intelligence activity in Nairobi aiming to identify the name and residence of the member who are associated with the sheik since America know well that the youth who lived in Somalia and were member of the sheik's cell are the one who killed Americans in Somalia. They know that since Kenya wa the main gateway for those member, there must be a center in Kenya, he wrote, concluding: We are really in danger. The government ha asserted that one of Fazil's duty wa to prepare and transmit report to bin Laden and his top lieutenant. Federal authority said that Khalid al Fawwaz, a London-based associate of bin Laden, directed Fazil to report periodically to bin Laden about the security situation of the cell. Fawwaz, who served a an informal press spokesman for bin Laden in London, wa arrested by British authority in September after the embassy bombing. He ha denied any connection to terrorist activity. A translation of the report wa part of a package of document American prosecutor have sent to Britain to support the extradition of Fawwaz for trial in New York. It is not clear from the material whether the report in the computer wa forwarded to bin Laden. The document, which were initially filed in secret, include a federal complaint that accuses Fawwaz of conspiring with bin Laden to kill Americans overseas. A second count charge him with soliciting others to do so. The report made clear that the organization wa being run on a shoestring. Its author wrote that his mother ha fallen ill, and that he would like to return to his homeland for a visit. What do you think? Keep in mind we only have $500. He repeatedly expressed his fear of American intelligence, which he believed wa in the midst of a worldwide search for bin Laden and his associate. There is a war and the situation is dangerous, he said. He wrote that American force kidnapped anyone who threatened the national security or American citizen. The author noted with alarm a recent CIA operation in which a man accused of shooting agency employee had been lured across the border in Pakistan and returned to the United States for trial. According to federal authority, Fazil went on to play a pivotal role in the bombing of the Nairobi embassy. Prosecutors assert that he rented the villa where the bomb wa assembled and surveyed the embassy's security precaution. On Aug. 7, they charge, Fazil drove a pickup truck to the embassy, leading the way for a vehicle carrying the bomb that killed more than 200 people, including 12 Americans. The author of the report said that he stood ready to fight the force of atheism and dictator who wreaked havoc on earth. He said that the group did not have to inform it Nairobi-based operative of all it global plan, but they needed enough warning to go underground for a while if authority intensified the pressure in Nairobi. We, the East Africa cell member, do not want to know about the operation plan, he wrote, since we are just implementers. If Osama bin Laden ever stand trial in New York for the bombing of the US. embassy in Africa and other act of terror, it is already clear who prosecutor will call a a chief witness: One of his senior aide who ha been talking to US. investigator for two year. The government ha identified the aide in court paper with the pseudonym CS-1, saying the person pleaded guilty to terrorism charge in a secret proceeding in US. district court in Manhattan. According to the government, the informant worked closely with bin Laden from 1989 to 1996, a period when prosecutor assert that bin Laden wa ordering deadly attack on US. soldier in Somalia and elsewhere. From the court paper filed in the investigation of the embassy bombing in East Africa in August, it is clear that the informant ha provided crucial information to federal investigator. They have cited the source in the paper filed to support the extradition of two associate of bin Laden who are under arrest in Germany and Britain. Bin Laden, a Saudi exile, is thought to be living in Afghanistan. The source is also the basis for many of the significant charge in the indictment against bin Laden himself, including the assertion that he directed the attack on US. soldier in Somalia and that he attempted to obtain nuclear weapon. It is not known whether the source is in custody somewhere, or hiding under government protection. As recently a 11 day ago, record show, the source swore to a 5-page affidavit before a New York notary summarizing his allegation against bin Laden. Government official adamantly declined to say anything about the identity of CS-1, which stand for confidential source. But at least one operative of bin Laden's group in East Africa concluded more than a year ago that he knew the identity of a crucial turncoat: Sidi Tayyib, a businessman who wa married to one of bin Laden's relative. The operative's concern were inflamed by a report in a British newspaper that Tayyib wa cooperating with Saudi and US. authority. In an August, 1997 article, The Daily Telegraph said Tayyib had been in custody in Saudi Arabia since May and had given intelligence official detail of bin Laden's bank account and business. The news of Tayyib's possible defection, the East African operative wrote in a report apparently intended for the group's commander, almost made me explode. An important man with close link to bin Laden seems to have fallen into the enemy's hand, and we have to take all the appropriate security precaution against that, the operative, Haroun Fazil, wrote in his summary of security concern. Fazil ha since been charged in the embassy attack and remains at large. The report wa typed on a computer seized last year by Kenyan authority, according to a government filing last week in US. district court in Manhattan. Thus far, US. prosecutor have charged at least six member of bin Laden's organization with terrorist activity or conspiracy. In one recent filing, they said their case will in part be based on the testimony of the confidential source, suggesting that the informant ha agreed to testify at any trial of bin Laden or his associate. The arrangement appears to have resulted from a plea bargain in which the source is cooperating in hope of receiving a lesser sentence. There is no indication that the source ha yet been sentenced and it seems likely that sentencing would take place after the investigation and ensuing trial are complete. In the affidavit prepared last week, the source acknowledged pleading guilty to terrorism charge in the United States and said they stemmed from attack on US. target, which were not specifically identified. The source described taking an oath of allegiance to follow bin Laden's order, and gave a detailed account of bin Laden's group, including it history and inner working. The source told of private statement by bin Laden to other al Qaeda member, encouraging them to attack US. troop and other citizen stationed in the Middle East and Africa. I either heard these statement myself, the source said, or I read them or learned of them from other al Qaeda member. The government ha also said in other court paper that the source helped identify bin Laden's signature on a 1996 document urging Muslims to kill Americans. Tayyib's whereabouts are unknown and he could not be reached for comment. The Taliban's chief justice accused the United States on Wednesday of looking for an excuse to launch another missile attack on his war-shattered homeland. And that excuse is Osama bin Laden, the man Washington call Enemy No. 1 and blame for the Aug. 7 bombing of US. embassy in East Africa, Justice Noor Mohammed Saqib said an interview with The Associated Press. On Aug. 20 the United States retaliated by firing Tomahawk missile at suspected terrorist camp in eastern Afghanistan, killing 26 people. According to US. intelligence source, the camp were being used to train member of bin Laden's al Qaeda terrorist group. America is looking for an excuse to fire more rocket on our dear Afghanistan and that excuse is bin Laden, Saqib said. Washington, which ha posted a dlrs 5 million reward for bin Laden's arrest, hasn't ruled out further attack on Afghanistan. Saqib, who head a judicial inquiry established by the Taliban to investigate the terrorism charge against bin Laden, say the United States ha become insecure. America fear it shadow . in every part of the world it is afraid and see every danger connected to bin Laden, he said in an interview in the Afghan capital of Kabul. In Afghanistan, bin Laden is considered an honored guest by his Taliban host. They cite Afghan tradition, which demand the host guarantee his guest protection. So far Saqib say he ha no evidence of bin Laden's involvement in terrorist activity. The Taliban have refused to turn over bin Laden to the United States, but they say if there is evidence they will try him under Islamic law. In the 90 percent of Afghanistan ruled by the Taliban a harsh brand of Islamic justice ha been imposed, including the death penalty. We want good relation with the United States and all Muslim and non-Muslim country, but they have to respect our way, he said. Saqib said his inquiry will wind up on Nov. 20 and if there is no evidence against bin Laden the case will be closed at least for the Taliban. Bin Laden is not a sinful man . America ha been silent . they have given no evidence, he said. It is too shameful for America who is now seen by all that world to have no reason to go after bin Laden. The man accused of orchestrating the US. embassy bombing in Tanzania and Kenya wa declared a free man Friday in Afghanistan, where he ha lived for year with the permission of the hard-line Islamic Taliban militia. The Taliban, who control about 90 percent of Afghanistan, on Friday closed their three-week inquiry into allegation that Osama bin Laden is waging a war of terror against the United States. It's over, and America ha not presented any evidence, Afghanistan's chief justice, Noor Mohammed Saqib, told The Associated Press in an interview at the Supreme Court building in the Afghan capital, Kabul. Without any evidence, bin Laden is a man without sin. . He is a free man. The Taliban have told bin Laden, however, that political activity is banned and he ha agreed to respect that, the Taliban information minister said in a statement Friday. The minister, Amir Khan Muttaqi, also disputed US. assertion that bin Laden is a rich man, saying the Saudi dissident ha had his foreign asset frozen, a claim not immediately corroborated. One of the clear but unstated objective of last August's raid on Afghanistan wa to kill Osama bin Laden and a many of his lieutenant a possible, administration official now acknowledge. According to the official, White House lawyer conducted a secret review in the month before the attack and concluded that such operation are legal under US. and international law. The official said the raid wa timed so that more than 70 cruise missile would hit bin Laden's camp at the moment when the Central Intelligence Agency believed he would be meeting there with his chief operative. A 1976 executive order bar anyone working for the US. government from plotting or carrying out assassination. But official said the White House legal opinion drafted before the Afghan strike asserts that the president ha authority to target the infrastructure of terrorist group that are attacking Americans. A top US. counterterrorism official said this week that the infrastructure of bin Laden's group is mostly human. As we said from the time of the Aug. 20 strike, the objective wa to disrupt the training, organization and infrastructure of the bin Laden terrorist network at the Khost camp, said David C. Leavy, a spokesman for the National Security Council at the White House. Targeting infrastructure, official acknowledged, can also mean destroying the leadership of a terrorist group. Command and control of an enemy is a justifiable target, Leavy said. Senior administration official said they never discussed killing bin Laden in their planning session. His death, they said in interview after the attack, would simply have been a side benefit. US. intelligence official say they now believe that bin Laden wa in the camp on the day of the attack, but he appears to have left unscathed before the missile hit. Officials said there were report that at least one of his senior lieutenant may have died in the attack, and that total casualty in the complex were between 50 and 100. Administration spokesman have drawn a distinction between attempting to kill a specific person like bin Laden and attacking a group of people who command a terrorist organization. Administration official have denied since August that the raid wa intended to kill bin Laden, a Saudi exile who ha been charged by federal prosecutor with leading a global war against US. interest. He ha been linked to the Aug. 7 bombing of two US. embassy in East Africa. But a le subtle explanation wa offered on Oct. 13 by Defense Secretary William Cohen, who said during a visit to Saudi Arabia that the United States had been going after bin Laden and his colleague. We weren't quite successful, Cohen continued, but we sent a message. Kenneth Bacon, the Pentagon spokesman, said the secretary had not retracted his statement. The Los Angeles Times recently reported that the administration believed that it had a legal right to use deadly force against terrorist leader. Bin Laden's organization wa a significant concern for the Clinton administration even before the bombing of the US. embassy in East Africa. Last spring, official said, US. intelligence considered a daring raid into Afghanistan to capture the Saudi exile. Officials said that at roughly the same time, the White House drafted the legal justification for military attack against a terrorist leadership. That review, official said, provided the legal basis in August to fire cruise missile into the meeting at which it wa believed bin Laden and his lieutenant would be gathered. The review, by the National Security Council, wa the basis for saying this operation did not violate the presidential order banning assassination. That ban wa imposed by President Ford in 1975, after congressional investigator uncovered evidence that the CIA had plotted to assassinate Fidel Castro, the Cuban leader, and others. The order said: No person employed by, or acting on behalf of the United States government shall engage in, or conspire to engage in, assassination. While it is, on it face, a sweeping and unqualified ban, it ha been subject to interpretation and intense debate over the year. In 1986, the Reagan administration responded to a terrorist attack against US. soldier in Germany with a bombing raid on Libya.

6,"He wa the classic small-town prodigy, with the creativity of a big-city profiteer. When there wa no shot to take, he invented a new one. When there wa no one to pas to, he reconfigured the play until a teammate wa open. Larry Bird, in the Indiana countryside or inside Boston Garden, wa a luminous exception to the governing rule. That is why, six year after his retirement from the National Basketball Association, his name is again basketball's most prominent, beginning with his induction to the Hall of Fame before 7,000 Bird watcher at the Civic Center here on Friday night. Deservedly enshrined a forever exceptional, he again becomes Bird, the exception, the case study for a contentious and potentially disastrous labor war. No, not really, Bird said, when I asked whether he is troubled by the likelihood of his legendary name soon representing a symbol of greed to unsympathetic million. There's always a player's name attached to these thing. I know at the time I wa very happy about it. That would have been 1988, when the Celtics wanted to compensate Bird with a $4.9 million bonus to push through his back pain, go on a their savior. Three year later, in a contract arbitration involving the Knicks' Patrick Ewing, the agent David Falk would contend that the NBA conspired with the Celtics to circumvent the salary cap, in order to satisfy Bird. Alan Greenspan, I am sure, would agree that this salary cap is convoluted enough to give anyone a headache, so let's just say it is a cap that doe not exist when a team is negotiating with one of it own. The process of unsealing the cap to re-sign a particular player eventually became known a making use of the Larry Bird exception. And that is where we stand, a this onetime exception ha become the very expensive rule the owner don't want to play by anymore. I can understand both side, said Bird, safely in the middle, between Bird, the former exception, and Bird, the present Indiana Pacers' coach. Without getting into the exception, I think it's very important for player to stay in the same place. Important, he meant, for franchise stability and fan identification. You have a son who is 7 year old, he go from 7 to 17 in the 10 year you've played, Bird said. A lot of people in Boston told me that they had followed me, from the time they were very young to when they were in college. The Bird year numbered only three Celtics championship, but he wa the best player pro basketball's most famous team ever had. He and Magic Johnson created a basketball renaissance that began during a college title showdown in Salt Lake City and spread worldwide, like an infectious smile. They stood for the pas, for team play, but now their decade of selflessness ha given way to one of selfishness. The NBA of Michael Jordan reached greater height than anyone imagined it could, but it is a league that now suffers from a sickness of the soul. If Larry and Magic hadn't done what they did, we might not survive what we're about to go through, said Bill Fitch, Bird's first Celtics coach, who, with Bill Walton, stood with him on the night that, he said, gave closure to his playing career. The owner, a always, are exaggerating their misery, but this time, it is much easier to not root for the player. The president of the union is Ewing, who one day command player to boycott the world championship because the NBA's corporate fingerprint are on them, then the next day help himself to some television commentary work for David Stern's women's annex. Ewing lead the fight to protect the $100 million contract for 21-year-olds who have achieved not a single playoff victory, linked to the big payoff for agent like his friend Falk. The battle is waged in the name of a salary cap that make exception of the unexceptional, reward everyone a if they were Bird. I believe that in any field there ha to be an allowance for the truly special one, Walton said. But that group is very small. When I wa growing up in this sport, the only player who got the recognition were the champion, the one who always made you feel good about the game, about sport. That's how Larry and Magic played, always dreaming of the special team. It wasn't about hype, about money. That is not quite the case, nor should it have been. Bird wa a businessman's ball player from the day he arrived, with his flannel shirt and blue-collar ethic. He hired the late Bob Woolf, one of the original heavy-hitting agent, and got himself a record rookie contract. Then he went out and turned a 29-victory catastrophe into a 61-victory contender. A rare Bird, an honest exception to the rule. Despite modest encouragement over a new proposal delivered by the player to the owner, the National Basketball Association Tuesday canceled the first two week of the regular season, the first time in the league's 51-year history that it will lose game to a labor dispute. The NBA's deputy commissioner, Russ Granik, announced the cancellation after nearly three and a half hour of meeting concluded at a Manhattan hotel. The decision to cancel 99 game between Nov. 3 and Nov. 16 came after the player association proposed the implementation of a tax system instead of a hard salary cap, a proposal the owner said they would respond to by Friday. We tried our best today to try to do what wa possible to salvage the season, said Alonzo Mourning, the Miami Heat center. Unfortunately, it didn't work out. After 35,001 game without a blemish, the NBA now join the National Hockey League, the National Football League and Major League Baseball in having lost game to a labor dispute. Taking into account that a three- to four-week period would be needed for training camp and free-agent signing before the season start, the league said it would decide in two week whether to make further cancellation. I'm very sad and disappointed, said the NBA commissioner, David Stern. I consider it to be a collective failure, but I honestly don't know what else we could have done. I do thing that I like to think are in the best interest of the game. And I believe this is. The decision came after what both side agreed were the most substantive talk since the owner imposed a lockout on the player July 1. Seventeen player, including union president Patrick Ewing and vice president Mitch Richmond, Herb Williams, Dikemebe Mutombo and Ty Corbin, attended the meeting along with Stern, Granik and five member of the ownership committee Madison Square Garden president Dave Checketts and owner Abe Pollin of Washington, Gordon Gund of Cleveland, Les Alexander of Houston and Jerry Colangelo of Phoenix. The talk featured what the player association implied were a bevy concession made to the owner that they felt would accommodate the league's desire to swing the revenue pendulum back toward the owner. The dispute involves the distribution of approximately $2 billion in league-wide income. The main sticking point ha been the owners' insistence on a salary cap without exception, the implementation of which they believe would bring player salaries' in line with revenue growth. While the player did not discus the elimination of the Larry Bird exception a clause that allows a player to secure any amount of money he want in re-signing with his current team they did address the exception in their taxation proposal. The main point were a follows: A 50 percent tax would be imposed on salary earned above $18 million, a clause that would affect only a few player who exercised their Bird right. For example, if a player made $20 million, the team would be forced to put $1 million into a fund that would most likely be distributed to low-revenue team. There could be provision made for some player, said Jeffrey Kessler, the chief outside counsel for the union. We don't want to do anything that would encourage Chicago from getting Michael Jordan back. And I think the league feel the same way. The proposal is similar to the luxury tax proposed by the union in 1995 during negotiation, but it would not be nearly a liberal. A salary cap credit would go into effect if the league pay out more than 63 percent of revenue in salary. Whatever figure over that number reduces the salary cap the next year. If the figure wa $29 million over the salary cap, then the 29 team would work with a salary cap $1 million le than the previous season. But the player would have an assurance that the salary cap would go up at least $2 million before the credit go into effect. Also, if the 63-percent threshold is met, a reduction of annual 20 percent raise would take effect for multi-year contract. Players would either get raise of 10 percent or the rate of growth in league revenue. The union said this clearly address the league's desire to bring salary in line with revenue. Since the owner re-opened the current agreement because 57.1 percent of revenue wa going toward salary, the 63-percent figure would probably have to come down substantially for the owner to agree to such a proposal. Teams would get a right of first refusal on free agent after the fourth year for incoming rookie, meaning a player would be contractually obligated to the same team for the first four year of his deal. Currently, the rookie scale is three year and includes a clause that enables a player to exercise his Bird right after two season a clause Kevin Garnett parlayed into an astronomical $126 million deal last year with Minnesota. Finally, the player agreed to make marijuana a banned substance. Details of testing have not been negotiated and no specific discussion took place regarding testing for performance-enhancing drug, a provision the owner included in their last proposal. In return for the concession, the player want an increase in the minimum salary currently $272,500 and creation of an average salary exception. This would allow every team above the salary cap being able to sign one free agent per year for the average salary currently $2.6 million. We're buoyed by the fact for the first time they've decided to submit a counterproposal, the union's executive director, Billy Hunter, said. I don't know if I'm more optimistic, but I can earnestly say we can look our ballplayer in the eye and say we made a valiant effort. Asked if the player would finally be tested financially with the cancellation of game, Hunter added: It's not about u blinking. We want to reach an agreement. We're tired of the rhetoric, we're tired of the game-playing. Our position all along ha been we don't want to accept a bad deal. Granik said refund to fan would be made at end of the calendar month and that the first refund would include monies for canceled preseason game. He estimated the loss into the hundred of million of dollar. I think we have serious concern whether a tax system can address the kind of need we have economically, he added. But there's some possibility. Added Stern, We owe it to the fan to go back and look at the notion whether a tax rate might begin to achieve the result we wanted. It doesn't look promising, but we're going to spend the next two day to see if we can give a favorable response. Though the decision to cancel game wa not surprising, it did represent a major shift in prior labor stalemate. Both side reluctantly hammered out a deal in 1995 before the start of training camp with the sole notion of not missing game and preserving the NBA's perfect record. Tuesday, they could not come to such an accord. I'd like to think these our the last game we have to cancel, Granik said. But unless this or something else work, or there's some dramatic breakthrough, I think that is certainly not all of the season that's in jeopardy. In a decision that will almost certainly lead to the first work stoppage in National Basketball Association history, the league Monday announced the cancellation of all 114 preseason game. Citing stalled negotiation with the Players Association over a new collective bargaining agreement, league official said they would decide next week whether to cancel the first week of regular season game. While the decision had been expected for 10 day, it nonetheless sent a strong signal that the owner and player will probably be willing to cancel at least part of the regular season in order to settle their labor dispute. Both side agree that it would take at least three week to hold abbreviated training camp and sign over 200 free agent to new contract. Privately, official on both side do not believe the season will start a scheduled on Nov. 3 or even before December. Unlike Major League Baseball, the National Football League and the National Hockey League, the NBA ha never lost a regular-season game to labor strife. Since we're not even negotiating, you have to conclude it's very likely that we're going miss some part of the regular season, deputy commissioner Russ Granik said Monday night. We'll try and defer any decision until the last minute, but right now it doe not look good. The two side will meet on Thursday their first official bargaining session since Aug. 6. Commissioner David Stern and a group of owner walked out of a meeting after dismissing the merit of a new proposal from the player. Neither Granik nor player association executive director Billy Hunter sounded a if this week's meeting would go a long way toward the signing of a new agreement the precursor to playing again. I don't think you have any choice but to miss game at this point, Hunter said. In fact, I think the they've intended it all along. They've locked u out, they've refused to negotiate and they've given u a proposal that's ludicrous. Not only are both side still awaiting the outcome of an arbitration decision that is due before Oct. 18 - the Fordham Law School dean John Feerick will rule whether or not more than 200 player with $800 million in guaranteed contract should be paid during the lockout but the owner and player also are making time to win public opinion before they test their fans' loyalty by canceling game. Monday in 11 city throughout the country, the player are holding make-shift press conference at training-camp venue, NBA arena and gymnasium. Patrick Ewing, the union president, and several teammate will speak at SUNY-Purchase in Purchase, N.Y., where the Knicks train during the season. With training camp originally scheduled to open on Oct. 6, the message from the player is clear: if the owner would call an end to the lockout, we would be ready to play today. About 100 player are expected to attend, speak and sign autograph for fan afterward. I wish they would put their energy into trying to negotiate a deal rather than the various other thing that they've been doing, Granik said. The dispute is essentially over how the owner and player will judiciously divvy up $2 billion in income. It began last year with the contention by the owner that their employee were receiving more than their fair share of the pot. The owner were allowed to terminate the current agreement because of a clause that enabled them to do so after player salary reached 53.8 percent of total basketball-related income. The owner say that figure is currently hovering around 57.1 percent. Though many economic issue need to be resolved, the main point of contention since the labor agreement expired and the owner declared a lockout on July 1 ha been a clause which allows team to pay their own free agent whatever they want, regardless of salary-cap rule governing the NBA's 29 team. Called the Larry Bird exception, it wa created to allow the Hall of Fame Boston Celtics forward to re-sign with the Celtics near the end of his career. Michael Jordan exercised the clause the last two year with the Chicago Bulls, earning more than $30 million per season figure more than $5 million more what a team is allowed to spend on all it player. But with exorbitant salary paid to several unproven star over the last few year and $100 million deal sprouting up routinely, the owner are determined to swing the income pendulum back toward themselves by enforcing a restricted salary cap a hard cap and putting a ceiling on how much one player could earn. Last year, the player received about $1 billion dollar in salary and benefit and we have made proposal that are guaranteed to increase that number by 20 percent over the next four year, Granik said in a prepared statement. Our proposal would result in an average player salary of more than $3.1 million and a minimum salary for 10-year veteran of $750,000. Unfortunately, the union leadership ha been unwilling to give any serious consideration to what we have offered. Hunter labeled those claim a optimistic projection, and shot down a number of new proposal presented to the player on Sept. 25. If they had left the current deal in place, we would have gotten much of that anyway, he added. All we're saying is, we're not in position to accept a hard cap. Monday's decision to cancel the preseason came le than two week after the NBA indefinitely postponed training camp and canceled the first week of exhibition game. Through ticket sale alone, Granik estimated that losing the exhibition season would cost the league between $35 million and $40 million. Decisions about the cancellation of regular season game are expected to be made next week, he added. A league official said the game would be canceled in block of one or two week, depending upon circumstance regarding negotiation. Thursday's bargaining session ha suddenly become the last hope at starting the season on time. Hurdles could be overcome very quickly, but I have no reason to believe they will on Thursday, Granik said. Added Hunter: Of course they don't expect much to get done. When Russ and David decide the negotiation are going to be real and substantive, then something will happen. What they're banking on now is that the player are going to miss paycheck and cave in November. It's a if they've ingested something that ha to pas. And once it pass, then they'll negotiate. The first substantive talk in more than two month between opposing side of the National Basketball Association's labor dispute came and went Thursday without a hint of a settlement. Still, a five-hour meeting that wa described a cordial by the league and almost like two bull letting off a little steam by the player association produced another scheduled round of talk next Tuesday. Barring a major compromise, that will not be enough time to preserve a full season and prevent the league from losing it first regular-season game to labor strife in November. Russ Granik, the NBA's deputy commissioner, said the league would wait until after next week's meeting before deciding to cancel regular-season game. He also discussed the possibility of a significantly shortened season. We haven't made a determination that you need this exact number of game in order to have a representative season, Granik said. But we recognize that beyond a certain point we can't possibly sell to our fan that we're having an NBA season. Whether's that 60 game, 50 game or 49 or 53, we're not there yet. We have a few month before we have to face that decision. Perhaps the only progress involved Thursday in the conference room of a midtown Manhattan hotel wa a question-and-answer session over the league's latest proposal to the player. Patrick Ewing, the union president, and vice president Herb Williams and Dikembe Mutombo attended the meeting with the union's executive director, Billy Hunter, and union lawyer. No owner were present, but Granik, Commissioner David Stern and the league's lawyer spent most of the day explaining the intricacy of a two-week-old proposal to the player. At one point before the two party broke for lunch, Stern and Hunter raised their voice and accused each other of handling their constituency poorly, a participant in the meeting said. But the two were seen shaking hand and laughing after the meeting concluded shortly after 3 pm. There wa some venting from both side, Hunter said. We've been placid and very respectful. Today, we took the coat off and we were inclined to take the glove off a little bit. Having done that, I think it kind of loosened up both side. Hunter added: Did anybody blink today? They're sort of look at u for any kind of nuance they can find during the course of negotiation that might, in some way or another, give some indication that while we're mouthing one thing we might be open to something else. We're looking at their body language, too. I don't think that they're ready to make a deal. The last formal meeting between both side on Aug. 6 ended when Stern and the owner abruptly marched out after they had received a proposal from the player. In a critical ruling for the North American National Basketball Association and the players' union, arbitrator John Feerick decides Monday whether more than 200 player with guaranteed contract should be paid during the lockout. If the player win, the owner will be liable for about dlrs 800 million in guaranteed salary, although they have vowed to appeal if they lose. The league already ha sued the player over Feerick's jurisdiction. If we win, I think it just emboldens the spirit and resolve of the player, union director Billy Hunter said. But I don't think there will be anybody celebrating because there's no guarantee that it will end the lockout. It only mean they have to pay some 200 player, and they've indicated to u their intent to file an immediate appeal and take it a far a they have to in order to avoid payment. So even if he doe rule in our favor, at most it's a hollow victory. The player aren't going to get paid Nov. 15 in any circumstance, Hunter said. If the owner win, it will remove the last wild card the player had been holding. The side have not negotiated since last Tuesday, when the union proposed a superstar tax on the highest contract. The league made a counterproposal Friday, asking that the tax be imposed with a much lower threshold. Hunter dismissed the league's latest proposal on Friday afternoon, then said both side would be best served by awaiting Feerick's ruling. It's unlikely any negotiation will be held this week, since the union is holding a meeting for all NBA player and the agent advisory committee in Las Vegas from Wednesday through Friday. We've got to get a sense of where the player are, what they consider to be reasonable and what they're willing to do in order to get the season to commence, Hunter said. The union filed a grievance with Feerick before the lockout wa imposed July 1 over the owners' announcement June 29 that they would not honor guaranteed deal. In a six-day hearing over the summer, the union argued that owner should have protected themselves from being liable for guaranteed salary during a work stoppage by inserting lockout language into the standard player contract. The Sacramento Kings inserted a lockout clause into center Olden Polynice's contract in 1994, and it wa approved by the league. The union used the existence of that clause to argue that all the other team should have protected themselves similarly. Most player are due to receive their first paycheck Nov. 15, although a dozen or so had clause entitling them to be paid over the summer. None ha received a paycheck. The NBA argued that a tenet of labor law allows employer to withhold pay from employee during a lockout. The league also called former union director Simon Gourdine to testify. He said it wa his understanding when he negotiated the old labor agreement in 1995 that player would not be paid if the owner chose to reopen the agreement and impose a lockout. More than 220 National Basketball Association player with guaranteed contract will find out Monday whether they are to be paid during the management lockout, a long-awaited arbitrator's decision that may affect leverage in the league's dispute with the player and have major ramification on American sports-labor law. But neither the player nor the owner are counting on the ruling by the arbitrator, John Feerick, to speed up negotiation, especially if Feerick find in favor of the player, an award that could approach $800 million in salary. NBA attorney have indicated to the union that if the decision go against management, they will seek to have it vacated by appealing to the US. District Court in Manhattan and then, if necessary, to the 2nd US. Circuit Court of Appeals, a process that could prevent the player from getting paid for several month. The NBA ha already canceled the first two week of the regular season because of the labor dispute. The league ha other litigation pending in US. District Court in Manhattan. If the player win the ruling, the NBA intends to renew it motion to disqualify Feerick. The motion wa brought last summer on the ground that no collective bargaining agreement existed and, therefore, he had no jurisdiction to hear the matter. If he rule in our favor, I think it emboldens the spirit and the resolve of the player, said Billy Hunter, union executive director. But we understand that won't end the lockout. It just mean they have to pay 200-some player. And there is still other litigation alive that may take a while to resolve. At most, it's a hollow victory. Feerick will have taken the full 30 day to render his decision. Whatever he decides, his ruling will be watched carefully. There is no precedent for locked-out athlete being paid. During the NBA summer lockout of 1995, player who missed paycheck did not file a grievance. Neither did National Hockey League player who were locked out for the first three month of the 1994-95 season. The union argued that owner should have protected themselves by inserting clause about non-payment for lockout and strike into individual player contract. In support of it argument, the union pointed to clause in a few individual player contract that contained language precluding payment during a lockout. The league is relying on the basic tenet of labor law, which hold that employee not be paid during strike or lockout. A ruling for the union would be significant for all future negotiation between player and owner. The deterrent factor of a lockout is that employee subject to a collective bargaining agreement do not get paid once the agreement expires and they are unable to reach a new agreement. If Feerick find in favor of the player, there will be no economic incentive for those with guaranteed contract to reach an agreement quickly. They would essentially be paid for not playing basketball. If Feerick find in favor of the owner, the reality of not being paid may spur the player to reach an agreement more quickly. But Hunter disputed this notion, and in a conference call Friday talked openly about the entire season's being canceled before the player would back away from their ultimate goal. I'm not at all concerned, Hunter said. There's been no demonstration that there's going to be a change in our resolve. After the player saw these proposal from the league and the recent posturing by NBA owner, well, I had two player call me up and tell me, if need be, they'd be willing to hock everything they've got. Another significant development may be thedeparture of many player to Europe until the dispute is settled, according to at least two player agent. I think it would be a case-by-case basis, but yes, there's already some people talking about that, said Bill Strickland, a member of the union's agent advisory committee. Steve Kauffman, another member of the committee, said he would explore the possibility that one client, Nets center Rony Seikaly, would sign with a professional team in Greece. We wouldn't look to void his deal with the team, Kauffman said. But we would want him to have the right for him to work temporarily until he could come back and honor his contract.' Russ Granik, NBA deputy commissioner, said the league ha approved the idea of players' earning a living elsewhere until the lockout is settled. Proposals exchanged last week that included the concept of a luxury-tax system on player salary appeared to reflect the first sign of progress in negotiation since the lockout began July 1. But both side have termed the figure in each other's proposal a unacceptable, and it wa unclear whether either side wa willing compromise. I don't think we should get too carried away about the possibility just yet, Granik said. When they explored the idea of a tax system, we were taking the player at their word that they wanted to make some headway. But to call their first proposal meaningless is charitable. They proposed something that ha no impact. As it stand, that can't be the solution. The owners' goal is to slow the growth of player salary in relation to leaguewide revenue over the next three year, while the player want to keep earning a much a possible. As labor battle go, the current one between the National Basketball Association and it player is weird even by sport standard. There is a real possibility that most, if not all, of the coming season will be canceled. In this union battle it is the interest of the best paid, not those who make union scale, that are dominating the discussion. And here it is some of the worker, not the management, who are considering trying to make the union disappear. The current arrangement ha produced an unbalanced pay scale of immense proportion. Last year more player than ever before received the union minimum, then $242,000 for rookie or $272,000 for veteran. The number of player making $1 million to $2 million a year the middle class, in NBA term fell sharply. But Michael Jordan made $33 million. This should not be a surprise. Sports is an entertainment business, not unlike movie. Big star get million, while most get union scale. Over the year, NBA effort to stem the rise of salary have failed. The most important loophole in it salary cap let a team sign it own free agent for whatever it is willing to pay. When that wa adopted, it wa assumed that no team would pay a lot more than a rival could pay. But it ha not worked out that way. In the current negotiation, the league ha offered to guarantee that it payroll will rise 20 percent over the next four year, from $1 billion to $1.2 billion, and say it is open to proposal to split that money any way the player want, whether by raising the minimum salary or guaranteeing raise for veteran. The union say it is worried about that middle class, but seems determined to preserve the free market. The league got it broadcaster, NBC and Time Warner's cable channel, to agree to pay this year's television fee whether or not there are any game to broadcast. (They will be paid back in later year, either through reduced fee or extra game to show.) Owners hoped the player would think management wa willing to wait them out, and come to term with only a small part of the season canceled. But the union is acting unhurried. It turned aside request for negotiation this week, saying the player had to meet first. Then there is the issue of union suicide, a tactic that wa rejected by the player in 1995. The idea is that if the player had no union, it would be illegal under antitrust law for the owner to collude. The sky would be the limit. That tactic might fail. The court could reject a union decertification vote a a sham, and in any case some player may fear that team would feel free to offer le than the old union minimum. But if the player go that route, it could be a long time before real negotiation get going. Billy Hunter, the union's executive director, warned the owner this week that a prolonged lockout could destroy the league's popularity. That wa what all the seer said four year ago, when baseball's World Series wa canceled by labor trouble. But fan memory are relatively short, and now baseball seems more popular than ever. With that in mind, both owner and player may choose to battle on for month. In a critical ruling for the North American National Basketball Association and the players' union, arbitrator John Feerick decides Monday whether more than 200 player with guaranteed contract should be paid during the lockout. If the player win, the owner will be liable for about dlrs 800 million in guaranteed salary, although they have vowed to appeal if they lose. The league already ha sued the player over Feerick's jurisdiction. If we win, I think it just emboldens the spirit and resolve of the player, union director Billy Hunter said. But I don't think there will be anybody celebrating because there's no guarantee that it will end the lockout. It only mean they have to pay some 200 player, and they've indicated to u their intent to file an immediate appeal and take it a far a they have to in order to avoid payment. So even if he doe rule in our favor, at most it's a hollow victory. The player aren't going to get paid Nov. 15 in any circumstance, Hunter said. If the owner win, it will remove the last wild card the player had been holding. The side have not negotiated since last Tuesday, when the union proposed a superstar tax on the highest contract.

In a six-day hearing over the summer, the union argued that owner should have protected themselves from being liable for guaranteed salary during a work stoppage by inserting lockout language into the standard player contract. The Sacramento Kings inserted a lockout clause into center Olden Polynice's contract in 1994, and it wa approved by the league. The union used the existence of that clause to argue that all the other team should have protected themselves similarly. Most player are due to receive their first paycheck Nov. 15, although a dozen or so had clause entitling them to be paid over the summer. None ha received a paycheck. The NBA argued that a tenet of labor law allows employer to withhold pay from employee during a lockout. The league also called former union director Simon Gourdine to testify, but Feerick upheld union objection and prohibited Gourdine from saying whether it wa his understanding when he negotiated the old labor agreement in 1995 that player would not be paid if the owner chose to reopen the agreement and impose a lockout. Patrick Ewing did not want to sound like a striking longshoreman demanding health benefit. I'm not going to try and put it in dollar and cent. But Ewing, president of the National Basketball Association Players Association, played the public-relations game Tuesday by expounding on the theme of labor unrest: strong-willed unity and short-sighted proposal. On the day when training camp were scheduled to begin, player from across the country held news conference in 14 NBA city to proclaim themselves ready to practice for the regular season. We want to show the public that we, a player, want to play, said Ewing, who wa flanked by five teammate. Today is supposed to be the start of training camp. We want to practice and we want the season to start. But unfortunately, the owner have locked u out and the season ha been postponed. The owner and player are scheduled hold their first bargaining session since Aug. 6 on Thursday in Manhattan. Neither side is predicting progress toward signing a new collective bargaining agreement and beginning the season a scheduled on Nov. 3. The league canceled the entire 114-game preseason on Monday. Next week, it will consider canceling the first-ever regular season game in league history. With wide philosophical difference on how $2 billion annual income should be distributed, both side have privately said they don't expect to play a regular season game before December. Billy Hunter, the union's executive director, offered a glimmer of hope. He spoke optimistically about the potential for a quick resolution. Standing a few foot away from Ewing, he said, I hope the owner and commissioner have gotten the message: that we're serious about a deal. I'm prepared to make a quantum leap. I don't think we're that far off. I think there's a lot jockeying, a lot of rhetoric and a lot of game being played. But if and when the owner decide they want a deal, then they'll get one. But soon after, he began lambasting the owners' latest proposal, which includes the eventual phasing out of the Larry Bird exception the clause that enables free agent to earn unlimited salary from their current team. That clause represents the major rift in negotiation. Owners would like to implement a restrictive salary cap that would eventually put a ceiling on how much one player can earn. I don't know if this is going to come to a speedy resolution, Ewing said. They're entrenched with what they want, which is a hard cap. And we feel with a hard cap, we a player, cannot survive. We would have to be stupid and ignorant to accept that deal. Said Hunter, If you go for their proposal, it's just a joke. It's a step backwards. I cannot understand it. If the intent wa to reach an agreement at this late stage or to negotiate in earnest, this wa the wrong way to go about it. League official did not respond to the players' comment. All we want is our fair share and we feel like they're trying to take that away from u, Ewing said. `There's a perception that we're on strike. It's the other way around. We've been locked out. Besides Ewing, the other Knicks included former union president Buck Williams, former vice president Herb Williams, Allan Houston and John Starks. Marcus Camby also showed up briefly. When the medium horde closed in, however, the third-year forward went to look for his late-arriving teammate inside the practice facility. He wa stopped at the gym door, which wa locked. They locked u out, said Rockets forward Mario Elie. Everybody's got to get that corrected. It's not on u. They're the one that closed u down. The stalemate ha elicited talk of possibly bringing in a mediator in the coming week, a Major League Baseball did in 1994 to help solve it labor dispute. But the player are convinced commissioner David Stern and the owner are set on testing their resolve before any genuine headway can be made in negotiation. That mean missing paycheck in November, something Ewing said the player are prepared to do. Both side are still awaiting the outcome of an arbitration decision that is due before Oct. 18. Fordham Law School dean John Feerick will rule whether or not more than 200 player with $800 million in guaranteed contract should be paid during the lockout. Feerick's decision could give new leverage to one side. But if the player lose the arbitration, more than 400 athlete many with extravagant lifestyle and tremendous financial obligation will have their allegiance instantly tested. It's like they want to see how strong we are, Ewing said. Based on the proposal we've received, we're very strong. So far, it seems a though the NBA is dug in on their position, Buck Williams said. I don't think they're too concerned at this point about making a deal. He added, We're about a far apart a the Grand Canyon right now. The National Basketball Association, embroiled in a labor dispute with it player, Tuesday canceled the first two week of the 1998-99 season. It is the first time in the league's 51-year history that it will lose regular-season game. The NBA's deputy commissioner, Russ Granik, announced the cancellation after nearly three and a half hour of meeting concluded at a Manhattan hotel. The decision to cancel 99 game between Nov. 3 and Nov. 16 came after the player association proposed the implementation of a tax system instead of a hard salary cap, a proposal the owner said they would respond to by Friday. We tried our best today to try to do what wa possible to salvage the season, said Alonzo Mourning, the Miami Heat center. Unfortunately, it didn't work out. After 35,001 game without a blemish, the NBA now join the National Hockey League, the National Football League and Major League Baseball in having lost game to a labor dispute. Taking into account that a three- to four-week period would be needed for training camp and free-agent signing before the season start, the league said it would decide in two week whether to make further cancellation. I'm very sad and disappointed, said the NBA commissioner, David Stern. I consider it to be a collective failure, but I honestly don't know what else we could have done. I do thing that I like to think are in the best interest of the game. And I believe this is. The decision came after what both side agreed were the most substantive talk since the owner imposed a lockout on the player July 1. Seventeen player, including union president Patrick Ewing and vice president Mitch Richmond, Herb Williams, Dikemebe Mutombo and Ty Corbin, attended the meeting along with Stern, Granik and five member of the ownership committee Madison Square Garden president Dave Checketts and owner Abe Pollin of Washington, Gordon Gund of Cleveland, Les Alexander of Houston and Jerry Colangelo of Phoenix. The talk featured what the player association implied were a bevy concession made to the owner that they felt would accommodate the league's desire to swing the revenue pendulum back toward the owner. The dispute involves the distribution of approximately $2 billion in league-wide income. The main sticking point ha been the owners' insistence on a salary cap without exception, the implementation of which they believe would bring player salaries' in line with revenue growth. While the player did not discus the elimination of the Larry Bird exception a clause that allows a player to secure any amount of money he want in re-signing with his current team they did address the exception in their taxation proposal. The main point were a follows: A 50 percent tax would be imposed on salary earned above $18 million, a clause that would affect only a few player who exercised their Bird right. For example, if a player made $20 million, the team would be forced to put $1 million into a fund that would most likely be distributed to low-revenue team. There could be provision made for some player, said Jeffrey Kessler, the chief outside counsel for the union. We don't want to do anything that would encourage Chicago from getting Michael Jordan back. And I think the league feel the same way. The proposal is similar to the luxury tax proposed by the union in 1995 during negotiation, but it would not be nearly a liberal. A salary cap credit would go into effect if the league pay out more than 63 percent of revenue in salary. Whatever figure over that number reduces the salary cap the next year. If the figure wa $29 million over the salary cap, then the 29 team would work with a salary cap $1 million le than the previous season. But the player would have an assurance that the salary cap would go up at least $2 million before the credit go into effect. Also, if the 63-percent threshold is met, a reduction of annual 20 percent raise would take effect for multi-year contract. Players would either get raise of 10 percent or the rate of growth in league revenue. The union said this clearly address the league's desire to bring salary in line with revenue. Since the owner re-opened the current agreement because 57.1 percent of revenue wa going toward salary, the 63-percent figure would probably have to come down substantially for the owner to agree to such a proposal. Teams would get a right of first refusal on free agent after the fourth year for incoming rookie, meaning a player would be contractually obligated to the same team for the first four year of his deal. Currently, the rookie scale is three year and includes a clause that enables a player to exercise his Bird right after two season a clause Kevin Garnett parlayed into an astronomical $126 million deal last year with Minnesota. Finally, the player agreed to make marijuana a banned substance. Details of testing have not been negotiated and no specific discussion took place regarding testing for performance-enhancing drug, a provision the owner included in their last proposal. In return for the concession, the player want an increase in the minimum salary currently $272,500 and creation of an average salary exception. This would allow every team above the salary cap being able to sign one free agent per year for the average salary currently $2.6 million. We're buoyed by the fact for the first time they've decided to submit a counterproposal, the union's executive director, Billy Hunter, said. I don't know if I'm more optimistic, but I can earnestly say we can look our ballplayer in the eye and say we made a valiant effort. Asked if the player would finally be tested financially with the cancellation of game, Hunter added: It's not about u blinking. We want to reach an agreement. We're tired of the rhetoric, we're tired of the game-playing. Our position all along ha been we don't want to accept a bad deal. Granik said refund to fan would be made at end of the calendar month and that the first refund would include monies for canceled preseason game. He estimated the loss into the hundred of million of dollar. I think we have serious concern whether a tax system can address the kind of need we have economically, he added. But there's some possibility. Added Stern, We owe it to the fan to go back and look at the notion whether a tax rate might begin to achieve the result we wanted. It doesn't look promising, but we're going to spend the next two day to see if we can give a favorable response. Though the decision to cancel game wa not surprising, it did represent a major shift in prior labor stalemate. Both side reluctantly hammered out a deal in 1995 before the start of training camp with the sole notion of not missing game and preserving the NBA's perfect record. Tuesday, they could not come to such an accord. I'd like to think these our the last game we have to cancel, Granik said. But unless this or something else work, or there's some dramatic breakthrough, I think that is certainly not all of the season that's in jeopardy.

7,"Congolese rebel have taken their two-month campaign to oust President Laurent Kabila to the Internet. We have to explain to the world audience who we are and what we're fighting for, rebel leader Ernest Wamba dia Wamba said on Friday. Besides, the (Kabila) government ha been using the Internet to tell their side of the story. The 56-year-old history professor at the University of Dar e Salaam in Tanzania said supporter of the Congolese Rally for Democracy in the United States have created a web site for the rebellion. The site www.prairienet.org/panafrican/cdm ha been set up on the donor-supported Prairenet Community Network in eastern Illinois. The rebel are a coalition of ethnic Tutsis, disenchanted member of Kabila's army and political opponent who accuse Kabila of power-grabbing, mismanagement, corruption and sowing dissent among Congo's 400 tribe. After an initial lightning advance in the far west of Africa's third-largest nation, the rebel were stopped at the outskirt of the capital, Kinshasa, by troop from Angola, Zimbabwe and Namibia, who are backing Kabila. Since then, the rebel have been confined to a chunk of territory in the extreme eastern part of the country where their rebellion wa declared Aug. 2. Wamba said the rebel control 40 percent of Congo, an area of 15 million people. So far, Kabila ha refused to negotiate with the rebel, accusing them of being the puppet of neighboring Rwanda and Uganda. Posting the rebel mission statement on the Internet is just part of the medium campaign. Last week, Wamba dispatched two of his top aide to the United States and Europe to lobby for political support and raise public awareness about the conflict in Congo. World leader, diplomat and are not familiar enough with our cause. They still talk about Tutsis leading the rebellion. Well, I'm not a Tutsi, Wamba said. Jacques Depelchin, the movement's vice president and a former lecturer at the University of California at Berkeley, met in Washington earlier this week with the US. special envoy in the Great Lakes region of Central Africa, Howard Wolpe and with congressman, Wamba said. Rebels in eastern Congo on Saturday said they shot down a passenger jet ferrying 40 government soldier into a strategic airport facing a rebel assault. A Congo Airlines executive said the victim were civilian being evacuated from Kindu, about 1,000 kilometer (620 mile) east of the capital, Kinshasa. Neither claim could be confirmed independently. Stavros Papaioannou, the president of the airline's management committee, said a missile hit the rear engine of the Boeing jet after the aircraft took off from Kindu airport. A rebel military commander, who requested anonymity, said the plane wa carrying troop, although he did not explain how he knew this. He said the plane wa shot down while approaching Kindu air base, where the rebel had deployed at least two surface-to-air missile and more than 3,500 troop in preparation for a final assault on the government-held town. Alexis Tambwe Mwamba, one of rebel leader, said from the rebel stronghold at Goma, 380 kilometer (235 mile) northeast of Kalima, that fighter had intercepted government radio message in Kindu and knew in advance of the arrival of the aircraft. He said the government had been using the Boeing 727 to fly in troop and ammunition in Kindu for several day. Papaioannou, citing, 6th graf pvs After a day of fighting, Congolese rebel said Sunday they had entered Kindu, the strategic town and airbase in eastern Congo used by the government to halt their advance. Etienne Ngangura, a rebel spokesman, said the rebel fighter were inside Kindu and had taken the adjacent, large airbase, 380 kilometer (235 mile) west of Goma, the rebel stronghold. We're in the town and the airport, Ngangura said. He offered no detail and the report could not be confirmed independently. Rebel military source said the fighting continued inside Kindu where the rebel were apparently meeting stiff resistance. The rebel ethnic Tutsis, disenchanted member of President Laurent Kabila's army and opposition politician took up arm Aug. 2 accusing Kabila of mismanagement, corruption and creating division among Congo's 400 tribe. The rebel have targeted Kindu since late August, when they were forced to retreat from the outskirt of the capital, Kinshasa, after troop from Angola and Zimbabwe came to Kabila's aid. Troops moving south from Kisangani, the largest city under rebel control, and moving west, had made steady gain against Kindu, which the government apparently used to build up force for a planned counter-offensive. Apart from Kindu, Ngangura said rebel fighter took Buta, 120 kilometer (75 mile) north of Kisangani and on the main road in northern Congo that link Sudan and the Central African Republic. Also on Sunday, Ngangura said the rebel took Bumba, 400 kilometer (250 mile) northwest of Kisangani. These report could not be confirmed independently either. Rebel leader said a victory at Kindu would confirm rebel strength, boost fighters' morale and perhaps persuade others to join them. The rebel want direct negotiation with Kabila. But the president ha so far refused, accusing the rebel of being puppet of Rwanda and Uganda, which Kabila ha accused of orchestrating the rebellion. The conflict in Central Africa ha drawn in most of Congo's nine neighbor, and regional diplomatic initiative have so far failed to stop it. The bloody bandage of injured rebel trucked back to this rear base Wednesday offered evidence that the three-day battle for the strategic air base at Kindu wa not going well for those fighting to oust Congolese President Laurent Kabila. It wa impossible to say who had the upper hand in the battle for Kindu and it air base, which government force have been using to launch airstrikes on eastern town and to assemble ground troop. Rebel commander Richard Mondo said shelling and ground attack, which began Monday, continued on Wednesday. Mondo said he wa expecting air shipment of munition to bolster the rebel offensive. On Wednesday, a truck unloaded a dozen wounded rebel fighter at Kalima, a small town 80 kilometer (50 mile) northeast of Kindu, serving a a rear base for the attack. Sweaty and weary, some limping and others bandaged, they waited to be airlifted to a hospital in Goma, the rebel stronghold 380 kilometer (235 mile) east, on the Rwandan border. The rebel a coalition of ethnic Tutsis, disenchanted soldier in Kabila's army and opposition politician faced stiff resistance. In Kinshasa, the Ministry of Defense said Tuesday that the Congolese Armed Forces, known a the FAC, had killed 18 rebel in warding off the attack. Kindu is effectively in the hand of the FAC, which ha now launched an offensive after defending it position, said a ministry statement broadcast on state-run television. The civilian there are cooperating fully with the FAC a their counterpart did previously in Kinshasa, the capital. Rebel leader hope the capture of Kindu will boost morale and demonstrate can carry their two-month rebellion into the rest of Congo, Africa's third-largest nation. The rebel victory would also open route to Katanga and Eastern Kasai province, rich in copper and diamond. The rebel targeted Kindu since late August, when they were forced to retreat their march from extreme western Congo to the outskirt of Kinshasa after Angola and Zimbabwe sent troop to bail out Kabila. Rebel commander say their 2,000 fighter face an estimated 5,000 government troop, apparently reinforced by Sudanese soldier. Sudan denies involvement in Congo. The rebel accuse Kabila of betraying the eight-month rebellion that brought him to power in May 1997 through mismanagement and creating division among Congo's 400 tribe. Rebels attacked a village in western Uganda and killed six civilian before soldier drove them off, a military spokesman said Thursday. The attack occurred overnight Wednesday in the village of Chiondo near Kasese, 270 kilometer (170 mile) west of the capital Kampala, said the spokesman, who identified himself only a Lt. Majera. Majera said the attacker were believed to be rebel of the Allied Democratic Forces who operate from base in the foothill of the Rwenzori Mountains that straddle the Uganda-Congolese border. He said the rebel likely fled back to their base after the attack. Majera said the attacker avoided a nearby army post when they shot up the village. It wa the gunfire that alerted the soldier, he said, adding that they killed two of the assailant. The various rebel group operating in the region often attack with knife or machete, either to save on ammunition or because they don't have gun. He had no further detail. Under an agreement earlier this year with Congo, Uganda sent troop into the neighboring country to flush out the ADF fighter. President Yoweri Museveni insists they will remain there until Ugandan security is guaranteed, despite Congolese President Laurent Kabila's protest that Uganda is backing Congolese rebel attempting to topple him. The anti-Kabila rebel claim the Ugandan rebel Lord's Resistance Army, which operates in northern Uganda and enjoys support from Sudan, is fighting alongside Kabila's force together with Sudanese soldier. The government-owned daily New Vision reported Thursday that LRA leader Joseph Kony wa badly wounded last week and is in hospital in Juba, the largest town still under government control in southern Sudan. The Sudan People's Liberation Army, which is fighting the government in Khartoum for autonomy for southern Sudan, ha waged pitched battle with government troop in the past week a it move on Juba, spokesman for both side say. New Vision quoted Ugandan Minister of State for Security Muruli Mukasa a saying Kony's largest camp at al-Gabelain, 38 kilometer (24 mile) south of Juba, wa destroyed last week when the SPLA took control. Muruli said the LRA had been planning to bomb several site in the Ugandan capital, including the Parliament building, state-run Radio Uganda, unidentified embassy and other public site, the newspaper said. A day after shooting down a jetliner carrying 40 people, rebel clashed with government troop near a strategic airstrip in eastern Congo on Sunday. Fighting for the town of Kindu in this vast West African nation subsided after rebel launched an artillery barrage into government-held building and the airfield, two mile (three kilometer) away. On Saturday, the rebel shot down a Congolese Boeing 727 over the Kindu airport. Rescue worker said there were no survivor from the downed plane, the British Broadcasting Corp. reported Sunday. Rebels said the airplane wa carrying 40 troop and ammunition. In the capital, Kinshasa, the private Congolese Airlines, which owned the aircraft, said the victim were civilian fleeing fighting in Kindu. It wa not possible to confirm either claim independently. Rebel commander Fino Kabangu Kalunga said surface-to-air missile in the arsenal of his Congolese Democratic Coalition had prevented the government from landing aircraft at the airport. Kabangu Kalunga said 3,500 rebel troop and their Rwandan ally had closed in on government force from three direction after a week of fighting. He said government troop did not launch a counterattack to Sunday's barrage, and some reportedly retreated on the one road leading out of town. The rebel say they now control one-third of Kindu, which the government ha used a a staging area for a counteroffensive against rebel position in the east. Rebels, who began their insurgency more than two month ago, accuse President Laurent Kabila of corruption, failing to carry out promised democratic reform, and stirring up hatred among Congo's 400 tribe. Early in the conflict, rebel pushed far into the west, to the outskirt of Congo's capital. Then Angola, Zimbabwe and Namibia intervened to help Kabila and drove the rebel back to their base in eastern Congo. The conflict ha drawn in many of Congo's neighbor. There are unconfirmed report that troop from Chad and the Sudan are involved in defending Kindu. Kabila accuses Rwanda and Uganda former ally who installed him in power in May 1997 after an eight-month rebellion of sponsoring the rebel. Both country say they have legitimate security interest in eastern Congo and accuse Kabila of failing to rid the common border area of Rwandan and Ugandan rebel. Back in the golden year, Kasuku wa Ngeyo had a farm and wa the head of a 25,000-strong farmer organization in the northeastern breadbasket of this central African nation. A quarter of a century later, the 56-year-old businessman who also ran hotel and a tourist camp is broke; the farmer group is a memory. Inter-tribal rivalry, looting soldier, Rwandan refugee and two rebellion in a many year have wiped out half a million head of cattle here, slashed coffee and tea export in half and turned Congo's bucolic eastern region of green pasture, sparkling volcanic lake and snow-capped mountain into a war zone. Nobody is making money any more. People are surviving on a sack of bean. They are tired of insecurity and have little hope thing will get better, said Kasuku, the son of an Italian settler and a Rwandan Tutsi refugee mother. On Aug. 2, Tutsis, political opponent, and disenchanted member of President Laurent Kabila's army took up arm, accusing Kabila of corruption, nepotism and fostering tribal strife. The war ha split Africa's third-largest nation between the government-held west and south and rebel-controlled east, and no political settlement is in sight. Goma, a small trading post at the head of Lake Kivu in eastern Congo, is no longer the starting point for tourist trekking to see mountain gorilla. Today, it decaying building, empty shop and crumbling guest house are home to rebel leader, soldier and people displaced by violence. The rebel have promised to revitalize the economy by reducing tax to boost investment. They also say they will pay civil servant who haven't seen a paycheck in month or year and invite investor to buy tea and coffee farm and gold and diamond-mining concession. But the war ha also increased tribal animosity especially toward ethnic Tutsis, a tiny but highly successful minority in the eastern region. In 1990, the liberating effect of early political freedom revived unresolved land dispute and led to clash between the Rwandan Tutsis and Hutus who had settled in eastern Congo since the 1930s. Mai-Mai warrior armed youth from the Hunde and Nande tribe who accuse Tutsis of stealing their land, also joined the fighting. In 1994, nearly 1 million Rwandan refugee engulfed Goma, a town of 30,000. Among them were former Hutu soldier and militiaman who took part in a 1994 genocide in neighboring Rwanda in which more than half a million Tutsis were killed. They brought anti-Tutsi ideology with them and sold weapon to Congolese tribe, who then joined in the persecution of Tutsi landowner and rancher. People misunderstood political freedom for anarchy, said Safari Ngezayo, a farmer and hotel owner. We tried to mediate between Tutsis and Hutus and other tribe, but how can you talk to people who have blood on their hand and genocide in their head? In late 1996, Congolese Tutsis backed by Rwanda attacked the refugee camp, dislodged the Hutu fighter and forced most of the refugee back home across the border. After an eight-month rebellion backed by Rwanda and Uganda, dictator Mobutu Sese Seko fled in May 1997, and Kabila took power. He quickly changed the name of the country to Congo, from Zaire. Few people in northeastern Congo expected another rebellion so soon. I blame our politician. Then I blame the foreign power who kept meddling in our affair. It is they who supported Mobutu and Kabila, and we are paying the interest, Kasuku said. Congolese rebel have taken their two-month campaign to oust President Laurent Kabila to the Internet. We have to explain to the world audience who we are and what we're fighting for, rebel leader Ernest Wamba dia Wamba said on Friday. Besides, the (Kabila) government ha been using the Internet to tell their side of the story.

Rebel commander said Tuesday they were poised to overrun an important government-held air base in eastern Congo a battle that could determine the future of the two-month Congolese war. After trekking several hundred kilometer (miles) through dense tropical forest, thousand of rebel fighter have gathered 19 kilometer (11 mile) outside Kindu, where troop loyal to President Laurent Kabila have used an air base a a launching pad for offensive. If the rebel succeed in capturing Kindu, 380 kilometer (235 mile) west of Goma, the rebel headquarters, this will remove the last government stronghold in eastern Congo and pave the way for rebel advance into the mineral-rich southwest. A rebel defeat, on the other hand, would put the coalition of ethnic Tutsis, disenchanted member of the Congolese army and opposition politician on the defensive and give a boost to Kabila's effort to fend off the rebellion launched Aug. 2. Rebel commander Richard Mondo said troop had fired artillery round into Kindu Monday and early Tuesday, sending the population fleeing out of town. Advance unit had crossed the Lualaba River from the north and were meeting stiff resistance in the town, he said. Since the assault on the town began at 3 am. (0100 GMT), at least 18 enemy soldier were killed and 40 taken prisoner, Mondo said, adding the number wa expected to rise. The rebel took casualty, too, but the number wa not known. One rebel soldier wa wounded in the stomach, he said. He said the large Kindu air base, 4 kilometer (2 mile) outside town, wa deserted and no one appeared to be in control. Our soldier are in the town and the fighting is continuing, rebel battalion commander Arthur Mulunda said in Kalima, 80 kilometer (50 mile) northeast of Kindu. There wa no independent confirmation of the rebel claim. On Sunday, a spokesman in Goma boasted that Kindu wa already under rebel control. In Kinshasa, government spokesman Didier Mumengi said Monday the Congolese army wa firmly in control of Kindu. Mulunda's 1,500-strong battalion walked 240 kilometer (150 mile) Bukavu at the southern end of Lake Kivu to Kalima, which fell to the rebel Saturday with little resistance. The rebel fighter, clad in brand-new Rwandan-made dark green uniform, rubber rain boot and toting Kalashnikov assault rifle and rocket-propelled grenade launcher, said they were advancing slowly through the lush forest of palm tree and razor-sharp tall grass. We've been resting a lot. It took u two week to get here, Mondo said. The rebel are now using Kalima, a town with one main street, scattered house and mud-and-brick hut, to supply troop with rice, cooking oil, drinking water and ammunition. A small, grass airstrip 8 kilometer (5 mile) away from Kalima is just barely long enough for the rebels' Russian-built Antonov AN-72 transport aircraft. The rebel have targeted Kindu since late August, when they were forced to retreat from the outskirt of Kinshasa after Angola and Zimbabwe sent troop to bail out Kabila. Rebels still control a string of town in eastern Congo, including Kisangani, the country's third-largest city. A day after shooting down a jetliner, Congolese rebel and their Rwandan ally pushed Sunday through government defense line, showing the confidence of a victor in a week-old battle for a strategic air base. Fighting in Kindu, 32 kilometer (20 mile) northeast of the Elila River bridge, died down after the rebel fired a barrage of artillery into the government-held quarter and the air base, four kilometer (two mile) away. Rebel commander Fino Kabangu Kalunga said the government force, surrounded by 3,500 rebel troop from three direction, failed to respond to Sunday's attack. Some troop reportedly retreated through a single road corridor leading out of the town. On Saturday, the rebel said they shot down a Congolese Boeing 727 which wa attempting to land at Kindu air base with 40 troop and ammunition. In Kinshasa, the private Congolese Airlines, which owned the aircraft, said the victim were civilian fleeing fighting in Kindu. It wa not possible to confirm independently either claim. Kalunga said the airport, although still under government control, wa in effect unoperational because of the rebel surface-to-air-missiles deployed nearby. War-weary, physically exhausted and sweaty, hundred of rebel troop and Rwandan soldier marched through dense tropical forest went to reinforce their comrade at Kindu. After a week of battling for Kindu, rebel fighter had made little progress and failed to capture the town outright. The rebel see Kindu a a major prize in their two-month revolt against President Laurent Kabila, whom they accuse of mismanagement, corruption and warmongering among Congo's 400 tribe. Kabila ha turned Kindu into a launching pad for a counteroffensive against rebel position in eastern Congo. The conflict ha drawn in many of Congo's neighbor. There are unconfirmed report that troop from Chad and the Sudan are involved in defending Kindu. Kabila accuses Rwanda and Uganda former ally who installed him in power in May 1997 after an eight-month rebellion of sponsoring the new fighting. Both country say they have legitimate security interest in eastern Congo and accuse Kabila of failing to rid the common border area of Rwandan and Ugandan rebel. Tanks, aircraft and troop from Angola, Zimbabwe and Namibia are supporting Kabila. The assistance wa essential in routing an early rebel offensive in the west that had reached the outskirt of Kinshasa in mid-August. The rebel say they now control one-third of Kindu and are poised to overrun the rest of the town. Under a scorching sun, the column of rebel reinforcement heading to Kindu sneaked through abandoned roadside hamlet. The silence of their march wa interrupted only by the singing of cricket and the clanging of the bullet belt hanging around the soldiers' neck. Soldiers walked by empty hut made of mud and palm leaf. Some rested in the shade of the umbrella-shaped acacia tree. The soldier stopped for the night at the bridge over the chocolate-colored Elila River, which guard the path to Kindu. There wa no immediate comment on the latest development from the government in Kinshasa, which claimed earlier in the week it wa in control of the tarmac bridge. ","After years of civil war, Congo in October 1998 was again in turmoil as rebel forces fought to overthrow the government of President Kabila.The rebels, ethnic Tutsis, disenchanted members of Kabila's army and his political opponents, were said to be supported by Rwandan and Ugandan forces while Kabila was backed by Angola, Zimbabwe, Namibia, Sudan and Ugandan rebels.At first the rebels advanced to the outskirts of the capital, Kinshasa, but foreign troops pushed them back to the extreme eastern part of the country.The rebels then launched a counter offensive but by mid-October it was not clear who would prevail.","Civil strife, tribal rivalry and rebellion has given Congolese rebels control of 40 percent of Congo.The rebels are ethnic Tutsis, disenchanted members of President Kabila's army and opposition politicians.They are accused of being puppets to Uganda and Rwanda.They launched an attack in Kindu, the strategic town and airbase in eastern Congo used by government to halt their advances.Rebels downed a jetliner carrying 40 people from Kindu but fighting has subsided.They have taken their two-month campaign to the Internet to tell their side of the story.Kabila, refusing to negotiate with them, is accused of mismanagement and causing tribal divisiveness.","Rebel groups, mostly Tutsis, but backed by Rawandas and Ugandans are fighting the Congolese government of President Kabila, who is accused of corruption and sowing dissent among Congo's 400 tribes.The government controls the western part of the country but the rebels are gaining in the east.Heavy fighting has occurred near the village of Kindu, which has an airfield critical for supplying government troops.Rebels shot down an airliner near there, killing all 40 aboard, which they say were soldiers but the airline says were civilians.The rebels have promised reforms and a revitalization of the economy; however, the war has increased tribal animosity.","Likely ADF rebels attack Chiondo, Uganda, killing 6 civilians.Soldiers repel attack, killing 2 rebels.Anti-Kabila rebels start a web-site and post their mission statement in a media campaign.Congo Tutsi rebels meet resistance as they enter Kindu and adjacent strategic government airbase.Thousands of rebels in place for battle.After 3 days, battle not going well for rebels.Rebels shoot down jet; say soldiers on board.Government claims Kindu refugees on board; unconfirmed.Rebels and Rwandan allies push through government defenses at Kindu.Fighting subsides after rebel artillery strikes.Population suffers from rebellions and tribal conflict."
8,"After an unusual, one-on-one chat Tuesday night, the Philippine and Indonesian president were considering staying away from an Asia-Pacific summit in Malaysia to protest the treatment of their jailed friend Anwar Ibrahim. Both president have hinted they might not attend the meeting of the 18 Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation nation next month in the Malaysian capital out of concern for Anwar. The former deputy prime minister and finance minister of Malaysia wa arrested Sept. 20 on corruption and illegal sex charge, then brought to court with a black eye and bruise. Philippine President Joseph Estrada told business and political leader in Singapore on Tuesday that he had not made up his mind. Estrada called Anwar his friend and said, I think all of u here believe that due process and human right should be respected. Indonesian President BJ. Habibie may also stay away, his foreign minister, Ali Alatas, said after the two new Southeast Asian leader held a half-hour private meeting. If Habibie pass up APEC, Alatas said, it will be because he ha difficulty leaving the country while there is no vice president, while there are so many problem to deal with. Habibie ha already canceled a state visit to Malaysia, citing difficulty at home. The meeting wa delayed for almost 90 minute when a mechanical fault wa discovered in one of two Indonesian helicopter that were to have flown Estrada and his entourage through heavy rain from Singapore. A ferry wa chartered for the 45-minute sea journey. Habibie apologized when Estrada finally arrived at the Melia Panorama Hotel. Estrada replied, That's all right. The two men, who have each been in power le than five month, met alois June 30 inaugural speech to give the underclass a fairer share of the country's wealth. Habibie took office May 21, hour after his predecessor and mentor, Suharto, wa forced from power after national protest and street riot over Indonesia's collapsing economy. Top finance official from 14 country in the Asia-Pacific region advised Asia's battered economy on Sunday to adopt further reform in their effort to restore stability. Among the necessary step is for country to restructure their economy and corporation to make them le susceptible to abuse by narrow political interest, the official suggested. The deputy finance minister and deputy central bank governor met for two day to review progress on the Manila Framework, an agreement reached last November that aim to promote regional economic stability. Many of Asia's economy have plunged into recession since that agreement. Collapsed currency, weakened demand and higher unemployment now characterize a region that once boasted some of the world's highest economic growth rate. The worsening financial gloom is likely to dominate talk at next week's summit in Kuala Lumpur of leader from the 18-nation Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum. The summit is to take place on Nov. 17-18. In a joint statement, the official cited risk including slower global growth, with particular mention of Russia's worsening economy, and the need to speed up social program to help the poor in the worst-hit country. Stanley Fischer, deputy managing director of the International Monetary Fund, noted that some country have already reformed their banking sector. But he stressed the need for corporate restructuring a well. These are not easy thing to do, he said. Meanwhile, Malaysia's most prominent dissident predicted that the country's prime minister would declare a state of emergency after the APEC meeting end in Kuala Lumpur, a report said Sunday. Former Deputy Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim, now on trial on charge of corruption and sexual misconduct, made the warning in an interview with Monday's edition of Time magazine. Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad fired Anwar in September, saying he wa morally unfit to lead, then had him expelled from Malaysia's ruling party. Anwar denies the allegation and say they were fabricated because Mahathir considered his popularity a threat to the prime minister's 17-year rule. The Philippine ambassador to Malaysia said Friday he wa summoned to the Malaysian Foreign Ministry to explain his president's statement in support of dissident Anwar Ibrahim. Ambassador Jose Brillantes said in a radio interview from Kuala Lumpur that he wa called Thursday after the Malaysian dissident's eldest daughter met Philippine President Joseph Estrada. They expressed their concern about what's happening and the statement coming out of the Philippines, Brillantes told radio station DZXL in Manila. Brillantes said he explained that following the 1986 people power revolt against the late dictator Ferdinand Marcos, Filipinos' react strongly to real and perceived violation of human right. I just explained our culture to them, he said. Anwar wa fired a deputy premier in September and later arrested, appearing in court with a black eye, bruise and a neck brace. He say he wa beaten by security guard. Estrada ha expressed support for Anwar, whom he considers a personal friend, and indicated he may not attend a summit of Asia Pacific Rim nation in Malaysia next month. He ha also said Anwar should be held in house arrest during his upcoming trial on corruption and sexual misconduct charge. Anwar ha denied the charge, calling them politically motivated. On Thursday, Estrada told Anwar's daughter, Nurul Izzah, to tell her father not to waver because he is fighting for a cause, the cause of the Malaysian people. He said, however, that his support is personal and moral and not meant to interfere in the internal problem of Malaysia. Brillantes said: The expression of personal opinion is allowed in our culture and it is not surprising for that to happen. He also said there is no connection between Anwar's case and the summit meeting in Malaysia of the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation forum. We still consider, a expressed by our president, that APEC is important to u, he said. He did not say how the Malaysian official reacted, but he said he wa not reprimanded. Meanwhile, a group Philippine legislator said they plan to attend Anwar's trial, which open Nov. 2. We feel that being observer to his trial will be our silent statement of our democratic aspiration for all Asia, the group said in a statement. Again bowing to Chinese pressure, Taiwan will send it chief economic planner to represent President Lee Teng-hui at November's Asian Pacific Economic Cooperation forum summit in Kuala Lumpur, the Foreign Ministry said Friday. Lee decided to send Chiang Pin-kung to the informal leader summit on Nov. 17-18 after giving much thought to an invitation from Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad, the ministry said. Presentation of an invitation to Lee by the host nation with the understanding that it will be politely refused is an annual formality that allows Taiwan to maintain a semblance of dignity and the host to avoid controversy with China. Beijing's threat to boycott APEC's annual meeting if Lee attends ha forced him to send a stand-in every year since the inaugural summit in 1993. China claim Taiwan a a breakaway province and argues that only sovereign nation are allowed to send their head of state. APEC group Australia, Brunei, Canada, Chile, China, Hong Kong, Indonesia, Japan, South Korea, Malaysia, Mexico, New Zealand, Papua New Guinea, the Philippines, Singapore, Taiwan, Thailand and the United States. Russia, Vietnam and Peru will join in November. Indonesian President BJ. Habibie find attending a summit of Asia-Pacific leader difficult because of his concern about the arrest of Malaysia's former deputy prime minister, a Thai newspaper reported Sunday. Asia-Pacific leader are scheduled to meet next month in Malaysia for an annual economics meeting. Last week, Philippine President Joseph Estrada said he wa considering not going to the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum because of Anwar Ibrahim's arrest. I'm very concerned over how my friend Anwar Ibrahim ha been treated, Habibie wa quoted a saying by the English-language newspaper The Nation. I'm concerned because people should not forget that Anwar Ibrahim had contributed a lot for the benefit of his country. Anwar is a charismatic politician who wa once picked to be the successor to Malaysia's long-serving Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad. But he wa suddenly fired by Mahathir on Sept. 2 after the two differed on economic policy. He then began speaking out against Mahathir and wa arrested Sept. 20. Anwar ha been accused of engaging in homosexual act illegal under Malaysia law, but the charge are generally seen a a pretext for his political persecution. In a court appearance last week, Anwar's face wa bruised and he said he had been beaten by police, heightening international attention to his case. Because of human right involved and I think it is universal people should be given the chance to defend themselves, Habibie wa quoted a saying in the interview conducted Saturday. People should not be tortured. Habibie said Anwar's dismissal should not have been based on thing which had not been proven. On attending the APEC meeting, he said, It's difficult for me. But he said he would consult parliament, adding, I'm not coming personally but a the president of 211 million people of Indonesia. Like Estrada, Habibie served a his country's vice president when Anwar wa deputy prime minister, making them counterpart on the international affair circuit. A group of high-powered US. investor in Southeast Asia on Monday applauded effort to perk up Thailand's staggering economy, saying they had been assured by top Thai official that key economic reform package will soon be approved. After meeting with Thai Cabinet member, including Prime Minister Chuan Leekpai, member of the U.S.-ASEAN Business Council said they were confident in the future of Thailand's economy and promised their company would continue to invest here and elsewhere in the region. We would be quick a observer to applaud the aggressiveness of the reform package that we see being proposed in front of your government today, said business council chairman George David, who is also chairman and CEO of United Technologies Corp. Thailand wa hit hard by last year's Asian economic crisis, and the proposed economic reform legislation focus on resolving the massive bad debt of private company, which is hindering a recovery. This is very aggressive, good reform. It's very impressive, David said, adding that Finance Minister Tarrin Nimmanahaeminda promised Parliament would pas reform measure in month, not year. The U.S.-ASEAN Business Council is a private organization comprising about 300 US. company with substantial investment in Southeast Asia. David said the five executive in the delegation represented dlrs 300 billion in asset. The council's lobbying effort with the US. and Southeast Asian government have concentrated on removing tariff and other barrier to overseas trade. The delegation will travel to Kuala Lumpur for the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum Nov. 14-18. David said free trade should be a focus of discussion among the government leader attending. What I hope they will say at APEC is a very strong affirmation of the free-trade agenda and a very strong affirmation of the foreign direct investment agenda, he added. In little more than a week, the world's leader will converge on this businesslike city in the heart of Southeast Asia for the annual meeting of the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation forum. They could hardly be meeting in a more provocative place. On Sept. 1, Malaysia discontinued trading in it currency, the ringgit, and imposed sweeping control on the flow of capital in it stock and currency market, particularly on investment from overseas. In doing so, the Malaysian prime minister, Mahathir Mohamad, in effect slammed the door on the global economy that President Clinton and the other leader are coming here to champion. Mahathir's decision drew jeer from international investor and policy- maker, who warned that Malaysia wa seeking a quick fix that would retard it desperately needed reform and leave it the odd man out when Asia finally recovered from the regional malaise. Now, though, Mahathir's ally are marshaling new economic data that they say indicate that capital control are breathing new life into the country's moribund economy. Malaysia's foreign reserve rose strongly in September, and there is anecdotal evidence that consumer are starting to spend again. It's nice to be able to say that since we adopted capital control, the economy ha improved, said Zainal Aznam Yusof, the deputy director of the Institute of Strategic and International Studies, a research organization here that helped draft the policy. But we want to see whether this is strongly sustainable. Critics said it wa predictable that capital control would be a short-term tonic to Malaysia's economy. Because the country is sheltered from the vagary of capital flow and currency fluctuation, they said, the government had been able to ease interest rate and encourage consumer spending. Still, the mere fact that Malaysia's experiment ha yielded some positive result guarantee that the issue will come up during the APEC meeting. With Mahathir leading the campaign, the cause of capital control will have a fiery advocate who ha a penchant for getting under the skin of Westerners. Mahathir is a very outspoken political leader, said Chia Yew Boon, an independent analyst in Singapore. There is no way the like of Clinton or Jiang Zemin are going to be able to muzzle him, he added, referring to President Jiang of China. Policy-makers in the United States have expressed fear that if Malaysia's gambit is seen a successful, other economically weakened country in the region, like Indonesia, might be tempted to try it. So far, Indonesian official have said they would stick to the recovery plan devised by the International Monetary Fund, which stress economic austerity and open market. But official in Japan have expressed some sympathy for Mahathir's policy, while Paul Krugman, an economist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, ha advocated using them a an emergency measure. Yusof said recent event had vindicated Malaysia's contention that it needed to insulate itself from the ravage of the global financial system. He said the recent near-collapse of a prominent American hedge fund underscored how sudden flow of capital can have destructive consequence. The Long-Term Capital Management hedge fund, based in Greenwich, Conn., wa nearly wrecked by a series of wrong bet on Treasury security after the collapse of the economy in Russia prompted a flight of capital out of that country. The LTCM fiasco really provides a case study of what could go wrong in the global economy, Yusof said. With capital control a protection, Yusof said Malaysia wa picking up the piece of it shattered economy. In addition to growing foreign reserve, he said Malaysia had improved it trade balance and revived consumer purchase of durable good. Foreign investor have also not wholly abandoned Malaysia, a expert had predicted they would. While foreign direct investment fell in September to $142 million, from an average monthly rate of $321 million for the period from January through September it did not dry up completely. For every comforting statistic, though, the critic produce an alarming one. They said the increase in Malaysia's foreign reserve wa merely due to the new capital restriction, which stipulated that Malaysian currency held outside the country would be worthless unless repatriated by Sept. 30. The skeptic also noted that bank lending declined in September, despite several reduction in interest rate. So the consumer who are buying new car and home appliance are merely dipping into their saving, which mean the buying spree will end when their saving are depleted. The argument wa that by imposing capital control, you'd regain control over monetary policy, which would increase the supply of money and lessen the liquidity crunch, said KS. Jomo, a professor of political economy at the University of Malaya here. But that's not happening. The biggest flaw in Malaysia's policy, Jomo and others said, is it timing. With the Asian crisis more than a year old, much of the foreign capital that wa in the country ha already gone. The critic said Mahathir had spooked would-be investor without even locking in the one who used to be here. There is a case to be made for the temporary imposition of capital control, but to avert a crisis, not to respond to one, Jomo said. In fact, other Asian currency, like the Indonesian rupiah and the Thai baht, have actually rebounded since Malaysia suspended trading in it currency and fixed the exchange rate at 3.8 ringgit to the dollar. Analysts liken the situation to buying an insurance policy for a disaster that ha come and gone. More important, the capital control are slowing down much-needed corporate and banking reform. The government's rescue of Renong, a major conglomerate with close tie to Mahathir, is going ahead, though some analyst predict the government will eventually scrap the much-criticized plan. The rescue of politically connected company remains a tense issue here. On Monday, during the trial of Malaysia's former deputy prime minister, Anwar Ibrahim, on charge of corruption and sex-related crime, Anwar angrily denied Mahathir's claim that he had approved the bailout. Anwar's sensational trial is a reminder that Mahathir's economic policy cannot be disentangled from politics. Malaysia's 72-year-old prime minister clashed with his former protege over how to respond to the Asian crisis, and he dismissed Anwar the day after imposing capital control. During boom time, Mahathir won support for his policy by wrapping them in anti-foreigner language. In a speech on Monday, he attacked a familiar target, saying foreign currency trader are the cause of the currency turmoil, adding: They spread it worldwide. They precipitated the current recession in every country. But Mahathir's treatment of Anwar ha stirred anger and sparked growing social unrest in Malaysia. With protester chanting for reform on the usually orderly street of this city, expert said Mahathir needed capital control to work in order to soothe the country's agitated population. Things will heat up if the economy doe not improve, said Chandra Muzaffar, a professor of political science at the University of Malaya. Then the whole question of Mahathir and his leadership will remain an issue. In that regard, at least, the leader who converge on Kuala Lumpur in two week will be able to identify with their embattled host. The leader of Malaysia's ruling party met Tuesday to discus a replacement for ousted deputy prime minister Anwar Ibrahim, who face trial next month in a case that will test the country's legal system. Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad, 72, said last week he could drop dead at any time. But because of the large number of candidate for the deputy's job within the ruling United Malays National Organization, a decision wa not expected quickly. The party leader, who have been conducting a national campaign to explain to Malaysians why the popular Anwar wa fired Sept. 2, will also confer on what to do now that the High Court judge ha banned all comment on Anwar's guilt or innocence. The ruling coalition had scheduled a giant rally in the capital Saturday, aimed at drawing in the youth to whom Anwar's campaign of reform ha the most appeal. Mahathir, who had heart bypass surgery in 1989, had groomed Anwar, 51, a his successor. But he fired his protege from his post a deputy prime minister and finance minister on ground he wa morally unfit to lead. The two had differed over economic policy and Anwar ha said Mahathir feared he wa a threat to his 17-year rule. Anwar wa also dumped from the ruling party, and after two week of nationwide rally at which he called for government reform and Mahathir's resignation, he wa arrested under a law that allows police to hold him indefinitely, and prevent him from seeing his family and lawyer. On Tuesday, Mahathir denounced demonstrator who had flocked by the thousand to the street of downtown Kuala Lumpur in recent week, calling them part of a plot to topple the government. Baton-wielding riot police had dispersed the crowd with tear gas and water cannon, arresting more than 100 people. They decided that the government should be brought down through demonstration, riot, the Bernama news agency quoted Mahathir a saying in Sarawak state on Borneo Island. He wa expected to return to Kuala Lumpur later Tuesday to chair the UMNO meeting. After Anwar appeared in court with a black eye, bruised face, neck and arm, his case drew international attention, particularly from the president of the Philippines and Indonesia, who have raised the possibility they might not attend an 18-nation summit in Malaysia next month. The United States would downgrade President Bill Clinton's visit to Kuala Lumpur next month if Anwar continued to be mistreated, the Wall Street Journal quoted an official in Washington a saying. Clinton is scheduled to go to Malaysia for the meeting of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum. Wearing a neck brace Monday after a court-ordered hospital checkup, Anwar wa ordered to stand trial Nov. 2 on four charge of abusing his power to interfere with a police investigation. His trial is to halt on Nov. 14 and resume after the APEC meeting. He ha pleaded innocent to all charge, including another corruption count and five charge of sodomy. He face 14 year in prison and a fine on each corruption count and 20 year, plus whipping, on each sexual charge, if convicted. Anwar wa arrested Sept. 20 under the Internal Security Act, which allows jail without trial. Under the same law, police also arrested 17 people considered Anwar associate and a risk to national security. As of Tuesday, 12 had been released. The UMNO supreme council wa expected to prepare a list of top candidate for Anwar's job for Mahathir's final decision. The Star newspaper, which is close to the government, listed the favorite a Foreign Minister Abdullah Ahmad Badawi and Education Minister Najib Tun Razak. Other top contender included Mahathir's confidant Daim Zainuddin, a former finance minister brought back into the Cabinet in June a special function minister in charge of economic recovery. Rafidah Aziz, the international trade and industry minister, and Tengku Razaleigh Hamzah, a former finance minister, were also in the running. The last time the Asia-Pacific region held it annual summit to promote free trade, Japan's prime minister assured everyone that his economy wouldn't be the next victim of Asia's financial crisis. Canada, the host country, wa criticized by some in Canada for cracking down on demonstration against Suharto, Indonesia's iron-fisted ruler at the time. And President Bill Clinton, whose popularity and booming economy were the envy of the planet, joined everyone else in urging country such a Thailand and South Korea to bite the bullet and comply with the tough economic reform that the International Monetary Fund wa demanding. My, how the challenge have grown, a the 21-nation Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum prepares for it November summit in Malaysia. Japan the world's second largest economy, and Asia's financial anchor is suffering through it worst recession since World War II, and that bad news cost Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto his job. Suharto, who ruled Indonesia for 32 year, wa driven out of power by a violent, pro-democracy movement, and the world's fourth most populous country is in real trouble financially. Wall Street is now coping with a steep downturn. And even though Clinton ha promised to attend the APEC meeting, some people wonder how he can do that while facing an impeachment inquiry back home, thanks to the Monica Lewinsky sex scandal. Worse still, Asia's economic crisis is showing sign of going global, and more and more economist are criticizing the IMF for the way it is handling it bailouts. Other well-respected economist are going even further, questioning whether a free-market philosophy doesn't leave some country too vulnerable to the chaos of major market speculator. In fact, Malaysia isn't the only country trying self-defense mechanism such a capital control. Hong Kong recently spent a fortune investing in it stock market to ward off speculator. And Washington is trying to figure out what to do with hedge fund after watching it Federal Reserve help bail out a major one that wa going under, and seeing the investment of others send the US. dollar into a tailspin against Japan's yen. Ironically, Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad, who made one of his typical anti-free-market comment during last year's summit, probably could have opened this year's with an I told you so. But even he is having major domestic problem. Mahathir, 72, who is widely credited with creating modern Malaysia during his 17 year in power, dismissed Anwar Ibrahim, his expected successor, in an apparent dispute over how to battle the country's economic mess. Instead of stepping aside, Anwar launched a reform movement across Malaysia that quickly led to big rally demanding that Mahathir step down. The prime minister used riot police to thwart the protest, and jailed Anwar, charging him with corruption and sex crime, and scheduling his trial for Nov. 2. The trial will be interrupted during the Nov. 12-18 APEC meeting, but Mahathir's treatment of Anwar and his reform movement already have been criticized by APEC member such a Australia, Indonesia, the Philippines and the United States. President BJ. Habibie of Indonesia and Philippine President Joseph Estrada consider Anwar a friend, and Estrada won't say whether he plan to attend this year's APEC summit. John S. Wolf, the US. ambassador for APEC, recently acknowledged that it won't be easy for APEC member to meet in Malaysia a the Asian crisis ricochet around the world with no clear sign what will happen next. But he also said the leader of the 21 APEC member should aim for a productive meeting. Wolf said such gathering give member a chance to discus IMF bailout strategy and the free-market philosophy, to resolve bilateral dispute, and to continue to reduce tariff rate to help struggling country improve their export. This ha been a lousy year in general. It ha affected all of u. It ha set APEC back, and there is no silver bullet to solve the crisis right away, said Wolf. But we should welcome the chance to work together and to develop a sense of what's possible. So far, APEC ha been criticized for doing little during the financial crisis. But next month it hope to complete a plan that would lift trade barrier in nine key industries: environmental product and service, energy, fishery, forestry, toy, jewelry, medical good, chemical product and telecommunication. Besides the United States, APEC, which account for half of all global trade consists of these members: Australia, Brunei, Canada, Chile, China, Hong Kong, Indonesia, Japan, Malaysia, Mexico, New Zealand, Papua New Guinea, the Philippines, Singapore, South Korea, Taiwan and Thailand. During the Malaysia meeting, APEC also will include three new members: Russia one of the latest victim of the financial crisis Vietnam and Peru. The agenda might be global, but the menu will be Malaysian when world leader meet next week for the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum. Pacific Rim leader, including US. President Bill Clinton, will sample local dish at a luncheon planned for the end of their two-day summit. It's expected to be a hot affair. Spicy delicacy on the menu are satay kajang, a beef or chicken kebab in peanut sauce; ayam percik, chicken curry with chilies; soto ayam, a Malaysian chicken soup, and fried rice village-style, the Star newspaper reported in Monday edition. Desert will be simple: fresh tropical fruit, said Maleia Marsden, general manager of the Cyberview Lodge, where the leader were expected to stay during the summit Nov. 17-18. APEC group Australia, Brunei, Canada, Chile, China, Hong Kong, Indonesia, Japan, South Korea, Malaysia, Mexico, New Zealand, Papua New Guinea, the Philippines, Singapore, Taiwan, Thailand and the United States. Russia, Vietnam and Peru will also join APEC this year.

A burly policeman bent to cover a bloodied corpse with whatever wa at hand a sodden piece of cardboard, a plastic shopping bag. Two people were killed and at least 21 injured when an explosives-rigged car blew up Friday at Jerusalem's Mahane Yehuda market, only meter (yards) from the site of a suicide bombing 16 month ago. At police barricade set up along Jerusalem's busiest thoroughfare, soldier and police held back crowd of people, some frantic about loved one who had been shopping in the crowded market only hour before the start of the Jewish Sabbath. Please, please, is there a girl with red hair who is hurt? an older, heavyset woman said tearfully, trying to push her way past police. A young female soldier patted her arm consolingly. Some of the onlooker gave vent to fury over the new peace agreement, which wa being debated by Israel's Cabinet even a the blast occurred. Death to Arabs! Death to Arafat! a small crowd of demonstrator shouted. Police tried to grab one of them, but he escaped into the crowd. The explosives-rigged car wa a mass of twisted metal, with only the steering column intact. Next to the wreckage lay a completely charred body with stump of arm and leg apparently that of the bomber. Witnesses said they heard a series of explosion. Although shop window closest to the car were shattered, market stall only a few more foot (yards) away were completely intact, and stacked with neat pile of banana and onion. Eyewitness Yaakov Shlomo said initial, smaller blast scared most onlooker away. When the big explosion went, there were already not that many people nearby, he said. That wa a miracle from heaven. Shlomo Meir, a black-clad Orthodox Jew, wa standing nearby when he heard a blast. When he tuirned he saw fire. It wa terrible, he said, red-eyed. I thought, `Again!' Only a block away, some stall were still open and shopper were buying produce. One woman, with almost maniacal determination, sorted through a pile of orange. We can't stop what we're doing when this happens, she said grimly. By the police barricade, wearing bright-orange vest, stood a group of Orthodox Jewish volunteer who search scene of accident and attack for body part, in keeping with their religious belief that body must be buried intact. One young volunteer squinted down the street a his group waited for permission to begin it grisly task. It's hard, this work, but it's very important to u, he said. A defiant Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Saturday that Israel would continue to build Jewish neighborhood throughout Jerusalem, including at a controversial site in the traditionally Arab sector of the city. We will build also in Har Homa a we will build in every part of Jerusalem, Netanyahu told a crowd of political supporter in Jerusalem, By 2000 there will be home at Har Homa. Har Homa is the site of a planned Jewish neighborhood in traditionally Arab east Jerusalem, which Palestinians want to have a the capital of their hoped-for independent state. Groundbreaking at the site led to angry Palestinian protest and a breakdown of peace talk in March 1997. Netanyahu's Cabinet delayed action on the latest Israeli-Palestinian accord following Friday's suicide bombing at a Jerusalem market, and his remark about building on Har Homa may be seen a a provocation by the Palestinians at a politically sensitive moment. US. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright told Netanyahu by phone that she expects Israel's Cabinet to ratify the new peace accord within a few day despite the market bombing, Channel Two television reported Saturday. The radical group Islamic Jihad claimed responsibility Saturday for the market bombing and vowed more attack to try to block the new peace accord. This heroic operation is not the first and not going to be the last, the group said in a leaflet faxed to news organization. We refuse any political agreement that would recognize the Zionist enemy. An Islamic Jihad official in the Syrian capital of Damascus confirmed that the group's leader Ramadan Abdullah Shallah claimed responsibility for Friday's bombing in an interview with the Paris-based Radio Monte Carlo. Palestinian security source and the family of the dead bomber had already identified them a Islamic Jihad activist. At least half a dozen other Islamic activist have been rounded up since the bombing, the source said. Palestinian political leader said Israel should not use Friday's suicide bombing, which killed the two assailant and wounded 21 Israelis, a an excuse to stop the peace process. One of Israel's key demand is that the Palestinians do more to fight attack by Islamic militant against Israeli target. The Palestinians, however, said the two bomber had come from Israeli-controlled area and that Israel thus bore at least part of the security responsibility for the attack. The Israeli military said it could not confirm the suicide bombers' identity and hometown, but they were disclosed by Palestinian security official and also reported by Palestinian medium. One lived near the Anata refugee camp, north of Jerusalem, and the other lived in the West Bank village of Silat al Harithiya, outside the town of Jenin. Both family held so-called mourning house on Saturday, but not actual funeral, since Israeli authority still have their body. I didn't raise him to lose him like that, said Mohammed Zughayar, the 54-year-old father of Yusef Ali Mohammed Zughayar, 22. I'm proud, but I'm sad because I loved my son. The family of Suleiman Musa Dahayneh, 24, said he had been married for three month to Zughayar's sister, Basma. They met when she wa visiting her brother, who wa in prison with Dahayneh, the family said. At the market, some 200 observant Jews gathered Saturday night near the site of the bombing to offer prayer of thanks that no life other than those of the assailant were lost. A ring of young men wearing skullcap joined hand and danced, and rabbi spoke of the miracle that had saved those shopping in the market at the time of the attack. Although Hamas initially claimed responsibility through anonymous phone call to the police for Friday's attack all side now have agreed that it wa Islamic Jihad that carried it out. Israel's Cabinet decided Friday to suspend indefinitely it ratification of the land-for-security agreement with the Palestinians. The decision came le than three hour after a car rigged with explosive blew up in an outdoor market in downtown Jersualem. Two people were killed and 21 others were wounded in the attack for which the Islamic militant group Hamas claimed responsibility. The Cabinet said it would not resume it debate or hold a vote on the accord until the Palestinian Authority ha taken step against terrorism. The Cabinet also said it would not resume the ratification process until Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat ha clarified the procedure for revoking clause in the PLO founding charter calling for Israel's destruction. The procedure is part of the Wye River agreement negotiated last month. However, Israelis and Palestinians have widely divergent interpretation of how the clause should be rescinded. Israel say it should be done by a vote by the Palestine National Council. The Palestinians say a vote is not required. A defiant Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Saturday that Israel would continue to build Jewish neighborhood throughout Jerusalem, including at a controversial site in the traditionally Arab sector of the city. We will build also in Har Homa a we will build in every part of Jerusalem, Netanyahu told a crowd of political supporter in Jerusalem, By 2000 there will be home at Har Homa.

US. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright expects Israel's Cabinet to ratify the new peace accord within a few day despite the market bombing, a television report said Saturday. The United States understands the delay by a day or two but expects the agreement to be approved soon, Albright told Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu by phone, Channel Two reported. The radical group Islamic Jihad claimed responsibility Saturday for the market bombing and vowed more attack to try to block the new peace accord. This heroic operation is not the first and not going to be the last, the group said in a leaflet faxed to news organization. We refuse any political agreement that would recognize the Zionist enemy.

Although Hamas initially claimed responsibility through anonymous phone call to the police for Friday's attack all side now have agreed that it wa Islamic Jihad that carried it out. Israel's Cabinet announced within hour of a market bombing Friday that it will put off a vote indefinitely on whether to ratify the Wye River accord until Palestinians crack down further on terrorism. Israel radio said the 18-member Cabinet debate on the Wye River accord would resume only after Yasser Arafat's Palestinian Authority fulfilled all of it commitment under the agreement, including arresting Islamic militant. The Cabinet also insisted that Arafat convene the Palestinian National Council, a parliament in exile, to abrogate the Palestinian National Charter, which call for Israel's destruction. The Israeli Cabinet had convened for a second day in an attempt to approve the Wye agreement. To our sorrow, since the Wye agreement . there ha been relentless terrorist attack against Israeli citizen, according to a Cabinet statement read on the radio. Israel radio quoted official saying the Cabinet would also decide to renew construction of the Har Homa neighborhood in the traditionally Arab sector of Jerusalem. Groundbreaking there in March 1997 led to a break-off in negotiation with the Palestinians. The militant Palestinian movement Islamic Holy War said Saturday that it carried out the suicide bombing in a Jerusalem market on Friday, which prompted arrest by the Palestinian Authority overnight. Palestinian official said they had jailed several of the small but radical group's member from the West Bank, and raided and then shut down a nursery school linked to the organization in Bethlehem, which is controlled by the Palestinians. The two bomber who carried out Friday's attack, which led the Israeli Cabinet to suspend deliberation on the land-for-security accord signed with the Palestinians last month, were identified a member of Islamic Holy War from West Bank village under Israeli security control. Ramadan Abdallah Shallah, the Damascus-based leader of Islamic Holy War, said martyr from his movement had carried out the Jerusalem attack in response to Israel's settlement policy and Judaization of the West Bank. He spoke in an interview with Monte Carlo Radio, an Arabic station broadcasting from Paris that is widely listened to in the Middle East. A leaflet signed by the group and faxed to Reuters in Jerusalem said the heroic attack, in which 24 people were injured and the 2 bomber killed, had been carried out to confront the great conspiracy that aim to liquidate the Palestinian cause through the Oslo and Wye Plantation agreement of submission. Islamic Holy War and it counterpart, Hamas, have denounced a a sellout of Palestinian right the 1993 Oslo self-rule accord and the latest agreement, known a the Wye Memorandum, named for the Wye Plantation in Maryland, where the deal wa worked out with strenuous American mediation. Shallah's claim of responsibility from abroad contrasted with the muted response of Islamic Holy War's leadership in the Gaza Strip, which ha reportedly given commitment to the Palestinian Authority to refrain from such attack. We have no knowledge in the movement about the operation that occurred in Jerusalem, said Nafez Azzam, a senior leader of Islamic Holy War in Gaza. From it condition we consider it likely that it wa an individual effort. The Palestinian cabinet, in a statement issued after a meeting on Friday night, accused foreign force of standing behind the attack. One cabinet member, who declined to be identified, pointed a finger at Iran, saying a search of one bomber's home had uncovered a letter he had written to the Iranian supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, expressing condolence for the recent killing of several Iranian diplomat in Afghanistan. Iran, which ha backed militant Islamic group opposed to the Arab-Israeli peace effort, ha denounced the Wye agreement, branding Yasser Arafat, the Palestinian leader, a traitor to the Palestinian cause. The Palestinian cabinet promised to crack down on the militant, who it said were jeopardizing the recovery of Palestinian land and hope for statehood by giving Israel a pretext to postpone carrying out the Wye accord. The Israeli Cabinet suspended a meeting to ratify the agreement after the bombing, demanding that the Palestinians conduct an all-out war on terror. Israeli official had no comment Saturday on the measure taken by the Palestinian Authority on Friday. The Wye agreement call for an Israeli troop withdrawal from 13 percent more of the West Bank in exchange for specific Palestinian measure against violent militant. A Palestinian security official said several Islamic Holy War member were arrested in the West Bank on Friday night. Arrests were also reported in the Gaza Strip. Itaf Alayan, a supporter of the group who run the Islamic Purity Nursery in Bethlehem, said Palestinian officer had raided the school and confiscated videotape and educational cassette before locking it up. The two bomber were identified a Youssef Zughayer, 21, from Anata, near Jerusalem, and his brother-in-law, Suleiman Tahayneh, 24, from Silat al-Harithiya, near the West Bank town of Jenin. Both had served time in Israeli jail and were known to be member of Islamic Holy War. We never thought he would do something like this, said Muhammad Zughayer, Youssef's father. We condemn such act, but the only thing we can do now is to say may he rest in peace. On a warm, sunny morning last Friday, at the time he usually left for work at his family's produce store, Youssef Sughayer said goodbye to his grandmother for the last time and rode off to his death. Relatives say that the 21-year-old Palestinian from this village near Jerusalem showed no sign that he wa heading for a suicide mission with his brother-in-law a part of a secret cell of Islamic Holy War. Their car-bomb blew apart two hour later in a Jerusalem market, killing both men and wounding 24 people. Don't grieve for me, he wrote in a farewell note, according to relative who found it later. If you cry, cry with happiness that I'm a martyr. Don't serve bitter coffee, serve sweet. I'm going to Paradise. At the family's stone house outside Jerusalem on Sunday, visitor paying condolence call were served sweet juice, not coffee, a Sughayer's relative tried to make sense of what he had done. The young man, once an ace student, had come of age in Israeli prison. Jailed for a year at age 15 for stoning Israeli car during the riot of the Palestinian uprising, he wa imprisoned again at 17, that time for three-and-a-half year for similar offense and affiliation with Islamic Holy War. Relatives said he wa an impressionable teen-ager, influenced by Islamic militant with whom he wa jailed. Sughayer came out of prison more devout, and hardened by mistreatment at the hand of the Israelis, relative said. His cellmates taught him the doctrine of holy war and about the glory of martyrdom, said an older brother, Samih Sughayer. They sowed it in his heart, he said. He wanted to be a martyr in the cause of God. But that reality, suddenly so clear Sunday, wa not so apparent when Sughayer wa freed seven month ago. He seemed normal, said his brother. He went to work at the grocery store, he finished his high school class and he wanted to enroll in the university. He wa supposed to take a driving test in a few day. If he wa planning something, we didn't see it. He would stay up late at night after work, studying the Koran and praying, but he showed no outward sign of rage toward Israel. He would joke about thing and say that whatever happens is God's will, said a brother-in-law, who insisted on anonymity. He wa an easygoing guy. Last Thursday, Sughayer bought a battered red Fiat and parked it near his house. When someone at home asked about the car he said nothing, and family member assumed it wa one of the stolen vehicle often found here. On Friday morning he left with the car, meeting his brother-in-law and old jail buddy, Suleiman Tahayneh, who came from his village near the West Bank town of Jenin. Tahayneh had his own score to settle with the Israelis. His leg had been amputated after he wa shot in a confrontation with Israeli troop during the uprising, his relative said. The Fiat wa loaded with explosive, and the two men drove to the market. That evening, when concerned member of the Sughayer family gathered to await news of their missing relative, a man arrived and told them that he had sold his car to Youssef the previous day. It wa a red Fiat, the same car they had seen near the house, and the same type of car that news report said had exploded in the marketplace. At midnight, Israeli security force raided the house and interrogated family member. The last, grim piece of the puzzle fell into place. Up to the last minute on Thursday night we were talking together, said Sughayer's oldest brother, Ali, who worked with him past midnight at the produce store. He asked me about someone who had moved his hardware shop to another village, about how he wa doing. Earlier we ate together, and we talked about giving charity to the poor. He wasn't nervous. He had plan for the future, Ali continued. Maybe the people in his group convinced him to do this, and he could not refuse. We did not expect this from him. A car rigged with explosive blew up Friday morning in Jerusalem's Mahane Yehuda market packed with Israelis shopping for the Jewish Sabbath, killing two people and wounding 21. The Islamic militant group Hamas, which ha tried to stop the peace agreement, claimed responsibility, police said. In response to the attack, the Israeli cabinet suspended ratification of the Wye agreement until there is verification that the Palestinian authority is indeed fighting terrorism. The Israeli Cabinet also announced it will begin to build house in the controversial Jewish settlement of Har Homa in east Jerusalem. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu had held up the work in recent month in an apparent attempt to not disrupt negotiation with the Palestinians. Aides to Netanyahu were not immediately available for comment. The Cabinet minister had just begun a second day of of talk on the peace agreement about a mile (kilometer) away from the entrance to the market and just meter (yards) from the site of a suicide bombing last year. In Friday's explosion, the rigged car, a red Fiat, blew up at about 9:45 am. (0745 GMT) at the entrance of Mahane Yehuda market, just meter (yards) away from the site of a suicide bombing in July 1997. Witnesses heard a series of small explosion. Yair Cohen, 43, said he wa buying cooky when he saw a car driving slowly, with smoke coming out of the hood and exhaust pipe. People started to shout `car on fire.' After a while, we heard a blast, and something hit me in the stomach, said Cohen who wa treated for minor injury at Hadassah Hospital. The car wa a mass of twisted metal sitting in the middle of the main intersection outside the market. Flames shot 100 foot (30 meter) in the air. A charred corpse, covered by a blanket, lay several meter away. Streams of soot-black water ran in the street. Another bare-legged body lay in the street, face down, in a pool of blood below the head. Rescue worker covered the body with sodden piece of cardboard box and plastic shopping bag. There wa hysteria, people were running, said Eliad Duan, an Israeli border policeman who wa patrolling the market and wa lightly injured. One heavy-set woman, apparently in shock, climbed into an ambulance, weeping. Three paramedic talked to her, persuading her that she did not need medical treatment, and after a few moment she climbed out of the vehicle again. Soldiers and police wearing plastic glove held back the crowd. It's dangerous stay back! they shouted. Just a block away from the blast, shopper went about their business. One young woman shopper said: We can't stop with what we are doing when this happens. Hassan Asfour, a Palestinian peace negotiator, said the Palestinian Authority condemned the attack. This is a crime and whoever commits this, hurt the interest of the Palestinian people. The radical group Islamic Jihad claimed responsibility Saturday for the suicide bombing of a crowded Jerusalem market and promised more attack to try to block the new peace accord. This heroic operation is not the first and not going to be the last, the group said in a leaflet faxed to news organization. We refuse any political agreement that would recognize the Zionist enemy. The leaflet could not immediately be authenticated, but it style wa consistent with that of past communication from the group. An Islamic Jihad official in the Syrian capital of Damascus confirmed that the group's leader Ramadan Abdullah Shallah claimed responsibility for Friday's bombing in an interview with the Paris-based Radio Monte Carlo. Palestinian security source and the family of the dead bomber had already identified them a Islamic Jihad activist. At least half a dozen other Islamic activist have been rounded up since the bombing, the source said. Although Hamas initially claimed responsibility through anonymous phone call to the police, all side now have agreed that it wa Islamic Jihad that carried it out. There wa no immediate explanation for the inaccurate claim, but the two group have carried out attack together in the past a part of their goal of stopping the peace process. Setting the stage for a new quarrel over how to crack down on militant, Israel is demanding that the military wing of two radical Islamic group be outlawed, while the Palestinian Authority insists it ha already banned them. Implementation of the Israeli-Palestinian land-for-security accord, signed Oct. 23 in Washington, wa to have begun this past week, but ha hit various snag. Most recently, Israel's Cabinet put off a vote to ratify the accord after a suicide bombing Friday in Jerusalem that killed the two assailant and injured 21 Israelis. The radical group Islamic Jihad claimed responsibility. David Bar-Illan, a top aide to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, said Sunday that Israel expects Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat to formally outlaw the military wing of Islamic Jihad and the larger militant group Hamas. Hassan Asfour, a senior Palestinian official, said Hamas' military wing, Izeddine al Qassam, and the military wing of Islamic Jihad were outlawed by the Palestinian Authority in 1996. But Bar-Illan said the Palestinian legislature had never passed such a law. Why did Mr. Arafat agree in the Wye accord to outlaw them if he ha already done it? he asked. The Wye memorandum state that the Palestinian Authority will inform the United States fully of the action it ha taken to outlaw all organization (or wing of organization, a appropriate) of a military, terrorist or violent character, and their support structure and to prevent them freedom of action in the area under it jurisdiction. A Palestinian security official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said a joint Israeli-Palestinian meeting wa held Saturday night to discus security in the wake of Friday's attack. Participants included the head of the Palestinian intelligence, Amin Hindi, and the head of preventive security in the Gaza Strip, Mohammed Dahlan. The idea of outlawing Hamas and Islamic Jihad wa brought up in the meeting and also proposed by Netanyahu to Arafat during a phone call, the official said. The Palestinians said they could ban activity by Hamas or Islamic Jihad that endangered either Israelis or Palestinians, but could not outlaw them outright a political movement. Friday's bombing led to finger-pointing by both side. Israel said it showed Arafat's crackdown on terrorist had not been sweeping enough. The Palestinians, however, have also accused Israel of failing to take at least partial security responsibility for the attack, because both attacker came from Israeli-controlled area, and had recently served time in Israeli jail. Israel a a rule is harshly critical of the Palestinian Authority's security effort when attacker come from Palestinian-controlled area or have been released from Palestinian prison. On Sunday, Palestinian Justice Minister Freih Abu-Medein accused Netanyahu of using the blast a a pretext for delaying implementation of the peace accord. This attack is a gift to Mr. Netanyahu, Abu-Medein said. All the time he is praying to God to help him . to escape from the agreement. Under the accord, Israel is to hand over another 13 percent of the territory in the West Bank to the Palestinians in exchange for various security step. Israeli Defense Minister Yitzhak Mordechai predicted Sunday that the Israeli Cabinet would ratify the agreement in coming day. I estimate that the government will meet this week and will accept the decision of the majority (in favor of the agreement), he said.

11,"BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) - The European Union on Friday expressed it deep concern over report of physical abuse of Malaysia's former deputy-prime minister, Anwar Ibrahim, who wa arrested last month. The EU urge the Malaysian authority to ensure that similar incident will not occur again in the future and that Anwar Ibrahim be assured correct treatment while in custody, a statement by the 15 EU country said. The EU hope that appropriate action will be taken against any individual, including official, found responsible for such mistreatment, the statement added. On Sept. 2, Malaysia's Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad fired Anwar, calling him morally unfit for office. Mahathir and Anwar had differed over economic policy and Anwar say Mahathir feared him a an alternative leader. Anwar mounted a nationwide campaign against the prime minister before being detained a a national security risk and charged with illegal homosexual act and corruption in connection with those allegation. Earlier this week, Anwar appeared in court with a black eye and bruise on his neck and arm. He told the magistrate's court he wa beaten by police on Sept. 20, the night of his arrest. Faced with mounting public criticism, Mahathir called Thursday for a probe by the attorney general of the alleged mistreatment of Anwar. The EU statement welcomed the opening of this investigation. It also welcomed the release of seven youth leader, including Ahmad Zahid Hamidi, the head of the youth wing of the ruling United Malays National Organization and a former ally of Anwar, who were arrested last week in connection with demonstration in favor of the ousted deputy-premier. The EU express hope that the other political demonstrator still detained under the Internal Security Act will also be released soon, the statement said. The former deputy-premier, who wa also finance minister, pleaded innocent this week to charge of sodomy and corruption. A number of Anwar's associate are still detained. The leader of Malaysia's ruling party met Tuesday to discus a replacement for ousted deputy prime minister Anwar Ibrahim, who face trial next month in a case that will test the country's legal system. Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad, 72, said last week he could drop dead at any time. But because of the large number of candidate for the deputy's job within the ruling United Malays National Organization, a decision wa not expected quickly. The party leader, who have been conducting a national campaign to explain to Malaysians why the popular Anwar wa fired Sept. 2, will also confer on what to do now that the High Court judge ha banned all comment on Anwar's guilt or innocence. The ruling coalition had scheduled a giant rally in the capital Saturday, aimed at drawing in the youth to whom Anwar's campaign of reform ha the most appeal. Mahathir, who had heart bypass surgery in 1989, had groomed Anwar, 51, a his successor. But he fired his protege from his post a deputy prime minister and finance minister on ground he wa morally unfit to lead. The two had differed over economic policy and Anwar ha said Mahathir feared he wa a threat to his 17-year rule. Anwar wa also dumped from the ruling party, and after two week of nationwide rally at which he called for government reform and Mahathir's resignation, he wa arrested under a law that allows police to hold him indefinitely, and prevent him from seeing his family and lawyer. On Tuesday, Mahathir denounced demonstrator who had flocked by the thousand to the street of downtown Kuala Lumpur in recent week, calling them part of a plot to topple the government. Baton-wielding riot police had dispersed the crowd with tear gas and water cannon, arresting more than 100 people. They decided that the government should be brought down through demonstration, riot, the Bernama news agency quoted Mahathir a saying in Sarawak state on Borneo Island. He wa expected to return to Kuala Lumpur later Tuesday to chair the UMNO meeting. After Anwar appeared in court with a black eye, bruised face, neck and arm, his case drew international attention, particularly from the president of the Philippines and Indonesia, who have raised the possibility they might not attend an 18-nation summit in Malaysia next month. The United States would downgrade President Bill Clinton's visit to Kuala Lumpur next month if Anwar continued to be mistreated, the Wall Street Journal quoted an official in Washington a saying. Clinton is scheduled to go to Malaysia for the meeting of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum. Wearing a neck brace Monday after a court-ordered hospital checkup, Anwar wa ordered to stand trial Nov. 2 on four charge of abusing his power to interfere with a police investigation. His trial is to halt on Nov. 14 and resume after the APEC meeting. He ha pleaded innocent to all charge, including another corruption count and five charge of sodomy. He face 14 year in prison and a fine on each corruption count and 20 year, plus whipping, on each sexual charge, if convicted. Anwar wa arrested Sept. 20 under the Internal Security Act, which allows jail without trial. Under the same law, police also arrested 17 people considered Anwar associate and a risk to national security. As of Tuesday, 12 had been released. The UMNO supreme council wa expected to prepare a list of top candidate for Anwar's job for Mahathir's final decision. The Star newspaper, which is close to the government, listed the favorite a Foreign Minister Abdullah Ahmad Badawi and Education Minister Najib Tun Razak. Other top contender included Mahathir's confidant Daim Zainuddin, a former finance minister brought back into the Cabinet in June a special function minister in charge of economic recovery. Rafidah Aziz, the international trade and industry minister, and Tengku Razaleigh Hamzah, a former finance minister, were also in the running. Deprived of a voice in state-controlled newspaper and television, supporter of Malaysia's jailed opposition leader have turned to the Internet to air their view. Although the government said police would check every bit of information and leaflet posted on the Internet, Malaysia's sole Internet provider acknowledged Friday the medium is impossible to control. Jailed, beaten and facing trial on 10 sexual misconduct and corruption charge, ousted Deputy Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim is a political underdog in Malaysia. In the realm of cyberspace, though, he's top dog. Within hour of Anwar's recent speech accusing Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad of cruelty and insanity, dozen of boot-legged recording had been posted onto new website hatched by supporter. Among the hottest image now making the Internet round are several news-photo version of Anwar's badly bruised eye, which he claim wa inflicted by police during his first night of detention. Most pro-Anwar site also contain his speech, private letter to Mahathir, clipping of foreign news report and prose scorching the 72-year old prime minister. Most of the Internet content about Anwar is false or unverifiable, but the medium is tough to rein in, said Azzman Shariffadeen, head of Mimos, the company that set up Malaysia's Internet infrastructure. No website ha been blocked or censored by the government, he said. Shortly after Anwar's arrest, one of the former leader's aide bragged that they had set up dozen of site offshore, beyond the reach of the Malaysian government. Malaysian journalist MGG. Pillai, who run a popular website on local politics, isn't surprised by the aggressive march toward cyberspace. When you're in the opposition and you have no access to resource and medium, then you end up making use of what's available to air your grouse, he said, noting that membership on his site ha soared by 40 percent since Anwar's ouster. The cyber explosion is a boon to most middle-class Malaysians, who are leery of local medium. I've finally given up reading local newspaper. They're so skewed, said Michael Chan, a lawyer who upgraded his computer with a high-speed modem the day after Anwar wa arrested on Sept. 20. Chan us the modem to download picture of balaclava-clad police in bulletproof jacket busting down Anwar's front door before bundling him off to jail. Occasionally, he receives e-mail calling for organized rally at the National Mosque and nearby Independence Square, where hundred of protester have been arrested by police. The advertised demonstration don't always materialize. Other e-mail call for silent protest. Malaysians are being urged on the Internet now to switch off all light for 10 minute on Oct. 6 to declare their state of sorrow, sadness and darkness over national injustice. A key witness in the government's sexual misconduct case against Malaysia's former deputy prime minister remains determined to appeal his conviction, his attorney said Monday. Munawar Ahmad Aness, a friend and speech writer of Anwar Ibrahim, pleaded guilty to the charge last month, allegedly confessing to having sex with the political dissident. Anwar ha said the guilty plea wa coerced. Aness, a Pakistani with permanent residence in the United States, wa sentenced to six month in jail. In a move that could deal a major setback to the case against Anwar, Aness then filed a letter of appeal through his lawyer. Another letter then appeared, saying Aness would not go through with the appeal. His lawyer say the second letter wa a fraud. His instruction are he want u to proceed with the appeal. There is no change, said Balwant Singh, one of two lawyer defending Aness, after a meeting with Aness. One of the major charge against Anwar hinge on Aness' confession. Singh spoke to reporter after attending court proceeding Monday where Anwar's trial wa fixed for Nov. 2 on corruption charge. He said he went to a hospital to meet Aness when the court broke for lunch. Aness wa jailed on Sept. 15 but moved soon after to a hospital where he ha been under treatment for heart problem. He ha given u the written retainer. He signed a notice of appeal. We have instruction to proceed and we are proceeding, said Singh, adding he filed the letter of appeal in court Sept. 29. Between the visit with his client, however, Aness signed another letter saying he would not proceed with the appeal, Singh said. That led to confusion whether Aness really wanted an appeal. Somebody approached him and asked him to sign a typewritten letter, said Singh. He wa asked to sign it and he did. Bruises on the face of jailed dissident Anwar Ibrahim, splashed on newspaper front page for two day and downloaded from the Internet, are blemishing the image of Malaysian police. After first suggesting that the former deputy prime minister had beaten himself on the face, neck and arm during 10 day in police custody, Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad called for an investigation of the wound Anwar displayed in court Tuesday and Wednesday. We can't accept this and we will undertake full investigation, Mahathir wa quoted a saying in Thursday's New Straits Times. The police cannot harm their detainee in the course of their interrogation. Mahathir fired Anwar on Sept. 2 from his post a deputy prime minister and finance minister, saying he wa morally unfit for office. The two had differed over economic policy a the country veered into recession and Anwar ha said the 72-year-old Mahathir feared him a an alternative leader. Local newspaper that are normally pro-Mahathir have splashed close-up photo of Anwar's badly bruised face for two day. People are peering at the picture, downloading copy from the Internet, discussing whether Mahathir, who also oversees the police a home affair minister, knew what wa happening to the man he had once groomed a his successor. It wa not the first time that a Malaysian ha said he wa tortured or mistreated in police custody. But there ha been no one a high-profile a Anwar. What I experienced wa chicken feed compared to Anwar, Syed Husin Ali, head of the opposition Malaysian People's Party, said Thursday. In a book about his six-month detention under the same law that kept Anwar away from family and lawyer for 10 day, Syed described being hit and deprived of sleep. At least I didn't have bruise on my face, although I wa slapped and hit on the stomach, Syed told The Associated Press. Anwar's bruise raise alarming question about the state of governance in the country, said Lim Kit Siang, leader of the opposition Democratic Action Party. If Mahathir did not know of the alleged beating, it suggests the police acted on their own. At a series of rally before his arrest, Anwar led throng in chanting for Mahathir's resignation and a more open, le corrupt government. His arrest Sept. 20 wa followed by street protest and hundred of additional arrest. Before his arrest, Anwar designated his wife, Azizah Ismail, a the leader of his new reform movement. But police have banned her from speaking publicly. On Thursday she wa summoned for the third time to police headquarters for questioning about an interview with regional television network CNBC Asia. She had expressed fear that her husband would be injected with the HIV virus to prove allegation of homosexuality, and police are investigating possible charge of sedition against her. She called the repeated interview pressure and harassment. Three Malaysian police officer traveled to Singapore Thursday to ask CNBC news anchor how they had arranged to get the Sept. 21 interview with Azizah and one with Anwar on Sept. 3. CNBC refused to answer question about it news gathering, said vice president of news programming Chris Blackman. Anwar, who pleaded innocent this week to five charge of sodomy and five of corruption, told the court that police beat him the night he wa arrested, until blood seeped down my nose, leaving him half-conscious. His allegation, accompanied by pictorial evidence, brought prompt expression of disapproval, from the US. State Department, the Australian government, Amnesty International, and the finance minister of other country who used to meet with Anwar at international conference. On Thursday, the Indonesian government, where security force have been accused for year of mistreating prisoner, said it regretted the report about Anwar's injury and that the allegation have placed in doubt a visit to Malaysia by President BJ. Habibie. The arrest of former Malaysian Deputy Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim won't lead to massive social unrest or frighten away investor, Malaysia's trade minister said Thursday. Anwar wa fired by Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad on Sept. 2 after the two differed on economic policy. He then began speaking out against Mahathir and wa arrested Sept. 20. Frankly speaking there is no reason to say that just because one man wa arrested for something . that it should bring any unrest, trade minister Rafidah Aziz said. Leaders come and go. . They even get sacked in all country of the world. They even die, she told a news conference in Manila, where she attended a meeting of Association of Southeast Asian Nations economic minister. Rafidah said there have only been a few demonstration in Malaysia over Anwar's arrest, all of them orchestrated. In recent visit to Chicago, New York, Houston and Boston, she said potential investor asked her about Anwar's arrest but were still interested in investing in Malaysia. Anwar said police beat him in custody. In recent appearance in court, where he is facing charge of corruption and illegal homosexual act, he wa seen with a black eye and a neck brace. At least two ASEAN leader, Philippine President Joseph Estrada and Indonesian President BJ. Habibie, have spoken out against Anwar's treatment. The Philippine leader said he wa considering skipping a summit of Asia-Pacific leader in Malaysia in November to protest the arrest of Anwar, whom he described a a personal friend. He later said he would attend the summit and had only made the earlier remark out of sympathy toward Anwar. The Philippines, Malaysia and Indonesia are founding member country of ASEAN, which also includes Brunei, Laos, Myanmar, Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam. Among Asia's leader, Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad wa notable a a man with a bold vision: a physical and social transformation that would push this nation into the forefront of world affair. It almost came true. In 17 year a prime minister, Mahathir, 72, who is a medical doctor, fostered an economic liberalization that led to some of the world's fastest rate of growth. He drove Malaysians to be more productive, to embrace high technology and to begin major investment around the world. He created a national affirmative-action program that allowed the country's ethnic Chinese, Malays and Indians to share in improved living standard and a new sense of Malaysian identity and pride. This year wa to have been Mahathir's year of triumph, perhaps paving the way for his retirement, with the inauguration of huge public work project and impressive gathering of foreign leader and sportsman. But today, in a dizzying turnaround, Malaysia is on Asia's critical list, it economy teetering on the edge of disaster and it stability shaken by what seems to have been an entirely avoidable political cat fight. Last month, Mahathir dismissed and arrested his deputy and heir apparent, Anwar Ibrahim, 51, accusing him of corruption and illegal sex act. The move set off street demonstration and aroused international condemnation, particularly from Anwar's many friend in foreign government. One of the region's most stable and prosperous nation is suddenly in an uproar. It appears that a in Indonesia, Thailand, Japan and South Korea, the pressure of economic collapse have spawned a political crisis. In all those nation, the result wa a change in leadership. The question now is: Is Mahathir next? The answer is far from clear. Unlike in Indonesia, there ha been little evidence of a simmering discontent in Malaysia. The ouster of former President Suharto in Indonesia had been predicted by many people. Almost no one seems to have foreseen the eruption here. Malaysia is not familiar with political demonstration. Unlike Indonesians, Malaysians rarely riot. Many people here were puzzled and disturbed when they encountered water cannon and the riot police on the street in recent week. What we're seeing is unprecedented, said Ambassador John Malott of the United States. This ha never happened in Malaysia, and nobody know where it's going to go. You can write a lot of scenario but we are in totally uncharted water. Mahathir, the confident nation-builder, seems to be flailing a he watch his legacy crumble. An economy that had been growing at more than 8 percent a year for the last decade is now headed for a contraction of perhaps 6 percent. Angry and frustrated, he closed Malaysia off from international financial market one month ago, turning his back on the foreign investor whom he once embraced and who had fueled the country's rapid growth. The move had the intended effect of bringing home the Malaysian currency, insulating it from the speculator Mahathir blame for the crisis, and giving an adrenaline jolt to the now self-contained economy. It is a move that seems in tune with a recent round of questioning of the economic orthodoxy of the International Monetary Fund. But few foreign economist expect it to work for long. Mahathir is attacking the fundamental belief of the free market, of capitalism, of Wall Street, a foreign diplomat said. We are either watching economic theory being rewritten or reconfirmed and I don't think it's being rewritten. The day after making his economic gamble, Mahathir set off the most severe political crisis of his tenure, dismissing Anwar, the man he had been grooming to be his successor. Two week later, Anwar wa arrested at his home and held incommunicado for 10 day, during which he say he wa beaten by his jailer. Last week he wa charged with 10 count of corruption and sexual misconduct that could result in a prison term of up to 34 year. The harshness of those move unleashed a surge of largely unsuspected discontent that mobilized Anwar's motley fellow constituencies: liberal democrat, young professional and politically assertive Muslims. For the first time in decade, Malaysians by the thousand demonstrated in the street and in mosque and were met with tear gas and water cannon. Many people were beaten and hundred were detained, although most were later released. With the emergence of this still-tentative opposition movement, the fear expressed by one Western diplomat is of a downward spiral in which suppression breed more discontent breed more suppression breed more discontent. People here whisper that Mahathir's day may now be numbered. But few venture a guess at what the number might be. Given his control of the lever of power and the lack of focus or leadership in the opposition, Mahathir could ride out the storm a Anwar's trial proceeds. But he ha struck a harsh blow to the morale of his own nation, to the sense of confidence he had worked so hard to build under the slogan Malaysia Can! In this generally decorous nation, the depth of anger expressed by two men who once called each other father and son is disturbing to hear. Anwar, say the prime minister, is despicable and a sodomist. Mahathir, say his former deputy, is senile and insane. Malaysians, who have stolidly accepted Mahathir's authoritarian rule with a mixture of gratitude and emerging pride, seem stunned. Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad said Friday he is not too choosy about who will be his successor. The man need not necessarily be very religious and only preoccupied with doing virtuous deed at all time, the national news agency, Bernama, quoted Mahathir a saying after Friday prayer at the Al-Falah Mosque in the northern town of Jitra in Kedah state. It is sufficient that the person doe thing acceptable by the people, Mahathir said. So far Mahathir, 72, ha designated three heirs-apparent during his 17-year rule. One resigned. Another challenged Mahathir for leadership of the ruling party, and lost. On Sept. 2, he fired the last one, Anwar Ibrahim, calling him morally unfit for office. Anwar mounted a nationwide campaign against the prime minister before being detained a a national security risk and charged with illegal homosexual act and corruption in connection with those allegation. Mahathir told reporter later that Anwar had been working toward toppling him a prime minister and president of the governing coalition's dominant party, the United Malays National Organization. He appeared very good to me but he wa actually planning way of bringing me down. At first, I did not believe when people told me about this, but I now know this to be true, said Mahathir. Mahathir said Anwar had arranged for his supporter to contest for and gain control of the UMNO division so that he could win the party's top post in next year's party election. Indonesian President BJ. Habibie find attending a summit of Asia-Pacific leader difficult because of his concern about the arrest of Malaysia's former deputy prime minister, a Thai newspaper reported Sunday. Asia-Pacific leader are scheduled to meet next month in Malaysia for an annual economics meeting. Last week, Philippine President Joseph Estrada said he wa considering not going to the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum because of Anwar Ibrahim's arrest. I'm very concerned over how my friend Anwar Ibrahim ha been treated, Habibie wa quoted a saying by the English-language newspaper The Nation. I'm concerned because people should not forget that Anwar Ibrahim had contributed a lot for the benefit of his country. Anwar is a charismatic politician who wa once picked to be the successor to Malaysia's long-serving Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad. But he wa suddenly fired by Mahathir on Sept. 2 after the two differed on economic policy. He then began speaking out against Mahathir and wa arrested Sept. 20. Anwar ha been accused of engaging in homosexual act illegal under Malaysia law, but the charge are generally seen a a pretext for his political persecution. In a court appearance last week, Anwar's face wa bruised and he said he had been beaten by police, heightening international attention to his case. Because of human right involved and I think it is universal people should be given the chance to defend themselves, Habibie wa quoted a saying in the interview conducted Saturday. People should not be tortured. Habibie said Anwar's dismissal should not have been based on thing which had not been proven. On attending the APEC meeting, he said, It's difficult for me. But he said he would consult parliament, adding, I'm not coming personally but a the president of 211 million people of Indonesia. Like Estrada, Habibie served a his country's vice president when Anwar wa deputy prime minister, making them counterpart on the international affair circuit. Lawyers for the prime minister's former deputy, now his most prominent opponent, went to court Thursday to demand their client's release from indefinite detention. Azizah Ismail, the wife of jailed politician Anwar Ibrahim, told reporter that the lawyer had filed a habeas corpus appeal that say the dissident politician is being unjustly held. She said authority have denied lawyer access to her husband, and asked: How are they going to prepare for his defense? Anwar, 51, wa arrested Sept. 20 under the Internal Security Act, which allows indefinite detention without trial, after two week of rally around Malaysia at which he called for government reform and Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad's resignation. Anwar wa sacked on Sept. 2 from his post a deputy prime minister and finance minister, after he had differed with Mahathir on policy for escaping economic recession. But the prime minister said the deputy wa fired because he wa morally unfit. Anwar said Mahathir viewed him a a threat. Anwar since ha been charged with corruption and illegal homosexual act, and is to go on trial Nov. 2. He ha pleaded innocent to all the charge, which he say were trumped up by his political enemy. We claim that his detention is illegal and we'll prove that in court, said one of Anwar's lawyer, Pawancheek Marican. He said the lawyer had asked the High Court for an early hearing on the request for Anwar's release. When Anwar appeared in court Monday, the judge had assured defense attorney that they would have access to their client so that they could prepare their argument for the trial. Azizah said authority have spurned all her request for family member to visit her husband on ground that Anwar's case wa still under police investigation. I pleaded with the police to allow the child to see their father, she told reporter at the courthouse. I told them that I don't have to see my husband. But please let my son go and see him. But the police said no. Although Anwar remains in custody at the Bukit Aman federal police headquarters in Kuala Lumpur, all but five of those arrested under the ISA for participating in activity and rally organized by Anwar have been released. Sidek Baba, deputy rector of the International Islamic University, wa released Wednesday after 16 day in jail. I may have been detained because I knew Anwar during my involvement with the Malaysian Islamic Youth Movement, Sidek wa quoted a saying by The Star daily. Despite the recent protest against him, Prime Minister Mahathir said Wednesday that support for his ruling party remains strong and there have been no defection from the party, which claim a membership of 2.4 million in a nation of 22 million. He ruled out an early election to prove his popularity. A general election is not scheduled until 2000. Support is solid, said Mahathir. There is no exodus from the party. This week, Mahathir declined to name a replacement for Anwar, who had been Malaysia's deputy prime minister since 1993. The absence of a successor could lead to a power struggle in the event Mahathir is forced to resign or dy, because there is no clear line of succession. Mahathir, 72, underwent heart bypass surgery in 1989.

15,"The United States and Russia are ratcheting up the pressure on President Slobodan Milosevic, warning that NATO airstrikes are inevitable unless he take decisive action soon to end the humanitarian crisis in the southern Serbian province. Fearing airstrikes, Yugoslav general put the nation's air defense on high alert, but tried a belated compromise by moving some tank and other heavy equipment out of Kosovo. A Western diplomat said up to 120 Yugoslav army armored vehicle, including tank, have been pulled out. In Brussels, Belgium, however, US. special envoy Richard Holbrooke told reporter Monday that the situation in Kosovo ha not improved. Holbrooke is en route to Belgrade for a meeting with Milosevic. While the level of fighting (in Kosovo) may have abated temporarily, the capacity for it resumption is there, Holbrooke said after a meeting with NATO Secretary General Javier Solana and Supreme Allied Commander Europe Wesley K. Clark. The situation therefore remains fully a serious today a it wa a week or two ago, he said. We hope to make clear to President Milosevic and the people of Yugoslavia the extreme gravity of the situation. On Sunday, Milosevic met with Russian Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov and Defense Minister Igor Sergeyev, Serbian President Milan Milutinovic and Yugoslavia's top defense official. The Russians are against using NATO force in Kosovo. However, Ivanov and Sergeyev said the airstrikes could occur if decisive measure are not immediately taken for a radical improvement of the situation, Foreign Ministry spokesman Vladimir Rakhmanin told the ITAR-Tass news agency. To avoid such an attack, Yugoslavia must end the hostility, withdraw army and security force, take urgent measure to overcome the humanitarian crisis, ensure that refugee can return home and take part in peace talk, he said. In Berlin, 7th graf pvs With NATO attack said to be only day away, top US. envoy Richard Holbrooke delivered an 11th-hour warning Monday to Yugoslavia's president to halt his crackdown on ethnic Albanians in Kosovo or face airstrikes. But there wa no sign that Slobodan Milosevic wa backing down. Following his meeting with Holbrooke, Milosevic's office issued a statement denouncing NATO threat a a criminal act which favored separatist ethnic Albanian guerrilla. The statement, broadcast by government television, said there had been no fighting in the Serbian province for the past seven day and that the crisis represented no threat to other country in the southern Balkans. Holbrooke, the US. ambassador-designate to the United Nations, met with Milosevic for several hour late Monday after arriving from Brussels, Belgium, where he conferred with senior NATO official. There wa no statement from Holbrooke after the meeting. Before boarding a plane for Belgrade, however, Holbrooke said condition in the southern Serbian province had not improved since the alliance started two week ago to finalize plan for air raid to force Milosevic to halt his offensive against Kosovo Albanian separatist. Holbrooke said he planned to drive home to Milosevic the extreme gravity of the situation. Holbrooke negotiated the peace deal with Milosevic and other Balkan leader that ended the 3 and one-half year Bosnian war in 1995. In Washington, President Clinton expressed concern that Milosevic wa playing the classic game of making false promise to avoid NATO military strike. Clinton, in a telephone call with Russian President Boris Yeltsin, said Milosevic's compliance with UN. demand must be verifiable, tangible and irreversible, press secretary Joe Lockhart said at the White House. What happens next depends on President Milosevic, Lockhart quoted the president telling the Russian leader, who ha opposed the use of force against Moscow's longtime ally. As Holbrooke tried to resolve the crisis through negotiation, British Foreign Secretary Robin Cook said a decision on NATO military action wa imminent. We are getting ready for NATO action and later this week we will expect a decision to be taken, Cook told reporter after a special session of the Cabinet called by Prime Minister Tony Blair. In Brussels, NATO official said they were ready to launch airstrikes within hour of receiving an order to attack. If that first airstrike failed to deter Serb force, a senior NATO official said on condition of anonymity, the alliance could unleash a fully fledged air campaign involving hundred of plane. At the United Nations, Secretary-General Kofi Annan said Yugoslav force had increased their attack on Kosovo's ethnic Albanians even after a UN. resolution demanded a cease-fire. In a widely anticipated report to the Security Council, Annan listed apparent violation of a Sept. 23 UN. resolution, decried the appalling atrocity in Kosovo, and said it wa clear beyond any reasonable doubt that Yugoslav force were responsible for the bulk of them. The UN. chief also said rebel force of the Kosovo Liberation Army also were responsible for human right violation, a charge the KLA quickly denied. NATO country had been awaiting the UN. chief's report to determine whether to use military force to stop the offensive on ethnic Albanians, who are seeking autonomy like they had until 1989, if not independence, from Yugoslavia. Albanians in the province outnumber Serbs 9-to-1. Despite Annan's unwillingness to declare Serb noncompliance, State Department spokesman James Foley said the Clinton administration believed Milosevic had not met the condition laid down by the Security Council. Briefing reporter in Washington, Foley cited the absence of a formal cease-fire, the failure to arrange a meaningful dialogue with ethnic Albanian leader and the continued presence of major army unit in southeastern Kosovo near Albania's border. Meanwhile, Yugoslavia's prime minister told an emergency session of parliament Monday that the country is faced with the imminent danger of war. Yugoslavia is comprised of dominant Serbia and smaller Montenegro. The threat are serious, Prime Minister Momir Bulatovic said. And I call on this parliament to conclude that Yugoslavia is faced with the imminent danger of war. Yugoslavia ha to defend itself if it wa attacked. One option wa for parliament to declare a state of emergency a step toward a mobilization of all military-aged men. But the parliament voted to introduce the measure when the first bomb drop on our territory. In an attempt to head off NATO action, Bulatovic said the government had accepted a Russian proposal for an investigation by the 54-nation Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe. Yugoslavia had repeatedly rejected such a mission to Kosovo until Yugoslav membership in the organization is restored. The prime minister also said there wa no longer any fighting in Kosovo, which ha 2 million resident. He said five of the 10 special police unit had been removed from Kosovo and the others had been returned to their barrack in the province. One diplomat in Kosovo, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said there ha been a significant redeployment of Yugoslav army troop out of Kosovo to other part of Serbia, including a mechanized brigade that pulled out Sunday. Some army unit remain in the field, and there is enormous fear that violence will resume, particularly among refugee, ten of thousand of whom are living in the hill and forest without shelter. The United States and Russia are ratcheting up the pressure on Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic, warning that NATO airstrikes are inevitable unless he take decisive action to end the crisis in Kosovo province. Fearing airstrikes, Yugoslav general put the nation's air defense on high alert, but tried a belated compromise by moving some tank and other heavy equipment out of Kosovo. A Western diplomat said up to 120 Yugoslav army armored vehicle, including tank, have been pulled out. However, US. envoy Richard Holbrooke said Monday that the Kosovo situation remains critical despite a lull in fighting and the removal of some Yugoslav tank and troop. Holbrooke spoke in Brussels, Belgium, en route to Belgrade to meet with Milosevic. We hope to make clear to president Milosevic and the people of Yugoslavia the extreme gravity of the situation, Holbrooke said after a meeting with NATO leader. Holbrooke said he wa told that NATO preparation continued unabated. At NATO, the planning for military action is serious, intense and sustained, he said. Serbian police and the Yugoslav army have routed separatist Kosovo Albanian rebel in the crackdown that began in late February. The conflict ha killed hundred most of them Albanian civilian and left more than 275,000 refugee. Kosovo is in southern Serbia, the main republic of Yugoslavia. Milosevic met Sunday with Russian Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov and Defense Minister Igor Sergeyev, Serbian President Milan Milutinovic and Yugoslavia's top defense official. The Russians are against using NATO force in Kosovo. However, Ivanov and Sergeyev said the airstrikes could occur if decisive measure are not immediately taken for a radical improvement of the situation, Foreign Ministry spokesman Vladimir Rakhmanin told the ITAR-Tass news agency. To avoid such an attack, Yugoslavia must end the hostility, withdraw army and security force, take urgent measure to overcome the humanitarian crisis, ensure that refugee can return home and take part in peace talk, he said. In Berlin, German Gen. Dieter Stoeckmann told German radio that NATO action could come within day. NATO's decision may depend on a report UN. Secretary-General Kofi Annan is scheduled to present Monday to the Security Council on whether Yugoslavia is meeting UN. demand. Serb authority appeared ready for compromise by installing an interim government in the rebellious province in Serbia, the dominant republic in Yugoslavia. On Monday, Yugoslav Prime Minister Momir Bulatovic said the government had accepted a Russian proposal for the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe to investigate the crisis. Yugoslavia had repeatedly rejected such a mission until it membership in the 54-nation organization is restored. Bulatovic also claimed there wa no longer any fighting in the secessionist, majority Albanian province. He said five of the 10 special police unit had been removed from Kosovo and the others had been returned to barrack in the province. A Yugoslav statement said the nation's leader wanted the Kosovo dispute solved peacefully, but in case we are attacked, we shall defend our country with all mean. One option could be for parliament to declare a state of emergency a step which could lead to a general mobilization of all military-aged men. The head of Yugoslavia's other republic, Montenegro, on Monday urged Milosevic to accept all international demand and avert a NATO attack. We have to avert a clash with the whole world, a confrontation which we are bound to lose, Montenegro's pro-Western president, Milo Djukanovic, said in a statement. With the threat of NATO attack mounting, Yugoslavia's prime minister warned Monday the nation face the imminent danger of war and claimed the government is taking step to comply with international demand for peace in Kosovo. But NATO Secretary-General Javier Solana told reporter that the Alliance believed Yugoslavia had not yet met the condition demanded by the UN. Security Council. The reality coming to u is that the compliance is not yet in place, Solana said. As far a we are concerned, once again, I can tell you we are ready. In New York, UN. Secretary-General Kofi Annan said systematic terror had been inflicted on Kosovo civilian within recent day and that Yugoslav force were mostly responsible. But Annan said he did not have the mean necessary to provide an independent assessment of compliance a required by the Security Council and suggested the 15 member may want to make their own judgement in this respect. Following a meeting with Solana in Brussels, Belgium, US. special envoy Richard Holbrooke said the situation in the southern Serbian province wa a bad now a two week ago. Holbrooke said he would tell Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic of the extreme gravity of the situation. Sources speaking on condition of anonymity said Holbrooke arrived in Belgrade late Monday afternoon and wa expected to meet Milosevic in the evening. BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) US. special envoy Richard Holbrooke said Monday the military situation in Kosovo wa a bad now a two week ago. Holbrooke said he will explain the extreme gravity of the situation when he meet Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic later Monday. Speaking after a meeting with NATO Secretary General Javier Solana and Supreme Allied Commander Europe Wesley K. Clark, Holbrooke said while the level of fighting (in Kosovo) may have abated temporarily, the capacity for it resumption is there. The situation therefore remains fully a serious today a it wa a week or two ago, he told reporter before flying to Belgrade. He plan to meet with the Kosovan Albanian leader on Tuesday. We hope to make clear to president Milosevic and the people of Yugoslavia the extreme gravity of the situation, he said. Under NATO threat to end his punishing offensive against ethnic Albanian separatist in Kosovo, President Slobodan Milosevic of Yugoslavia ha ordered most unit of his army back to their barrack and may well avoid an attack by the alliance, military observer and diplomat say. Milosevic, who on one hand is excoriated by Washington a the scourge of Kosovo yet on the other hand is treated a key to peace in Bosnia, acted a the European Union, NATO and the United Nations prepared for a review on Monday of possible military intervention. Russia stepped up it warning against such action and dispatched it foreign and defense minister on an unusually high-level mission to see the Yugoslav president Sunday in Belgrade. As he ha so often, Milosevic appears to have bowed to foreign demand in the nick of time and yet still accomplished what he wanted. This weekend, foreign diplomatic observer in Kosovo reported that a military stand-down had taken place in the province, where Milosevic's force have waged a fierce offensive against Albanian rebel. The observer said that except for segment of three brigade, most unit of the Yugoslav army were home. The daily report of the observer mission, made up of U.S., European Union and Russian military expert, are one of the key element in helping Washington and European capital decide whether Milosevic ha met their demand for a cease-fire. By putting the army back in it barrack, sending some police unit out of Kosovo and ordering an end to burning and looting of village, Milosevic may well avoid a NATO attack, diplomat here and in Washington said. But at the same time, they acknowledge that while NATO looked the other way, he enjoyed a three-month license to overwhelm the Kosovo Liberation Army the rebel army fighting for independence for Kosovo and it ethnic Albanian majority and terrorize the rural civilian population that support it. His military operation created more than 250,000 refugee, whom the Clinton administration is gearing up to take care of this winter through a variety of relief organization. US. official said they expected Richard Holbrooke, the US. envoy who dealt with Milosevic in negotiating an end to the war in Bosnia, to meet with him on Monday to discus a political plan for Kosovo. The heart of the disagreement in Kosovo is between Serbia, Yugoslavia's principal republic, which insists on keeping Kosovo a a province, and the ethnic Albanians there who have chafed under Milosevic's repression since he stripped the province of virtual autonomy in 1989, and who now seek independence. The West, fearing the precedent that independence for Kosovo would set in other conflict in the world, ha been trying to mediate a middle course. In essence, diplomat said they believed that the plan Holbrooke will present to Milosevic call for a three-year interim period leading to a status fairly close to the pre-1989 autonomy arrangement. Since the Kosovo conflict flared up in March, critic of Washington's policy toward Milosevic argue that he ha been able to choreograph every move to suit his goal: pushing the Albanian population into submission with impunity. The United States and it ally have waited four month while he cleaned the clock of the Kosovo Liberation Army, said Morton Abramowitz, head of the International Crisis Group, a policy analysis organization, and taken three week to discus military action, with the result that 500 Albanian village were destroyed. Administration official now acknowledge that when NATO failed to live up to it earlier threat in June to strike Serbia, Milosevic took advantage of the indecision and plunged ahead with an artillery and tank offensive against the lightly armed guerrilla force, whose bedrock of popular support had helped win them effective control of large swath of Kosovo territory, including key road. While he wa doing that, Milosevic skillfully managed a key requirement for Washington: he made sure that the war did not spill over into neighboring Albania and Macedonia, fragile country in a traditionally volatile area. All along, the biggest fear in Washington ha been that the Kosovo conflict would engulf neighboring country and encourage Albania and the ethnic Albanian population in Macedonia to join the cause. Such a possibility raised the specter of a new Balkans conflict just three year after peace wa secured in Bosnia. Milosevic catered to Washington's concern that the conflict be contained. The Yugoslav army mined Kosovo's border with Macedonia and Albania, ensuring that few refugee could escape and limiting route for arm supply for the rebel. The Yugoslav leader also understood that Washington wa unsure about how to deal with the disorganized Albanian political leadership in Kosovo and the unbending Kosovo Liberation Army, whose main chief were hardened emigre returned from Switzerland and Germany. For example, Holbrooke persuaded Milosevic to meet in May with Ibrahim Rugova, the top Albanian political leader in Kosovo, an encounter that turned out to be little more than a photo opportunity. For that procedural breakthrough, Holbrooke recommended the lifting of a ban on foreign investment in Serbia that had been put in place the month before. After meeting with Rugova, Milosevic stepped up his military operation in Kosovo, forcing Washington to reverse itself again and carry out the investment ban. In late June, Holbrooke met with two self-styled Kosovo guerrilla commander in the province's western town of Junik but then broke off all contact. Clinton administration official said at the time that they were concerned that NATO intervention would bolster the separatist force. To try to put the best face on the situation, Washington worked with Moscow to get Milosevic to accept the presence of international monitor who would patrol Kosovo and report on military action. The monitor were slow in getting organized. By August, when the Yugoslav army, backed by the Serbian special police, were in full swing against the rebel and burning and looting village in the process, the monitor found it difficult to gain access to the fighting. They drove up to roadblock, knew something wa going on from the sound and the smoke, but could not be precise. In recent day a the tank and artillery have withdrawn, access ha improved, the monitor say. But there are some area in central Kosovo around Likovac and Gornje Obrinje that the monitor have ruled off limit because of land mine on the road. The mine are believed to have been planted by the guerrilla. Gornje Obrinje wa the site of a massacre of 18 ethnic Albanian woman, child and elderly people on Sept. 26. A British reporter who walked across field into the village on Sunday said about 10 mortar shell, apparently from the Serbian police or the Yugoslav army, were fired at the village early Sunday afternoon. The Yugoslav army and police force have been responsible for the vast majority of atrocity in the Kosovo conflict, said a report by New York-based group Human Rights Watch, released here on Sunday. The report said the rebel had also violated the law of war by taking civilian hostage and carrying out summary execution. But the violation by the guerrilla were on a lesser scale than the government abuse, the author of the report, Fred Abrahams, concluded. The report focused on what it called a watershed in the conflict the attack by police force on three ethnic Albanian village in late February and early March in the Drenica region of central Kosovo. At least 83 people, including 24 woman and child, were killed in the attack, which involved helicopter, artillery and armored personnel carrier. In the Yugoslav capital, Belgrade, which is a four-hour drive north through rolling countryside from Kosovo's capital of Pristina, Milosevic remains politically secure. That is in part, his domestic critic say, because diplomat like Holbrooke and the head of the U.N.refugee agency, Sadako Ogata, insist on going to see him, thus enhancing his stature. The American envoy Richard Holbrooke met with President Slobodan Milosevic of Yugoslavia Monday night and according to American diplomat told him that he had to take further step to pull back his military in Kosovo Province or face a NATO attack. Milosevic wa also told, the diplomat said, that he had to insure that the roughly 250,000 ethnic Albanian refugee who have been forced to flee their home in the fighting in the last six month be allowed to return home. Most of these refugee are reluctant to return because many of the Serb police officer who destroyed their home and village remain in the neighborhood. After delivering his sternest message so far to Milosevic over the Kosovo conflict, Holbrooke said at a news conference that NATO's military plan for attacking Serbia were moving ahead on a serious, intense and sustained basis. Holbrooke's mission to Milosevic wa described by the American diplomat a not a do or die trip, but they added, We're at a very serious juncture. Shortly after Holbrooke's meeting with Milosevic, the Yugoslav leader issued a defiant statement on Serbian television in which he said the threat of aggression outlined by Holbrooke represented a criminal act. Milosevic, who rarely comment about his meeting with foreign diplomat and whose tough word cast an unusually ominous tone, also said that Holbrooke's position constituted support for Albanian terrorist and not the Albanian people. Milosevic wa apparently accusing Holbrooke of supporting the ethnic Albanian guerrilla of the Kosovo Liberation Army, who have been fighting to make the Serbian province of Kosovo an independent nation. The Yugoslav leader added that for more than seven day there have been no skirmish or military action. An American diplomat familiar with the theme Holbrooke planned to stress to Milosevic said there had been no expectation that the American envoy would walk out Monday night with an agreement. Rather, the point wa to underscore to the Yugoslav leader and make explicit what wa expected of him. It wa not quite an ultimatum, the diplomat said, but more a matter of what step have to be taken to show compliance. The essence of Holbrooke's demand centered on issue outlined in a United Nations Security Council resolution of two week ago. The resolution ordered Milosevic to withdraw the extra army and police force that were sent to Kosovo to deal with the guerrilla and to send back to their base the military force normally stationed in the province. So far, American diplomat said, Milosevic ha withdrawn troop from the field but not all of them are in their barrack. Such a move is essential, American diplomat said, to create a conducive atmosphere for any possible negotiation on the future status of the province. The UN. resolution also call for a political solution. Holbrooke and the US. ambassador to Macedonia, Christopher Hill, discussed with Milosevic a political document drawn up by the State Department that call for broad autonomy for Kosovo. Milosevic withdrew the autonomy in 1989 a he began his campaign of Serb nationalism. The countryside in central Kosovo ha been eerily silent since last Thursday. The sound of artillery thud and mortar round have been noticeably absent and the coil of white smoke that signified burning village have vanished from the green hill and valley. Police checkpoint are more relaxed and area that were sealed off this time last week by the Yugoslav army are now open to the patrol of diplomatic monitor from the United States, European Union and Russia. These monitor, many of whom are former military officer, have reported that the Yugoslav army ha stood down and that they have seen virtually no military action since late last week. There ha been sporadic shooting, the monitor have reported. But this superficial calm is not good enough because the Serb military ha the capacity to resume fighting very quickly, a NATO military officer said Monday. The officer added that a cease-fire in Kosovo is pretty much enacted. He also said that the trend toward compliance is positive. The interior ministry police must also reduce their presence around village so that refugee who have fled have the confidence to return, the military officer said. Some interior ministry police officer had left the province, but not enough, he added. On the question of how badly damaged the KLA had been by the Yugoslav army's three-month offensive, the NATO officer said, It's a fair assessment that the KLA is dismantled but not destroyed. Holbrooke's first stop Monday wa Brussels, where he met with the secretary-general of NATO, Javier Solana. On Tuesday he plan to travel to Pristina, the capital of Kosovo, where he is scheduled to meet with the ethnic Albanian leader Ibrahim Rugova to present the political proposal for the future status of Kosovo. He is expected back in Belgrade on Tuesday afternoon for another session with Milosevic. The United States and Russia are ratcheting up the pressure on President Slobodan Milosevic, warning that NATO airstrikes are inevitable unless he take decisive action soon to end the humanitarian crisis in the southern Serbian province. Fearing airstrikes, Yugoslav general put the nation's air defense on high alert, but tried a belated compromise by moving some tank and other heavy equipment out of Kosovo. A Western diplomat said up to 120 Yugoslav army armored vehicle, including tank, have been pulled out. In Brussels, Belgium, however, US. special envoy Richard Holbrooke told reporter Monday that the situation in Kosovo is a bad now a two week ago. Holbrooke is en route to Belgrade for a meeting with Milosevic. While the level of fighting (in Kosovo) may have abated temporarily, the capacity for it resumption is there, Holbrooke said after a meeting with NATO Secretary General Javier Solana and Supreme Allied Commander Europe Wesley K. Clark. The situation therefore remains fully a serious today a it wa a week or two ago, he said. We hope to make clear to president Milosevic and the people of Yugoslavia the extreme gravity of the situation. On Sunday, Milosevic met with Russian Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov and Defense Minister Igor Sergeyev, Serbian President Milan Milutinovic and Yugoslavia's top defense official. The Russians are against using NATO force in Kosovo. However, Ivanov and Sergeyev said the airstrikes could occur if decisive measure are not immediately taken for a radical improvement of the situation, Foreign Ministry spokesman Vladimir Rakhmanin told the ITAR-Tass news agency. To avoid such an attack, Yugoslavia must end the hostility, withdraw army and security force, take urgent measure to overcome the humanitarian crisis, ensure that refugee can return home and take part in peace talk, he said. In Berlin, German Gen. Dieter Stoeckmann told German radio that NATO action could come within day. NATO's decision may depend on a report UN. Secretary-General Kofi Annan is scheduled to present to the Security Council Monday on whether Yugoslavia is meeting UN. demand. Serb authority appeared ready for compromise by installing an interim government in the rebellious province in Serbia, the dominant republic in Yugoslavia. Serbian police and the Yugoslav army have routed separatist Kosovo Albanian rebel in the crackdown that began in late February. The conflict ha killed hundred most of them Albanian civilian and left more than 275,000 refugee. A Yugoslav statement said the nation's leader wanted the Kosovo dispute solved peacefully, but in case we are attacked, we shall defend our country with all mean. The government said Friday that the fighting had ended and blamed continuing violence on ethnic Albanian rebel, who are fighting for independence for the Serbian province. Although the United States and Europeans want an end to the fighting, they also oppose independence for the majority Albanian province, fearing that could destabilize other Balkan country with Albanian population. In the Kosovo capital Pristina, the KLA offered to help NATO force if asked. KLA spokesman Jakup Krasniqi said in a statement published Monday by the Albanian language newspaper Bujku that we wish they (airstrikes) would become reality and we shall provide assistance. if it is asked of u. Krasniqi accused ethnic Albanian politician of having given up on independence and having become the servant of the enemy, by agreeing to accept autonomy but not independence. Serbs reported two attack Sunday on civilian car by Albanian terrorist 25 mile (40 kilometer) south of Pristina, Kosovo's provincial capital. Elsewhere, a policeman wa killed after stepping on a mine, the Serb Media Center said. The Kosovo Information Center, allied with the ethnic Albanians, reported heavy fighting between government force and the guerrilla 25 mile (40 kilometer) southwest of Pristina. Ethnic Albanian political leader have rejected the new interim government, which wa drawn up without their participation. The council is composed of seven Serbs, five ethnic Albanians and the rest Turks and Muslims. Momentum for outside involvement ha increased in the past week amid revelation of massacre of ethnic Albanian civilian in the forest of Kosovo. London's Sunday Telegraph reported that Britain is preparing troop and armored unit for Kosovo, to be deployed in a post-airstrike peacekeeping role. The defense ministry refused to confirm or deny the report but repeated that Britain wa ready to participate in a NATO attack. French Foreign Minister Hubert Vedrine met Sunday night with his British counterpart, Robin Cook, to discus the situation in Kosovo, France's Foreign Ministry said. Vedrine and Secretary of State Madeleine Albright had a lengthy telephone conversation a well, the spokesman said. On Sunday, Human Rights Watch said both Milosevic's government and ethnic Albanian rebel have committed atrocity since the conflict began, but the government abuse were on a much greater scale. The report by the New York-based human right organization say Milosevic ha the primary responsibility for gross government abuse. With the threat of NATO attack mounting, Yugoslavia's prime minister warned Monday the nation face the immiment danger of war and claimed the government wa taking step to comply with international demand for peace in Kosovo. In New York, UN. Secretary-General Kofi Annan said systematic terror had been inflicted on Kosovo civilian within recent day and that Yugoslav force were mostly responsible. But Annan said he did not have the mean necessary to provide an independent assessment of compliance a required by the Security Council and suggested the 15 member may want to make their own judgement in this respect. But US. special envoy Richard Holbrooke said the situation in the southern Serbian province wa a bad now a two week ago. Holbrooke spoke in Brussels, Belgium en route to Belgrade, where he planned to drive home to Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic the extreme gravity of the situation. Meanwhile, Yugoslavia's prime minister told an emergency session of parliament Monday that the country is faced with the imminent danger of war. Kosovo is a province of Serbia, the main republic of Yugoslavia. The threat are serious, Prime Minister Momir Bulatovic said. And I call on this parliament to conclude that Yugoslavia is faced with the imminent danger of war. Yugoslavia ha to defend itself if it wa attacked. One option could be for parliament to declare a state of emergency a step which could lead to a general mobilization of all military-aged men. In an attempt to head off NATO action, Bulatovic said the government had accepted a Russian proposal for the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe to investigate the crisis. Yugoslavia had repeatedly rejected such a mission to Kosovo until Yugoslav membership in the 54-nation organization is restored. Bulatovic also claimed there wa no longer any fighting in the rebellious, majority Albanian province. He said five of the 10 special police unit had been removed from Kosovo and the others had been returned to barrack in the province. In Brussels, however, Holbrooke made clear that half-measures would not be enough to satisfy Washington and prevent a NATO attack. While the level of fighting may have abated temporarily, the capacity for it resumption is there, Holbrooke said after a meeting with NATO Secretary General Javier Solana and Supreme Allied Commander Europe Wesley K. Clark. The situation, therefore, remains fully a serious today a it wa a week or two ago, he said. We hope to make clear to president Milosevic and the people of Yugoslavia the extreme gravity of the situation. Meanwhile, the head of Yugoslavia's other republic, Montenegro, called on Milosevic to accept all international demand and avert a NATO attack. We have to avert a clash with the whole world, a confrontation which we are bound to lose, Montenegro's pro-Western president, Milo Djukanovic, said in a statement. Djukanovic, a staunch Milosevic critic, called on the Yugoslav president to address the nation with an unambiguous message that he ha accepted all UN. resolution and agreement he made with Russian President Boris Yeltsin. Djukanovic blamed Yugoslavia's problem on Milosevic's undemocratic regime. Fearing airstrikes, Yugoslav general put the nation's air defense on high alert and moved some tank and other heavy equipment out of Kosovo. A Western diplomat said up to 120 Yugoslav army armored vehicle, including tank, have been pulled out. Belgrade had been counting on Russia to block any U.N.-sanctioned military move by the Western Alliance. On Sunday, Milosevic met with Russian Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov and Defense Minister Igor Sergeyev, Serbian President Milan Milutinovic and Yugoslavia's top defense official. Although the Russians are against using NATO force in Kosovo, Ivanov and Sergeyev said the airstrikes could occur if decisive measure are not immediately taken for a radical improvement of the situation, Foreign Ministry spokesman Vladimir Rakhmanin told the ITAR-Tass news agency. To avoid such an attack, Yugoslavia must end the hostility, withdraw army and security force, take urgent measure to overcome the humanitarian crisis, ensure that refugee can return home and take part in peace talk, he said. In Berlin, German Gen. Dieter Stoeckmann told German radio that NATO action could come within day. Serb authority appeared ready for compromise by installing an interim government in the rebellious province in Serbia, the dominant republic in Yugoslavia. Serbian police and the Yugoslav army have routed separatist Kosovo Albanian rebel in the crackdown that began in late February. The conflict ha killed hundred most of them Albanian civilian and left more than 275,000 refugee. Ethnic Albanians compromise 90 percent of the province's 2 million-strong population, and most favor independence or substantial self-rule. Momentum for outside involvement ha increased in the past week amid revelation of massacre of ethnic Albanian civilian in the forest of Kosovo. Although the United States and Europeans want an end to the fighting, they also oppose independence for Kosovo, fearing that could destabilize other Balkan country with Albanian population. In the Kosovo capital Pristina, the KLA offered to help NATO force if asked. KLA spokesman Jakup Krasniqi said in a statement published Monday by the Albanian language newspaper Bujku that we wish they (airstrikes) would become reality and we shall provide assistance. if it is asked of u. Krasniqi accused ethnic Albanian politician of having given up on independence and having become the servant of the enemy, by agreeing to accept autonomy but not independence. Ethnic Albanian political leader have rejected the new interim government, which wa drawn up without their participation. The council is composed of seven Serbs, five ethnic Albanians and the rest Turks and Muslims. With NATO attack said to be only day away, top US. envoy Richard Holbrooke delivered a last-minute warning Monday to Yugoslavia's president to halt his crackdown on ethnic Albanians in Kosovo or face airstrikes. But Slobodan Milosevic showed no sign of backing down. Following his meeting with Holbrooke, Milosevic's office issued a statement denouncing NATO threat a a criminal act that favored separatist ethnic Albanian guerrilla. The statement, broadcast by government television, said there had been no fighting in the Serbian province for the past seven day and that the crisis represented no threat to other country in the southern Balkans. Holbrooke, the US. ambassador-designate to the United Nations, met with Milosevic for several hour late Monday after arriving from Brussels, Belgium, where he conferred with senior NATO official. Holbrooke issued no statement after the meeting. Before boarding a plane for the Yugoslav capital, Belgrade, however, Holbrooke said condition in the southern Serbian province had not improved since the alliance started two week ago to finalize plan for air raid to force Milosevic to halt his offensive against Kosovo Albanian separatist. Holbrooke said he planned to drive home to Milosevic the extreme gravity of the situation. Holbrooke negotiated the peace deal with Milosevic and other Balkan leader that ended the 3 1/2 year Bosnian war in 1995. In Washington, US. President Bill Clinton expressed concern that Milosevic wa playing the classic game of making false promise to avoid NATO military strike. Clinton, in a telephone call with Russian President Boris Yeltsin, said Milosevic's compliance with UN. demand must be verifiable, tangible and irreversible, press secretary Joe Lockhart said at the White House. What happens next depends on President Milosevic, Lockhart quoted the president telling the Russian leader, who ha opposed the use of force against Moscow's longtime ally. As Holbrooke tried to resolve the crisis through negotiation, British Foreign Secretary Robin Cook said a decision on NATO military action wa imminent. We are getting ready for NATO action and later this week we will expect a decision to be taken, Cook told reporter after a special session of the Cabinet called by Prime Minister Tony Blair. In Brussels, NATO official said they were ready to launch airstrikes within hour of receiving an order to attack. If that first airstrike failed to deter Serb force, a senior NATO official said on condition of anonymity, the alliance could unleash a fully fledged air campaign involving hundred of plane. At the United Nations, Secretary-General Kofi Annan said Yugoslav force had increased their attack on Kosovo's ethnic Albanians even after a UN. resolution demanded a cease-fire. In a widely anticipated report to the Security Council, Annan listed apparent violation of a Sept. 23 UN. resolution, decried the appalling atrocity in Kosovo, and said it wa clear beyond any reasonable doubt that Yugoslav force were responsible for the bulk of them. The UN. chief also said rebel force of the Kosovo Liberation Army also were responsible for human right violation, a charge the KLA quickly denied. NATO country had been awaiting the UN. chief's report to determine whether to use military force to stop the offensive on ethnic Albanians, who are seeking autonomy like they had until 1989, if not independence, from Yugoslavia. Albanians in the province outnumber Serbs 9-to-1. Despite Annan's unwillingness to declare Serb noncompliance, US. State Department spokesman James Foley said the Clinton administration believed Milosevic had not met the condition laid down by the UN. Security Council. Foley cited the absence of a formal cease-fire, the failure to arrange a meaningful dialogue with ethnic Albanian leader and the continued presence of major army unit in southeastern Kosovo near Albania's border. The European Union nation were divided Monday on whether to launch air strike without UN. Security Council backing. The EU foreign minister, meeting in Luxembourg, agreed to tighten economic sanction against Milosevic, but it wa unlikely that stricter travel curb for Yugoslav official and freezing more Yugoslav asset abroad would be anything more than symbolic. Meanwhile, Yugoslavia's prime minister told an emergency session of parliament Monday that the country is faced with the imminent danger of war. Yugoslavia is comprised of dominant Serbia and smaller Montenegro. The threat are serious, Prime Minister Momir Bulatovic said. And I call on this parliament to conclude that Yugoslavia is faced with the imminent danger of war. Yugoslavia ha to defend itself if it wa attacked. One option wa for parliament to declare a state of emergency a step toward a mobilization of all military-aged men. But the parliament voted to introduce the measure when the first bomb drop on our territory. In an attempt to head off NATO action, Bulatovic said the government had accepted a Russian proposal for an investigation by the 54-nation Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe. Yugoslavia had repeatedly rejected such a mission to Kosovo until Yugoslav membership in the organization is restored. The prime minister also said there wa no longer any fighting in Kosovo, which ha 2 million resident. He said five of the 10 special police unit had been removed from Kosovo and the others had been returned to their barrack in the province. One diplomat in Kosovo, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said there ha been a significant redeployment of Yugoslav army troop out of Kosovo to other part of Serbia, including a mechanized brigade that pulled out Sunday. Some army unit remain in the field, and there is enormous fear that violence will resume, particularly among refugee, ten of thousand of whom are living in the hill and forest without shelter. ","Yugoslavia failed to comply with a U.N. resolution demanding that the forces sent to Kosovo to suppress the ethnic Albanian separatist uprising be withdrawn and is now threatened with NATO airstrikes.Though Milosevic moved some units from the Serbian province, U.S. special envoy Holbrooke called the situation serious.Russia, previously against a NATO attack, said the strikes could occur if steps aren't taken to end the crisis.Hundreds, mostly Albanian civilians, have been killed and thousands are refugees.While the U.S. and other nations want peace, they oppose Kosovo independence, fearing it could destabilize other Albanian-populated Balkan states.","Under threat of NATO attack, Milosevic orders back most army units.US envoy says situation is as grave as it was 2 weeks ago, despite temporary abatement of fighting.US and Russia increase pressure on Milosevic to end the humanitarian crisis in Kosovo or face NATO airstrikes.US envoy tells Milosevic to pull back his military and let Albanian refugees return home.Yugoslavia claims it is taking steps to comply with peace demands.However, NATO says that UN Security Council conditions have not yet been met.US envoy gives Milosevic last minute warning to halt ethnic crackdown in Kosovo.Milosevic calls NATO threat criminal act favoring guerrillas.","Yugoslav President Slbodan Milosevic does not appear to be complying completely with UN demands to withdraw his troops and stop anti-Albanian activity in Kosovo.U.S. special envoy Richard Holbrooke said the level of fighting may have abated but the situation is such that it could resume.The U.S. and Russia have ratcheted up pressure on Milosevic warning him of inevitable NATO air strikes.Yugoslavia claimed it ""is faced with the imminent danger of war"", will defend itself if attacked and called NATO's threats a ""criminal act"".Yugoslav generals put the nation's air defense on high alert then pulled some armored equipment out of Kosovo as a compromise.","On Oct. 4, 1998 Yugoslav President Milosevic ordered his forces in Kosovo back to their barracks.While supressing the Albanian independence movement they had massacred hundreds of civilians and left 275,000+ refugees.NATO threatened airstrikes unless hostilities ceased and peace talks began.U.S. envoy Holbrooke insisted that Milosevic pull all forces out of Kosovo.Milosevic called the NATO threat ""a criminal act"" and said Holbrooke aided Albanian terrorists.Russia also urged an end to hostilities, but the Yugoslavs denied any fighting and vowed to defend their country if attacked.Neither side budged as NATO seemed to wait for a U.N. decision."
17,"A North Korean man arrived in Seoul Wednesday and sought asylum after escaping his hunger-stricken homeland, government official said. Kim Myong Sup, 23, had been living in hiding in a third country since fleeing North Korea last year, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade said. The ministry generally us the term third country to avoid naming China, which is required by treaty with North Korea to return defector to their homeland. The ministry described Kim a a former athlete, but said detail of his background and his method of escape from North Korea were not available. About 200 North Koreans have defected to South Korea in the past three year, including 60 so far this year. All complained about severe food and fuel shortage in their country. The Koreas were divided into the communist North and the capitalist South in 1945. They fought the Korean War in 1950-53 and never signed a formal peace treaty. Hunger and malnutrition in Cambodia are reaching crisis level comparable to the effect of famine in North Korea, a UN. World Food Program representative said Tuesday. Though North Korea is suffering from a simple lack of food, a faltering economy in Cambodia combined with weak health care and education is causing similar level of malnutrition in child, said Ken Davies, the WFP's country director. There is enough rice. The problem is that people are too poor to access it. The problem is poverty, Davies said. The WFP is currently supporting 1.7 million hungry Cambodians about 15 percent of the population with food-for-work and direct assistance program, but Davies said he fear there are still plenty more that are not getting enough to eat every day. The problem is so bad that it is only a little worse in North Korea, Davies said. The situation is much worse than most people recognize. According to a recent WFP survey, 49 percent of Cambodian child under age 5 are stunted by lack of food and 20 percent suffer from acute malnutrition. By comparison, a similar survey of North Korean child under 7 found that 65 percent are stunted and 16 percent suffer from acute malnutrition. Cambodia ha produced a rice surplus for export in the last two year and expects another this year, but WFP statistic show that 25 percent of rice-growing area account for 75 percent of the surplus. The majority of Cambodian farmer are not producing enough to keep their family fed and are being increasingly saddled with debt incurred when they run out of reserve before harvest, Davies said. Money-lenders in rural Cambodia typically charge 100 percent interest, which must be paid in rice at harvest time, giving many farmer a handicapped start on the next crop season. Poor sanitation, lack of health care and ignorance of modern child rearing problem left mostly unaddressed by under-funded health and education sector in Cambodia have exacerbated the food security problem, Davies said. Davies urged the new government to substantially increase annual expenditure on health, education and rural development a a first step in a long-term solution to Cambodia's food crisis. The poverty is getting worse right now and the situation with the malnutrition of child is a crisis, Davies said. Cambodia typically earmark about half of it annual budget to defense and security. In the 1998 budget, education wa allocated 6.5 percent, health 4.4 percent and rural development 0.2 percent. Actual disbursement to the three ministry are often only 60 to 70 percent of the budgeted amount a annual revenue fall short of expectation, according to aid worker. A 1999 budget draft proposed a reduction of the health ministry's allotment, which caused an outcry in September from health official and the UN. World Health Program. The draft wa later readjusted to provide an unprecedented 33 percent increase in health spending. North Korea is entering it fourth winter of chronic food shortage with it people malnourished and at risk of dying from normally curable illness, senior Red Cross official said Tuesday. The official warned against international complacency and hostility toward North Korea a the food crisis stretch on and the isolated communist country show little willingness to adopt far-reaching change to revive it ruined economy. Humanitarian suffering cannot be routine in any part of the world, said Margareta Wahlstrom, the Red Cross' undersecretary of disaster relief, who returned to Beijing Tuesday after a week inspecting the aid agency's operation in North Korea. She and other Red Cross official saw further ravage of North Korea's slow-motion famine: electricity supplied to only half the capital, Pyongyang, at a time; the elderly looking swollen, a sign of long-term hunger; a generation of child stunted, with 10-year-olds looking like 6-year-olds and 5-year-olds like 2-year-olds. Everywhere, from bakery to government ministry, people were being served noodle and cake made from soybean mixed with acorn, grass and herb, Red Cross president Astrid Heiberg said. Heiberg likened the additive to cattle food and noted that doctor reported a rise in stomach illness from the mixture. This is really part of the daily life, she said. You would not give them to your child or your elderly mother knowing she would get cramp in her stomach and diarrhea unless her stomach wa moaning. Three year of flood and drought that started in 1995 devastated North Korea's collective farming and planned economy, already teetering from the loss of it Soviet bloc trading partner. With few good or money to barter or buy foreign supply, the country lack sufficient fertilizer for crop, and fuel and part for machinery. The Red Cross inspector saw soldier and people harvesting cabbage, the winter's main vegetable. The grain harvest is finished and by UN. estimate little improved over last year's: about 3 million ton, only enough to meet two-thirds of the need of North Korea's 22 million people. As the long, harsh winter begin, doctor confirm and official statistic show widespread malnutrition, tuberculosis on the rise and hunger-weakened patient unable to recover from operation and sickness, Heiberg said. Doctors worry that the respiratory illness so common in the winter may take a toll on the weakened population, she said. One 10-bed hospital in the countryside wa keeping only three patient at a time because it did not have food to care for more, said Heiberg. The Red Cross want to focus it latest dlrs 9 million appeal on getting essential medicine and blanket and warm clothes to North Korea. Food aid is largely being turned over to UN. agency. Despite catastrophic hunger at home, North Korea plan to send 317 athlete and official to next month's Asian Games in Thailand, South Korean official said Thursday. It will be the largest sport delegation the communist country ha sent abroad in recent year. North Korean Sports Minister Chang Ung said 209 athlete from his country will compete in 21 event in Bangkok, hoping to win medal in women's judo, women's soccer, wrestling, table tennis, weightlifting and boxing. Chang made the remark in an interview published recently by the Chosun Shinbo, a newspaper run by pro-North Korean resident in Japan, said Seoul's Naewoe Press, which obtained the report. Chang said North Korea wa sending a large delegation to Bangkok to prepare for the 2000 Sydney Olympics. North Korea did not enter the last Asian Games, in Hiroshima, Japan, in 1994. It sent only 18 athlete and official to the Winter Olympics in Nagano, Japan, in February. Naewoe is run by South Korea's main government intelligence agency and specializes in monitoring communist news medium. Three year of flood and drought that started in 1995 devastated North Korea's collective farming and planned economy, forcing the country to rely on outside aid to feed it 23 million people. Famine-threatened North Korea's harvest will be no better this year than last and could be worse, a senior UN. aid official said Saturday. North Korea need a minimum 4.5 million to 5 million ton of grain to feed it 23 million people, but managed last year to harvest just 2.8 million ton, Namanga Ngongi, deputy head of the World Food Program said. Although hard figure are not yet available, the prospect for this year are that the harvest will not be any better, Ngongi told reporter in Beijing after visiting North Korea. It may be worse than last year. Poor harvest, economic collapse and three year of flood and drought, have produced chronic food shortage in North Korea and left it heavily reliant on foreign aid. Fertilizer is lacking, a is fuel to power tractor and farm machinery, meaning most planting and harvesting must be done by hand. Every year it get worse, Ngongi said. But despite the need for food aid, Ngongi said the government about a month ago cut the number of county to which the WFP ha access from 171 to 145, reducing the number of people who can get aid from 6.7 million to 5.8 million. Most of those receiving WFP aid are child aged between 6 month and 6 year. Ngongi said the government cited security concern notably the lack of a peace treaty with it rival South Korea for it decision. The government said the ban would be temporary, Ngongi added. Ngongi, who spent four day inspecting WFP relief effort in North Korea, said people generally looked better than during a visit last year. But he also said he could see that a large part of the population is very weak. Everybody ha been consuming at a very low level. So they may not be severely malnourished, but they are not well nourished at all, he said. US. official who toured some of the hardest-hit region of North Korea this summer said 2 million people may have died because of famine. Ngongi said he saw malnourished child who were said to be 10 or 11 year old, but appeared to be only 4 or 5 year old. About 30 percent of child in one primary school he visited were not in class. A lot of the child were too weak to come to school, he said. But Ngongi said foreign food aid ha saved life. A lot of people are alive today thanks to the international community's support, he said. A congressman who visited remote part of North Korea last week said Saturday that the food and health situation there wa desperate and deteriorating, and that million of North Koreans might have starved to death in the last few year. The congressman, Tony Hall, D-Ohio, who ha had a longtime interest in world hunger, passed through Tokyo on his return to the United States and showed photograph he had taken of North Korean child with patchy hair, protruding bone, open sore and other sign of severe malnutrition. Hall also brought back a bag of what official called substitute food being distributed by a government food station: dried leaf and straw, so coarse that even cattle would normally turn away. They grind it into powder and make it into noodle, Hall said. The noodle have no nutrition and are indigestible, leaving people holding their aching stomach, he said. North Korea ha admitted that it is facing serious economic difficulty, but there have been sharply diverging assessment of how serious these are. Some visitor with the United Nations and other organization have said that the food situation seems to be a bit better now than a year or two ago. Hall said that the divergence might have arisen because in the North Korean capital, Pyongyang, life did seem to be slightly better than during his three previous trip to North Korea. But in rural area where foreigner are not often allowed to visit, he added, the overall situation is worse than ever. Based on visit to four hospital, Hall also emphasized that public health care had declined sharply. In one hospital, assistant were holding down a patient while surgeon conducted a stomach operation without electric light or anesthesia. Ordinary North Koreans are suffering, in part, because their government's hard-line policy have alienated would-be donor and aid agency. The United Nations ha repeatedly appealed for relief aid for North Korea, but the latest appeal ha raised le than one-third of the target. In September, Doctors Without Borders announced that it wa pulling it staff of 13 from North Korea because it feared that it aid wa going to the politically connected rather than to the most needy. North Korea doe not release mortality figure or health statistic, but Hall said that the United Nations had gathered and would soon release data indicating that 30 percent of North Korean child under age 2 are acutely malnourished and that 67 percent of all child are physically stunted. Hall said he thought that overall at least 1 million people had died and that the total wa probably closer to 3 million. In an indication of the seriousness with which professional demographer view the situation, the US. Bureau of the Census recently published estimate suggesting that North Korea's population peaked in 1995 at 21.55 million and ha since fallen to 21.23 million this year. That would be a decline of 320,000 over three year, a period when North Korea's population would have been expected to grow by about 925,000 people, based on the population growth rate of the early 1990s. Nicholas Eberstadt, an American specialist on North Korean population figure, say that there simply is not enough hard information for him to estimate the death toll from the famine. But he note one political tidbit: North Korea's constitution stipulates that there should be one delegate to the country's people's assembly for every 30,000 citizen. This year's assembly did not expand a previous one did, but rather had just 687 delegate, the same a the previous assembly held in 1990. While Eberstadt counsel caution, that could mean that North Korea's population, after eight year in which it had been expected to add several million people, is now back to 20.6 million people or fewer. The United States ha been supplying grain to North Korea, but strain are growing over a secret underground complex in the North that some expert worry may be the heart of a new nuclear weapon program. The United States warned last week that the agreed framework that is the basis for it relation with North Korea will be in jeopardy unless the North let American expert visit the underground complex and resolve their doubt. North Korea ha said that it will show off the complex only if Washington promise that if the complex is not a nuclear one, it will pay for vilifying u and impairing our prestige. Washington refuse to pay, and North Korea is warning that the standoff could lead the agreement to fall apart. Their shameless and wicked demand is an open infringement upon our sovereignty and wanton interference in our internal affair, declared North Korea's leading newspaper, Rodong Sinmun. More than five year of severe food shortage and a near-total breakdown in the public health system have led to devastating malnutrition in North Korea and probably left an entire generation of child physically and mentally impaired, a new study by international aid group ha found. The study, the first scientific nutritional survey in North Korea, confirms the disturbing report by international aid worker, who over the past year have gained increasing access to the population of this highly isolated and secretive country. Among other shocking finding, researcher from the World Food Program, Unicef and the European Union found that, because of long-term food shortage, a staggering 62 percent of child under 7 year old suffer from stunted growth. They have discovered that, despite a huge international food aid program over the past three year, severe malnutrition is widespread among toddler at crucial stage of brain development, suggesting that this generation's physical and mental ability will not develop normally and that the loss can never be recovered. Separately, international medical worker from group like the Red Cross, have begun to document how the effect of food shortage are being severely compounded by a breakdown in public health service. Even basic water purification system stand idle for lack of essential ingredient like chlorine, Red Cross worker say, leaving vast number of people with such severe diarrhea that they are unable to absorb completely what little food they have. As the North Korean dictatorship ha slowly, often grudgingly, granted increased access to international aid group in the last six month, an increasingly clear and saddening picture of the hunger haas emerged a a result of the large formal study and informal survey and observation by foreign aid agency. Past assessment of the magnitude of the disaster in the country of 23 million are considered flawed because they were based on interview with a small number of North Korean refugee who had fled into China. And while the researcher and aid worker on the ground in North Korea have not seen evidence of cannibalism or starving child dying by the roadside description that have surfaced in the more lurid refugee report what they did find wa in many way equally disturbing: A population withering after nearly a decade of chronic hunger, people so weakened by malnutrition that cold and stomach flu quickly turn lethal, the future of a generation irretrievably lost. Now at last we have hard fact the situation is very grave, said Judith Cheng-Hopkins, regional director for Asia of the World Food Program, which ha taken part in the research. To me this is a famine in slow motion. People cope year after year, and probably a lot drop off. But the totality is very hard to gauge. For three week this fall, crew led by foreign scientist were finally permitted to fan out across North Korea to conduct the first random sample nutritional survey of child, providing by far the most solid data on the crisis. They found that 62 percent of child under 7 had stunted growth, a symptom of long-term malnutrition. Thirty percent of 1-year-olds suffered from moderate to severe malnutrition. This mean a high likelihood of impaired mental and physical development, because the nervous system matures dramatically during this essential first year. The researcher said that available scientific data suggest that 10 year ago, malnutrition wa rare in North Korea. Even if the situation improves, it is unlikely to improve to the degree that the country will fully recover from what we saw, said Judit Katona-Apte, a senior program adviser for the World Food Program. People will be small and not a well developed a otherwise and somewhat limited in their mental capacity. Likewise, when Red Cross representative this year tested the water supply at the 840 hospital and clinic where they operate, they found that not one had water that wa suitable for human consumption, said Sten Swedlund, head of the Red Cross delegation in North Korea. But of course they drink it they have no choice, he said during a recent trip to Beijing. There is a very close relationship between the problem caused by the lack of food and a health sector that's in very bad shape. Virtually all the child under 7 who are malnourished also have diarrhea, he said. None of the aid group ha been able to study the issue of hunger-related death, and the North Koreans have not released relevant figure, although most expert agree that probably more than one million and perhaps a many a three million have died prematurely since the food shortage began. But public health expert say the number who have perished might be difficult to tally in any case, because most death were probably not from quick starvation, but from immune system weakened by year of hunger, so that common cold more easily give way to lethal pneumonia and an ordinary bout of infectious diarrhea prof fatal. Still, there are some disturbing clues: In one limited study conducted by the World Food Program and other group last year on 4,000 child hand-picked by the government, 10 percent had a parent who wa dead. In this fall's independent nutritional survey, 18 team of expert sent to eight of North Korea's nine province looked at 1,800 rural and urban child under seven. In addition to finding that 62 percent of child had stunted growth, the team found that about 16 percent of child were suffering from acute malnutrition and were underweight for their height, a sign that they were severely underfed at the time of the study. That figure is higher than in any country in East Asia and put North Korea among the world's worst 10 country in term of malnutrition. While that 16 percent figure is not quite a bad a that of India and Bangladesh, the worst in the world with an 18 percent malnutrition rate, expert say that North Korea's number in some way understates the problem. In India and Bangladesh, pocket of severe poverty alternate with pocket of relative plenty, while in North Korea the whole country is to some degree underfed. Even in war-torn country, famine is more in pocket, Dr. Katona-Apte said. It's hard to think of another country that's been affected in this way. The survey result are especially sobering since the researcher studied only child under 7, the group that received nearly all the food donated from abroad. After three year of food donation, many foreign aid worker in the country have remarked that child in nursery and kindergarten are looking better but that their older sibling are failing. So a month ago, the World Food Program began providing elementary school with high nutrition biscuit for child aged 7 to 12. We have reason to believe that many people are suffering and that the elderly are a neglected age group that is just getting weaker and weaker, Swedlund said. There are now more than 100 Westerners living in Pyongyang, the capital city, and many say the long-term hunger is readily apparent there. If you walk down the street in Pyongyang and ask a child how old she is, you are usually off by three year, Swedlund said. She may be 7 but she look just 3 or 4. Dr. Katona-Apte, a nutrition expert who ha worked in Bangladesh and the Sudan, said she wa shocked when she first visited a North Korean kindergarten last year. There were these two child sitting at a desk who were obviously severely malnourished they were so thin and they had patchy hair, she said. And they were just sitting there working. This is accepted a normal! They are in school, and they should really be hospitalized or placed in nutritional rehabilitation. If you saw them in a refugee camp, you would recommend immediate intervention. But with a severely depleted public health and hospital system, that option doe not exist, she and others said. Many Korean doctor do not know how to diagnose or treat malnutrition; few had seen it before this decade. And, in any case, the hospital lack the food and proper nutritional supplement. Swedlund said most hospital lacked medicine, had no glass to replace broken window and were colder inside than out, having received no coal since 1994. He said that even in hospital, sanitation and water purification system were virtually nonexistent, because the country lack chlorine for purification and fuel to run water pump. He said that next year, the Red Cross would start to address those problem, spending $3.5 on food for hospital patient and $1 million on water treatment. With few other option, vast number of North Koreans have resorted to eating substitute food, hard cake and noodle made from a mix of nutritional plant, like soybean and sweet potato, combined with indigestible filler, like cornstalk and straw. This now constitutes 40 percent of food intake, Swedlund said. It's becoming a regular part of the food basket. Doctors in North Korea say many people suffer from stomachache after eating this partly indigestible material, he said, but added, If you're very hungry, it fill your stomach. Although the North Koreans date their food problem to a series of flood and drought in the mid-1990's, the foreign researcher who have worked in North Korea say medical record and childhood growth pattern indicate that the hunger began several year before that and is linked to the collapse of the Soviet Union, which had long been North Korea's main supplier of food, fuel and fertilizer. North Korea is a mountainous country, with le than 20 percent arable land. It ha been a food importer for decade, mostly from the former Soviet Union, but also from China. The country ha to come to grip with the fact that this is part of a structural problem and can't just be blamed on the weather anymore, Ms. Cheng-Hopkins said. Still, she and others praised the normally rigid and secretive government for slowly loosening it restriction. Swedlund said that after three year in the country, the international Red Cross, which collaborates with the North Korean Red Cross, had found official increasingly responsive and doctor more willing to share medical record and bring up problem. Travel is still restricted. There are more than 100 county, home to 30 percent of the population, to which aid group have no access and where they have therefore refused to provide food or medical supply. Still, the number of county open to the worker ha increased steadily, and freedom to move about ha improved. Ms. Cheng-Hopkins said about half of follow-up inspection were now unannounced, and she noted that the researcher in the nutritional survey were allowed to select village to visit and enter home at random. Workers from the Red Cross and the World Food Program said they had not observed extreme scene of people dying of acute starvation and believe that they would have if they were occurring frequently. I have not seen acute starvation like I have seen in Bangladesh, Dr. Katona-Apte said. But that doesn't mean it can't exist. We're still really limited in what we can see. Swedlund said it wa unlikely that the county still closed to foreigner were markedly different from the open one. And while some have surmised that the closed county might harbor pocket of death and devastation, he said he accepted North Korea's explanation that they had been excluded from some area for national security reason. One thing I've learned is how important national security issue are to the North Koreans, said Swedlund, a retired admiral in the Swedish Navy. And I really think these area are important from that standpoint, he added, going through a map of closed area and describing what Western intelligence expert know about military installation there. He also rejected the notion that the North Korean military is stealing donated food, a charge leveled by the organization Doctors Without Borders, when it angrily pulled out of North Korea last summer to protest the many restriction on group working there. Now that aid group say they are starting to get somewhat better cooperation from the North Koreans, they hope to repeat their nutrition survey every 6 to 12 month. And they are still analyzing some tantalizing findings: Boys were twice a likely to suffer from stunted growth a girl, and every child whose mother wa dead wa malnourished. A generation of North Korean child is already scarred for life, said Astrid Heiberg, president of the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies, in an interview in Beijing after a trip to North Korea. We need to continue to mobilize resource to prevent an even greater catastrophe. The founder of South Korea's largest conglomerate plan to visit his native North Korea again next week with a gift of 501 cattle, company official said Thursday. The visit ha been delayed a month because of a dispute over 500 cattle donated by Chung Ju-yung, founder of the Hyundai group, during a trip to the North in June. North Korea claimed 71 of those cattle died because Seoul government agent force-fed them indigestible vinyl strip and lump of rope before shipping them to the North. Calling the North's claim nonsense, Seoul's Ministry of National Unification ordered Hyundai to check thousand of other cattle being raised at it ranch on the west coast. The ministry later acknowledged that lump of rope were found in the stomach of some cattle on the ranch, but said the material didn't kill the animal donated to North Korea. It blamed the death on stress caused by the long shipment by truck to the North. The South Korean government said it would not authorize a second shipment of cattle unless the North retracted it accusation. On Thursday, South Korean Unification Minister Kang In-duk said North Korea sent a letter to Hyundai last week, saying that the misunderstanding with the southern authority on the issue of the dead cattle is cleared. Kang said the North's letter cleared a stumbling block for Hyundai's additional cattle donation. During his visit, Chung is expected to reach agreement on detail of Hyundai's plan to start sightseeing tour of a scenic mountain in the North. The tour, originally scheduled to begin in September, have been delayed because of cost, security and other matter. Hyundai hope to send by ship up to 2,000 tourist a week for four-day tour of Diamond Mountain on the North's east coast beginning in November. Animosity and distrust between the two Koreas run deep. The Korean state were separated into the communist North and the capitalist South in 1945. They fought a three-year war in the early 1950s. Years of food shortage have stunted the growth of million of North Korean child, with two-thirds of child under age seven suffering malnourishment, UN. expert said Wednesday. Several year of flooding and drought coupled with an economic downturn have heavily damaged North Korea's crop production and capacity to import food in the closed, communist nation. A survey carried out in September and October also showed that 16 percent of child in North Korea are acutely malnourished, with a body weight too low for their height. That figure, which reflects ongoing shortage, is exceeded in Asia only by Bangladesh, India and Sri Lanka. Eighteen team, each headed by a foreign official from the World Food Program, the UN. Children's Fund or the European Union, carried out the study. They measured the weight and height of 1,800 North Korean child from infant up to age seven in home randomly selected in area where aid agency have access. Those area cover around 70 percent of the population. It wa the first technically sound survey of the problem, UNICEF official Kirsi Madi told reporter. The most alarming finding were for toddler aged one to two, 30 percent of whom were acutely malnourished. At that age, malnutrition can permanently impair physical and intellectual growth, said Judy Cheng-Hopkins, WFP director for the region. Children in North Korea's three largest city Pyongyang, Wonsan and Nampo were better off than their counterpart elsewhere, with 11 percent acutely malnourished. Boys were almost twice a badly affected a girl. Police in northeastern China's Jilin province said Monday they had rounded up at least 100 North Koreans and sent them back to endure a famine in their reclusive country. A police official in the Jilin city of Tonghua, near the North Korean border, said the North Koreans were forced to repatriate because some had resettled illegally in China, had formed criminal gang or engaged in prostitution. The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, denied report in the South Korean press that the Chinese had disregarded request for political asylum in forcing the refugee back across the border. He said they had crossed into China seeking food, not because of political repression in North Korea. Citing a North Korean human right group and Japanese tourist visiting the region, South Korea's Yonhap News Agency reported Monday that 150 North Koreans had been sent home from China, despite having presented petition for political asylum. North Korea is entering it fourth winter of chronic food shortage, having harvested only 3 million ton of grain this year, about two-thirds of the minimum needed by it 23 million people.

20,"Thai police have detained more than 300 beggar, most from neighboring country, in a campaign to make Bangkok's street safer for spectator and athlete arriving for the upcoming Asian Games, a senior police officer said Friday. Arrests were made throughout Bangkok during a four-day crackdown on panhandler. About 100 of those detained were displayed Friday to local and foreign press at a detention center in Bangkok. Most come here because of economic hardship, said Maj. Gen. Chanvut Vajrabukka, deputy commissioner for the immigration police. There are some beggar, however, who are under control of gangster. They could cause trouble for tourist and athlete. Other group targeted by police in advance of the Asian Games are foreign criminal gang believed to operate in Bangkok and other major city in Thailand. The Asian Games will be held from the Dec. 6-20. Saudi Arabia is considering sending a small team to the Bangkok Asian Games from which it pulled out unexpectedly this week, a Saudi official said Saturday. Saudi Arabia's top sport official, Prince Faisal bin Fahd, is studying a proposal by the Olympic Council of Asia to at least send a symbolic delegation to the Dec. 6-20 Games, said the official, speaking on condition of anonymity. The plea to reconsider wa made by Sheik Ahmad al-Fahd al Sabah, president of the Olympic Council of Asia. Sheik Ahmad, a member of the Kuwaiti royal family, is a friend of Prince Faisal. Saudi Arabia's sudden announcement Wednesday that it is withdrawing it 105-member team shocked host Thailand, who remain skeptical about the official reason offered. Saudi sport authority said the Games conflicted with national centenary celebration and the Muslim holy month of Ramadan. But observer point rather to Saudi anger at the failure of Thai authority to solve two, decade-old criminal case involving their nationals: the theft of dlrs 20 million worth of jewel from a Saudi prince and the murder of three Saudi diplomat in Bangkok. The case are widely believed to involve people high up in the power hierarchy, who in Thailand rarely face prosecution. Saudi Arabia ha in the past said relation would only be normalized when the two case were solved. Thai newspaper reported Saturday that attempt to convince Saudi Arabia to participate in the upcoming 13th Asian Games have failed. Thai Olympic Committee Chairman Gen. Chettha Thanajaro told the Bangkok Post he sent a last-minute plea to his Saudi counterpart but ha received no response. I have done my best. We have to respect their decision, he told the Post. The withdrawal ha thrown the Games' schedule into disarray. China's national soccer team could call back four player from overseas to boost it chance at the Asian Games in Thailand in December, an official newspaper reported Monday. Two of the player, Fan Zhiyi and Sun Jihai, play for Crystal Palace in the English First Division. Another, Yang Chen, play in Germany, while Li Jinyu is with Nantes in France. Englishman Bob Houghton, who coach the national team, said recalling Fan and Sun for the Asian Games would allow him to see if they can bring the thing they have learned recently in England to the national team, the China Sports Daily said. Houghton also said that Yang, who play in Frankfurt, very possibly could become an extremely important player in the national team, the newspaper reported. Li, who ha not had many chance to play since his move to France, also is very willing to come back, the newspaper said. China and South Korea will both field their Asian Games team at a friendly warm-up match Nov. 22, the newspaper said. The Asian Games are held every four year. Horses belonging to Iran's equestrian team will not be allowed to compete in next month's Asian Games because they failed to meet the requirement of the games' veterinary commission, the Thai organizer announced Thursday. The three horse originally came from Iran, but arrived in Thailand after a training period in the United States. They did not have the necessary health certificate guaranteeing that they are disease-free, said Siraya Chunekamrai, president of the Veterinary Commission for the game. This is the first Asian Games in which competitor have been allowed to bring their own horse from abroad. According to regulation, all participating horse had to be screened for a number of disease before arriving in Thailand. Siraya said she felt sorry for the Iranian team because the problem resulted from ignorance of the rule. Iran is the only country that did not pas the requirement. They are the most beautiful horse of all, she said. I am so sorry for the team but cannot allow them to compete because it is against the rule and it might affect other horses' good health. There is only one Thai horse available on standby for the Iranians, a Thailand wa not prepared for such a problem, Siraya said. If the Iranian team can borrow a couple of more horse from other participating country, they still can compete, she said. There are 106 horse and 12 country participating in the equestrian event. Most of the horse actually come from Europe and the United States. Thailand ha provided a climate-controlled stable and field cleared of contaminant to help the horse become acclimatized to the tropical heat before the competition begin Dec. 8. Many of the horse are suffering stress from the journey here, but those from Asian country are adjusting faster than those from cold country, Siraya said. Organizers of December's Asian Games have dismissed press report that a sport complex would not be completed on time, saying preparation are well in hand, a local newspaper said Friday. Santiparb Tejavanija, deputy secretary of the Bangkok Asian Games Organizing Committee, said construction of the sport complex at the Muang Thong Thani housing estate is 95 percent complete and will be finished this month, the Bangkok Post reported. Liquidity problem at Bangkok Land, the company that owns the housing estate, threatened to prevent the company from finishing the complex in time for the Dec. 6-20 game. Deputy Prime Minister Bhichai Rattakul, who chair the organizing committee, expressed doubt last month that the complex would be completed on time because of the financial problem. Santiparb told the Post the money problem had been overcome by shifting 200 million baht (dlrs 5 million) worth of credit guarantee from a project that had been scrapped to cover the construction cost of the complex. Preparations for the game have been plagued by political interference by previous government, alleged corruption and incompetence. The decision to award the contract for the sport complex wa controversial, with critic calling it an attempt to bail out the property developer's failed housing estate. Doubts over Thailand's ability to stage the game increased over the past year-and-a-half after the country entered it worst economic downturn in decade. The body governing the game threatened several time to award Asia's version of the Olympics to other country, but Thailand argued that all would be ready by opening day. The Bangkok game are expected to attract more than 10,000 athlete from 43 nation. For some team, out of bound at the Asian Games mean more than just a line on a soccer field or basketball floor. That's because the host city offer the punchy mix of Viagra and notorious night life. The Pakistanis say all their athlete and official for the game opening Sunday have been told not to even think of the wonder drug and night life idea. The Indian team's solution is mandatory meeting for all athlete before bedtime. The Sri Lankan participant, who had to sign a code of conduct before coming to Bangkok, are being watched by an army brigadier with a track record of high discipline. The Chinese have done their homework on staying out of trouble. Thailand, especially the capital Bangkok, is known worldwide for it titillating night life. From taxi driver to local tourist magazine distributed free at hotel, there are messenger aplenty to advertise massage parlor and escort service. Minutely detailed photo album seek to arouse sensual fantasy. Estimates of the number of female sex worker in Thailand, a country of 60 million, range from more than 300,000 to 2 million. Under Thailand's drug rule, Viagra is not available in drug store, but is sold only in hospital pharmacy with a prescription from a urologist, cardiologist, endocrinologist or psychiatrist for 400 baht (about dlrs 10) a dose. But there is a black market in the drug that might prove an attraction for some among the more than 15,000 athlete, official and medium personnel in Bangkok. No way, said Gurdayal Singh Mander, leader of the Indian contingent, when asked if there wa a risk of lack in discipline. I believe no one will try anything silly in Bangkok. Even if they try, our watching system is watertight and we will know, said Mander, a former police officer. Indian official in charge of various sport meet their athlete at 10 pm. before bedtime at the Asian Games village. The Pakistanis have opted for trust and nationalism. Oh, Viagra, exclaimed Pakistani medical officer Yousef Baig. They know all about it and they know all about Bangkok. We have told them, don't break our trust and keep the good name of Pakistan flying high, Dr. Baig said. China ha taken a similar approach. We don't treat them a kid, telling them don't do this, don't do that. We just told them to leave a good impression of Chinese athlete, said Li Furong, deputy head of the Chinese delegation. For the Sri Lankans, we have told them that they will not be allowed outside the game village until they finish their discipline, said Upali Bandaratillaka, a serving brigadier in the Sri Lankan army. Even if they want to go to shopping, one of u will accompany them, Bandaratillaka said. His deputy is a police officer. Host Thailand is stressing that sex isn't lurking around every corner. A Traditional Thai Massage Parlor ha been opened at the games' village. Thai traditional massage is considered an art form, said Prarop Laovanich, secretary of the Asian Games Sub-Committee for Culture and Performance. A skilled masseur can cure ailment and muscular fatigue. And one must wear baggy white pajama before a traditional Thai massage. In rite building from low flare symbolizing dawn to a fiery cauldron lighting, Thailand's king opened the Asian Games Sunday night, giving Thais some respite from an economic crisis that once threatened the continent's Olympic-style event. King Bhumibol Adulyadej, the world's longest-reigning monarch, wa upstaged slightly by Japan's Naoko Takahashi. In a marathon run in early morning, to avoid the worst of Bangkok's tropical heat, she won the games' first gold medal in a time just one minute off the world record. Her medal ceremony immediately preceded the official opening festivity for two week of competition among 6,000 athlete from 41 nation. In all, 377 gold medal are at stake in 36 sport, including Asian speciality such a kabaddi and sepak takraw. But the king not only made the key proclamation and released the royal pigeon, he also anointed a plaque for the Royal Main Stadium and composed some of the music. Songs written by the king, a talented jazz composer, were played by the Bangkok Symphony Orchestra. Thai official who approached him at the ceremony did so on their knee. Others greeting the king included International Olympic Committee President Juan Antonio Samaranch. A cascade of firework in honor of his 71st birthday Saturday and dancer who prostrated themselves on the field welcomed the monarch to his seat in the royal box. Then came the athlete, starting with Cambodia and ending with the host Thai team. Saudi Arabia, which withdrew it team at the last minute, wa represented by only a flag bearer. The Sri Lankan team wa led by six dancer in bright costume, who delighted the crowd in the 60,000-seat stadium with acrobatic maneuver. Each team wa led by a Thai beauty queen holding it signboard. After the parade, five of the woman collapsed, and three were taken out on stretcher. A giant cauldron atop the stadium wa lit by touching a torch to a smaller cauldron inside a model of a temple, which then wa lifted on an elevator and sent an explosion of spark into the games' flame receptacle. Outside the stadium before the ceremony, long line of people waited to take photo of themselves in front of a plastic statue of the games' elephant mascot, Chai-yo. One, Sakchai Pungsrinon, a 30-year-old piping engineer, who paid 1,000 baht (dlrs 26) for his ceremony ticket, said, Thailand ha many problem. Asia also ha many problem. For two week, maybe we can forget about all these problem. Several thousand people without ticket milled around outside, waving small Thai flag and waiting for a glimpse of the king. They also could watch the ceremony on a large television screen. Security measure included bomb-sniffing dog. For the competing nation many sending reduced team to ease the pinch of the Asian crisis the game are a proving ground for the 2000 Olympics in Sydney, Australia. It's not just getting a gold, it's getting a gold with a result that is close or at world standard, said Li Furong, deputy head of China's Asian Games delegation. The main target is the 2000 Olympics. Sunday's focus wa more on pageantry, beginning with slightly built Prime Minister Chuan Leekpai leading off a torch relay at 9:09 am. (0209 GMT), reflecting popular belief that nine is a lucky number. Bhumibol is the ninth king of the current dynasty. The three-hour ceremony featured 7,614 performer in lavishly produced act with the theme Friendship Beyond Frontiers. Performers in ancient Thai garb paraded across the field, followed by people-drawn chariot. A martial art display celebrated Asian unity, and hundred of primary school student dressed in colorful outfit introduced the games' mascot. Parts of the ceremony were built around the Indian Ramayana epic, the basis for much of traditional Thai mythology, literature and performing and fine art. The field became a swirl of giant snake, swan, bird, angel, and other mystical creature. Another performance celebrating the unity of Asia capped the show, with four large swan float pulled to the middle of the field, each tethered to a giant balloon symbolizing the sun, moon, earth and a giant lotus. Fireworks burst overhead, searchlight played across the stadium and laser split the darkness before the royal anthem concluded the program. The combined budget for the opening and closing ceremony wa 70 million baht (dlrs 1.94 million), including a large share of donated and at-cost labor part of Thailand's remedy for overcoming financial problem that hit the game. In warming up the audience before the ceremony, a Thai comedian jested: If you're Saudi, raise your hand. Saudi Arabia withdrew from the game at the last minute, throwing some of the scheduling into disarray. It cited a national holiday and the Muslim fasting month of Ramadan, but many Thais saw the move a retaliation for the failure of Thai police to solve a number of serious crime against Saudi citizen. Thailand showed it nearly complete facility for the Asian Games to a tough jury Thursday the head of the organizing committee from the 43 nation competing in the December event. Thailand won host right for the quadrennial game in 1995, but setback in preparation led official of the Olympic Council of Asia late last year to threaten to move the game to another country. They complained that the Thai organizer were behind in constructing facility and had failed to keep them informed. It appeared that Thursday's tour wa successful in reassuring everyone. We have a strong of sense of relief, said Abdul Muttaleb al-Ahmad, director general of the Kuwait-based Olympic Council of Asia and a frequent critic of Thailand's organizing committee. Everything is 99 percent completed. In a welcoming speech, Thai Deputy Prime Minister Bhichai Rattakul, also chairman of the Thai organizing committee, told delegation member to cast aside any doubt over whether the Dec. 6-20 game will be a success. I can hereby confirm that regardless of what Thailand ha faced, we . have tried to accommodate all request for the 13th Asian Games, said Bhichai. Since the Thai organizer began their preparation, they have faced many difficulty, most of them resulting from the country's financial crisis, he said. But the country wa able to pull it through, he added. This is an example of Asia's resiliency. We have financial problem in all of Asia but still we are able to prepare commendably, said Manuel Veguillas, head of the Philippine delegation. I am impressed, said Tu Mingde, secretary-general of China's Olympic Committee. The game will be a success. Still, Bangkok's infamous traffic jam did not go overlooked. My only concern now is the road construction leading to the site, said Kenji Ono from Japan. Construction worker are trying to ensure that the road leading to the stadium, including a flyover at a key intersection, will be completed on time for the game. The Olympic Council of Asia, meanwhile, is working with the Bangkok Organizing Committee to come up with a contingency plan in case of any possible emergency, said it director general, Muttaleb. You cannot really anticipate anything, he said, a he toured the main stadium of the Sports Authority of Thailand. Any venue can have a problem, such a electrical failure. Saudi Arabia's abrupt withdrawal from the Asian Games left organizer scrambling Thursday to change schedule and Thai diplomat mulling a decade of relation strained by jewel theft and the murder of diplomat. Bhichai Rattakul, deputy prime minister and president of the Bangkok Asian Games Organizing Committee, asked the Foreign Ministry to urge the Saudi government to reconsider withdrawing it 105-strong team. The game open Dec. 6. We're not sure if this is related to the Saudi jewel scandal, Bhichai told Thai radio. But regardless, we should not mix sport with politics. In a letter to the Thai prime minister's office, reported Thursday by Bangkok newspaper, Saudi sport authority cited the looming Muslim holy month of Ramadan and national centenary celebration a reason for suddenly pulling out. But suspicion immediately arose that the real reason wa the continued strain in relation since a Thai janitor stole precious jewelry from the palace of a Saudi prince in 1989 and fled home. Thai police recovered the jewel and returned them, but many were fake leading the Saudis to conclude that corrupt officer and member of Thailand's power elite kept the loot. The real jewel have never been recovered. Tensions were aggravated in 1990 and 1991, when three Saudi diplomat were murdered in Bangkok. In retaliation, the Saudis barred new Thai guest worker and refused to renew the visa of the thousand already in the desert kingdom. The killing remain unsolved. Saudi Arabia ha said relation would be normalized only when the two case were solved. Kobsak Chutikul, a Foreign Ministry spokesman, said it would be understandable if Saudi Arabia pull out because of Ramadan fasting. If there is any other reason behind this, such a the jewelry case and the murder, we will regret it very much because sport should be separated from politics, Kobsak said. Organizers noted that 10 other Muslim nation are sending team. Suggestions were made that in the future, the Olympic Council of Asia should consider punishing last-minute withdrawal. Organizers need to hold new draw for both handball and basketball because of the pullout, but said the live television coverage schedule will not be affected. The withdrawal is expected to cost 30 million baht (dlrs 830,000) to cover the committee's expense for organizing program, accommodation and television schedule. They said they would consult with the council, which oversees the organization of the game, about the impact of the Saudi withdrawal. Officials, meanwhile, expressed shock over a brawl that erupted Tuesday during a friendly soccer match between Thailand and Qatar. The scoreless match wa suspended without further play after player from both side kicked, punched and body-slammed each other for about 10 minute. Several suffered light injury. As a host, surely the melee will have an impact on the image and reputation of Thailand, said Santiparb Tejavanija, chairman of the administrative committee. Nobody wanted that incident to happen. Officials said that forgiveness wa a better option than punishment and that both side would be admonished not to let a repeat brawl occur. A snooker game between longtime Asian rival India and Pakistan led to a flareup of temper Sunday, showing a depth of difference that shocked Thai organizer and spectator at the Asian Games. India and Pakistan have fought three war since becoming independent in 1947. A Thai referee's decision that India's Yashin Merchant had committed a foul during a decisive frame sparked a fierce debate with the referee that forced stoppage of play for 15 minute. Merchant defeated Mohammad Saleh 5-4 after order wa restored, but the incident not only violated the sport's strict etiquette, but showed the distrust between the two neighbor that often ha spilled over into sport. The referee ruled that Merchant's white cue ball had first touched the black before hitting the target, red. Merchant protested. With the referee refusing to reverse his decision, Merchant sought help from the Indian team. Several Indian team member went to the playing arena, and one of them wrote a quick protest letter using the snooker table a a writing platform. Disgusted spectator viewed it a a breach of snooker etiquette. It doe not look nice for grownup men wearing necktie to fight, said Pakistani team manager Shahnawaz Khan. We just watched the whole drama, he said. Pakistani team official did not intervene, instead staying in their allocated seat. It wa made very clear to everybody that a referee's decision will be final, but now that the Indians have lodged a formal complaint, we have also done so, Khan said. The Indian complaint, however, ha no meaning now a Merchant ha won. Indian official were not available for comment. Tournament director Surasak Werapong said both complaint were thrown out because neither side paid the required dlrs 50 filing fee. The match wa one of the first a snooker made it Asian Games debut in style, with elated official greeting the opening with muffled clapping, in keeping with the sport's etiquette. A total of 19 country are vying for 10 gold medal in snooker and billiards. The preliminary elimination round began Sunday. This is the brightest day for u, said Manmohanjit Singh, the Singapore-born president of the International Billiards and Snooker Federation, the sport's world governing body. This is indeed a high step and this will greatly help to make the sport more popular in Asia, which is coming up fast, said Singh, whose family migrated to Singapore from India several decade ago. With the addition of snooker, the Asian Games now have 36 sport. ","Despite economic problems and threats from the Asian Olympic Committee that it would move the games, Thailand was able to meet construction deadlines and open the 13th annual Asian Games to participants from 43 countries.The games have not been without controversy.In a surprise move, Saudi Arabia pulled its athletes from the games, probably in reprisal for a jewel theft and the murder of three of its diplomats.There was speculation that the Saudis would send a ceremonial delegation.National rivalries also were Apparent in a snooker game between India and Pakistan when an argument Arose following a disputed call.","Bangkok prepared for the 6000 athletes from 41 nations to compete in the Asian Games.Thai police detained more than 300 beggars to make the city's streets safer, but its notorious night life concerned some team managers.China considered recalling overseas soccer players to bolster chances at the Games.Saudi Arabia abruptly withdrew its 105-man team citing the approach of Ramadan but more likely for past grievances with the Thais.Later, they considered sending a ""small team"".The Iranian equestrian team's horses failed the vet's exam.The Thai King opened the Games with an elaborate ceremony.Rivals India and Pakistan argued during a snooker match.","Despite concern that corruption, incompetence and financial failure would delay or prevent Thailand's ability to host the Asian Games, Bangkok was ready for the December 6 deadline.After an extravagant opening ceremony, the games went well despite a brief soccer brawl, a snooker game incident, the banning of Iran's equestrian team horses for not being disease free, and the withdrawal of Saudi Arabia over strained relations with Thailand.Thai police cleared the streets of beggars and criminals, and athletes were disciplined to avoid Bangkok's night life.China's recall of four soccer players from Europe is testimony of the importance of the games.","The Asian Games scheduled for Bangkok Dec. 6-20, 1998 were never a sure thing.Thailand was in economic doldrums and there was question whether the sports complex for the games would be completed in time.By late October, however, it was clear the games could take place.Thai police rounded up beggars who might intimidate spectators, but then in late November Saudi Arabia withdrew its teams and there was concern that athletes might be tempted by Bangkok's nightlife and the availability of Viagra.But on Dec. 6 the games opened as scheduled as 6,000 athletes from 41 nations competed, including a heated snooker match between India and Pakistan."
22,"China's central government ordered the arrest of a prominent democracy campaigner and may use his contact with exiled Chinese dissident to charge him with harming national security, a colleague said Wednesday. Two Beijing police officer spent 30 minute telling Zha Jianguo to stop trying to set up a political opposition party. Underscoring the warning, they said his colleague, Xu Wenli, won't be released soon and may be charged for having link to reactionary group, Zha said. Xu and another influential dissident, Qin Yongmin, were arrested Monday night in police raid in two city that delivered the sternest blow so far to a five-month campaign to establish the China Democracy Party and challenge the ruling Communist Party's monopoly on power. Qin wa arrested for plotting to overthrow the government, a crime that could land him in jail for life. A third Democracy Party advocate, Wang Youcai, already in custody for a month, wa also formally arrested Monday although his family ha not been informed of the charge. Zha, who helped Xu organize would-be party member in Beijing and the nearby port of Tianjin, said police officer told him Xu's arrest wa ordered by the central government, not Beijing police. He took the police reference to reactionary group to mean exiled dissident in the United States. Under China's vague State Security Law, such link may also be punishable by up to life in prison. Zha pledged to work with dissident in China and exile in the United States to campaign to save Xu Wenli. On Wednesday, 190 dissident from around the country demanded in an open letter that the government release Xu, Qin and Wang Youcai, saying the arrest run counter to UN. human right treaty China ha signed over the past 14 month. The authority are deceiving and cheating international public opinion while on the other hand they are suppressing and persecuting domestic political dissident, said the letter faxed to foreign news agency. In Washington, White House spokesman Joe Lockhart said the United States deplored the detention and arrest of Xu and Qin. We believe the peaceful political activity of this kind and other form of peaceful expression that they've been involved in are fundamental human right that should be protected by all government, Lockart said. We call on the Chinese government to assure the protection in these case of Mr. Xu and Mr. Qin. State Department spokesman James P. Rubin said US. official conveyed their concern to the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs and urged that Xu be released immediately. US. official received confirmation Wednesday that Xu is being detained on suspicion of having conducted activity damaging to China's national security, Rubin said. He said he had no information from Chinese authority about Qin or Wang. Two other democracy party supporter taken into custody in central Wuhan city along with Qin Chen Zhonghe and Xiao Shichang were released Wednesday morning, said He Xintong, Xu Wenli's wife. She added that police questioned the pair about the party a well a Qin's human right monitoring organization. Qin and Xu are towering figure in China's persecuted dissident community. Their activism date to the seminal Democracy Wall movement of the 1970s. Wang wa a student leader in 1989's influential Tiananmen Square democracy movement. All have spent time in prison, Xu for 12 year, much of it in solitary confinement. Xu's wife said she doe not know where he is being held and, in her 20-year experience with the authority, belief they are unlikely to tell her. Released in 1993, Xu picked up his campaigning for political change soon after his parole ended last year. He ha tried to use China's nascent legal system and the international treaty it signed to push for reform. My husband is innocent and there's nothing he can be criticized for, said his wife, He Xintong. They're going to have to expend a lot of effort to make him a criminal. One leader of a suppressed new political party will be tried on Dec. 17 on a charge of colluding with foreign enemy of China to incite the subversion of state power, according to court document given to his wife on Monday. The decision to try the leader, Wang Youcai, a founder of the China Democracy Party, with unusual speed suggests how serious the Communist authority are in their campaign to destroy the fledgling party and silence dissident who had begun to speak out over the last year. The charge that Wang face, in a trial that will almost certainly be secret and quick, could bring a sentence of five year or more. Wang, 32, ha been imprisoned in his home city, Hangzhou in eastern China, for a month, but wa not formally arrested until Nov. 30. On that day two prominent dissident, both promoter of the new party, were detained. One, Qin Yongmin, 45, of the central city of Wuhan, and the other, Xu Wenli, 55, of Beijing, are being held on suspicion of subversive activity. Detailed charge have not been filed. Wang wa a student leader in the pro-democracy demonstration in Tiananmen Square in 1989. After the army had crushed the movement, Wang wa arrested and served two year in prison. Qin and Xu became known a democracy advocate in the late 1970s. Qin wa imprisoned for eight year. In 1993 he wa put in a labor camp for two year. Xu spent 12 year in prison. When President Clinton visited in the spring, Wang announced the formation of the Democracy Party. He and other dissident hoped that China's new friendship with the United States and it decision to sign a global covenant on political and civil right would give them room to promote political alternative. After Clinton returned home Wang wa detained, warned and released, only to be re-arrested a authority began what now appears to be a major crackdown on dissent. Monday, Wang's wife, Hu Jiangxia, wa handed the bill of prosecution, according to the Information Center of Human Rights and Democratic Movement in Hong Kong. Wang is charged with helping draft a party manifesto that state, in part, Only by establishing an opposition party can we be rid of this despotism. That is cited a ground for the subversion charge, the information center said. In addition to detailing Wang's organizing activity, the prosecutor charge that he colluded with enemy of the state abroad, making his crime far more serious under Chinese law. He used e-mail to send 18 copy of the party's founding document abroad, met with a member of a subversive foreign organization and received money from foreign source to buy a computer, the indictment reportedly say. China's government said Thursday that two prominent dissident arrested this week are suspected of endangering national security the clearest sign yet Chinese leader plan to quash a would-be opposition party. Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhu Bangzao refused to specify what law were broken or how Xu Wenli and Qin Yongmin endangered the state. A third leading advocate of the China Democracy Party who ha been in custody for a month, Wang Youcai, wa accused of inciting the overthrow of the government, the Hong Kong-based Information Center of Human Rights and Democratic Movement in China reported. All three men could face up to life in prison if convicted of the harshest measure under China's vague state security law. The ruling Communist Party ha resorted to the law to silence dissent since it went into effect last year. The arrest of Xu and Qin at their home Monday night and the accusation against them and Wang were the sharpest action Chinese leader have taken since dissident began pushing to set up and legally register the China Democracy Party in June. Xu and Qin were suspected of involvement in activity endangering state security and their behavior breached relevant provision of the criminal law of the People's Republic of China, Zhu said at a twice-weekly briefing. Police in Hangzhou city notified Wang's wife Wednesday that charge have already been submitted to prosecutor, bringing him a step closer to trial, the Information Center said. Xu and Qin are influential figure in the dissident community, having started their campaign for change 20 year ago in the seminal Democracy Wall movement. Wang wa a student leader in the 1989 Tiananmen Square democracy demonstration. Both have served time in prison. Xu spent 12 year in jail, much of it in solitary confinement. Since dissident began organizing and trying to legally register the China Democracy Party, police have harassed and briefly detained more than two dozen member, but until now the government had not leveled such politically charged allegation. The Communist Party ha never allowed another political party to form since it took power in 1949. In Washington on Wednesday, White House spokesman Joe Lockhart said the United States deplored the arrest and said the dissidents' peaceful political activity were fundamental human right that all government should protect. US. official conveyed their concern to the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs and urged that Xu and Qin be released immediately. Zhu criticized the United States for condemning the arrest, saying that no country, including the United States, should interfere in China's internal affair. China in October signed a key UN. treaty on civil and political right that guarantee freedom of expression and freedom of association. It wa the 17th international human right treaty China ha signed. Zhu told reporter there wa absolutely no contradiction at all between China's support for these treaty and it arrest of the two dissident. In response to criticism from home and abroad, Chinese official broke their silence Wednesday to defend their arrest this week of a prominent dissident who wa trying to form an opposition political party. Xu Wenli is suspected of involvement in activity damaging to national security and ha violated relevant criminal code of the People's Republic of China, said a statement from the Foreign Ministry, which on Tuesday declined to comment on the arrest. The sudden arrest on Monday night of Xu, a well a several other activist involved with him in trying to form the China Democratic Party, set off strong protest from human right group, other Chinese dissident and Washington. We view his detention for peacefully exercising fundamental freedom guaranteed by international human right instrument a a serious step in the wrong direction, State Department spokesman James P. Rubin said in Washington on Tuesday. US. official in Beijing urged the government to release Xu and asked for clarification a to the exact nature of his crime. China signed the International Covenant of Civil and Political Rights with great fanfare in October, and Xu's arrest is seen by human right group a a test of the nation's commitment to it tenet. Dissidents in and out of China rose to Xu's defense, with more than a dozen activist around the country announcing that they would begin fast in support of Xu and another leader of the China Democratic Party, Qin Yongmin, who wa arrested in his home in Wuhan on Monday. Almost 200 dissident signed a letter to the Chinese government protesting the detention, said the Information Center for Human Rights and Democratic Movement in Hong Kong. Three other Democratic Party organizer were also detained on Monday, although two of them were released early Wednesday. But the two more prominent dissident, Xu and Qin, are likely to face a much longer haul since both have been charged with criminal act. Xu's wife, He Xintong, said Wednesday night that she had still not been informed of the specific charge against her husband, although she surmised from the aggressive behavior of the arresting officer that the sentence could be long. Qin's family wa told that he wa charged with plotting to subvert the government, a crime that for serious offense command sentence of three year to life. In the Chinese criminal code, this charge come under a grab-bag section called threatening state security, which make almost any political activity that question or hamper the authority of the Communist Party illegal, from violent or nonviolent activity aimed at overthrowing the government authority, to activity designed to change the basic nature of the state. Xu's and Qin's trouble almost certainly stem from their effort to gain recognition for the China Democratic Party, a loose network of pro-democracy activist in more than a dozen city around China that wa formed this year. In the last six month they have become increasingly aggressive and defiant in their attempt to register the party with the government, submitting repeated application even after local authority had declared the concept of an opposition party illegal. They say the Chinese Constitution doe not specifically forbid the formation of new political party, although there have been no new party since the founding of the People's Republic in 1949. In fact, the by-laws of the China Democratic Party are fairly tame; they carefully acknowledge the central role of the Communist Party, but also support free speech and free election for public official. My husband thought the time wa right to begin working to form a new party, since China recently signed the covenant on human right, Ms. He said. In September, a few Democratic Party member got some slightly encouraging signal from local government, which initially accepted their application to form a social organization to develop a party. But in recent week, a organizer like Xu became more insistent and defiant, harassment by the police increased. All this past week we felt something wa going to happen, Ms. He said. It seemed that anyone who came to visit u wa later detained for a while. And there have been a lot more car from the Public Security Bureau parked outside than is usual. Hours before China wa expected to sign a key UN. human right treaty and host British Prime Minister Tony Blair, police hauled a prominent human right campaigner in for questioning Monday. Qin Yongmin's latest run-in with the authority came a he tried for the second time in a week to legally register a human right monitoring group. Qin said a civil affair official in the Hubei provincial capital of Wuhan accused him of engaging in illegal activity. The police came soon after he returned home. As I'm sending this statement, the Wuhan Public Security Bureau is again taking me away, Qin said in a hastily scrawled message on the bottom of the typed statement faxed to reporter. Qin, detained briefly two week ago, wa questioned for about three hour before being released and threatened with prosecution if he persisted in trying to set up his China Human Rights Observer. Qin hoped the harassment would stop after China sign the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, but he said if local authority don't observe the treaty we will unswervingly push ahead with protecting human right to the last. China plan to sign the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights on Monday at the United Nations. By the time the ink is dry, Blair should be landing in Beijing on Tuesday morning for the first visit by a British prime minister in seven year. The treaty is supposed to guarantee freedom of speech and assembly. But even after China sign, the treaty would not come into force until ratified by the legislature, which may attach reservation effectively nullifying some provision. Blair ha vowed to discus difference over human right with Chinese leader. His visit ha drawn appeal from dissident and an international press freedom group urging him to persuade Chinese leader to free political prisoner. In an open letter, three dissident said that while Chinese leader say they respect human right principle, in law and practice the government allows right abuse and persecution of dissident. Thousands of political prisoner are believed to remain in Chinese prison, labor camp or detention center, said the letter, a copy of which wa released by the Hong Kong-based Information Center of Human Rights and Democratic Movement in China. The letter called for the release of Shi Binhai, a journalist who compiled a popular book on political change; Fang Jue, a businessman who called openly for political reform; and other imprisoned activist. Paris-based Reporters Without Borders urged Blair to call for the release of Gao Yu, Liu Xiaobo and Liu Jingsheng. The three are among 13 journalist imprisoned simply for attempting to practice their profession, it said in a statement. Protesting the lack of a defense lawyer, the father of a prominent dissident is to seek a delay in his son's subversion trial, scheduled to start on Thursday in the central city of Wuhan. The defendant is Qin Yongmin, 45, a democracy advocate who ha spent 10 year in prison and labor camp and ha recently promoted an alternative, non-Communist political party. In a telephone interview Wednesday evening, his father, Qin Qinguo, 76, said that before the trial begin, he plan to hand the court a written plea for postponement. If the plea is ignored, he said he will walk out. I wouldn't be able to stand it, the father, a retired steelworker, said, citing his frail health and high blood pressure. Under China's code of criminal procedure, a defendant ha the right to a defense lawyer. But in this case, the elder Qin said, some lawyer he approached declined to take the case, while others were warned by security official not to get involved. The father said he did not agree with his son's political tactic but now he felt he had no choice but to protest his treatment. Qin Yongmin wa arrested on Nov. 30, only hour after his mother died of a stroke. He wasn't even allowed to attend the funeral, Qin Qinguo said. And now he's not allowed to find a lawyer. On Thursday morning, a few hundred mile to the east in the city of Hangzhou, Wang Youcai, 33, is to go on trial on similar charge of inciting subversion. He, too, ha no defense lawyer. Wang wa a leader of student demonstration in Tiananmen Square in 1989 and served two year in prison after they were put down by military force. As the founder of the suppressed new political party, the China Democracy Party, he publicly announced it charter in June during President Clinton's visit to China. Scores of people around the country began to champion the new party, hopeful that closer tie between China and the United States, and China's signing of the international covenant on political and civil right, would mean a looser political climate. But the party wa soon declared illegal and many adherent were detained, at least temporarily. Wang now face charge that could land him in prison for five year or more. A third veteran dissident and promoter of the new party, Xu Wenli, ha been detained for week in Beijing and is expected to face similar subversion charge. In the last two day, at least 10 Democracy Party member or supporter in the Hangzhou area have been detained by the police and others have had their phone line cut, reported the Information Center of Human Rights and Democratic Movement in China, based in Hong Kong. The separate trial of two prominent democracy advocate for inciting subversion of the state opened Thursday morning, with the family of both defendant protesting their inability to hire defense lawyer. The trial in the eastern city of Hangzhou of Wang Youcai, 32, founder of the China Democracy Party, which is now suppressed, wa in session for just two hour and 10 minute. It appears to be finished, although the court did not announce a decision or say when it would. I don't know what happens from here, said Wang's wife, Hu Jiangxia, who wa one of three relative allowed to attend the trial. I don't hold much hope, she added in a telephone interview. Wang, who spent two year in prison after the 1989 student demonstration in Tiananmen Square, wa accused of organizing a political party that sought to overturn Communist Party rule and of colluding with foreign enemy of the state. He could face five year or more in prison. Since all the lawyer his family approached were intimidated by security agent, Ms. Hu said, Wang tried to mount his own defense Thursday morning after prosecutor laid out their case. But the judge frequently interrupted him and cut him off after half an hour, saying he wa not responding to the specific fact of the case, she added. Wang argued that his activity were legal under China's constitution and under an international covenant on political right that China ha signed, Ms. Hu said. In the central city of Wuhan, the trial on similar charge of Qin Yongmin, 45, a veteran dissident, also continued for something over two hour. It will apparently be continued, said Qin's father, Qin Qingguo, since the session ended after the prosecution presented it charge. In that case, too, prospective lawyer had been intimidated or detained, family member said. The elderly father's request to the court Thursday morning for a postponement wa ignored, so he and one of the defendant's brother stayed outside the court building in protest, leaving another brother inside. We didn't feel there wa any reason to observe the trial because if Qin Yongmin did not have a defense attorney, then a far a we were concerned the proceeding were meaningless, the father said by telephone. The US. Embassy asked to observe the trial. When an embassy official arrived at the court in Hangzhou Thursday morning, he wa told that there were no seat available and instead waited outside, greeting Ms. Hu when she emerged, shaken, from the brief trial. Police detained and questioned the organizer of a group set up by dissident to monitor official corruption and told him the group's activity must cease, a human right group said Thursday. Police in Xinyang, in central China's Henan province, took An Jun away Wednesday afternoon and held him until past midnight for questioning about the group's member, said the Information Center of Human Rights and Democratic Movement in China. Police wanted a list of member with their work and home address, a demand An Jun refused for fear of getting them into trouble, the Hong Kong-based Information Center said. Corruption Watch, founded by nine dissident in seven province, now ha nearly 100 member, the center said. It applied last month to the government to register officially, but received no response, the center added. The police officer who questioned An Jun said that without official permission, the group must cease it activity, the center said. Rampant official corruption is a major public gripe in China. The Information Center said Corruption Watch had already received report of graft in it first month of operation. In a separate report, the center said that an official in the Sichuan provincial government refused Thursday to accept an application by three dissident to form a branch of a would-be opposition group, the China Democracy Party. Groups of dissident in city across China have attempted to register the group, a required by law, but authority have rejected those application. Signaling that the Communist Party's 49-year-old ban on opposition group remains intact, police have detained and questioned many dissident associated with the group. With attorney locked up, harassed or plain scared, two prominent dissident will defend themselves against charge of subversion Thursday in China's highest-profile dissident trial in two year. Qin Yongmin's and Wang Youcai's family were running out of option Wednesday to help the pair, leading organizer of a budding opposition political party. Qin's family pleaded for a postponement at Wuhan's Intermediate People's Court, but court official denied the request. Police have detained one lawyer and threatened another, and subtler pressure have been used on others, family member said. Given the interference, Wang Youcai's wife assumes he will be convicted. Whether he ha a lawyer or not, whatever he say, the government ha already decided, Hu Jiangxia said. Qin and Wang will be tried separately, in city 500 kilometer (300 mile) apart and in proceeding attended only by family and a few observer selected by the court. Qin, 44, and Wang, 31, are accused of inciting the subversion of state power, apparently for helping to organize the China Democracy Party. They face from 10 year to life imprisonment if convicted under the harshest aspect of the law. By moving against Qin, Wang and the China Democracy Party, the ruling Communist Party appears to be signaling it determination to crush challenge to it monopoly on power. Authorities have detained or questioned more than 30 people associated with the party in a 17-day-old crackdown. Qin, a democracy campaigner for 20 year, and Wang, a student leader of the 1989 Tiananmen Square democracy movement, are among the most active and influential member of China's dissident community. A third prominent member of the dissident community, Xu Wenli, wa also arrested in the crackdown, but not yet charged. To prevent display of solidarity outside Wang's trial, police have detained at least ten dissident in the eastern city of Hangzhou, a Hong Kong-based right group reported. The Information Center of Human Rights and Democratic Movement in China said many more are missing and believed to be in custody. To prosecute Wang, authority violated the minimal right guaranteed suspect under Chinese law and ignored court order, his wife said. Even the judge asked me to hire a lawyer, but while I wa doing this, some people were doing thing to stop me, Hu Jiangxia said. During one meeting with a potential defense attorney, a police official stormed in and said, `Don't do anything for them. Don't take this case. Whoever take the case, you can't win,' Hu recounted. Four law firm refused to take Qin's case, his brother Qin Xiaoguang said. The Information Center said one lawyer who initially agreed to represent Qin on Monday went missing for four hour and then called Qin's family to withdraw. Dispirited by the harsh treatment, Qin's family argued over whether to attend the trial. Qin Xiaoguang said he and his father have decided to stay away to protest the unfairness, but another brother will go. Three dissident from northeastern China sent an open letter to China's legislature and the Supreme People's Court appealing for fair trial, the Information Center said. It added that authority violated China's own law by not ensuring Wang and Qin have adequate representation. The letter wa the latest in a string of petition demonstrating the appeal of both Wang and Qin and the idea of the China Democracy Party. Since Wang publicly announced in June that he and others in Hangzhou were setting up the party, dissident in at least 14 province and city have set up party branch. Authorities have refused their application to register the party a required by law. Wang and Qin are the most well-known dissident China ha put on trial since Tiananmen Square student leader Wang Dan in 1996. He wa convicted of subversion and served le than two of an 11-year sentence. In return for his release, he agreed to go into exile. A Chinese dissident fleeing a new round of arrest of democracy activist in Shanghai arrived here Wednesday and announced that he and other opponent of the Chinese government plan a demonstration Thursday at the United Nations to protest the crackdown. The dissident, Yao Zhenxian, who wa released in April from a Chinese labor camp, is a leader of the China Democracy Party, which wa formed in June during President Clinton's visit to China. Speaking through an interpreter at Kennedy International Airport, Yao, 44, said little about why he had left Shanghai, except that he and his younger brother, Yao Zhenxiang, 38, had been sent to a labor camp in 1996 on a trumped-up charge of publishing pornography. The younger Yao, who is also a prominent figure in the China Democracy Party, is scheduled for release in April. Last week the Chinese government arrested 10 member and sympathizer of the China Democracy Party, one of whom, Wang Youcai, is to go on trial Dec. 17. The Chinese government feel it expanded too quickly, Yao said at the airport, referring to his party. Washington gave Yao a special visa, which expires in February. Dr. Wang Bingzhang, 50, an adviser to the overseas committee of the party, said later that Yao had left China for personal and political reason. They were scared all the time, he said, referring to Yao's wife, Yu Yingzhang, and daughter, Yao Yiting, 14, who accompanied him. The family had a terrible life, especially the daughter. Secret agent followed them all the time. The family trading business, which wa 12 year old, wa shuttered by the government in 1996, said Wang, a former surgeon in Beijing, so they had no way of living. In addition, after Yao made organizational trip to several province, democracy activist urged him to go abroad, Wang said. They wanted him to tell the truth about what is really happening in China and to call on the whole world to pay attention, Wang said. Beatrice Laroche, liaison at the United Nations for Human Rights in China, a New York-based group, said the China Democracy Party wa a growing presence in some of China's most populous province, including Sichuan. But their most vocal leader have all recently been detained, she added. Ms. Laroche said the Yao brother, especially the younger man, won prominence by helping to finance predecessor of the China Democracy Party with money from the family business before it wa closed by the government.

24,"This is what Newt Gingrich is supposed to do well. The planning. The strategy. The big picture. The vision. His vision brought the GOP to the majority in Congress in 1994 and made him the first Republican House Speaker in 40 year. But by his own admission, Gingrich's vision seems to have blurred this time around, costing Republicans a net of five seat in Tuesday's election and leaving the party's narrow governing majority even narrower. The disappointing election result also left Gingrich open to a fractious challenge for his post a speaker. Members and aide said Wednesday that a fury at the speaker had bubbled up overnight and that some member were trying to organize a slate of candidate to replace Gingrich and his leadership team when House Republicans convene on Nov. 18 to select their leader for next year. As Rep. Mark Sanford, R-S.C., put it, When a company's stock price go down, it's usually the CEO who get fired. Top Republican aide, speaking anonymously, were even blunter. People were very angry last night, one aide said. Today it's a mixture of seething and dismay. It's just ugly. And Newt know it. His career is on the line. Another aide said, Most people are really angry with Newt, and no one know what to do with it. But some are dipping their toe in the water and seeing what the temperature is. A possible slate could contain the name of Reps. Robert L. Livingston of Louisiana to replace Gingrich, Steve Largent of Oklahoma to replace Dick Armey of Texas a majority leader, and Jennifer Dunn of Washington to replace John A. Boehner of Ohio a conference chairman. Rep. David M. McIntosh of Indiana is also said to be considering a run for speaker, but it wa not clear whether he would be part of any slate. Rep. Tom DeLay of Texas, the majority whip, wa said to be secure. Armey bluntly acknowledged the scramble going on in the wing to oust the leadership. Told on Nightline that there were Republicans after his head, Armey replied: They're welcome to it if they're big enough to take it. Publicly, Gingrich ha expressed confidence about keeping his job a speaker. But he ha been grim-faced over the last 24 hour and closeted himself Wednesday with his top strategist making call to shore up his support among member. He look like the victim of an accident, said Rep. Peter King, R-N.Y., who support Gingrich. He's very somber in tone. The question, a it always is with Gingrich, is how many member are prepared to rebel against his leadership. In the past, no more than a couple of dozen member have openly expressed their dissatisfaction with him, and a coup attempt last year fizzled for lack of support. I'm hoping more people will understand the need for a serious reassessment this year, said Rep. Charles T. Canady, R-Fla., who said he had hoped for a challenge to the speaker after the 1996 election, when the Republicans also lost seat. The reality is this: Our majority keep shrinking, Canady said. If it shrink any more, it will be gone. But Gingrich ha built support among moderate, and some perceived the election a a repudiation of the conservative. Rep. Sherwood L. Boehlert, R-Utah, said the result showed that this wa the right direction for the party. To maintain our majority, we've got to moderate some of our view, Boehlert said. Thomas Mann, a Congressional scholar at the Brookings Institution, said that moderate supported Gingrich in part because no appealing alternative had emerged. They know he see the broader world and is prepared to moderate if it make sense, Mann said. Newt's gone out of his way to support the moderate. He's nurtured a relationship with them. But Mann and others said that anger ha been building at Gingrich for several reason, including his signing on to a budget deal last month that seemed to capitulate to President Clinton, not offering a clear legislative agenda for Republicans and not communicating a clear political message. We are most defined by who we hate said Rep. Mark Souder, R-Ind. But voter are more sophisticated than that, and Republicans better have something to say about where we're going. The anger grew in the last few day when the speaker approved a $10-million anti-Clinton advertising campaign that allowed Democrats to turn the election into a referendum on Gingrich, who ha never been nearly a popular with the public a Clinton ha been. As if only slowly absorbing the implication of the loss, the speaker seemed unable at a news conference here Wednesday morning to pinpoint why the party suffered a net drop of five seat in the House. As late a Tuesday afternoon, he wa predicting a net pickup of between 10 and 30. Until we look at it better, I frankly don't understand all the thing that happened yesterday, he said, and I'm not sure anybody else in the country doe either. But he said Republicans should have maniacally focused on a basic message of cutting tax, saving Social Security and preventing drug abuse, and campaigned aggressively on those theme. He contrasted the lack of focus this year with the Contract With America that proved so successful in 1994. People thought we stood for something pretty big, he said. But Gingrich also seemed aware of the mounting concern about his leadership, repeatedly casting the election result a a victory for his leadership team because Republicans had stayed in the majority for three election in a row for the first time in 70 year. He also suggested that those who would challenge him have little support. The people who normally are quoted on this are people who would in fact take the party to a narrower base, Gingrich said, referring to the periodic eruption of concern among conservative about his leadership. I'd like to see who it wa that had a plan that they were confident over the last 60 day would have been more successful and why they didn't share it. An intense struggle for control of the House is underway, with Rep. Bob Livingston conducting a telephone campaign to replace Rep. Newt Gingrich a speaker and Gingrich fighting with a counter-campaign that ha given some member pause about ousting him. At the same time, a small band of Republicans vowed on Thursday that they would not vote to re-elect Gingrich under any circumstance, a move that, because of the Republicans' shrunken House majority, could tie the party in knot for month because it could throw the speakership to a Democrat. Rep. Matt Salmon, R-Ariz., said: I personally have made the decision that I cannot vote for Newt Gingrich for speaker in January, and there are six others who have told me they feel the same way, seven people who just will not, and it take six to deadlock the vote. Fury at the speaker ha boiled over since Tuesday's election, when Republicans suffered a net loss of five seat in the House. They blamed Gingrich, the party's chief strategist. But many were already angry at him for what they said wa his failure to articulate a clear message for the party going into the election and for a messy budget process that gave President Clinton a political edge and contradicted Republican principle of fiscal conservativism by containing massive amount of pork spending. House Republicans are to meet Nov. 18 to vote by secret ballot for their leader. Whoever win the party's nomination for speaker then stand for election by the full House in January. Even if Gingrich win the secret ballot, he could be denied re-election a speaker in January if Salmon and at least five others refuse to vote for him. Because the Republicans now control the House by only 12 seat, it would take just six vote against Gingrich to deny him a majority and allow Democrats to potentially elect one of their own a speaker. With such a chaotic and unacceptable prospect looming, Livingston told Gingrich that he should step aside for the good of the party, according to Republican official. The official said that Livingston spoke to Gingrich shortly after the disastrous election return but also before the election, reflecting Livingston's earlier displeasure with the speaker over the budget process. Several Republicans said that both Livingston, the chairman of the Appropriations Committee and one of the few member with the stature to stand for speaker, and Gingrich were working the phone on Thursday in a struggle for vote. Livingston ha said nothing publicly about a challenge to Gingrich, but several member and aide said on Thursday that he would announce his intention, possibly a soon a Friday, after he had determined if he could win. He won't do it 'til he ha his duck in a row, and right now a lot of people are still loyal to the speaker, said an aide to a Republican who, like many others, is trying to straddle the line between fealty to a speaker who may retain power and encouragement to a challenger who offer a salve to an embattled party. Stunned by the Democratic resurgence in the mid-term election, congressional Republicans tore into each other Wednesday over who wa to blame for their failure to make the traditional opposition party gain in an off-year election. The soul-searching and recrimination and a possibility of congressional leadership challenge came a election result showed that Republicans had been unable to increase their 55-45 hold over the Senate and that Democrats had picked up five seat in the House. The Democratic surge marked the first time since 1934 that the president's party had gained seat in a midterm election, and it whittled the Republican House majority down to a mere six vote. The Democratic victory were even more remarkable in a political year marked by the months-long scandal over President Clinton's affair with Monica Lewinsky. The Republicans' new 223-211 majority (assuming a Democrat leading in Oregon hold on to win), with one independent, amounted to the smallest congressional majority since the Republican-controlled Congress of 1953, the last time Republicans controlled the House until they captured it again in 1994. With attention now shifting to the House Judiciary Committee and it impeachment inquiry, Rep. Henry Hyde told fellow Republicans on the panel in a conference call Wednesday that the only witness Republicans were likely to call would be the independent counsel, Kenneth Starr. Hyde, the chairman, told lawmaker he hoped to have the committee vote on possible article of impeachment by Thanksgiving, an act that would take the issue out of his hand and put it into Gingrich's. Committee Democrats declined comment Wednesday until they could discus Hyde's plan among themselves. Trying to put the best face on the result, Speaker Newt Gingrich said in Marietta, Ga., that the Republicans still held onto the House for three election in a row for the first time since the election of 1932. But furious rank and file Republicans burned up the phone line to each other, discussing whether to mount leadership challenge in both chamber in the next few week. We've got to reach out and have more than southern white male running the Washington Republican Party, said Rep. Joe Scarborough, a conservative from Florida. He said that Republicans this year had been left without any accomplishment to run on. We need an agenda first of all, he said. We went an entire calendar year without an agenda. Rep. Chris Shays, a moderate from Connecticut called the election a devastating loss and said simply, There are going to be major change in our leadership. All segment of our party want to see change. At the White House, Clinton called the election result a vindication of his party's policy. If you look at all the result, he said, they are clear and unambiguous. The American people want their business, their concern, their child, their family, their future addressed here. That's what the messag e of the election wa. One of the first difficult question now facing Congress is how to proceed with the impeachment inquiry in the face of public resistance to removing Clinton from office, and with a Republican majority now so slim that it is almost certain that the 218 vote required for impeachment cannot be assembled. In a public statement released Wednesday, Hyde said The Committee continues to have a clear constituional duty to complete it work in a fair and expeditious manner. Our duty ha not changed becasue the constitution ha not changed. But Sen. Robert Torricelli, D-N.J., said the election result guaranteed that impeachment will fail. I think any serious effort to remove President Clinton from office is effectively over, he said. It is simply for Newt Gingrich and Trent Lott to decide on an exit strategy. From the other side of the aisle, Rep. Rick Lazio, a Long Island Republican, said, The inquiry should be wrapped up expeditiously, fairly and it ought to be resolved in the immediate future. For the past year, Republicans struggled to keep control of the House with a 228-207 majority and to find consensus among their party's competing faction. With their number reduced, the Republican leadership will need to carry out a tortuous balancing act to unite a hard-core conservative faction that want a more aggressive social agenda with a bloc of moderate who want their party to return to the center. Any small Republican faction will now have enormous leverage. The new arithmetic of the House may even lead to Democrats' and moderate Republicans' forming ad hoc majority on issue, taking control away from Republican leader. Already seeing some of the possibility, Rep. Peter King of Long Island, N.Y., said northeastern Republicans would be strengthened. It give u much more leverage with the leadership and make it easier to protect New York, he said. It's going to weaken the position of the strident conservative and the anti-northeast conservative. Just two week ago, Gingrich had foreseen election gain ranging from 10 seat to more than 40. Seeming uncharacteristically uncertain Wednesday, he said he had trouble accounting for the result. Things were happening out there that none of u fully understand--neither party in my judgment, he said. Taking his share of the blame for his party's loss, the Georgia Republican said he had misjudged how the public would recoil from the Clinton scandal a amplified in the modern medium world and how the scandal would drown out other Republican theme. I mean I totally underestimated the degree to which people would just get sick of 24-hour-a day talk television and talk radio and then the degree to which this whole scandal became just sort of disgusting by sheer repetition, he said. And a a result I think we probably underestimated the need to really aggressively push a much stronger message about cutting tax and saving Social Security, winning the war on drug, reforming education and national defense. Majority Leader Sen. Trent Lott of Mississippi also admitted mistake, saying his party had not presented a clear enough message in the final 96 hour of the campaign. He also conceded that Congress' final scramble to pas a $500 billion budget bill hurt his party. One of this lesson for Republicans out of this is that we need to listen more carefully to the people and we need to have a clear understanding and concise message that we do apply across the nation, he said in Washington. Both Lott and Gingrich said Republicans would put an emphasis next year on tax-cutting and shoring up the Social Security system. Even a the two leader spoke, their angry rank-and-file lawmaker were making phone call trying to ass whether to mount challenge against the Republican leader who have steered the Congress since the Republican's assumed control four year ago. One senior Republican staffer said the House had become a tinderbox of intrigue. Scarborough said, The long distance charge in Washington office probably are going through the roof today. Everybody's calling everybody. Everybody recognizes that something's terribly wrong with the direction of Washington Republicans when Republican governor are doing so well in New York, Massachusetts, Florida and Texas. And while Gingrich ha not gone out of his way to identify himself with the Republican campaign's last-minute ad blitz attacking President Clinton, his caucus know he is responsible. Gingrich ha faced down an uprising before, foiling a coup attempt against him by disgruntled conservative and some of his own leadership team in the summer of 1997. Any move to remove him remains a long-shot. But with House leadership election now set for mid-November, Republicans said this time the dissatisfaction in their caucus had crossed ideological line to moderate like Shays a well. We got shellacked, said Rep. Christopher Cannon, a conserative from Utah. We beat ourselves because we had no agenda. Republicans were discussing possible challenge to Gingrich, his second-in-command, Rep. Dick Armey, and other member of the senior leadership team. Some were envisioning trying to run an entire new ticket headed by Rep. Bob Livingston, the Appropriations Committee chairman from Louisiana and including Rep. Steve Largent, an Oklahoma conservative. Asked whether Tuesday's election result could cost him the speakership, Gingrich said, I'm not particularly concerned. Republicans close to him said they expected the anger to dissipate. In the Senate, where leadership race take place in early December, some Republicans were talking of mounting challenge against mid-level leadership figure. Several senator expressed particular pique toward the re-election chairman, Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, who poured party dollar and much of his own time into trying to defeat the Democratic champion of campaign finance overhaul, Russell Feingold of Wisconsin. Feingold won in a close race. Some lawmaker on Wednesday approached Sen. Chuck Hagel of Nebraska to see if he would replace McConnell. Hagel confirmed he had talked to more than eight senator, and wa considering whether to challenge McConnell. Hagel lambasted the Republican leadership for the election outcome. This is a big loss for u, he said. We squandered a very historic opportunity last night. To just break even is a loss. Most incumbent coasted to victory Tuesday night. But some will not be returning. Five House Republicans were defeated: Vince Snowbarger of Kansas, Bill Redmond of New Mexico, Jon Fox of Pennsylvania, Mike Pappas of New Jersey, and Rick White of Washington. One Democrat also lost his re-election bid Rep. Jay Johnson of Wisconsin. The new House member include 17 Republicans and at least 22 Democrats. David Wu, a Democrat wa leading Molly Bordonaro, a Republican in the race for one House seat in Oregon, but the final victory announcement wa not expected until Friday after absentee ballot are counted. Unlike the self-proclaimed revolutionary of the Republican class of 1994, many of the newly elected member are career politician who rose through the rank of local and state government. Three of the Democrats are the son of former lawmaker, Mark Udall of Colorado, son of Morris Udall who represented Arizona; Tom Udall of New Mexico, son of the other Udall brother, Stewart, a former Congressman and Secretary of the Interior, and Charlie Gonzalez, who o won the Texas seat of his father, Henry.

Several senator expressed particular pique toward the re-election chairman, Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, who poured party dollar and much of his own time into trying to defeat the Democratic champion of campaign finance overhaul, Russell Feingold of Wisconsin. Feingold won in a close race. Some lawmaker on Wednesday approached Sen. Chuck Hagel of Nebraska to see if he would replace McConnell. Hagel confirmed he had talked to more than eight senator, and wa considering whether to challenge McConnell. Hagel lambasted the Republican leadership for the election outcome. This is a big loss for u, he said. We squandered a very historic opportunity last night. To just break even is a loss. Most incumbent coasted to victory Tuesday night. But some will not be returning. Five House Republicans were defeated: Vince Snowbarger of Kansas, Bill Redmond of New Mexico, Jon Fox of Pennsylvania, Mike Pappas of New Jersey, and Rick White of Washington. One Democrat also lost his re-election bid Rep. Jay Johnson of Wisconsin. The new House member include 17 Republicans and at least 22 Democrats. David Wu, a Democrat wa leading Molly Bordonaro, a Republican in the race for one House seat in Oregon, but the final victory announcement wa not expected until Friday after absentee ballot are counted. Unlike the self-proclaimed revolutionary of the Republican class of 1994, many of the newly elected member are career politician who rose through the rank of local and state government. Three of the Democrats are the son of former lawmaker, Mark Udall of Colorado, son of Morris Udall who represented Arizona; Tom Udall of New Mexico, son of the other Udall brother, Stewart, a former congressman and secretary of the Interior, and Charlie Gonzalez, who won the Texas seat of his father, Henry. A week after the White House and congressional Democrats disavowed his war on Speaker Newt Gingrich, James Carville, President Clinton's former campaign strategist and chief outside defender, put forth a new battle cry Wednesday: He will not be muzzled. Not only that, but Carville went beyond his customary denunciation of Gingrich and the Republicans and, in an interview, trained his fire on leader in his own party for not being sufficiently aggressive four week before Election Day. My sense of frustration is that I believe the Democrats have a much better chance of doing much better than anyone expects, Carville said. And I don't think anyone's emerging to try to pull it together. Everybody ought to be pushing, the leadership in the Congress, the White House, the DNC. We ought to hammer Gingrich every day. How can you take the Congress back if you don't make a case against the people who are running it? I have never heard of a strategy like that. Sounding increasingly agitated, he went on: The only people left to be activated in this election are Democrats. The right wing, they're bouncing off the wall. They're going out to vote. Rep. Dick Gephardt, the minority leader, complained to Erskine Bowles, the White House chief of staff, after Carville appeared on the NBC News program Meet the Press on Sept. 27 and declared, Cpl. Cue Ball Carville will be rolling into battle against Newt Gingrich. The concern among House Democrats, one expressed by some White House official a well, wa that Carville's vitriol would make the Democrats appear overly partisan and could be especially damaging to Democrats in marginal district who do not want to appear too easy on the president. But on Wednesday, Carville wa anything but timid. If Gephardt people think they've quieted me down, he said, I'm not quieted. Carville said he told official at the White House, Don't waste your breath about calling me and telling me not to say this. Carville insisted that he would rather do battle with Republicans than with his fellow Democrats. If they want to fight with me, they can, he said. I'm going to fight with the Republicans. Yet he could not help but ridicule his party. Asked to describe the Democrats' strategy for the election, Carville said, If there is one, no one's shared it with me. Just four year ago, it wa a good bet that Newt Gingrich would be the pivotal figure in US. politics at the turn of the millennium. Seemingly overnight he had taken a moribund minority party and turned it into a pumped-up, issue-driven House majority. With a promise to balance the budget, end welfare and represent more conservative social value, he appeared to have rearranged the political map for Congress just a Ronald Reagan had done for the presidency. But Gingrich's leadership is now so shaky that even if he maintains his hold on the speaker's office, he is in danger of marginalization. A change this dramatic suggests something far more profound than a miscalculation about election tactic. What looked like one of the major realignments in US. political history might turn out to have been nothing but a temporary shift. The Gingrich revolution wa fueled by anger, a revolt of white working-class Americans against what they perceived a a Democratic bias in favor of black and other minority, and a middle-class rejection of the politics of big government and big deficit. They were the same resentment that Ronald Reagan had exploited so successfully. But old political habit and a moribund Republican leadership allowed the Democrats to retain control of Congress throughout the 1980s, and turned Reagan's economic program into an undisciplined tax-cutting spree that created prosperity along with huge budget gap. Gingrich's attention-grabbing rhetoric, energy and talent for political organization finally took Reagan's formula for success to the congressional election in 1994. But once in power, he ran head on into Bill Clinton, whose political instinct were even better. The president co-opted part of the Contract With America, particularly the balanced budget and welfare reform. He adapted the Republican social message into a call for thing like school uniform and television rating system, which symbolized more responsibility and parental control without supporting government intrusion into private life. The Republican right's genuine contempt for Clinton wa based in part on the well-known flaw in the president's character. But it wa mainly a reaction to the ease with which he had diverted what wa supposed to be the flood tide of their revolution. They expected that the genuine success of Gingrich's first year in office would lead to still larger victory for minimal government and tax, unfettered free enterprise and a return to conservative Christian value. But the public wa happy to be led in another direction, and focus on the concern of aging baby boomer about health care and Social Security. The government that wa seen a the enemy when the issue were budgetary once again looked like a potential ally. Back in 1994, both party were so stunned by the sudden change in their congressional fortune that they may have overestimated what it all meant. In particular they may not have realized how quickly good economic time, a drop in crime and national welfare reform could blunt the power of race in US. politics. The Democrats had become literally a minority party a white voter resentfully identified their policy with city, black and immigrant. But last week union worker and Catholics returned to the Democratic fold. Without race a a wedge issue, the solid black Democratic vote became a powerful advantage in key state. Blacks, woman and Latinos angry at Republican anti-immigration initiative were the winning coalition in California, North Carolina and New York. The speaker wa right to say this wa not the election we expected. There may indeed be a Republican majority in America, but it appears to resemble the Republicanism of Dwight Eisenhower rather than Newt Gingrich pro-business, wary of debt and with an inherent distaste for bringing up messy social issue like abortion. The Republicans who have begun talking about compassionate conservatism and the politics of inclusion may be peddling political mush, but they peddled it to victory on Tuesday. The congressional Republican Party's long sojourn in the wilderness of the House minority may have left it too accustomed to opposition to figure out what it can be for, and too attached to the politics of anger to make sense of a nation in the mood for moderation. Gingrich ha suggested that his mistake wa to let the Republicans drift along on the politics of impeachment when they should have been almost maniacally focused on thing like tax cut. But looking maniacal is what got them into trouble in the first place. Winning control of Congress after so many year wa very tough for Gingrich in 1994. But it will be ten time tougher to forge a politics that doe not depend on rage. House Speaker Newt Gingrich, who orchestrated the Republican revolution of recent year and is overseeing the impeachment inquiry into President Clinton, wa driven from office Friday by a party that swiftly turned on him after it unexpected loss in Tuesday's midterm election. Catching virtually everyone on Capitol Hill by surprise, Gingrich announced Friday night in two conference call to other Republicans that he would not seek re-election a Speaker in the Nov. 18 vote and would leave Congress altogether when his term expires in January. This will give u a chance to purge some of the poison that is in the system, Gingrich said, according to a party aide who listened to one of the call. Gingrich's resignation wa a stunning reversal for one of the most combative and personally confrontational politician in America. He made his name a decade ago by bringing down one Democratic speaker, Jim Wright, and continued his assaultive style through Tuesday's election with last-minute commercial reminding voter of the Clinton scandal. His reflexive pugilistic response wa evident even Friday night. In his second conference call, according to several people who listened, Gingrich blamed House conservative for his downfall. Although it wa their revolutionary zeal he harnessed to take control of Congress in 1994, they have become his most bitter critic in the last two year of his tumultuous speakership. Friday night he called them cannibal who had blackmailed him into quitting. Rep. Michael P. Forbes, R-N.Y., said: Newt said all those who had marginalized the Republican Party had engaged in cannibalism. He said, `Refer to the clips.' He's blaming others. Another Republican described the conference call this way: He started off very statesmanlike, but then you could see the anger building. When someone asked him why he wa leaving, he said, `A handful of member have blackmailed the conference.' He said, `They're hateful.' And he said, `They're cannibals.' Gingrich announced his move just hour after Rep. Robert L. Livingston of Louisiana announced he wa running for speaker, putting himself forward a a pragmatist and a manager. After the Gingrich call, Rep. Bill Archer of Texas announced he wa considering his own run for speaker. Livingston and Archer are chairman of the two most powerful committee in the House. In a statement Gingrich said, The Republican conference need to be unified, and it is time for me to move forward. He said he hoped his colleague would pick a successor who can both reconcile and discipline, who can work together and communicate effectively. Referring to his wife, he told his colleague he wa resigning from Congress because Marianne and I are tired. We need time off to get to know each other again. He also acknowledged his own knack for bringing negative attention to himself and his party. If I stay, he told his colleague Friday night, my controversial nature would overshadow any success we might have, an understatement to those who recalled his suggestion two year ago that he forced a shutdown of the government because he wa miffed about having to sit in the back of Air Force One on a trip with President Clinton. According to another Republican who took note, Gingrich said of his resignation: There is a lot of bitterness amongst some of the member. So long a I am around, I will always be a target in the news medium, which would mean we would never be able to get our message out. Clinton said: Newt Gingrich ha been a worthy adversary leading the Republican Party to a majority in the House and joining me in a great national debate over how best to prepare America for the 21st century. Despite our profound difference, I appreciate those time we were able to work together in the national interest, especially Speaker Gingrich's strong support for America's continuing leadership for freedom, peace and prosperity in the world. Many Republicans took the opportunity to portray Gingrich a a visionary. Rep. Sherwood Boehlert of New York said that during the first conference call, there wa shock and surprise and strong expression of appreciation for leading u to the Promised Land. His supporter said Gingrich had the vote to win the election to nominate a speaker, which is to be conducted by secret ballot. But, they agreed, the party's slim, six-vote majority meant every vote would be a battle. Kenneth Duberstein, a former official in the Reagan administration, said, I have no doubt he had the vote to be speaker, but I'm not sure he had the vote to govern. He said that because of the deep rift in the party, Gingrich would not have been able to implement his plan. In an unusually biting reaction, Rep. Dick Gephardt of Missouri, the Democratic leader, said he hoped that Gingrich's resignation would clear the fierce partisan air that he had fostered. I hope that whoever succeeds Newt Gingrich a speaker will immediately begin the process of repairing the damage that wa wrought on this institution over the last four year, Gephardt said. House Republicans predicted that Gingrich's resignation would set off a more wide-ranging and hectic scramble to replace him than had been anticipated. There will be a lot of pretender to the throne who will test the water, said Boehlert, who had supported Gingrich for re-election a speaker. There won't be any shortage of candidate. The presidential campaign of 2000 began Wednesday, like it or not. The millennial election will be fought on a political playing field whose rough outline, if not it exact boundary, were drawn by the voter in Tuesday's election, which delivered a crushing disappointment to the giddy hope of the Republicans and an unexpected elixir to the recently ailing Democrats. President Clinton called it an astonishing triumph of issue over investigation and said the Democrats had won so many major victory because they had a clear message. Republicans agreed. Of course the next 18 month will bring many surprise and many reversal of fortune. But the election result offered important guideline. Tuesday wa a great day for Vice President Al Gore, for at least three reason. He worked furiously and successfully in the last ten day before the balloting to persuade Democratic loyalist not to stay home and sulk, appearing on behalf of no fewer than 224 candidate, according to his office. A moderate within the spectrum of his own party, he watched moderate win crucial election, notably in the California gubernatorial race, where Lt. Gov. Gray Davis, a cautious pragmatist like Gore, won a smashing victory. The return an even break in the Senate and a Democratic gain of five in the House of Representatives also made the impeachment of President Clinton le likely. And the better shape Clinton is in a his term end, the better chance Gore, his sidekick for six year now, stand in the presidential nomination process and, ultimately, the election. But California voter also complicated the nominating process and set Gore strategist to work on tactic to uncomplicate it, because he and they consider the state absolutely central to his presidential aspiration. In a referendum in 1996, California adopted a primary system under which Republicans, Democrats and independent voter would all receive the same ballot, with candidate of all party listed. That violates the rule of both major party, and a measure on the ballot Tuesday, Proposition 3, would have rescinded the 1996 change. But it failed, raising the possibility that California's March 7 primary will be a mere political popularity poll, with convention delegate chosen in caucus or convention a nightmare. Tuesday wa a bad day for the Republican right. High-profile right-winger lost across the country, from Attorney General Dan Lungren in the California governor's race to Sen. Lauch Faircloth, denied re-election in North Carolina, to Rep. Mark Neumann of Wisconsin, who failed in a Senate race despite a huge spending advantage over Sen. Russell Feingold, to Ellen Sauerbrey in Maryland, who proved unable on her second try to prevail over an unpopular Democratic governor, Parris Glendening. Both conservative and moderate in the party said the Republicans had to get back to basic. Even Speaker Newt Gingrich conceded that the result should sober every Republican and called for new strategic thinking. If you make it a referendum on a president with a 67 per cent approval rating, a they tried to do, you shouldn't be surprised if the election go against you, said Gov. Tom Ridge of Pennsylvania, a moderate whose promoter mention him weekly a a possible vice-presidential nominee. Sen. John McCain of Arizona, a conservative who tends to steer away from divisive social issue, won re-election with 68 per cent of the vote. He is studying the possibility of a presidential race, but before he or any other Republican nominee can hope to win, he said in an interview Wednesday, congressional Republicans and their leader need to learn some lesson. I just hope this debacle is a wake-up call for our people, he said. You've got to be for something smaller government, better education, something. We're seen a the party that's against everything. Polls taken late in this year's campaign bore McCain out. They showed that the Republicans are no longer identified with issue that were once their electoral bread and butter, such a low tax and law and order. Tuesday wa also a fresh demonstration, for anyone who needed one, of the political utility of pitching a tent big enough for almost everyone. Black politician in North Carolina, Maryland and California reported that their fear of an indifferent black turnout had proved groundless. Black vote proved indispensable to a considerable number of hard-pressed Democratic candidate, especially where they felt their interest directly threatened. The figure on Hispanic voting, assembled from exit poll and from the candidates' own precinct analysis, showed dramatic difference. In California, where the outgoing Republican governor, Pete Wilson, had played the anti-immigration card with a vengeance, both major Democratic candidate Davis and Sen. Barbara Boxer, who won re-election after trailing in early poll cleaned up among Hispanic voter. He took 78 percent, she 72. But both of the Bush brother, Jeb in Florida and George W. in Texas, took more than half the Hispanic vote in their highly successful gubernatorial campaign. So did McCain. Jeb Bush is married to a Hispanic woman, he and his brother both speak Spanish fluently and frequently, and Senator McCain ha long espoused Hispanic cause. Both George W. Bush and McCain will draw strength, if they decide to run, from their proven ability to appeal to Hispanic voter, a well a their general electoral strength. George W. Bush took 69 percent of the vote in Texas, where a Democrat sat in the governor's chair only four year ago, and which ha the second-largest bloc of electoral vote. Florida ha the fourth-largest. Governor Bush of Texas uttered a rallying cry for the moderate. A leader who is compassionate and conservative, he said in his victory speech, can erase the gender gap and open the Republican party to new face and new voice. But figure on the right saw thing differently. James Dobson, a leading religious broadcaster, said that Republicans had fared poorly because Gingrich and Sen. Trent Lott of Mississippi, the majority leader, had caved in to the president on the budget and de-emphasized social issue such a abortion and flag desecration. He called all but explicitly for the ouster of Gingrich. Likewise, the millionaire publisher Steve Forbes, another probable candidate in 2000, said the leadership will have a lot to answer for. Tuesday proved the potency of education a an issue, and suggested that it will emerge a a major theme of the 2000 campaign. Clinton, in his limited involvement in the campaign, and Gore, in his extensive participation, both stressed Democratic program to build more school and hire more teacher. Almost a quarter of California voter and there are now almost twice a many voter in California a in any other state named education a their most pressing concern. Elsewhere, Democrats won the governorship of Alabama and South Carolina against the odds, partly by emphasizing their rivals' opposition to lottery that will help to pay for school. In Iowa, a Democrat wa elected governor for the first time since 1969 on a platform that featured the dilapidated condition of the state's school and a promise to remedy it. Tuesday demonstrated the overriding importance of money in modern American politics. Feingold, one of the principal backer of campaign-finance reform, survived to fight another day, but so did opponent of reform. And the return in House race, showing that all but six of 401 member who sought re-election had won, underlined once again how hard it is, under the present system, for a challenger to raise enough money to compete effectively. The difficulty of raising money may doom many would-be presidential candidacy. Gore will have what he need, a will Bush, Forbes and former Gov. Lamar Alexander of Tennessee. But how many others will? Finally, Tuesday delivered an indecisive message about impeachment. Close to two-thirds of voter nationwide told exit pollster that they intended to send no message about Clinton, but they made it clear in response to other question that they disliked the House inquiry into the president's alleged misdeed and wanted to see it end. In only two state, Kansas and Nebraska, did a majority of voter say they favored even a congressional censure of Clinton, a much milder form of punishment advocated by many Clinton backer. Some Republicans said privately that there should be no hearing at all in the Clinton matter, and some Democrats began talking about a deal, the equivalent of a plea bargain that would bring the matter to an early close. Nevertheless, Republican member of the House Judiciary Committee said they needed to press ahead with the Constitutional process that the House ha set in motion. Among those taking that view were Rep. Bob Barr of Georgia, a fierce foe of the president, and Rep. Mary Bono of California, whose tone ha been more muted. But Rep. David Dreier of California, the incoming Rules Committee chairman, said that the election ha played a role in ensuring that one of u ha a desire to drag that out. Stunned by the Democratic resurgence in the mid-term election, congressional Republicans tore into each other Wednesday over who wa to blame for their failure to make the traditional opposition party gain in an off-year election. The soul-searching and recrimination and a possibility of congressional leadership challenge came a election result showed that Republicans had been unable to increase their 55-45 hold over the Senate and that Democrats had picked up five seat in the House. The Democratic surge marked the first time since 1934 that the president's party had gained seat in a midterm election, and it whittled the Republican House majority down to a mere six vote. The Democratic victory were even more remarkable in a political year marked by the months-long scandal over President Clinton's affair with Monica Lewinsky. The Republicans' new 223-211 majority (assuming a Democrat leading in Oregon hold on to win), with one independent, amounted to the smallest congressional majority since the Republican-controlled Congress of 1953, the last time Republicans controlled the House until they captured it again in 1994. With attention now shifting to the House Judiciary Committee and it impeachment inquiry, Rep. Henry Hyde told fellow Republicans on the panel in a conference call Wednesday that the only witness Republicans were likely to call would be the independent counsel, Kenneth Starr. Hyde, the chairman, told lawmaker he hoped to have the committee vote on possible article of impeachment by Thanksgiving, an act that would take the issue out of his hand and put it into Gingrich's. Committee Democrats declined comment Wednesday until they could discus Hyde's plan among themselves. Trying to put the best face on the result, Speaker Newt Gingrich said in Marietta, Ga., that the Republicans still held onto the House for three election in a row for the first time since the election of 1932. But furious rank and file Republicans burned up the phone line to each other, discussing whether to mount leadership challenge in both chamber in the next few week. We've got to reach out and have more than southern white male running the Washington Republican Party, said Rep. Joe Scarborough, a conservative from Florida. He said that Republicans this year had been left without any accomplishment to run on. We need an agenda first of all, he said. We went an entire calendar year without an agenda. Rep. Chris Shays, a moderate from Connecticut called the election a devastating loss and said simply, There are going to be major change in our leadership. All segment of our party want to see change. At the White House, Clinton called the election result a vindication of his party's policy. If you look at all the result, he said, they are clear and unambiguous. The American people want their business, their concern, their child, their family, their future addressed here. That's what the message of the election wa. One of the first difficult question now facing Congress is how to proceed with the impeachment inquiry in the face of public resistance to removing Clinton from office, and with a Republican majority now so slim that it is almost certain that the 218 vote required for impeachment cannot be assembled. In a public statement released Wednesday, Hyde said The Committee continues to have a clear constitutional duty to complete it work in a fair and expeditious manner. Our duty ha not changed because the constitution ha not changed. But Sen. Robert Torricelli, D-N.J., said the election result guaranteed that impeachment will fail. I think any serious effort to remove President Clinton from office is effectively over, he said. It is simply for Newt Gingrich and Trent Lott to decide on an exit strategy. From the other side of the aisle, Rep. Rick Lazio, a Long Island Republican, said, The inquiry should be wrapped up expeditiously, fairly and it ought to be resolved in the immediate future. For the past year, Republicans struggled to keep control of the House with 228 seat and to find consensus among their party's competing faction. With their number reduced, the Republican leadership will need to carry out a tortuous balancing act to unite a hard-core conservative faction that want a more aggressive social agenda with a bloc of moderate who want their party to return to the center. The Democrats held 206 seat, and one wa held by an indepenndent. Any small Republican faction will now have enormous leverage. The new arithmetic of the House may even lead to Democrats' and moderate Republicans' forming ad hoc majority on issue, taking control away from Republican leader. Already seeing some of the possibility, Rep. Peter King of Long Island, N.Y., said northeastern Republicans would be strengthened. It give u much more leverage with the leadership and make it easier to protect New York, he said. It's going to weaken the position of the strident conservative and the anti-northeast conservative. Just two week ago, Gingrich had foreseen election gain ranging from 10 seat to more than 40. Seeming uncharacteristically uncertain Wednesday, he said he had trouble accounting for the result. Things were happening out there that none of u fully understand--neither party in my judgment, he said. Taking his share of the blame for his party's loss, the Georgia Republican said he had misjudged how the public would recoil from the Clinton scandal a amplified in the modern medium world and how the scandal would drown out other Republican theme. I mean I totally underestimated the degree to which people would just get sick of 24-hour-a day talk television and talk radio and then the degree to which this whole scandal became just sort of disgusting by sheer repetition, he said. And a a result I think we probably underestimated the need to really aggressively push a much stronger message about cutting tax and saving Social Security, winning the war on drug, reforming education and national defense. Majority Leader Sen. Trent Lott of Mississippi also admitted mistake, saying his party had not presented a clear enough message in the final 96 hour of the campaign. He also conceded that Congress' final scramble to pas a $500 billion budget bill hurt his party. One of this lesson for Republicans out of this is that we need to listen more carefully to the people and we need to have a clear understanding and concise message that we do apply across the nation, he said in Washington. Both Lott and Gingrich said Republicans would put an emphasis next year on tax-cutting and shoring up the Social Security system. Even a the two leader spoke, their angry rank-and-file lawmaker were making phone call trying to ass whether to mount challenge against the Republican leader who have steered the Congress since the Republican's assumed control four year ago. One senior Republican staffer said the House had become a tinderbox of intrigue. Scarborough said, The long distance charge in Washington office probably are going through the roof today. Everybody's calling everybody. Everybody recognizes that something's terribly wrong with the direction of Washington Republicans when Republican governor are doing so well in New York, Massachusetts, Florida and Texas. And while Gingrich ha not gone out of his way to identify himself with the Republican campaign's last-minute ad blitz attacking President Clinton, his caucus know he is responsible. Gingrich ha faced down an uprising before, foiling a coup attempt against him by disgruntled conservative and some of his own leadership team in the summer of 1997. Any move to remove him remains a long-shot. But with House leadership election now set for mid-November, Republicans said this time the dissatisfaction in their caucus had crossed ideological line to moderate like Shays a well. We got shellacked, said Rep. Christopher Cannon, a conservative from Utah. We beat ourselves because we had no agenda. Republicans were discussing possible challenge to Gingrich, his second-in-command, Rep. Dick Armey, and other member of the senior leadership team. Some were envisioning trying to run an entire new ticket headed by Rep. Bob Livingston, the Appropriations Committee chairman from Louisiana and including Rep. Steve Largent, an Oklahoma conservative. Asked whether Tuesday's election result could cost him the speakership, Gingrich said, I'm not particularly concerned. Republicans close to him said they expected the anger to dissipate. In the Senate, where leadership race take place in early December, some Republicans were talking of mounting challenge against mid-level leadership figure. Several senator expressed particular pique toward the re-election chairman, Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, who poured party dollar and much of his own time into trying to defeat the Democratic champion of campaign finance overhaul, Russell Feingold of Wisconsin. Feingold won in a close race. Some lawmaker on Wednesday approached Sen. Chuck Hagel of Nebraska to see if he would replace McConnell. Hagel confirmed he had talked to more than eight senator, and wa considering whether to challenge McConnell. Hagel lambasted the Republican leadership for the election outcome. This is a big loss for u, he said. We squandered a very historic opportunity last night. To just break even is a loss. Most incumbent coasted to victory Tuesday night. But some will not be returning. Five House Republicans were defeated: Vince Snowbarger of Kansas, Bill Redmond of New Mexico, Jon Fox of Pennsylvania, Mike Pappas of New Jersey, and Rick White of Washington. One Democrat also lost his re-election bid Rep. Jay Johnson of Wisconsin. The new House member include 17 Republicans and at least 22 Democrats. David Wu, a Democrat wa leading Molly Bordonaro, a Republican in the race for one House seat in Oregon, but the final victory announcement wa not expected until Friday after absentee ballot are counted. Unlike the self-proclaimed revolutionary of the Republican class of 1994, many of the newly elected member are career politician who rose through the rank of local and state government. Three of the Democrats are the son of former lawmaker, Mark Udall of Colorado, son of Morris Udall who represented Arizona; Tom Udall of New Mexico, son of the other Udall brother, Stewart, a former congressman and secretary of the Interior, and Charlie Gonzalez, who won the Texas seat of his father, Henry. A struggle for control of the House is under way, with Rep. Robert Livingston conducting a telephone campaign that could lead to him running against Newt Gingrich a speaker. But Gingrich's counter-campaign ha given some member pause about ousting him. At the same time, a small band of Republicans vowed on Thursday that they would not vote to re-elect Gingrich under any circumstance, a move that, because of the Republicans' shrunken House majority, could tie the party in knot for month. Rep. Matt Salmon, R-Ariz., said: I personally have made the decision that I cannot vote for Newt Gingrich for speaker in January, and there are six others who have told me they feel the same way, seven people who just will not, and it take six to deadlock the vote. Fury at the speaker ha boiled over since Tuesday's election, when Republicans suffered a net loss of five seat in the House. They blamed Gingrich, the party's chief strategist. But many were already angry at him for what they said wa his failure to articulate a clear message for the party going into the election and for a messy budget process that gave President Clinton a political edge and contradicted Republican principle of fiscal conservativism by containing massive amount of spending for local project. House Republicans are to meet Nov. 18 to vote by secret ballot for their leader. Whoever win the Republican nomination for speaker must stand for election by the full House in January. Even if Gingrich win the secret ballot, he could be denied re-election a speaker in January if Salmon and at least five others refuse to vote for him. Because the Republicans now control the House by only 12 seat, it would take just six vote against Gingrich to deny him a majority. With such a chaotic and unacceptable prospect looming, Livingston told Gingrich that he should step aside for the good of the party, Republican official said. The official said that Livingston spoke to Gingrich shortly after the election return but also before the election, reflecting Livingston's earlier displeasure with the speaker over the budget process. Several Republicans said that both Livingston, the chairman of the Appropriations Committee and one of the few member with the stature to stand for speaker, and Gingrich were working the phone on Thursday in a struggle for vote. Livingston ha said nothing publicly about a challenge to Gingrich, but several member and aide said on Thursday that he would announce his intention, possibly a soon a Friday, only after he had determined if he could win. Rep. Peter King, R-N.Y., wa one of several member who spoke with Livingston on Thursday. He told me he's making a number of phone call, that he's gotten a very positive response about running for speaker, and he'll decide within the next 48 hour, King said. He won't do it till he ha his duck in a row, and right now a lot of people are still loyal to the speaker, said an aide to a Republican who, like many others, is trying to straddle the line between fealty to a speaker who may retain power and encouragement to a challenger who offer a salve to an embattled party. Many Republicans immediately blamed Gingrich for the party's loss on Tuesday. Talk quickly emerged the next day of a slate of candidate to oppose Gingrich and his lieutenant. The list of possible candidate for leadership position included Rep.e Steve Largent of Oklahoma, who talked with Livingston on Thursday about challenging Gingrich, Republican official said, speaking on the condition that their name not be reported. Those official said that Largent told Livingston that he wanted to run with him on a ticket and that he would challenge Rep. Dick Armey, the majority leader. But, these official said that if Livingston did not challenge Gingrich, Largent would run for speaker instead. Other name were floated Wednesday for leadership post. They included Reps. David McIntosh of Indiana for speaker and Jennifer Dunn of Washington a conference chairman. Added to the mix on Thursday wa the name of Rep. Christopher Cox, a California conservative. As a sign of the uncertainty prevailing among House member on Thursday, Rep. Henry Hyde, the chairman of the Judiciary Committee and one of the House's most venerable member, rebuffed a chance to endorse Gingrich a speaker. Hyde said that Gingrich bore responsibility for the party's loss Tuesday. Leadership take credit when thing go right, he said. They ought to take the blame when thing go wrong. Asked if Gingrich should remain speaker, Hyde said: I rather think he will, but that remains to be seen. The energy that many vented publicly on Wednesday a anger toward Gingrich seemed devoted on Thursday to intense internal political calculation about whether Livingston could succeed in toppling Gingrich and whether he should succeed. While many support him a a veteran who understands the House and ha shown shrewd political skill in managing the massive federal budget, others are reviving image of the Louisianan a a hot-head who gave the party a bad name during the government shutdown two year ago and who tends toward arm-flailing in heated moment. One conservative leader said that he and his ally had reservation about Livingston because he wa obsessed about trying to keep social issue out of the budget process. The budget, he said, ha been a vehicle for conservative over the year to add restriction on federal money for abortion and other thing you can't get through the Senate or past a presidential veto. If Livingston is the challenger, I doubt that will cause a rallying of the real conservative in Congress. Some moderate said they were prepared to support him. Rep. Marge Roukema, R-N.J., said, I would be amenable to Livingston. Still, she cautioned, I'm not after Newt. But it's wrong not to sit down and seriously look at our option. Ken Johnson, an aide to Rep. WJ. (Billy) Tauzin, R-La., said that his bos wa emblematic of the confusion among the broad base of House Republicans. Billy ha been loyal to both Speaker Gingrich and Dick Armey, and he's still loyal to them, but he also want to hear what they have to say before committing to them in the next election, Johnson said. Everyone is asking the same question: Can we refocus the message and re-energize our base without re-aligning the leadership? Salmon said his refusal to support Gingrich no matter what wa based on Gingrich's track record of one failed strategy after another, including the impeachment process and the pork-laden budget. With the challenge under way, Gingrich ha been trying to show member that he is responsive to their concern. After an election night in which he portrayed the Republicans a victorious even a they lost seat, the next day he took responsibility for the loss. In another move, Gingrich ha indicated that he is willing to cede control over the party's congressional campaign committee, allowing the whole House to select it member. Gingrich is also making strong personal appeal to Republicans. Said one top House aide: He'll get support. How much? Only his own vote-counters know. ","Speaker of the House Newt Gingrich has announced that he will not seek re-election to the post when the vote comes up on November 18th.He also announced that he would be leaving the House when his current term as Speaker expires in January.This announcement comes on the heels of a poor Republican showing in the mid-term elections.Although the Republicans retained a majority in the House, the Margin of Republican control shrank in the face of Democratic gains.Gingrich had been seen as the man who led the Republicans our of the doldrums into control of the House and the Senate.","Most Democrats, except for former Clinton strategist James Carville, were hesitant to attack Speaker Newt Gingrich as the 1998 elections approached.Republicans were expected to add to their majority in Congress.However, Republicans lost seats in both the House and Senate.Republicans became disenchanted with the Gingrich ""vision"" and blamed him for the losses.An active campaign began to replace Gingrich as Speaker with Louisiana Congressman Robert Livingston as the main actor.After a losing struggle to maintain his position, Gingrich resigned as Speaker.House Republicans then turned their attention to impeachment proceedings of President Clinton.","The 1998 election ended the political career of Newt Gingrich, who had become Speaker in 1994, leading a conservative, issue-driven, GOP majority.In Oct Democrats were urged to go after him.Although both houses retained a narrowed GOP majority, Newt, with his combativeness and Impeachment-fixation, was blamed for the failures by both wings of his party.The 1998 winners were Gore, Clinton, and moderates.Newt's issues seemed dead in the booming economy and old Democratic loyalists ignored Clinton's morals and returned to the fold.As fellow Republicans jockeyed for his positions, Newt resigned as Speaker on Nov 6 and also decided to leave his House seat.","James Carville complained that fellow Democrats didn't join his war against Speaker Newt Gingrich leading up to the congressional elections of 1998.Gingrich had led the impeachment inquiry against President Clinton in the House.When, contrary to all predictions, the Democrats gained five seats in the House and held their own in the Senate, Republicans enlisted in Carville's cause, blaming Gingrich for the election results.Gingrich battled fiercely as Rep. Livingston rallied forces against him, but ultimately Gingrich accepted defeat agreeing to cede the speakership and his seat in the House.He blamed his defeat on blackmail by Republican cannibals."
26,"America Online is on the verge of agreeing to purchase Netscape Communications Corp., the Internet pioneer at the center of the government's antitrust suit against Microsoft Corp., executive involved in the talk said Sunday. The proposed deal is a complex, three-way transaction involving AOL, Netscape and Sun Microsystems Inc. AOL, the leading on-line service with more than 14 million subscriber, would acquire Netscape's popular site on the World Wide Web and it software business. AOL would also enter into a joint marketing and development partnership with Sun Microsystems to strengthen Netscape's other business of selling to large corporation the heavy-duty software needed to serve up Web page and other Internet technology to many thousand of user at the same time. The purchase, an exchange of AOL share for Netscape stock, is valued at roughly $4 billion. A completed deal could be announced a soon a Monday morning. But executive involved in the talk cautioned Sunday night that some detail remained to be negotiated. The Netscape deal, if consummated, would realign three business at the forefront of the modern economy on-line service, Internet software and electronic commerce. It would strengthen two of Microsoft's leading rival, AOL and Sun Microsystems. At the same time, however, it would end the independent existence of Netscape, an Internet software maker once regarded a the most serious challenger to Microsoft's dominance of the personal computer software market. Netscape, founded in 1994, ha struggled over the last 18 month under an assault from Microsoft. Its Navigator wa the runaway leader in the market for the browser software used to navigate the World Wide Web. But Microsoft, responding to the Internet revolution, entered the market aggressively, quickly matching the quality of Netscape's technology and then bundling the Microsoft browser, Internet Explorer, into it industry-standard Windows operating system and giving it away free. Eventually, Microsoft's browser technology caught up to Netscape's. Earlier this year, Netscape announced layoff and started distributing Navigator for free a well, a Microsoft steadily gained in the browser market. Since then, Netscape ha focused mainly on two business advertising and transaction fee from it Netcenter Web site and selling industrial-strength software to corporation that are building their own Internet site on which to conduct electronic commerce. AOL belief it ha the expertise to increase revenue from Netscape's Web site and, helped by Sun's programmer and vast corporate sale force, to accelerate Netscape's software sale a well, executive involved in the negotiation said. Among large corporation, Sun's version of Unix, Solaris, is among the most popular operating system for the powerful computer that run Netscape's server software. The much smaller Netscape would be placed under the wing of AOL and Sun Microsystems. The three company had combined revenue of more than $12.4 billion last year. Microsoft, by comparison, had revenue of more than $14 billion. This deal would insure that the fundamental element of Netscape survive within bigger company that can drive it technology forward, said David B. Yoffie, a professor at the Harvard business school and co-author with Michael A. Cusumano of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology of a recent book, Competing on Internet Time: Lessons from Netscape and Its Battle with Microsoft. The impact of the deal, if any, on the government's antitrust suit against Microsoft is uncertain. It doe appear to support a key theme of Microsoft's defense namely, that it operates in a fast-moving industry where corporate alliance shift all the time. Thus, Microsoft argues, antitrust policy should tread gently. But the deal, government official insist, should have no direct effect on the current case. No matter how much the alliance shift, it doesn't affect the central fact of Microsoft's monopoly and how it ha used and abused it market power to protect it monopoly, said David Boies, the Justice Department's lead trial lawyer in the Microsoft case. Executives representing Netscape, AOL and Sun Microsystems are government witness at the Microsoft trial. And the serious merger talk between Netscape Chief Executive Officer James Barksdale and AOL Chairman Steve Case began about a month ago, or just after the start of the Microsoft trial, according to people close to the talk. Industry analyst suggest that the company may have been emboldened to take stronger anti-Microsoft step based partly on the perception that the antitrust case would weaken Microsoft. And representative of Kleiner Perkins Caufield &AMP; Byers, a Silicon Valley venture capital firm regarded a a power broker among Microsoft's rival, sit on the board of Netscape, Sun and AOL. Still, executive involved in the talk said that the timing of the proposed deal wa unrelated to the antitrust trial. Nor should it, one person noted, be regarded a a single-minded attempt to circle the wagon against Microsoft. Indeed, AOL, according to one person close to the talk, plan to keep Microsoft's Internet Explorer browser a the default choice on it on-line service. One of the government's allegation in the antitrust suit is that Microsoft won out over Netscape a the main browser for AOL because Microsoft used it Windows monopoly a a bargaining chip. To win the browser deal, Microsoft offered AOL prime real estate on the Windows desktop, the main screen on more than 90 percent of personal computer sold today. Staying with Microsoft's browser can be seen a proof that AOL still regard placement on the Windows desktop a crucial, a well a a careful step to avoid undermining one of the allegation in the government's case. For AOL, the Netscape purchase would accelerate it evolution toward the Internet. At present, it flagship on-line service is a hybrid to it own proprietary service, it ha added a gateway to the World Wide Web. In addition, for consumer who do not subscribe to AOL's dial-up service, it also ha it own Web site, aol.com, which attracts about 24 million visitor a month, according to Media Metrix/Relevant Knowledge, a market research firm. Its big Web site offer a wide range of information, entertainment, Internet chat and e-mail, a leading example of the all-in-one site that have become known a portal. Netscape's Netcenter traffic ha slipped a bit in recent month, to under 16 million visitor a month, but it, too, is a major portal. Together, they should be a huge player in the intensifying portal battle for viewer and resulting advertising revenue. Yahoo is the current leader among portal site with more than 25 million monthly visitor, while Microsoft's site attracts more than 20 million a month. Though known a a new-media company for consumer, AOL is also interested in boosting it electronic commerce business with the Netscape purchase. AOL ha recently done work with Eastman Kodak, American Greetings and other company, not only promoting their product to on-line subscriber but also building the Internet infrastructure of software to conduct electronic commerce. AOL note projection like a recent one from Forrester Research Inc., which predicted that worldwide Internet commerce could reach a high a $3.2 trillion by 2003, or 5 percent of global sale. Sun Microsystems, analyst say, could be a strong partner for AOL in the market for Internet commerce software. Sun is a corporate software company with a sale force of several thousand. As it move increasingly to Internet technology, AOL should prove an excellent partner for Sun in term of developing and using Sun's Java, an Internet programming language. And while Netscape's browser no longer generates revenue on it own, it is a distribution channel for Java technology. Having Netscape's browser safely in the hand of a friendly company is of strategic importance for Sun, since Microsoft owns the alternative in the browser market. AOL is expected pay little, if any, premium over Netscape's stock price on Friday, executive close to the deal said, since Netscape share have more than doubled in the last month. In the last week alone, Netscape's stock ha jumped about $12, or nearly 45 percent, following report that it wa discussing a possible partnership with AOL. The stock closed Friday at $39.1875, up $2625. AOL's share gained $1.50 Friday, closing at $84875. Envisioning a thoroughly networked world in which the World Wide Web is a limitless marketplace of information, entertainment, product and service, America Online Inc. Tuesday laid out the detail of it agreement to buy the Netscape Communications Corporation for $4.2 billion. By moving quickly toward what both company have recently come to see a the inevitable convergence of technology and medium, America Online hope that it will secure a solid lead in a battle already joined by giant like the Microsoft Corp. and the International Business Machines Corp. to transform the greater part of cyberspace into a vast virtual mall. Part of that vision rest on an alliance with Sun Microsystems that America Online negotiated a part of the deal. Sun not only brings a cyber-savvy sale force to the effort but, even more importantly, a strong technology partner in developing Netscape's industrial-strength software for running Internet site. Sun is indeed a technology heavyweight. It owns the Java programming language specially designed for Internet application, and Solaris, among the most popular commercial operating system for the powerful computer that big corporation use to serve up Internet service like the World Wide Web, e-mail and retail transaction. It also manufacture a highly respected line of powerful computer based on it own microprocessor chip. But for America Online and for the big Internet player against which it will compete the real potential gold mine lie further down the road, perhaps five year away, when people will venture on line for information or shopping not only from personal computer but from inexpensive Internet appliance costing $200 each, or maybe included free a part of a subscription service, just a some cellular phone are now. Today, being wired remains a comparatively elitist activity an estimated 25 percent of American household had access to the Internet last year, and 5 percent of household bought merchandise on line. But the executive at America Online and Netscape hope that their deal will accelerate the timetable for the day when the Net is ubiquitous, when people will tap into the World Wide Web from appliance-like device, pager, cell phone, television set-top box or computer a routinely a they use the telephone today. A new generation of Internet device to be able to deliver our service anywhere is a key part of what this deal is about in the long run, said Stephen M. Case, 40, the chairman of America Online. For the present, however, the idea is to make America Online, the nation's leading online service, the standard way to get onto the Internet, the executive explained. Netscape, the Internet pioneer, is a crucial part of that effort, they said. There is no assurance that this vision of the technological future will prove accurate or, even if it doe, that the America Online-Netscape combination will lead the way. Still, the long-range game plan help explain what brought America Online and Netscape together. And the ability of the companies' executive to sell that vision to Netscape's whiz-kid programmer in particular will determine whether the merger succeeds. Netscape's headquarters in Mountain View, Calif., is likely become a prime target for Silicon Valley headhunter. As is the case with any software company, Netscape's key asset is it talented programmer, and many of these code hacker may be reluctant to work for America Online, which still ha a reputation a a middle-brow service catering to online newcomer, known derisively a newbie. Stock option and other financial incentive will be tailored to try to keep Netscape employee on board. But these people want to change the world, and we've got to be clear that joining with America Online, along with the Sun component, really is a bigger opportunity for u, said Marc Andreessen, the 26-year-old cofounder of Netscape who led a team of young programmer from the supercomputing center at the University of Illinois to Silicon Valley to start the Internet software company in 1994. This ought to be the preeminent Internet company over the next decade, Andreessen declared, speaking from a cell phone on a streetcorner in Palo Alto, Calif. For his part, Andreessen, a Netscape executive vice president, will become Netscape's chief technology officer for the next three or four month, until the merger is completed. His new job at America Online ha not yet been determined, but it is likely to be chief technology officer of the combined company a well, an America Online executive said. Already, according to one Netscape board member, Andreessen ha delivered a 12-page single-spaced memorandum to Case, setting out his view of the technological road map the new company should follow into the future, emphasizing the opportunity for electronic commerce in an environment in which most people are linked to the Internet. Netscape, populated with computing sophisticate, and America Online, known a an on-ramp to the Internet for the technologically challenged, seem a corporate odd couple. But the two company, it executive explained, had been evolving toward each other for more than a year. In a telephone interview from America Online's headquarters in Dulles, Va., Case described Netscape a an enterprise that had morphed itself from a company dependent on sale of it software used to browse the World Wide Web and in Microsoft's cross-hairs into a business that relied on advertising and other revenue from it popular Netcenter Web site and from selling software to corporation to handle electronic commerce. The Netscape transformation wa largely a reaction to Microsoft's competitive assault on it browser business a central element in the government's antitrust suit against Microsoft. Microsoft bundled it browser into it industry-standard Windows operating system, and gave away the browser for free. The government alleges these step were part of a pattern of anticompetitive practice, while Microsoft maintains the move were intended mainly to benefit consumer. Early this year, after laying off worker and suffering a large loss last year, Netscape announced that it would also distribute it browser for free. It seems to have stabilized it business around it new model. Netscape announced Tuesday that it earned $2.7 million on revenue of $162 million in it fourth fiscal quarter, which ended in September. Yet America Online ha also changed in the last couple of year, moving well beyond it reputation a an online service for beginner. It now ha an Internet chat service and run it own all-in-one site on the Web, known a a portal, which includes e-mail, Internet searching, news, entertainment and online shopping. America Online ha really changed from a closed online service for novice user to an Internet medium and technology company with a diverse set of brand, Andreessen said. These two company have been moving in the same direction, and the fit is a good one. America Online Inc. want to become the next Microsoft in two promising information-age field where Microsoft Corp. is just another company the Internet medium business and electronic commerce. With it proposed purchase of Netscape Communications Corp., AOL, the nation's largest dial-up online service with more than 14 million subscriber, hope to take a significant step toward that ambitious goal. If the $4 billion deal is completed the company had not reached a final agreement a of Monday night AOL would acquire a leading Internet brand and enlarge it wired audience by absorbing the million who regularly visit Netscape's popular NetCenter site on the World Wide Web. Acquiring Netscape would really enhance America Online's role a the premier Internet medium company, said James F. Moore, president of Geopartners Inc., a consulting firm. America Online is assembling the kind of audience number that will convince people the Internet is becoming a mainstream medium. In the new medium business, a in traditional medium like television or newspaper, eyeball translate into advertising revenue. But what really intrigue medium executive and consumer marketer about the new medium news, entertainment and service rendered in computer code is that it is inherently a two-way medium with which people can interact with the tap of a key or the click of a mouse button The interaction that advertiser and marketer want to see, of course, is buying. And it is the potential for exploiting an instant, direct connection to consumer that ha fueled all the recent optimism about electronic commerce. Today, company are selling everything from book to baby clothes over the Internet. Most company have not progressed beyond the experimentation stage, but there are a handful of encouraging success story like Amazon.com, the on-line bookstore. By 2003, Forrester Research Inc., whose business is analyzing trend in cyberspace, project that Internet commerce could reach $3.2 trillion, or 5 percent of all sale worldwide. AOL is at the forefront of this convergence of medium and commerce converge, and integration reflected in the lineage of it leader. Steve Case, the chairman, wa once a new-product manager for Pepsico's Pizza Hut chain, while Robert Pittman, the president, is a former MTV executive. Microsoft is also investing heavily in new medium and electronic commerce. It ha an online service, MSN, which competes with AOL, a well a information-and commerce Web site that focus on travel, car and real estate. It also owns Sidewalk, a network of local site that list movie, restaurant and store in city around the country including Seattle and New York. Its MSNBC Internet news service is half of a joint venture with NBC. Microsoft is expected to be a formidable competitor in the media-and-commerce business. It ha no shortage of bright people and it ha more money than any rival. Besides deep pocket, Microsoft ha the built-in advantage in any computer-based medium because it Windows operating system run more than 90 percent of personal computer sold today. Its control of the Windows desktop give it the most valuable piece of commercial real estate in the information age. In theory, at least, owning that desktop screen should help Microsoft steer consumer to it online offering an issue that is key to the government's antitrust suit against Microsoft. But so far, Microsoft ha started slowly in the field of Internet medium and electronic commerce. Microsoft may want to, but it doe not dominate these new market, said Richard Shaffer, a principal of Technologic Partners, a research firm. America Online recognizes that the big opportunity is in these emerging growth business like electronic commerce instead of trying to take Microsoft on head-on. Still, if the Netscape deal is completed, AOL will also find itself in the software business in a way it ha never been in the past. Netscape is known a the pioneer in the commercial development of software used to navigate the World Wide Web. Microsoft saw the browser software a a direct threat to it industry dominance and pursued that market aggressively, bundling it own browser with it Windows and giving it away free tactic that have been challenged by the government. But Netscape no longer generates revenue from it browser, which it now also distributes for free, but from the sale of heavy-duty software sold to corporation. Much of this software is used a the technological back office for electronic commerce used in building Web site and processing transaction. A surprising element in the proposed deal is that AOL intends to hold onto Netscape's corporate software business instead of selling it off to an established software company. America Online just doesn't have credibility in that market, observed Michael A. Cusumano, a professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology's Sloan School of Management. Executives close to AOL explain the decision a the need to provide full-line offering for electronic commerce, from corporate Web site to the computer screen of consumer. But AOL ha decided it need help to preserve and strengthen Netscape's corporate software business. To do that, it ha brought in Sun Microsystems Inc. in a side deal, which ha complicated the transaction considerably. AOL, according to executive close to the proposed deal, will own Netscape, but it will have a joint marketing and development partnership with Sun. As part of the deal, AOL will agree to purchase about $300 million worth of Sun's computer for it service, while Sun will apparently agree to purchase sizeable amount of Netscape software, which Sun's sale force must sell. Still, AOL and Sun have a longer-term objective a well one that promise to place them in more direct conflict with Microsoft. For nearly a year, William J. Raduchel, Sun's chief strategist, ha been working closely with AOL, according to Sun executive. A former Harvard economics professor who taught Scott McNealy, the Sun chairman, Raduchel ha focused on Sun's Internet programming technology, called Java and Jini, both of which are seen a potential threat to Microsoft's dominance. By combining Sun's technology prowess with AOL's powerful consumer brand, the Sun executive say, there is the potential for a kind end-run around Microsoft's grip on desktop computing. In it research laboratory, Sun ha been working on a stripped-down network computer a simple-to-use information appliance, which could cost a little a $200 or be given away a part of a subscription service. The concept is that AOL's Internet medium and electronic commerce service could be delivered to many more home than today because many people still shun the expense and difficulty of using a personal computer. The appliance would be mainly a receiver and screen, with most of the computing power residing on vast central computer serving up information a user request by tapping a few button. Sun's technological specialty is this kind of centralized network computing. If the long-term AOL-Sun vision ever materialized certainly a three-to-five year bet, at the least it could give both company a boost and technological independence from Microsoft. Microsoft Corp. argued in federal court Monday that the proposed acquisition of Netscape Communications Corp. by America Online seriously undermined the government's antitrust suit against the software giant. From a legal standpoint, this proposed deal pull the rug out from under the government, William Neukom, Microsoft's senior vice president for legal affair, said Monday morning on the courthouse step. The reasoning behind this assertion, Microsoft say, is that the proposed deal demonstrates that Netscape and the larger software industry are healthy and vibrant even with all of the illegal and anti-competitive practice alleged in the government's suit. But David Boies, the government's lead attorney, said all of that wa irrelevant. Whatever the deal end up being if there end up being a deal is not going to remove any of the obstacle that Microsoft ha placed in the path of competition in this industry, he said. Michael Lacovara, a Microsoft lawyer who wa questioning a government witness, economist Frederick Warren-Boulton, suggested to him during the trial Monday that the proposed acquisition undermined Warren-Boulton's argument, that Microsoft seems headed toward obtaining a monopoly in Internet browser software to match the one it apparently hold in operating system. After all, about 22 percent of Americans who use the Internet reach it through America Online. And at present AOL us Microsoft's Web browser, Internet Explorer, a the service's default choice. In exchange for that, Microsoft place an AOL advertisement and Internet link in Windows 98. Lacovara asked the witness whether, once AOL's service contract expires in January, he would expect AOL to continue to distribute Microsoft software. Yes, Warren-Boulton responded. It is not at all clear to me that AOL's incentive to do this is changed by this proposed merger with Netscape. He noted that America Online official had said their need to be among the online service featured in Windows forced them to accept Microsoft term establishing Internet Explorer a the default choice. Lacovara then asked Warren-Boulton the question that lay under his entire cross-examination of the witness and Microsoft's larger assertion Monday about the proposed Netscape-AOL deal. Surely this combination, he asked, tell you something about the nature of competition in the software industry? Warren-Boulton's answer wa probably not the one Lacovara had been after. To the extent that this potential merger is the result of Microsoft's action with these exclusive contract and other action, he said, it is unfortunate to see the disappearance of a firm like Netscape, the brightest, newest star. Warren-Boulton's purpose on the stand for the government is to establish that Microsoft doe have a monopoly in operating-system software; more than 90 percent of the world's computer use a Microsoft operating system. That is the foundation under most of the government's case since federal antitrust law forbids certain behavior by a monopolist that would be legal for a firm that face healthy competition. Through repeated, often circumlocutious questioning, Lacovara tried to make the case that Microsoft's overwhelming market share wa ephemeral. The software industry is so vibrant and fast moving, he suggested, that Microsoft could be toppled from it position at any moment a point of view the company encourages among it employee. On Friday and Monday, Lacovara repeatedly pointed out that other company are placing other operating system on the market, and some software company principally Microsoft's greatest rival are writing software for these new system. But Warren-Boulton argued that the existence of these fringe competitor in the operating system market doe not mean in any way that Microsoft doe not have monopoly power. On Monday afternoon, Lacovara made an issue of the success Apple Computer Co. is having selling it new iMac computer. He entered into evidence an Apple news release issued last month showing, among other thing, that 12.5 percent of the people buying Apple's new iMac computer had previously owned a Windows machine. Apple computer use a different operating system, Mac-OS. The outcome of the Microsoft antitrust case may be a long way off, but one thing is already clear: This is the first major e-mail trial. The government's prosecution and Microsoft Corp.'s defense, to a striking degree, are legal campaign waged with electronic message. The human testimony often pale next to the e-mail evidence. On the stand or in videotaped testimony, the people being questioned shrug, mumble and forget. The e-mail is alive with idea and competitive zeal, punctuated with profanity and exclamation point. The second week of the trial ended with the prosecutor being frustrated because a lengthy cross-examination by Microsoft's lead lawyer left no time for the government to show several hour of a videotaped deposition of Bill Gates, the Microsoft chairman. With a new witness, an executive of Apple Computer Inc., taking the stand Monday, it is uncertain when the Gates tape will be played. The Justice Department and the 20 state suing Microsoft believe that the tape will strengthen their case because it show Gates saying he wa not involved in plan to take what the government alleges were illegal step to stifle competition in the Internet software market. The Gates videotape, said David Boies, the Justice Department's trial lawyer, offer an opportunity to judge Gates' credibility. But the Gates credibility gap, if there is one, becomes an issue not because of the videotape but because his taped remark can be compared and contrasted with the e-mail he wrote and received. The e-mail record, the government insists, show Gates waist-deep in plotting the anti-competitive deal and bullying tactic that he denies or professes to have never heard of in his taped deposition. If his machination are central to the government's case, why not summon Gates to the trial? The government doe not need to put Gates on the stand, because we have his e-mail and memoranda, Stephen Houck, a lawyer for the state, told the court. The Microsoft legal team ha for month been preparing it e-mail defense. First, Microsoft argues, anything that look damaging is taken out of context. I urge your honor, John Warden, Microsoft's lead lawyer, told Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson, to view with considerable skepticism the crazy quilt of e-mail fragment that seem to form the core of the government's case. But Microsoft ha also mounted an e-mail counterattack, culled from the million of message it obtained by subpoena from competitor in pretrial discovery. Warden's cross-examination ritual is to present a government witness with an internal e-mail from his company and then pose a declaration a a question. These interrogation have two refrains: Isn't it true your company doe exactly what you are accusing Microsoft of doing, and isn't it true that Microsoft prevailed not because it is a predatory monopolist but because of it superior technology? Microsoft is accused of trying to prod company to stay out of it way. So last week, for example, Warden produced e-mail from Stephen Case, the chairman of America Online, suggesting a partnership with Netscape Communications Corp. in which both company would focus on their respective strength. That division of labor, Case wrote, would be the best way to achieve the goal that Marc Andreessen, Netscape's cofounder, described in an earlier e-mail a beating the Beast From Redmond that want to see u both dead a reference to Microsoft's headquarters in Redmond, Wash. Printouts of e-mail are just another form of written communication. By the 1920s, a typewriter became common, typed memoranda started to be used in court case. From the 1950s through the 1980s, legal expert say, there wa an explosion of documentation fueled by the new technology of electric typewriter, photocopying and fax machine, and then personal computer. And e-mail, they add, ha played an important role in legal inquiry for year, like the Iran-contra case in the 1980s when e-mail found in Oliver North's computer proved crucial. But the Microsoft case is the result of a sweeping government antitrust investigation of a high-technology company where e-mail ha supplanted the telephone a the most common instrument of communication. E-mail ha just revolutionized investigation of this kind, one senior Justice Department official said. While under investigation, Microsoft ha handed over to the government an estimated 30 million document, mostly e-mail. In the trial, the two side have submitted about 3,000 exhibit, mainly e-mail. And in their e-mail, people often communicate more frankly and informally than when writing a letter or a report tap it out, punch a button and it's gone into cyberspace. But e-mail communication is documentary evidence, which in legal case provides a rich, contemporaneous record of what people were thinking and planning at the time. It can be a sharp contrast to formal oral testimony, so often coached by lawyer and crafted by selective memory. The e-mail record certainly make the I-don't-recall line of response harder to sustain, said Robert Litan, a former senior official in the Justice Department's antitrust division who is now at the Brookings Institution. It can also be powerful ammunition for pointing to contradiction in testimony. And that is what the government will do in attacking Gates' credibility with his videotaped deposition, taken over three day in August. The government offered a glimpse of that strategy on the first day of the trial. It showed a few brief clip of a point in the deposition when Gates wa asked about a meeting on June 21, 1995, at which, the government alleges, Microsoft offered to divide the browser market with Netscape and to make an investment in the company, which is it chief rival in that market. In the taped deposition, Gates say he recalled being asked by one of his subordinate whether he thought it made sense to invest in Netscape. He said that he wa asked about it after the June 1995 meeting and replied, I didn't see that a something that made sense. But in an e-mail on May 31, 1995, Gates urged an alliance with Netscape. We could even pay them money a part of the deal, he wrote, buying a piece of them or something. The contradiction between Gates' deposition and his e-mail, though, doe not of itself speak to the issue of whether Microsoft made an illegal offer to Netscape. To be sure, it is what Microsoft did not what it said in e-mail communication that count most. But once the e-mail that look bad get in the record, you end up doing what Microsoft's lawyer are going to spend much of this trial doing trying to explain it away, said Stephen Axinn, a leading antitrust litigator with the firm Axinn, Veltrop &AMP; Harkrider in New York. America Online built itself into the most potent force in cyberspace largely by appealing to family with chatty teen-agers who want to flirt online and adult looking for an easy way to send electronic mail while checking the weather and sport score. Now, the company ha to get serious if it is to win the heart and mind of corporate executive in pin-stripe suit. Nearly lost in the complexity of America Online's deal to buy Netscape Communication Corp. is America Online's announcement that it will enter an entirely new market: working behind the computer screen to help company open and operate online store. Netscape already ha created software that made it a player in providing support for what is already known a electronic commerce. But America Online now say it ha ambition to offer a much wider array of software, consulting and service for online merchant. Most company that sell to consumer realize that they need to get into the e-commerce space, said America Online president Robert Pittman in a news conference Tuesday. We see a major business in offering them an end-to-end solution. The market is big and growing bigger by the day. Forrester Research estimate that $325 million will be spent this year on electronic commerce software and another $5.3 billion on service that range from graphic design to the turn-key operation of entire online store. By 2002, Forrester estimate, the combined market for electronic commerce service and software should top $35 billion. E-commerce service are the silver bullet that will enable company to be able to take advantage of the true business opportunity on the Web, said Traci Gere, an analyst at International Data Corp. The market is growing very rapidly, but it is very fragmented. Analysts say the leader today in e-commerce service is IBM, which ha a full line of offering from sophisticated software product to hand-holding consulting. Other competitor include well-known information technology consulting company such a Andersen Consulting, the spin-off from the Arthur Andersen accounting firm; Electronic Data Systems, which run computer system for big company, and PricewaterhouseCoopers, which offer accounting and consulting separately but under one umbrella. Software company like Microsoft and Netscape sell packaged program, typically with little or no consulting to help customer use them. There are also plenty of new company that have sprouted up to provide electronic commerce service. Some, like Agency.Com and Organic Online, started basically a advertising and design firm. Others, including U S Web and Viant, have emphasized programming and consulting. In fact, those two strain are blurring together, a exemplified by U S Web's pending merger with CKS Group. America Online argues that it advantage in this increasingly crowded bazaar is it ability to combine a broad subscriber base of about 15 million customer with Netscape software, plus hardware from Sun Microsystems, which ha joined in America Online's venture into electronic commerce engineering. This is the first time anyone ha put a true end-to-end solution that start with the silicon and end with the audience, said Barry Schuler, America Online's president for interactive service. We start with Sun's line of server, then the commerce tool to build a store, the support service to process order and then a deal for online real estate that can drive the traffic. Despite the advantage Netscape and Sun bring, analyst say that America Online face a variety of problem in it new quest. Chief among them is whether it can appear to have the consistency, focus and follow-through that corporate customer demand. AOL is not the first company that come to my mind when it come to business-quality software, said Robert Chatham, a senior analyst with Forrester Research. Its decision to keep Netscape a a separate unit and offer electronic commerce service in partnership with Sun will not enhance it credibility, Chatham said. America Online doesn't look like a homogenous vendor, he added. It look like customer will have to tangle with a menage a trois of AOL, Netscape and Sun. Nor have Internet service provider and other telecommunications-oriented company shown much evidence, Ms. Gere of International Data said, that they are capable of offering the highly specific customized service that big corporate client demand. Telecommunications company that try to do thing efficiently for a large number of customer have not been able to offer customized one-to-one relationship, she said. Pittman said that America Online had been driven to the e-commerce business because company that approached it wanting to sell their good needed more help than simply advertising online. We are finding people who are expert in running bricks-and-mortar store are limited by their infrastructure, he said. They have an online store, but their square footage is too small. Even before the Netscape deal, America Online wa moving to provide some electronic commerce software and service. It ha been rewriting the software that let company open online store to be based on universally accepted Internet standard rather than the specific computer language used only on America Online. This new software, which now will be combined with Netscape's online store service, will be available for company to use both on America Online and on the Internet. Similarly, it ha developed a service that let user create a file with their credit card number and shipping address so they can make online purchase without retyping all that information each time. America Online is working to offer it for a fee to store on the broader Internet. There is a wide range of service that are incorporated in electronic commerce. These include high-end strategy consulting to help company decide whether and how to sell online without hurting their traditional sale in store. There are all sort of computer system to be developed, ranging from the online store themselves to connecting those site to a company's existing inventory and accounting system. There are creative service that include graphic design, medium buying, customer list analysis and other marketing and promotional effort. And there are operational service that involve actually maintaining the big server that user connect to when they use the online store that display catalog, take order and process payment. America Online, Schuler said, will emphasize service that relate to marketing rather than back-office function. We will consult on how to merchandise and sell online, he said. We understand the consumer piece of the puzzle. Some competitor worry that America Online's electronic commerce service may simply be a device to sell it software and hardware. The challenge is to prove that client are getting the best possible solution for their business, said Robert Gett, the chief executive of Viant. If they offer AOL and Netscape and Sun, their answer is a bit tainted. Netscape doe have an expanding force of about 700 people who provide consulting and custom programming. But they have been most competitive, Gett said, in competing for nuts-and-bolts project rather than the more lucrative assignment to develop and carry out a full-fledged strategy on the Web. They say, `Who know our software better than Netscape?' Gett said. We help customer decide which platform is best for them. But America Online argues that the combined might of it, Netscape and Sun is just what the business need. We always believed that commerce, that is buying good and service, is the huge revenue stream of the future, Schuler said. We have only seen the tiniest tip of the iceberg. America Online built itself into the most potent force in cyberspace largely by appealing to family with chatty teen-agers who want to flirt online and adult looking for an easy way to send electronic mail while checking the weather and sport score. Now, the company ha to get serious if it is to win the heart and mind of corporate executive in pin-stripe suit.

There are all sort of computer system to be developed, ranging from the online store themselves to connecting those site to a company's existing inventory and accounting system. America Online is on the verge of agreeing to purchase Netscape Communications Corp., the Internet pioneer at the center of the government's antitrust suit against Microsoft Corp., executive involved in the talk said Sunday. The proposed deal is a complex, three-way transaction involving AOL, Netscape and Sun Microsystems Inc. AOL, the leading on-line service with more than 14 million subscriber, would acquire Netscape's popular site on the World Wide Web and it software business. But a part of the deal, AOL would also enter into a joint marketing and development partnership with Sun Microsystems to strengthen Netscape's other business of selling to large corporation the heavy-duty software needed to serve up Web page and other Internet technology to many thousand of user at the same time. The purchase, an exchange of AOL share for Netscape stock, is valued at roughly $4 billion. A completed deal could be announced a soon a Monday morning. But executive involved in the talk cautioned Sunday night that some detail remained to be negotiated. The Netscape deal, if consummated, would realign three business at the forefront of the modern economy on-line service, Internet software and electronic commerce. It would strengthen two of Microsoft's leading rival, AOL and Sun Microsystems. At the same time, however, it would subsume Netscape, an Internet software maker once regarded a the most serious challenger to Microsoft's dominance of the personal computer software market. Netscape, founded in 1994, ha struggled over the last 18 month under an assault from Microsoft. Its Navigator wa the runaway leader in the market for the browser software used to navigate the World Wide Web. But Microsoft, responding to the Internet revolution, entered the market aggressively, quickly matching the quality of Netscape's technology and then bundling the Microsoft browser, Internet Explorer, into it industry-standard Windows operating system and giving it away free. Earlier this year, Netscape announced layoff and started distributing Navigator for free a well, a Microsoft steadily gained in the browser market. Since then, Netscape ha focused mainly on two business advertising and transaction fee from it Netcenter Web site and selling industrial-strength software to corporation that are building their own Internet site on which to conduct electronic commerce. AOL belief it ha the expertise to increase revenue from Netscape's Web site and, helped by Sun's programmer and vast corporate sale force, to accelerate Netscape's software sale a well, executive involved in the negotiation said. Sun's version of Unix, Solaris, is among the most popular operating system for the large, powerful computer that run Netscape's server software. This deal would insure that the fundamental element of Netscape survive within bigger company that can drive it technology forward, said David B. Yoffie, a professor at the Harvard business school and co-author with Michael A. Cusumano of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology of a recent book, Competing on Internet Time: Lessons from Netscape and Its Battle with Microsoft. The impact of the deal, if any, on the government's antitrust suit against Microsoft is uncertain. It doe appear to support a key theme of Microsoft's defense namely, that it operates in a fast-moving industry where corporate alliance shift all the time. Thus, Microsoft argues, antitrust policy should tread gently. But the deal, government official insist, should have no direct effect on the current case. No matter how much the alliance shift, it doesn't affect the central fact of Microsoft's monopoly and how it ha used and abused it market power to protect it monopoly, said David Boies, the Justice Department's lead trial lawyer in the Microsoft case. Executives representing Netscape, AOL and Sun Microsystems are government witness at the Microsoft trial. And the serious merger talk between Netscape Chief Executive Officer James Barksdale and AOL Chairman Steve Case began about a month ago, or just after the start of the Microsoft trial, according to people close to the talk. Industry analyst suggest that the company may have been emboldened to take stronger anti-Microsoft step based partly on the perception that the antitrust case would weaken Microsoft. And representative of Kleiner Perkins Caufield &AMP; Byers, a Silicon Valley venture capital firm regarded a a power broker among Microsoft's rival, sit on the board of Netscape, Sun and AOL. Stock price vaulted to record level Monday, furthering a recovery that a recently a two month ago seemed nearly unthinkable. I thought we were in the most serious correction since 1990, but I never thought or wrote that the bull market wa over, said Byron Wien, US. equity strategist at Morgan Stanley Dean Witter &AMP; Co. Now it seems all of that is behind u. The Dow Jones industrial average rose 214.72 point, or 2.34 percent, to 9,37427. The record is the first since July 17, when the Dow closed at 9,33797. Since Aug. 31, when the Dow stood at 7,539.07 after a steep slide, the blue-chip gauge ha risen more than 24 percent. For the year, the Dow is up 18.54 percent and ha a chance of rising more than 20 percent for a fourth consecutive year, something never accomplished before. Broader average also climbed. The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock index set a record, rising 24.66 point, or 2.12 percent, to 1,18821. The Nasdaq composite index did not reach a new high but posted the biggest percentage gain Monday, rising 49.21 point, or 2.55 percent, to 1,97742. And the Russell 2000 index of smaller-company issue gained 3.86 point, or nearly 1 percent, to 39815. Monday's action wa energized by a daily record for the number of merger and acquisition valued at $1 billion or more. The merger announcement not only prompted investor to change estimate of how much company were worth but also indicated coming decline in the outstanding share of stock. This may be a supply-demand story, where demand for stock is rising and the supply of stock is reduced a one company after another merges, said Hugh Johnson, chief investment officer at First Albany Corp. The flow of money into mutual fund is fairly strong, and there is pressure on manager to put that money to work. Two deal seemed to be catalyst for broad swath of stock. News that Bankers Trust may be close to accepting an $8.9 billion offer from Deutsche Bank of Germany heightened interest in financial-services and bank stock. And word that America Online may acquire Netscape Communications for $4 billion in stock powered Internet and other technology stock to even loftier valuation. Among financial company, JP. Morgan gained 6 1/16, to 115 11/16. American Express wa up 4 3/8, to 108 15/16. Merrill Lynch jumped 4 3/8, to 76. And Donaldson, Lufkin &AMP; Jenrette rose 3 9/16, to 42}. Netscape wa the most active stock Monday, gaining 2}, to 41 15/16. America Online gained 4 3/8, to 89\. Other Internet stock also surged, and analyst said the group, which ha seen meteoric gain in recent week, wa ripe for a steep correction. Yahoo and Amazon.com both became $200 stock on Monday. Yahoo rose 30 7/16, to 221 7/16. And Amazon.com gained 37 3/8, to 218. The performance of the Internet stock is an unsettling sign, Wien said. Still, more-established technology share also had a very good day. IBM rose 7, to 166 5/8. Microsoft jumped 5 9/16, to 119 3/16. And Intel closed at 113 9/16, up 1{. After Monday's big price move, Wien said that according to his calculation, stock were about 10 percent overvalued. By contrast, in the middle of July the market wa 20 percent overvalued, he said. Nonetheless, the market's recovery, which ha been buttressed by three cut in interest rate by the Federal Reserve Board, ha left many longtime Wall Street hand grasping for historical parallel. At this point we are in new ground, said Laszlo Birinyi, who head his own market research firm. At the beginning of the year, I said my target for the Dow wa 10,000 by the end of 1998. If anyone had asked when the market went through what now look like a corrective blip, I would have said my new target would have been about 9,000. I am surprised the 10,000 figure came back on the table for this year. The New York Times said in an editorial for Wednesday, Nov. 25: America Online's effort to acquire Netscape and set up a partnership with Sun Microsystems is a reminder of how rapidly the corporate landscape can change in fast-moving technical field. But it doe not lessen the need for the Justice Department to vigorously pursue it antitrust suit against Microsoft, the dominant player in software. The department ha presented solid evidence that Microsoft ha used it monopoly in operating system to muscle rival and partner so a to head off competition in other software realm. The Internet ha risen so quickly a an information medium that only four year ago, in his book The Road Ahead, Bill Gates scarcely mention it. In addition, only a couple of year ago America Online, the world's biggest online service, wa having so much trouble getting rid of the bug in the system it wa widely derided a America On Hold. Now Microsoft ha moved so aggressively into the Internet that the Justice Department is accusing it of predatory behavior, and America Online ha rocketed forward to make deal with other Internet player. In it antitrust suit against Microsoft, the federal government charge that the company ha illegally bundled it own browser with it Windows operating system to smother Netscape's chance of marketing it browser. Now in the corridor outside the antitrust trial Microsoft's lawyer maintain that Netscape ha found a new partner in America Online and ha no need of protection from the government. But it could be a easily argued that Microsoft ha bludgeoned Netscape into dissolution, forcing a distress sale to America Online. Nor is it clear that customer of America Online will choose Netscape's browser a a vehicle for buying and selling on the Internet. Even in it newly musclebound form, America Online remains dependent on Microsoft's good will for favorable placement of an AOL icon on the main desktop screen. It may be that, year hence, America Online, Netscape and Sun will put together an alternative mean to the Internet through telephone line, cable or the like. But until that day, fairness requires Justice Department action to insure that Microsoft not use it current position to thwart consumer choice. Only when company know they can get their product to the consumer will they have the incentive to innovate and turn the Internet into the revolutionary medium it promise to be. ","As the government continued to press its anti-trust suit against Microsoft, AOL has begun negotiations to purchase Netscape.Netscape is at the heart of the antitrust suit.Netscape alleges that Microsoft marketing practices, packaging its Internet Explorer in its operating system denied market opportunities to Netscape.The AOL deal, a three-way negotiation between AOL, Sun Microsystems and Netscape, would combined three Microsoft rivals.AOL is counting on the Netscape purchase to allow it to expand its internet Market by helping business operate on the internet in an effort to join Media and technology.","In a bid to become a leader in the lucrative cyberspace economy, AOL will buy Netscape and set up a partnership with Sun.The venture will let AOL offer corporations end-to-end services, including servers, software, and accessibility to consumers.Eventually, AOL hopes to capitalize on the production of cheap devices offering Internet access to more homes.News of the deal helped push the Dow Jones to a new high.Meanwhile, Microsoft, accused by the Justice Department of using its operating system dominance to squelch competition in the browser market, claims the deal shows the software industry is healthy and that Netscape needs no government protection.","As the U.S. government pressed its antitrust case against Microsoft Corp. in November 1998, America Online (AOL) proposed an alliance with Netscape Communications and Sun Microsystems.The three-pronged deal promised to provide on-line services, Internet software and electronic commerce.AOL was to buy Netscape and forge a partnership with Sun, benefiting all three and giving technological independence from Microsoft.Microsoft lawyers argued unconvincingly that AOL's purchase of Netscape would undermine the government's antitrust case, based in large part on Netscape's complaint.It remained to be seen whether AOL could achieve a vast virtual mall.","America Online became the leading force in cyberspace for individuals to exchange e-mail and check the latest news.AOL saw a bright day ahead as a company that could provide online services, Internet software, and electronic commerce.To position itself better in this growing market, AOL sought to buy Netscape and work an alliance with Sun Microsystems.Netscape has faltered because of the ubiquity of the Microsoft Windows operating system requiring its browser.Microsoft argued that a vibrant technology market and rising stock prices undercut antitrust charges against it.At the trial the government presented thousands of e-mails supporting its case."
27,"President Leonid Kuchma called Friday for correction to Ukraine's program of market reform, but pledged that reform would continue. Kuchma did not elaborate in his comment to a group of Ukrainian economist, saying only that the change were necessary because of the country's economic problem. Kuchma urged the economist to come up with recommendation before a national meeting of economist in November, the Interfax news agency reported. Ukraine ha suffered economic problem since the 1991 collapse of the Soviet Union and it ha been especially hard hit by the financial crisis in neighboring Russia, it main trading partner. The Russian crisis ha hurt bilateral trade, caused the Ukrainian currency to fall and led to a withdrawal of investor from Ukraine. In recent month, Kuchma ha implemented some economic reform by decree, prompting the International Monetary Fund to release the first installment of a long-awaited dlrs 2.2 billion loan. Many reform, however, remain stalled. National Bank chairman Viktor Yushchenko wa in Washington this week for consultation with IMF official. Yushchenko ha warned that the bank would not spend it dwindling reserve to support the hryvna currency, but ha avoided comment on the currency in recent day. Kuchma met Friday with Yushchenko, Prime Minister Valery Pustovoitenko and other senior official to discus way to stabilize the hryvna. The government's press service said they focused on possible way to keep the hryvna under 3.5 to the US. dollar through the end of the year. The hryvna ha been trading at 3.4 to the dollar in recent day but trading ha been limited. There are wide expectation in Ukraine that the hryvna will fall even further, and Ukrainians have been stocking up on food, clothing and household good to save their fast-devaluing money. When the world's finance minister and central banker gathered last year in Hong Kong, they nervously congratulated each other for containing at least for the moment a nasty financial brush fire in Asia. In a year's time, many predicted in hallway chatter, the trouble in Thailand and Indonesia would look like a replay of Mexico in 1995 a rough bump in the road for a world enjoying remarkable prosperity. Talk about bad market call. Twelve month later, a the same financial mandarin clog Washington with their limousine and glide through endless reception at the annual meeting of the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank, just about everything that could have gone wrong in the world economy has: the worst downturn in Japan since World War II, economic meltdown in Russia, a depression in Indonesia that is plunging 100 million people below the poverty line, and deep fear over what happens next in Latin America. What make this year's IMF meeting most remarkable, though, is that the harshest criticism are directed at the monetary fund itself, and, by extension, at the US. Treasury, which is viewed a the power behind the IMF. This year, in place of confident prediction, there are mutual recrimination. Arguments are breaking out over whether the true culprit were crony capitalist and weakened leader like Russian President Boris Yeltsin, or huge investor who poured money into the world's emerging market with reckless abandon in the mid-1990s and panicked in the past twelve month. Whatever the reason, one reality prevails: Hundreds of billion of dollar have fled from economy on four continent seeking the safest haven possible, often in the United States and the money is not returning anytime soon. And the subtext of every seminar on capital flow and every conclave of nervous minister will be some painfully blunt questions: Can this be stopped? Or is the world headed for a global recession? Fifty-three year ago the IMF wa created after the Bretton Woods conference which sought to stabilize the world economy and secure the peace after World War II. Now it is under attack from all side, charged not only with worsening a bad situation by misjudging the economics, but with being politically tone-deaf in some of the most volatile capital in the world, from Jakarta, Indonesia, to Moscow. For the first time, there are disturbing question about whether the institution itself is still capable, financially or politically, of containing the kind of economic contagion that caught the world unaware. Once, the IMF's critic were largely found in Africa and South Asia, were the fund wa often viewed a arrogant; today they include Wall Street's biggest player and top official in the most powerful economy of Asia and Europe. Only a few including former Secretary of State George Schultz and member of Congress who are increasingly suspicious of all international institution are talking about scrapping the IMF altogether. But almost everyone is talking about creating a new financial architecture that can do what the old one clearly cannot: smother financial wildfire before they leap around the globe. President Clinton, British Prime Minister Tony Blair and other leader, after month of silence, have edged into the debate, in some case wresting the issue for the first time from their finance minister and central bank. Their fear, their adviser say, is that 15 month of financial turmoil are now threatening political stability. Such concern have turned this year's meeting into a tumbled mass of worry and a groping for short and long-term solution. The Japanese, the French, the Southeast Asians are all arriving in Washington with different diagnosis of what went wrong, and different solution about how to set it right. The United States ha it own set of plan, a mix of suggestion to force more disclosure of financial data in country around the world and to impose more American-style financial standard and regulation. Meanwhile, an ideological argument is breaking out over whether the world should slow down a long march toward more free and open market a strategy pressed by the Clinton administration for the past six year. Others argue that it is unwise to start rebuilding the hospital while the patient are still on the operating table. Last year the standard answer that all of u were given came down to this: `We have the IMF and the World Bank, and they know best,' Indonesian Foreign Minister Ali Alatas said over breakfast in Washington the other day, reflecting on how the crisis turned 30 year of astounding growth in his country into an overnight depression. Then they said everything that went wrong wa our fault, he said. But now, now I think people know that much of the problem came from the outside, and we need something better. And the IMF itself is beginning to fight back, an awkward role for an institution dominated by PhD. economist who are unaccustomed to being openly challenged. Every place you turn you read the same story, that we came in, that we made thing worse, said Stanley Fischer, the deputy managing director of the fund, who wa born in Northern Rhodesia now Zambia and became chairman of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology's economics department before taking a job that ha now put him in the center of the financial storm. We frequently get the blame, some of it well-deserved, he said. But it is politically convenient for government around the world to cry, `The IMF made u do it,' and pin their mistake on u. That's fine. We'd rather be loved, but more than that we'd like to be effective. MISCALCULATIONS, POLITICS AND SAFETY NETS On a steaming January day, Michel Camdessus, the IMF's top official, slipped into Jakarta to the private residence of President Suharto and sat down for a four-hour meeting to tick off, line by line, the huge reform Indonesia would have to implement in return for ten of billion of dollar in emergency aid. Two previous deal had collapsed when Suharto ignored the fund's condition, so Camdessus insisted that he strike a deal directly with Suharto, then Asia's longest-serving leader. It wa a meeting of men who knew different world of power politics: Suharto rose a a general in central Java, and Camdessus had detonated mine in Algeria for the French army before entering the French Treasury on his way to becoming head of France's central bank. It wa all there, a senior IMF official recalled. He wa told he had to dismantle the national airplane project, the clove monopoly, all the distribution monopoly. At one point, Camdessus looked at the impassive Suharto and said, You see what this mean for your family, a reference to their vast investment in the country's key industry. He said, `I called in my child, and they all understand.' But within month, that exchange in Jakarta came to symbolize the IMF's twin troubles: Its inability to understand and reckon with the national politics of country in need of radical reform, and it focus on economic stabilization rather than the social cost of it action. Suharto had no intention of fulfilling the agreement. It wa, one of his former Cabinet member said, a delaying move that wa obvious to everyone except Camdessus. Perhaps one reason why the IMF sometimes appears tone-deaf is that it senior staff is almost entirely composed of PhD. economist. There are few official with deep experience in international politics, much le the complexity of Javanese culture that were at work in Indonesia. Historically, expert in politics and security have gravitated to the United Nations, development expert to the World Bank, and economist to the IMF creating dangerous gap in a crisis like this one. As a result, the fund had only a rudimentary understanding of what would happen if it demand were met and all Indonesia's state monopoly were quickly dissolved. While that system lined the pocket of the Suhartos and their friend, it also distributed food, gasoline and other staple to a country that stretch for 3,000 mile over thousand of island. To help balance the budget, the fund demanded a quick end to expensive subsidy that keep the price of food and gasoline artificially low. But that, combined with the huge currency devaluation that sparked the crisis, resulted in high price and shortage that fueled riot that continue to this day, a million of Indonesians lose their job. The IMF unintentionally, it official insist also sped Suharto's resignation, insisting on the elimination of crony capitalism, code word for removing the Suharto family from the center of the economy. Ultimately, that may prove to be Indonesia's salvation, if the new government can contain the rioting against the ethnic Chinese minority whose money is desperately needed to save the country's fast-shrinking economy. It is worth noting, Fischer said this week, that our program in Asia in Indonesia, Korea and Thailand only took hold after there wa a change in government. Nonetheless, the Indonesia experience ha revived the argument that the IMF is so focused on stabilizing bank and currency, on preventing capital flight and freeing up market, that it is blind to the social cost of it action. Among the toughest critic ha been it sister institution, the World Bank, whose main charge is alleviating poverty. You've seen the tension almost every day, one senior World Bank official said recently. The bank ha gone to extraordinary length in recent month to differentiate it role from that of the fund, and to announce a tripling of aid to the poorest in the country hit by the economic chaos. Even UN. Secretary General Kofi Annan ha joined the argument, warning in a speech at Harvard recently that if globalization is to succeed, it must succeed for poor and rich alike. It must deliver right no le than rich. It must be harnessed to the cause not of capital alone, but of development and prosperity for the poorest of the world. IMF official say they are changing strategy when they see they are exacting too great a social cost. It's a very difficult formula to get exactly right, Fischer said in August, a Russia wa teetering and the IMF wa sending in $4.8 billion in aid that wa rapidly wasted. You need enough discipline to send the right message to the market and keep investor from fleeing. But you need enough leeway to keep people from suffering more than they otherwise would. In recent month, he noted, the IMF ha allowed more spending to sustain subsidy for basic good for longer period in Indonesia, Korea and elsewhere. There is a new flexibility at the IMF a senior Indonesian official concluded recently. It is a lot better. A US. PAWN, OR A RUNAWAY AGENCY? The Clinton administration admits that the IMF ha many failing, many of them on display this year. But it insists that the world ha gone through global financial crisis without an IMF once before in this century and the result wa the 1930s. I have no doubt the situation over the past year would have been much worse with greater devaluation, more default, more contagion, and greater trade dislocation without the program agreed with the IMF and the finance it ha provided, Deputy Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers told Congress last week. Many Republicans and some Democrats are unconvinced. Even though the Senate ha overwhelmingly approved an $18 billion contribution to the fund to help it fight new crisis, the House defeated that measure two week ago. The fund's last hope of getting the money, which will free up nearly $100 billion in contribution from other nation waiting for the United States to act, will come when the House and Senate try to resolve their budget difference in a conference committee in the next 10 day. A rejection, Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin insists, would send a message around the world that the United States is turning it back on the one institution charged with restoring economic stability. Everywhere else in the world, though, politician and businessmen insist that one of the biggest problem with the IMF is that, contrary to the view of Congress, it act a the US. Treasury's lap dog. Ask in Jakarta or Moscow, and the response is the same: The IMF never venture far without looking back for the approving nod of it master. When the United States weighs in, however, is when the IMF is called on to rescue a country in deep trouble. Only then doe the IMF and the US. Treasury have the leverage to extract commitment in return for billion in aid. In theory, the US. influence is limited: It ha an 18.5 percent vote in the fund. Germany, Japan, France and Britain have about 5 percent each. But in practice the United States usually get it way, exercising it influence behind the scene, often in interaction between Fischer and Summers. The two met when Fischer wa on the MIT faculty and Summers wa a graduate student taking one of his class, later becoming a colleague at MIT. Each served a chief economist of the World Bank. It wa Summers who wa instrumental in placing Fischer in the fund's no. 2 job, and these day they talk constantly. It's usually a warm relationship, Fischer said this summer. Remember, this is a job where you cannot turn to outsider for advice you can't call the chief economist at a Wall Street firm, or even many of your academic friend, because so many of the issue are confidential. The Treasury's relation with Camdessus are often more strained a he play the role of world diplomat, traveling the globe and trying to coax along political leader. The tension were obvious from the start of the Asia crisis. The fund made little secret of it displeasure that the United States wa not offering direct aid to Thailand, a major US. ally, a a sign of support and confidence. Mindful of the backlash in Congress when Mexico wa bailed out with US. money, that wa the last thing the Treasury planned to do. Summers, in turn, thought the fund wa not forcing the Thais to implement it reform commitment rigorously enough or disclose their true financial picture. Within the US. government there wa other dissension: The State and Defense Departments felt the United States should do more for Thailand, but backed off when the Treasury asked if they would like to pony up some aid out of their own budget. There were other conflict. When Japan used the last IMF meeting to propose setting up a $100 billion Asia Fund one that would exclude the United States and would probably offer aid under much more relaxed condition than the IMF doe. Rubin called up Camdessus at breakfast one morning and told him that the Japanese proposal would undercut the IMF's authority. We've just had a dispute with Michel, Rubin reported to his aide a he returned to his orange juice and croissant. One of them shot back: And it's only 8 am. Camdessus backed down at Rubin's insistence and walked away from money that Asia could have used. Japan say it will be back with a similar proposal this weekend, this time for a $30 billion fund. Camdessus ha also rankled US. official with statement that amounted to cheerleading to reassure the market sometimes in the face of the fact. In June, with Russia on it way to collapse, Camdessus declared that contrary to what market and commentator are imagining about the slow collapse of Russia's economy, this is not a crisis. This is not a major development. The bailouts of Russia and South Korea were prime example of how Washington muscle into the IMF's turf a soon a major US. strategic interest are involved. Last Christmas, a South Korea slipped within day of running out of hard currency to pay it debt in December, it sent a secret envoy, Kim Kihwan, to work out a rescue package. I didn't bother going to the IMF, Kim recalled recently. I called Summers' office at the Treasury from my home in Seoul, flew to Washington and went directly there. I knew that wa how this would get done. Within day the Treasury dispatched David Lipton, it most experienced veteran of emergency bailouts, who is leaving his post a undersecretary for international affair this month, to shadow the IMF staff's negotiation with the government in Seoul. Fischer wa displeased. To make a negotiation effective, it ha to be clear who ha the authority to do the negotiating, he said. WHO LOST RUSSIA? The pattern wa repeated this summer, when the United States raced to put together a $17 billion package for Russia. The IMF's staff in Moscow declared that Russia needed no money at all it just needed to enact policy that would restore confidence in investor. The Americans and Germans came to a different conclusion. Soon after, US. official gathered in the White House situation room to consider what might happen to Russia if the ruble wa devalued and market reform collapsed and to push the IMF to come up with emergency money. So the fund began assembling a last-ditch program to prop up a country that had resisted it reform plan for seven year. Camdessus, though, wa still hesitant, questioning whether the IMF should risk it scarce resource in Russia. We had to pull Michel along, a senior Treasury official recalled. As it turned out, Camdessus' instinct were right while the approach championed by Rubin and Summers proved disastrously wrong. The first installment of that payment $4.8 billion wa wasted, propping up the currency long enough, in the word of one IMF official, to let the oligarch get their money out of the country. Then Yeltsin reversed his commitment, let the ruble devalue anyway, began printing money with abandon and fired virtually every reformer in his government resulting in a collapse of the IMF agreement and the indefinite suspension of it aid program. Now, inside the IMF and on Capitol Hill, there are recrimination over who lost Russia. Publicly, Fischer argues that there are no apology owed for what we attempted in Russia. But some IMF official complain privately that they let Rubin and Summers run roughshod over them, striking a deal that fell apart within week a the Russian parliament rebelled and Yeltsin backed away from his commitment. Summers responds that the United States took a calculated risk because it wa vastly better that Russia succeed than not succeed. The Russian collapse touched off new round of economic contagion, with investor fleeing Latin America, and triggering huge loss in hedge fund like Long Term Capital, the Greenwich, Conn., investment firm that needed to be rescued by Wall Street powerhouse whose money it had invested. Russia wa a turning point, said Robert Hormats, the vice chairman of Goldman, Sachs &AMP; Co. It made the world realize that some country can fail, even if the IMF and the Treasury intercede. And that changed the perception of risk. Now, a the country meet to face a future that the IMF ha warned could be very bleak, they need to reverse those perception, or watch country slowly starve for lack of capital. The emerging market are calling for control on short term investment. The French want a stronger IMF. The Americans say the answer is more disclosure, so that investor are better warned, and tougher regulation. These are usually nice, quiet meetings; everyone very polite, a top US. official said earlier this week. Not this year. Ukraine's parliament on Friday refused to approve President Leonid Kuchma's decree establishing a state fund to compensate people for saving lost in bank. Deputies voted 240-47 to prepare a revised version of the decree and debate it later in the month. They must consider the decree by Oct. 10, or else it automatically take effect under the constitution. Leftist faction, which voted against the proposed legislation, said it would not fully guarantee the return of saving lost during the financial instability that ha recently hit Ukraine. The fund Kuchma proposed to establish would have accumulated money in a special National Bank account and repay people in case the bank they kept their saving in went bankrupt or became insolvent. Although the decree provided for compensation of deposit amounting only to 500 hryvna (dlrs 147 at the current exchange rate), it author said it would cover more than 90 percent of Ukrainians who keep their money in bank. The measure wa meant to prevent mass withdrawal of deposit that most Ukrainian bank have already experienced a people, scared by the fall of the national currency and the turmoil in neighboring Russia, started to stock up on food, clothing and household good. Government official say that Ukrainians have recently withdrawn at least 10 percent of the 3 billion hryvna (dlrs 882 million) they deposited in bank. Russia's new prime minister picked an unusual way to reassure the nation Thursday. After two week of deliberation he announced that he still had no plan to rescue the country from it economic crisis. I want to repeat once more there is no program, Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov said. It ha yet to be worked out. In most nation such a statement might provoke alarm. But Primakov wa seeking to calm an anxious public that wa worried that the Kremlin's cure could be worse than the disease. It is not a if Russians do not have something to be concerned about. Thursday Primakov convened a meeting of top aide to try to hammer out a strategy for overcoming the economic woe. A main item on the agenda wa the plan drafted by Yuri Maslyukov, a Communist and the government's senior policy maker on economic issue. It did not take long for Maslyukov's plan to hit the street. A newspaper, Kommersant Daily, published it in full Thursday morning. Not surprisingly Maslyukov's plan call for a greater state role in the economy, including control on hard currency. A new State Bank for Reconstruction and Development would be established using the nationalized asset of failed commercial bank. Wages and pension would be paid in two month, and the minimum wage would be indexed to inflation. There would be huge tax cut, a combination that suggested that the government wa committed to printing additional money. The exchange rate of the ruble would be set by the central bank, based on change in inflation and the balance of payment. Maslyukov's plan also implies that Russians would be able to buy dollar at exchange through the country. It stipulates that hard currency could enter the country only with special authorization. Exporters would be required to sell most of their hard currency reserve. That is an allusion to currency control that sent shock wave through the Russian public. Russians have come to treat the dollar a a second currency, and many people have squirreled away dollar a a hedge against inflation. It is an obvious stupidity, Otto Latsis, a commentator with the newspaper Noviye Izvestiya, said. People won't give their dollar away. They will go to the black market if they need to. Yegor Gaidar, the former prime minister who favor free market, said the plan wa a war against the dollar and predicted that it would lead to a shortage of import. As the criticism grew, Primakov rushed to distance himself from the talk of currency control. The rumor of the state's becoming a monopolist on the inflow of hard currency into the country is nonsense, he said, asserting that the document published by Kommersant Daily wa just one of six possible plan. Primakov may be opposed to wildly unpopular currency control. He may be worried that the plan would would set off the panic buying of dollar, further depressing the ruble. Or he may simply be trying to keep his distance from Maslyukov's plan while Russia try to wrangle it next disbursement, $4.3 billion, from the International Monetary Fund. The particular could be modified, but many people following the maneuvering say they believe that it represents the basic thrust of the government's thinking. Primakov ha called for greater state regulation and an expansion of the money supply, two theme of Maslyukov's plan. The plan also ha many similarity with the plan presented to the government by Gorbachev-era adviser. We think it is close to being a final document, said the United Financial Group, a Russian investment business. It is unclear how long Primakov can carry on without spelling out a detailed strategy. The ousted tax chief, Boris Fyodorov, ha argued that the IMF should not provide further aid until Primakov ha taken tough measure to build a free market. Primakov ha, however, sought to turn that logic on it head, arguing that his government's economic strategy will depend on the fund's willingness to provide aid. His aim appears to be to pressure the fund by implying that it will be the fund's fault if Russia is forced to default on it loan or take draconian measure at home. Or a Primakov put it Thursday, without the fund's money, Russia will have to impose unpopular measure. Wall Street extended a global stock selloff Thursday with the Dow industrials tumbling more than 200 point for a second straight day. The Dow Jones industrial average, which plunged 237.90 point on Wednesday, fell an additional 210.09, or by 2.7 percent, to close at 7,63253. Broader market indicator also sank sharply in heavy trading. Bank and technology stock were particularly hard hit. The selling spree, amid worry about shrinking corporate profit and fear of new financial crisis, left the Dow 18.3 percent, or more than 1,700 point, below the all-time high of 9,337.97 reached on July 17. It wa getting closer to the low of 7,400 that wa reached during trading Sept. 1, before Wall Street's best-known indicator began a comeback bid that brought it above 8,100 a recently a Monday. The Dow's 12.4 percent slide in the third quarter, which ended Wednesday, wa it worst quarterly performance in eight year. It now is 3.5 percent below where it began this year. Stock price earlier plunged in Asia, with Tokyo share falling 1.6 percent to a new 12-year low, and share were falling sharply in Europe, where Germany's central bank left interest rate unchanged. Blue chip in London sank 3.1 percent to close at new low for the year, while the key index in Frankfurt, Germany, closed down 5.5 percent and the main indicator in Paris wa off 5 percent. The selloff in stock ha sent a flood of money into US. Treasury security, a traditional haven in time of uncertainty. Yields on 30-year Treasury bond fell further below 5 percent Thursday, reaching level unseen for long-term government bond since 1967. Traders were alarmed to see price on the New York Stock Exchange nosedive 2.9 percent on Wednesday, even though the Federal Reserve had lowered a key interest rate one-quarter percentage point on Tuesday. Some trader were disappointed that the cut wa not deeper amid fear a go-slow approach would not do enough to counter the economic crisis that have swept through Asia and Russia and are threatening Latin America. The smaller-than-expected lowering of interest rate by the US. Federal Reserve ha a chain reaction, said Lee Won-ho, an analyst at Samsung Securities Co. in Seoul, South Korea, where the main stock index fell by 1.5 percent. It is affecting Wall Street, the Japanese market, ours and others. The managing director of the International Monetary Fund, Michel Camdessus, on Thursday said the Fed made the right decision in cutting rate and that global power now must push for stronger growth to offset steep recession in Asia and Russia. Asked why stock market, particularly in the United States, have reacted so negatively to the Fed rate cut, Camdessus said he believed confidence will soon be restored, especially if financial leader show resolve in their discussion over the next week. There also are worry about where the next financial market crisis may erupt after last week's dlrs 3.6 billion private bailout of Long-Term Capital Management LP of Greenwich, Connecticut. In addition, investor worldwide worry that the downturn on Wall Street could signal a possible slowdown in economic growth a bad omen for the many foreign company dependent on export to the huge US. market. There's a psychological impact overall, but there's also a direct impact on company like Sony and TDK which derive a high percentage of their earnings from overseas market, said Pelham Smithers, a stock strategist in Tokyo at ING Baring Securities (Japan) Ltd. A new survey in Japan said confidence among small- and medium-sized business about the economy plunged to it worst level since the Bank of Japan began the quarterly sampling in 1967. The United States is disappointed by the economic confusion within the new Russian government of Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov, said Secretary of State Madeleine Albright on Friday, and she warned Russia about the danger of an anti-Western policy. In her first comprehensive review of U.S.-Russian relation since Primakov wa confirmed a prime minister last month, Albright said Washington wa deeply concerned about Russia's direction and did not think the crisis there would soon abate. We have heard a lot of talk in recent day about printing new money, indexing wage, imposing price and capital control and restoring state management of part of the economy, she told the U.S.-Russia Business Council in Chicago. We can only wonder if some member of Primakov's team understand the basic arithmetic of the global economy. While praising Primakov, once her counterpart when he wa foreign minister, a a pragmatist able to cooperate on key issue with Washington, she had harsh word of warning for him. Our initial reaction to some of the direction he's going in ha not been particularly positive, she said, adding, The question now is whether that cooperation can continue. The United States must keep up it aid to Russia but is adjusting it to promote the building of democracy and student exchange a well a arm control, Albright said. Washington doe not favor more direct aid. More big bailouts are not by themselves going to restore investor confidence in Russia, she said. In the long run, the gap between Russia's need and it resource must be met not by foreign bailouts but by foreign investment. Albright sharply criticized a self-defeating the many voice in Russia who want to shift the emphasis in Russia's interaction with America and our ally from one of partnership to one of assertiveness, opposition and defiance for it own stake. Russia could not stand alone in the world, she said, and the United States' ability to help Russians help themselves will go from being merely very, very difficult to being absolutely impossible. At the same time, she said, Washington would not assume the worst, for there are still plenty of people in Russia who will fight against turning back the clock. And she urged the world and American critic to be patient with the working of the democratic process in Russia and not start each day by taking a census of reformer in the Kremlin, a census that American official themselves promoted before President Boris Yeltsin dismissed the previous government. While Moscow may continue to oppose any NATO use of force against Serbian force in the southern province of Kosovo, Albright said, NATO must be prepared to act regardless. If the Communist Party ha it way and it ha been planning for month million of Russians will take to the street on Wednesday for some of the biggest demonstration in year. But now that Communists or politician with the Communist stamp of approval are running the country and it economy the question is what the marcher will be demonstrating against. President Boris Yeltsin and his economic adviser were easy target two month ago. But Yeltsin seems but a shadow of himself today, and his adviser are gone. The Communists, who have undergone a sort of resurgence by playing on the discontent, are working hard to cast themselves a outsider in the government that they help run and to keep the focus of the protest on Wednesday on Yeltsin and his policy. Even that strategy may backfire, however, because discontent over Yeltsin doe not necessarily translate into support for his predecessor. An adviser to the Communist Party leader, Gennadi Zyuganov, made headline not long ago when he called the new government bourgeois. The characterization wa striking, because the new prime minister, Yevgeny Primakov, wa one of Zyuganov's top choice for the post. The deputy prime minister in charge of the economy, Yuri Maslyukov, is a Communist Party figure who once headed Gosplan, the infamous central-planning program that helped bring the Soviet Union to ruin. We don't have slogan that are aimed against the government, the first secretary of the Moscow Communist Party committee, Alexander Kuvayev, said in a recent interview. All the slogan are aimed against the president and the economic course of the country. Only the president can fully be blamed for the course that ha brought the country to this situation. Anger over Russia's fate, and their own, is drawing some Russians back to Soviet-style slogan and old-style hostility toward capitalism. The ardently pro-Communist newspaper Sovietskaya Rossiya devoted most of it front page on Thursday to what it said were the result of a contest among reader for protest slogan. The entry ranged from catchy to kitschy, from, Legislator, official, banker study the Constitution; the exam is Oct. 7, to, Imperialist! Help Russia return the exported capital, and we will pay the debt at once. Russia ha seen nothing approaching this sort of economic chaos and despair since 1993, when hyperinflation swept the economy. There is no real way of knowing whether the latest travail will produce huge and ugly crowd or small, peaceful one. A deputy editor and political analyst at a newsweekly, Itogi, Masha Lipman, said the situation wa not unlike that of 1993, when Yeltsin sought, and won, a popular mandate in a referendum. He used it to dissolve the Communist-dominated Parliament and increase his own power. That led to an autumn showdown, the shelling of Parliament by tank and the total defeat, for the time being, of Yeltsin's legislative opponent. You can interpret this demonstration a a Communist mandate, but I don't think they will act like Yeltsin, Ms. Lipman said. Support for the Communists is at it smallest level, maybe 20 percent. In a survey of 1,714 people that wa released last week the All-Russian Public Opinion Center said that nearly half the population supported the idea of demonstration against Yeltsin, but that barely one-tenth were likely to participate in any way. Nobody is interested in any sort of struggle, Yuri Levada, who head the center, said in an interview. This is mainly a general expression of a great wave of distrust of authority, mainly the president. He's the great scapegoat for all our sin. There seems to be little enthusiasm for demonstration of any sort. Only a few thousand people turned out Sunday for the fifth anniversary of the shelling of Parliament and Yeltsin's subsequent triumph over the Communists. The Communist Party and the Federation of Independent Russian Unions, a leftist organization that say it is the main sponsor of the protest, predict that 9 million Russians will participate on Wednesday. The government ha vowed to keep order without resorting to force. But it is concerned enough that it ha summoned 11,000 police officer to patrol Moscow and 6,000 military troop to intervene if violence erupts. Protests since 1993 have generally been tepid, a deep-seated feeling here. Some demonstration last week, more or le practice run, hinted at similarly dampened march this year. President Boris Yeltsin would respond strongly to any effort to prohibit Russians from buying foreign currency, believing the move would be like bringing another Iron Curtain down on the country, his spokesman said Friday. The president clearly understands that such a ban would be a clear violation of our right . that would mean a return to the Iron Curtain in everyday life, said presidential spokesman Dmitry Yakushin. The remark came after medium report of a government economic plan in the work that would prohibit Russians from buying US. dollar and other foreign currency, and institute other strict economic control, rolling back seven year of reform. Though government official say such a plan is only one of six possibility, Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov warned Thursday that he might be forced to take unpopular measure to rescue the Russian economy if it doe not receive the next installment in a dlrs 22.6 billion loan from the International Monetary Fund. Central Bank Chairman Viktor Gerashchenko and Finance Minister Mikhail Zadornov flew to Washington on Friday for negotiation with the IMF over the dlrs 4.3 billion installment. IMF official have said they want the Russian government to come up with a sound economic program before the loan is given, and have made it clear that currency control and boosting the money supply by printing ruble are not acceptable. But Primakov said that the country's plan would be dependent on the IMF loan, not the other way around. No short-term economic plan will be known for another three week, long after the IMF is set to make it decision, said First Deputy Prime Minister Vadim Gustov. A draft version of the government's fourth-quarter budget would rely heavily on the IMF loan, the Kommersant newspaper said. Without the loan, the government would have to engage in major deficit spending. Calls for Soviet-style control part of the plan drafted by First Deputy Prime Minister Yuri Maslyukov and leaked to the press have apparently created a rift within the Cabinet. The plan drew heavy criticism from Zadornov, and Gerashchenko called the idea of banning foreign currency sale a mad idea. Meanwhile, Russia's stock market dropped by 5 percent to 38.8 Friday, but trading wa so light the downward move meant little. The stock market ha continued to fall since the crisis hit Aug. 17. And tax collection wa down in September, the result of the collapse in Russia's banking system, said Alexander Pochinok, head of the government's finance and credit department. Revenues totaled 14.3 billion ruble (dlrs 875 million), 700 million ruble (dlrs 43 million) le than expected. The government want to reverse this trend by raising tax for oil and gas company, but the idea is expected to meet sharp resistance in the lower house of Russia's parliament, which want to cut tax rate, Pochinok said. Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov said Saturday that the economic crisis would not bring an end to the government's program of privatizing state property. Privatization will be accomplished for growth of production, growth of investment and growth of production effectiveness through renewal of major fund, Primakov said during a meeting of Western businessmen. We shall conduct privatization so that it serf the interest of the people, the state, and business, he said, according to the ITAR-Tass news agency. Primakov reassured the businessmen, member of the prime minister's consultive council on foreign investment in Russia, that the government had no plan to ban the circulation of US. dollar in Russia. But, he said, the government would take step to staunch the flow of dollar from Russia. Responding to medium report of a government economic plan that would prohibit Russians from buying US. dollar and other foreign currency, Primakov said the report absolutely do not correspond to reality, ITAR-Tass quoted him a saying. He said there wa no need to regulate the influx of dollar into Russia, but the government should take step to prevent what he called the dollar drain. Russian company stashed about dlrs 2.5 billion outside the country in September alone, the Interfax news agency reported Friday, quoting central bank figure. Primakov said foreign investor are the force that will help Russia to minimize it loss from the current economic crisis. We are very much interested in foreign investment, especially in one that go into the real production sector, Primakov said, according to Interfax. We need a continuous dialogue with foreign investor, without whom it will be difficult for u to overcome the current difficulty. He said Russia wanted long-term investment. Foreign capital ha been coming to the country via short-term operation, Primakov said. This, he said, is not to our liking or yours. Viktor Gerashchenko, the central bank chairman, said on Friday that the government must act to stem the flow of dollar from Russia. Gerashchenko and Finance Minister Mikhail Zadornov were in Washington Saturday for the annual meeting of the International Monetary Fund, where they plan to spell out the measure Russia is taking to bail out it finance system. Russia want the IMF to release the second dlrs 4.3 billion installment of a loan that wa approved in July, a month before the country's economy crashed and the government effectively defaulted on it foreign loan. IMF official have said they want the Russian government to come up with a sound economic program before the installment is given, and have made it clear that currency control and boosting the money supply by printing ruble are not acceptable. In a season of crashing bank, plunging ruble, bouncing paycheck, failing cropsand rotating government, maybe it is not the ultimate insult. But the nation that bore Tolstoy and Chekhov, and still regard a well-written letter a a labor of love, is buckling a little this week, because it can no longer wish good health to Baba Anya in Omsk. The Post Office is broke. In 60 of the country's 89 statelike region, more than 1,000 mail car have been sidetracked, many stuffed with up to 18 ton of letter, newspaper and parcel. The state Railway Ministry refuse to carry more mail until the Post Office make good on some 210 million ruble in old bill about $13 million in today's dollar, or $35 million in dollar six week ago. Air mail, which amount to one of every four or five letter, wa also suspended at one of Moscow's major airport until this week, when the Post Office coughed up 5 million ruble for old bill. A second airport is still demanding 3 million ruble for past-due debt. So much mail is backed up that post office in Moscow and elsewhere have simply stopped accepting out-of-town mail, except for area that can be easily reached by truck. Delivery schedule have fallen week, and perhaps month, behind. The situation is really extraordinary, said Vladimir Sherekhov, the deputy chief of mail service administration in the government's Communications Committee. We've never had anything like this before. Maybe the Post Office ha been lucky. Extraordinary is the rule elsewhere in Russia. Until Friday, the lower house of Parliament wa preparing to sue the government for failure to provide soap, heat, toilet paper and copy-machine paper in the legislature's monumental downtown office. It turned out that politician had exhausted their fund by cutting short their recess and returning to address the nation's economic crisis. Earlier in the week, official said Russia's Arctic shipping route may close next month because half the nation's icebreaker are in disrepair and there is no money to fix them. The oldest of the ship is so ancient that it nickname is Granny. Such anecdotal evidence that Russia is losing it wheel, like one of it old, ill-maintained Volga sedan, is everywhere. But oddly, real sign of public distress are not particularly common, perhaps because the system rarely seems to shed a part a big a a postal system. If the US. Postal Service is increasingly a pipeline for sweepstakes notice and bill, the Russian Post Office still hold a special place in the national conversation. Russians still write letter to each other, frequently and fervently, and many in remote region get their news through the mail. Millions use the mail to ship canned good and other provision to needy relative and friend in faraway area, an especially vital service in winter. And in the last few year, the Post Office ha become a vehicle for a growing mail-order trade in book, clothes and other catalog item not readily available outside big city. Exactly why all this ha rumbled to a halt is in some dispute. What is clear is that the Post Office and the Railway Ministry both suffer from what ail every Russian venture, private and public alike: Nobody pay his bill. The state Railway Ministry complains that it is continually stiffed by customer who believe the railroad are honor-bound to carry freight whether they are paid or not. The government ha specified nearly 40 category of freight which the railroad must carry for next to nothing. Among the biggest deadbeat are the power ministry the military and interior department which did not pay during Soviet time and feel little need to pay now. It's a psychology formed during the socialist period, said Tatiana Pashkova, the deputy spokeswoman for the ministry, and the same situation exists with the Post Office. We've been in dispute for a very long time. Always we try to understand their difference. But we can't carry cargo for free. No kidding, say the Post Office: It, too, is owed 200 million ruble by government agency, and is barred from raising rate even though freight cost are outstripping revenue. Moreover, the Post Office is also required by the government to carry some form of mail, such a pension check, at reduced rate. Officials at the state Communications Department say they also suspect an ulterior motive in the railroads' actions: a struggle to dominate the thriving mail-order business. Here's competition between u and the railroad for the delivery of parcel, and I think decision made by the railroad are mainly explained by this competition, Sherekhov said. They blame u for carrying some commercial cargo instead of mail. The Railways Ministry's spokeswoman, Ms. Pashkova, said such commercial cargo are indeed a problem, but only because the railroad know that the Post Office ha already gotten cash to transport the package.

Relations are also strained by the growing military and diplomatic tie between Turkey and Israel, which Damascus claim destabilizes the region. Greece on Monday warned that mounting tension between Turkey and Syria could lead to tragic result if not dealt with in it early stage. Sources of tension are being created in our region, government spokesman Dimitris Reppas said. We will have to deal with these source from their birth, because they may develop out of control and we will be led to tragic result. Greece accused Turkey of undermining the whole region's stability through it stand-off with Syria over the alleged harboring of Kurdish rebel. Sadly, the tone of certain country is not constructive, Reppas said. Turkey in particular . repeatedly dynamite every effort for the creation of a climate of regional stability. Turkish troop have reportedly massed on the frontier with Syria, while Ankara ha indicated it readiness for cross-border raid to eradicate what it claim are guerrilla base harboring Kurdish rebel. Syria ha denied the charge. In the past, Turkish official have also accused Greece of harboring Kurdish rebel and running guerrilla training camp. Athens denied the charge, and no evidence ha been found to support the accusation. Relations between Greece and neighboring Turkey are rarely cordial. The two NATO ally are at odds over a variety of issue, and have twice reached the brink of war in the past 11 year over the Aegean Sea. But a neighbor, country in the region must learn to get along, Reppas stressed. No one can change geographical fact, he said. As we live in this region of the world . we have to strive for good friendly relation and cooperation.

Some 10,000 Turkish troop were deployed this week on the Turkish-Syrian border, news report said. Damascus denies that it is supporting the rebel, who wage cross-border raid from camp in Iraq, Iran and Syria. This situation is serious, Demirel said. I am not only warning Syria, I am warning the world. This cannot continue. He did not elaborate and it wa unclear whether Demirel wa warning of a possible military confrontation. But several military and civilian leader here have said that if diplomacy fails, the military would be charged with solving the issue. Our patience ha run out.

United States maxi Sayonara look set to continue the foreign domination of line honor in Australia's famous Sydney to Hobart yacht race, which start Saturday. Sayonara, raced by American computer billionaire Larry Ellison, ha only been beaten once since it wa launched in 1995 and is aiming for it second win in the 630 nautical mile bluewater classic. If the 80-footer beat the local boat home into Hobart, it will be third time in four year a foreign yacht ha finished first. New Zealand Endeavour trumped the local in 1992, Sayonara won in 1995 and German's Morning Glory set a race record of two day, 14 hour, seven minute and 10 second the following year. Sayonara's rival are expected to be last year's line honor winner Brindabella of Sydney and new Australian maxi Wild Thing. The contest for handicap honor appears more open, but there are many who believe Sayonara could become the sixth yacht to do the line honor and handicap double. Ellison belief unforeseen damage is the only major barrier to victory. She is a much more modern boat than Brindabella, if we don't break, we should beat Brindabella, we should beat anybody, Ellison said. If we hold together we should win the race, the question is if this boat come through and pay u a favor we would just love to knock off the record. Ellison say Sayonara can knock half a day off Morning Glory's record given the right condition. Brindabella's captain and owner George Snow belief a new record is possible. I think the front boat will be very close all the way down, which will be a great challenge, said Snow. We are well set up, we've got the best crew we've ever had and I think the boat is in great shape, Snow added. The race is tipped to start Saturday under freshening north easter with the prospect of shower and a thunder storm before a southerly change of around 25-30 knot later in the day. The southerly is expected to ease to 15-20 knot over Sunday before swinging back to the north on Monday with a west to south westerly change expected to move through Tasmania and Bass Strait on Tuesday when the first yacht is anticipated to finish. Two sailor died and 15 others were missing after gale-force wind and high sea battered yacht in the Sydney-to-Hobart yacht race Monday. There are two that have been confirmed deceased which is tragedy because in the 54-year history of the race I think there's only two people who have died in it before, said Australian Maritime Safety Authority spokesman David Gray. The two dead were found on the 40-foot vessel Business Post Naiad, about 100 kilometer (60 mile) off the New South Wales state town of Merimbula. Gray said Business Post Naiad owner-skipper Bruce Guy and first-time race participant Phil Skeggs were killed. Both men were from Launceston in northern Tasmania. Guy suffered a heart attack during one of the two occasion the yacht rolled, Gray said, while Skeggs drowned when he wa unable to free himself from a safety harness. Their body were left on board the boat but attempt were being made to recover them a soon a possible. Race official said Guy sailed in two previous Sydney to Hobart yacht race. Grave fear were held for the safety of the nine crew on missing cutter Winston Churchill, while contact ha been lost with the five crew aboard Solo Globe. British sailor Glyn Charles wa swept off the Sword of Orion on Sunday night when the boat rolled in wild sea. At 12:30 pm. local time (0130 GMT) Monday Charles had been missing for about 17 hour. Race official said Charles had sailed in four Admiral's Cups and represented Britain in the Star Class at the 1996 Atlanta Olympics where he finished 11th. Race spokesman Peter Campbell said it wa not known how long Gray could survive in the water. It's supposition, Campbell said. We had John Quinn survive for 5 1-2 hour in 1993 and that wa in the middle of the night in very severe condition. Gray said about 56 sailor had been winched to safety. There's just many many injury on those yacht that got knocked down. A lot of them rolled over one rolled over twice, Gray said. They've got hand, leg, facial injury, they really got pounded yesterday. One of the missing yacht B-52 wa found mid-morning Monday and wa making it way towards Eden on the New South Wales coast. The nine crew on board were thought to be safe and the vessel wa sailing unassisted. American John Campbell wa rescued by a police helicopter after being swerpt overboard when Kingurra rolled over 35 kilometer (22 mile) south of Gabo Island. Campbell wa in the water for about 40 minute and had hypothermia when he wa taken to safety by Senior Constable Barry Barclay, who dropped into large swell to secure Campbell. I wa definitely worried, Campbell told United States television in Seattle. There wa a point I didn't think I wa going to survive. (Barclay) came down into the water only about 5, 10 foot away from me and I swam to him pretty quicky. I just threw my arm into the harness and they hoisted me up. At least 37 yacht have been forced out of the 1,160-kilometer (725-mile) race. The Australian Maritime Safety Authority alerted all shipping in Bass Strait a high wind and huge sea smash into the remnant of the 115-boat fleet. The American maxi Sayonara wa narrowly ahead of last year's winner, Brindabella. Although the two were forced to reduce sail and cut speed, they were still well inside the race record of 2 day, 14 hour, 7 minute, 10 second, set by German maxi Morning Glory in 1996. British sailor Glyn Charles wa missing and presumed drowned becoming the third fatality in the Sydney-to-Hobart yacht race while three others remained missing in rough sea after nightfall Monday. Robin Poke, a spokesman for the Australian Maritime Safety Authority (AMSA), admitted it wa unlikely the 33-year-old Charles could survive more than 24 hour at sea after being washed off Sword of Orion on Sunday night. He ha been out there in 10-meter (30-feet) wave and 80-kilometer (50-mile) wind, Poke said Monday. He will be a superman if he make it. Charles sailed in four Admiral's Cups and represented Britain in the Star Class at the 1996 Atlanta Olympics where he finished 11th. Two sailor died after gale-force wind and high sea battered the entrant. Four member from the veteran cutter Winston Churchill were winched to safety from a liferaft before dark Monday. Two more crew from the Winston Churchill were plucked from a second liferaft late Monday night, but three others who had been aboard the liferaft were still missing. We are unsure about what ha happened to the other three, it appears they were washed out of the liferaft, a spokesman for the authority said. The two dead, both Australians, were found on the 40-foot vessel Business Post Naiad, about 100 kilometer (60 mile) off the New South Wales state town of Merimbula. The yacht's owner-skipper Bruce Guy and first-time race participant Phil Skeggs were killed. Guy suffered a heart attack during one of the two occasion the yacht rolled while Skeggs drowned when he wa unable to free himself from a safety harness. Their body were left on board the boat but attempt were being made to recover them a soon a possible, rescue official said. Dad loved sailing, said Bruce Guy's son Mark Guy. He loved the competition. He also loved a beer and a talk after the race. Dad simply loved life. Winston Churchill skipper Richard Winning wa one of the four rescued. The worst thing of the whole affair wa that after we got into the life raft and became separated from the others, the damned thing capsized twice on these great sea at night which is bloody frightening, let me tell you, Winning said. You have got four of u underneath this little canopy and the next thing is you are upside down. I wouldn't want to have spent another night out there. The first recorded death in the race, which started in 1945, wa in 1984 when a 72-year-old yachtsman wa washed overboard from Yahoo 2 and presumed drowned. In 1989, a 58-year-old man died from head injury on the yacht Flying Colours after a 45-knot gale off the southern NSW coast snapped the boat's mast. AMSA spokesman David Gray said about 50 sailor had been winched to safety in this year's race. There's just many, many injury on those yacht that got knocked down. A lot of them rolled over one rolled over twice, Gray said. They've got hand, leg, facial injury, they really got pounded yesterday. American John Campbell wa rescued by a police helicopter after being swerpt overboard when Kingurra rolled over 35 kilometer (22 mile) south of Gabo Island. Campbell wa in the water for about 40 minute and had hypothermia when he wa taken to safety by Senior Constable Barry Barclay, who dropped into large swell to secure Campbell. I wa definitely worried, Campbell told United States television in Seattle. There wa a point I didn't think I wa going to survive. (Barclay) came down into the water only about 5, 10 foot away from me and I swam to him pretty quickly. I just threw my arm into the harness and they hoisted me up. About half of the 115-yacht fleet have been forced out of the 1,160-kilometer (725-mile) race. The American maxi Sayonara wa narrowly ahead of last year's winner, Brindabella, and expected to cross the line Tuesday. Leading maxi yacht Brindabella, Sayonara and Marchioness were locked in a three-way duel down the New South Wales state coast Saturday a the Sydney to Hobart fleet faced deteriorating weather. All three maxi reported in at the same latitude during Saturday night's positioning report when they were about 30 nautical mile south of Jervis Bay on the New South Wales south coast. American maxi Sayonara and Sydney boat Brindabella reported they were about 50 kilometer (30 mile) offshore while Marchioness wa a couple of mile further inshore. In fourth spot wa Australian maxi Wild Thing. The three leader covered 105 nautical mile in the first 7 1-2 hour of the race. Propelled for the most part by favorable northerly breeze, the leader rocketed along at an average speed of 14 knot in the first part of the 630-nautical-mile race to Hobart on the island state of Tasmania. The fast early pace put the leader well on schedule to eclipse Morning Glory's 1996 race record but that wa before the far tougher condition forecast for overnight Saturday night. Morning Glory, a German maxi, broke the 21-year-old race record two year ago, arriving in Hobart 2 day, 14 hour, seven minute and 10 second after she left Sydney. While the annual event started in friendly and favorable northeasterly breeze, the 115-strong fleet reported cloudier condition a it moved down the coast. The yacht were bracing for a tough night with thunderstorm predicted ahead of a west-southwesterly change expected to lash the south coast by Sunday morning. Earlier, a crowd of around 300,000 people on the Sydney headland and water witnessed the start of the annual blue water classic. Sayonara took the initial honor when she beat Brindabella though Sydney head, but the 1997 line honor winner drew level when the American maxi's spinnaker blew out and had to be replaced. Two yacht crew member are dead, three yacht remain missing and rescue resource were stretched to the limit Monday a huge sea and gale-force wind continued to batter the Sydney-to-Hobart race fleet. A helicopter rescue team flew to a spot about 50 nautical mile off the far south New South Wales town of Merimbula early Monday morning. Two crew found dead on the stricken 40-foot vessel Business Post Naiad were left behind while seven colleague were winched aboard the helicopter and flown to Merimbula Hospital, he said. The death were confirmed by an Australian Search and Rescue Coordination Center spokesman in Canberra a short time later. Neither organization wa able to say how the sailor died or give detail on the injury suffered by surviving crewman. Three yacht remain missing and there wa no sign of a sailor swept off the Sword of Orion when the boat rolled in wild sea on Sunday night. The missing boat are veteran cutter Winston Churchill, which sailed in the inaugural 1945 race, B-52 and Solo Globe Challenger. A major search involving Australia's navy continued Monday morning for those missing. Race spokesman Peter Campbell said it wa not known how long the sailor washed overboard could survive in the water. It's supposition. We had John Quinn survive for 5 1-2 hour in 1993 and that wa in the middle of the night in very severe condition, Campbell said. Despite the horrendous condition it wa unlikely the race would be called off, he said. It doe say in the instruction that it is the sole responsibility of the skipper of each yacht to decide whether he continues in the race or retires, he said. The Australian Maritime Safety Authority (AMSA) ha alerted all shipping in Bass Strait a high wind and huge sea smash into the remnant of the 115-boat fleet. An AMSA spokesman said they were alerted that the 30-foot Sydney yacht Sword of Orion had rolled in heavy sea near Gabo Island about 450 kilometer (280 mile) east of Melbourne. Several crewman were injured including one with a broken leg. The yacht, which ha a crew of 11, wa halfway across Bass Strait when it overturned. The Navy sent a Sea King helicopter with night-vision and heat-seeking equipment to search the area and the frigate HMAS Newcastle wa on it way to the area. Earlier, a wind gusting to 80 knot and sea of 35 foot caused havoc to the fleet, several rescue took place. A police helicopter rescued a yachtsman swept overboard when the Victorian yacht Kingurra wa rolled over in huge sea 19 nautical mile south of Gabo Island. John Campbell, an American, wa in the water for about 40 minute and wa suffering from hypothermia when he wa winched to safety by senior constable Barry Barclay, who dropped into large swell to secure Campbell. A total of 37 yacht have been forced to retire from the 630-nautical-mile race, many having been dismasted or suffering injury to crew. Meanwhile, American maxi Sayonara wa narrowly ahead of last year's line winner Brindabella. Although the two were forced to reduce sail and cut speed, they were still well inside the race record for the 630-nautical-mile race of 2 day, 14 hour, seven minute and 10 second set by German maxi Morning Glory in 1996. (djp) Gale-force wind and high sea battered yacht in Australia's Sydney-to-Hobart race Monday, killing at least two crew member and leaving three yacht missing. The two dead were found on the 40-foot (12-meter) vessel Business Post Naiad, about 60 mile (100 kilometer) off the New South Wales town of Merimbula, according to the Australian Search and Rescue Coordination Center in Canberra. Seven others on board were taken to a hospital by helicopter, the center said. The center wa unable to identify the sailor, say how they died or give detail on the injury sustained by surviving crewman. One of the missing yacht B-52 wa found mid-morning Monday and wa making it way toward Eden on the New South Wales coast, AusSAR said. The nine crew on board were thought to be safe and the vessel wa sailing unassisted. With wind gusting to 90 mph (145 kph) and sea swelling to 35 foot (10 meters), the race continued even a rescue team searched for the missing vessel. AusSAR said no word had been received on the fate of the Winston Churchill or the sailor swept from the deck of Sword of Orion on Sunday night. As of mid-morning Monday, he had been in the water for 15 hour. The yacht, which ha a crew of 11, wa halfway across Bass Strait when it overturned. The Navy sent a Sea King helicopter with night-vision and heat-seeking equipment to search the area and the frigate HMAS Newcastle wa on it way to the area.

A total of 37 yacht have been forced out of the 1,160-kilometer (725-mile) race. Many lost their mast or have injured crew. ","Gale-force winds and high seas struck the 155 participants in Australia's Sydney to Hobart yacht race.One sailor, Glyn Charles, who was swept off the yacht Sword of Orion, is presumed drowned and two seamen on the Business Post Naiad were killed.Search and rescue efforts were stretched to the limit also as three yachts turned up missing.One yacht, the B-52 was found with the crew safe.Race organizers never considered canceling the race, claiming that the skippers controlled whether to stay in the race or drop out.A total of 37 yachts were forced out of the race, many of which had lost their masts.","Before this year, only two deaths had occurred in the 54-year history of the Sydney-to-Hobart race.Since the start of this year's classic, Bruce Guy and Phil Skeggs from The Business Post Naiad have died, three from the Winston Churchill are missing, and Glyn Charles is presumed drowned after being washed overboard the Sword of Orion.Huge seas and gale-force winds have battered the 115-boat fleet, forcing at least 37 yachts to retire.Numerous crewmen have been rescued, including an American, John Campbell, who was swept overboard the Kingurra.The race, nevertheless, continued.American maxi Sayonara narrowly leads last year's winner, Brindabella.","As contestants prepared for the 1998 running of Australia's 630 nautical mile Sydney-to-Hobart yacht race, the American maxi yacht Sayonara emerged as the favorite followed by Australia's Brindabella and Wild Thing.Winds of 15-30 knots were forecast.The first day of the race Brindabella and Sayonara led.By the end of the second day horrendous conditions had developed with gales reaching 80 knots and waves as high as 10 meters.By dusk of the third day three crewmen were dead, three missing, many injured and about half of the 115 yachts were forced out of the race.Sayonara was narrowly ahead of Brindabella and expected to reach Hobart the next day.","US-owned Sayonara, favored to win the Sydney-Hobart yacht race, set an early, fast lead.Weather deteriorated.In Bass Strait, boats rolled in heavy seas and crewmen were swept overboard.37 yachts dropped from the race, with many dismasted and many crewmen injured.The race continued as winds gusted to 90 mph and seas swelled to 35 feet.Yachts Solo Globe and Winston Churchill went missing, as did B-52 which was later found.Business Post Naiad's owner died of a heart attach and a crewman drowned.Sword of Orion's Glyn Charles was presumed drowned after 24 hours overboard.Three other sailors remained missing.Sayonara maintained its lead."
31,"Endeavour's astronaut connected the first two building block of the international space station on Sunday, creating a seven-story tower in the shuttle cargo bay. It wa the first time that the Russian-built Zarya control module and the made-in-America Unity chamber had ever touched. It looked to be a perfect and, hopefully, long-lasting fit. We have capture of Zarya, commander Robert Cabana announced the two piece came together. Congratulations to the crew of the good ship Endeavour, replied Mission Control. That's terrific. The 240-mile-high construction job began two hour earlier with Nancy Currie's capture of Zarya (Russian for Sunrise) using the shuttle robot arm. We're halfway home, Cabana said. Then came the hard part: stacking the two giant cylinder in the cargo bay. The two station piece are so big 77 foot from the tip of one to the tip of the other with a combined mass of 70,000 pound that Currie and her crewmates had to rely on a computerized vision system and camera view, rather than direct line of sight. This wa the first time such a blind docking had ever been attempted. Currie positioned the solar-winged Zarya, still on the end of the shuttle robot arm, several inch directly above Unity. It wa slow going; she wanted and needed perfect alignment. Once she wa sure she had it, Cabana fired Endeavour's thruster, and the brief burst raised the shuttle and thereby Unity enough for the docking mechanism on the two station component to snap together. The historical moment occurred above the South Pacific. The union intended to last the station's 15-year or more lifetime set the stage for a spacewalk by two astronaut on Monday to attach electrical connector and cable between the two component. Mission Control thought Sunday's work might take hour longer than planned and gave the six astronaut plenty of time for the task. But everything occurred more or le when and how it wa supposed to, aside from a piece of space junk that strayed too close. Before beginning their final approach to Zarya, the six astronaut had to steer clear of a chunk of a rocket launched last month from California. Mission Control ordered the pilot to fire the shuttle thruster to put an extra three mile between Endeavour and the space junk, putting Endeavour a total of five mile from the orbiting debris. The smaller gap would have been probably a little too close for comfort, Mission Control said. The bigger worry, by far, wa over Endeavour's pursuit and capture of Zarya, and it coupling with Unity. The shuttle's 50-foot robot arm had never before handled an object a massive a the 41-foot, 44,000-pound Zarya, a power and propulsion module that wa launched from Kazakstan on Nov. 20. It will provide all of the necessary electricity and steering for the fledgling space station until a permanent control module can be launched next summer. Minutes after Zarya's capture, Cabana called down that two antenna on the module were still undeployed a Russian flight controller had feared. The antenna must be fully deployed in order for Zarya's manual docking system to work; that system won't be needed before next summer, official said. The only other problem wa with a Zarya battery; the astronaut took up a replacement part. The 36-foot, 25,000-pound Unity, the first American-made component, will serve a a connecting passageway, or vestibule, for future module. It wa crucial that Zarya and Unity be joined; if they could not be connected with the robot arm, NASA would have sent out two spacewalking astronaut to manually fit them together. In all, three spacewalks are planned for Endeavour's 12-day flight, not only to hook up electrical connection between the two module but to install handrail and other tool for future crew. The joined module will be released from Endeavour once all of the work is completed. NASA estimate 43 more launch and 159 more spacewalks will be needed after this mission to assemble the entire orbiting complex. Once completed, the 16-nation space station will have a mass of 1 million pound, be longer than a football field, and house up to seven astronaut and cosmonaut. WASHINGTON NASA and the Russian Space Agency have agreed to set aside a last-minute Russian request to launch an international space station into an orbit closer to Mir, official announced Friday. While putting the new station closer to Russia's 12-year-old Mir station would make it easier to transfer equipment and supply from the old outpost to the new one, the request came too late to be acted on, said Randy Brinkley, NASA's space station program manager. NASA wa surprised last week when Russia's prime station contractor proposed the orbital position change just two-and-a-half week before launch of the first part of the new station. Delaying the Nov. 20 flight by 10 hour to match the orbit would have forced similar shift in the subsequent assembly flight, and resulted in potentially unfavorable sun angle on the solar-powered station, engineer said. We have mutually concluded that it would not be prudent to make these change, Brinkley said during a news conference held at the Johnson Space Center in Houston. It added technical complexity and risk to the mission that were not justified. The decision, which followed frank and candid discussion between the two partner, wa not imposed by the United States, he said. The conclusion were mutual, Brinkley said. Both side concluded that it did not make sense. The Russians, struggling to find money for their space program with their nation in economic collapse, had said they wanted to transfer thousand of pound of newer equipment and scientific instrument from Mir a an economy move. However, some critic questioned the Russians' motif, wondering if the requested orbital change wa part of plan to delay the decommissioning and destruction of Mir, which the Russians have agreed to do next summer. The Russians have so little money that the United States and other partner in the international station fear that money spent on Mir will prevent Russia from meeting it obligation with the new project. The Mir competes with the international space station for very critical resource and for funding, Brinkley said. NASA will consider idea for salvaging Mir's research equipment to use on the international space station, he said, but only if it doe not interfere with assembling the new station. The United States and 15 other nation plan to begin building the new station in orbit next week when the Russians launch a module that will supply power and propulsion during the early stage of the five-year construction period. The space shuttle Endeavor is to follow on Dec. 3 with the second station part, a U.S.-built connecting passageway that attache to the first module.

The historical moment occurred above the South Pacific. It took several try, however, for Zarya and Unity to be pulled tightly together. The docking ring between them would not retract properly; Mission Control quickly traced the problem to the attached robot arm and asked the crew to release it hold on the docked Zarya. That did the trick.

For the second day in a row, astronaut boarded space shuttle Endeavour on Friday for liftoff on NASA's first space station construction flight. Let's go do this, said commander Robert Cabana. Amen, replied a launch controller. Rain and cloudy sky were once again a threat. But NASA wa confident the master alarm in Endeavour's cockpit would behave; it went off with just 4{ minute to go in the countdown Thursday, forcing a delay. NASA ha only five minute or le each day to launch Endeavour in order to meet up with the first space station part, which wa put in orbit two week ago by the Russians. The shuttle contains the second station component. The master alarm blared and red light flashed just before the shuttle wa to lift off early Thursday. By the time controller traced the problem to a momentary drop in hydraulic pressure and decided to press ahead, it wa too late they had missed the cutoff by a second or two. Sure, it's frustrating, said Bill Readdy, shuttle program director and a veteran shuttle commander. But we do thing right. We do thing by the book, and we're not going to cut any corner even if it mean just shaving a second or two. The six astronaut crawled out of the shuttle, and two threw up their hand. Cabana held up his thumb and index finger a half-inch apart: We were that close. The problem wa confined to one of Endeavour's three hydraulic pressure unit. The pressure dropped just long enough to trigger the alarm, evidently because of a sensitive switch, then returned to normal. NASA engineer spent the day examining the problem, but found nothing wrong with any of the system and were confident it would not reoccur. Endeavour's flight is already a year late because of a cash crunch in Russia, one of NASA's partner in building the international space station. The one-day delay cost NASA about $600000, mostly in fuel and overtime pay. Aboard Endeavour is an American-made connecting passageway named Unity. The astronaut will use the shuttle robot arm to capture the Russian space station piece and attach it to Unity. Then, two spacewalker will hook up all the electrical connection and cable between the two cylinder, and attach handrail and tool for future crew. Until the alarm sounded, it looked a though the weather would be the only problem. Rain and cloud moved in from the Atlantic 1{ hour before liftoff, but drifted away with minute to spare. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright and other dignitary from around the world had gathered in the drizzle to see Endeavour and it crew off. Here we have 16 country cooperating on a venture to the future, said Albright, who wa expected back for Friday's attempt. This is a good investment. The planet's most daring construction job began Friday a the shuttle Endeavour carried into orbit six astronaut and the first U.S.-built part of an international space station that is expected to cost more than $100 billion. After a last-minute alarm on the shuttle forced a postponement early Thursday, the launch went off flawlessly at 3:36 Friday morning, right on schedule. The night sky wa clear, and the moon full. With a roar, Endeavour made it fiery ascent and briefly turned the Florida coastline from night to day. More than five minute and 500 mile later, the spaceship's main engine could still be seen in the distance, twinkling like a new star. On their 12-day flight, Endeavour's astronaut are to locate a Russian part already in orbit, grasp it with the shuttle's robot arm and attach the new US. module. Wielding tool hundred of mile above Earth, working methodically in the cold void, the astronaut will be starting a five-year assembly that is likely to make the construction of the Pyramids and the great cathedral look like child's play. Construction of the station, which will be a research facility, will require an estimated 160 space walk, which, for safety reason, will always be done by two people. When complete, the international space station, dominated by solar power array, will cover an area equal to that of two football field. Modules of interconnected laboratory and living quarter for up to seven astronaut are to form a habitat equal to that of two 747 jetliner. The station's battery alone, if lined up, would extend a half-mile. The project entail high risk, because of the technical difficulty of putting all this together in the unforgiving environment of space, along with the danger inherent in flying the space shuttle to the construction site. The work is further complicated by international politics and worry about money. The Russians, whose participation in the partnership clinched the post-Cold War deal five year ago, are now a wild card. Moscow's economic and political woe have left Western official unsure of it ability and willingness to come up with it share of money and technology. At the same time, the station's cost are rising, and it critic among scientist worry that it appetite for money will consume their own federal financing. The project's total cost is a subject of debate, but the most credible estimate now put the price of assembly and of operation for a decade, the station's estimated lifetime, at $110 billion. Of that, American taxpayer are to spend roughly $96 billion, and the project's 15 foreign partner about $14 billion. The station is intended to be a grand laboratory where, in the environment of weightlessness, investigator can develop new material and new drug and explore physiology's remaining mystery, in part so that human may someday know how to adapt for long space flight to other world. Friday, in any case, little wa heard about the project but praise. Great show, Endeavour, mission control in Houston radioed to the six astronaut a the shuttle went into orbit. At the Florida spaceport, Secretary of State Madeleine Albright lauded the launching team and the new venture. That wa truly, truly fantastic, she told the team after the liftoff. And it wa important, she added, to have so many nation working together on the kind of issue that the 21st century is going to be concerned with. So my congratulation to all of you, the secretary said. Stupendous work. The main cargo Thursday wa the Unity module, the first U.S.-built station part. Small compared with the giant to come in three dozen shuttle flight during assembly, the unit is 18 foot long, weighs 13 ton and is to serve a a connecting hub for other module. Saturday, one of the astronaut, Lt. Col. Nancy Currie of the Army, is to have the shuttle's robot arm hoist Unity from the payload bay and secure it to Endeavour's docking system, moving the unit from a horizontal to a vertical position. Then, Sunday, the astronaut are to rendezvous with the module known a Zarya, or Sunrise, which Russia launched into orbit from Kazakhstan on Nov. 20. Financed by the United States but built in Russia, Zarya, 41 foot long, is be a kind of tugboat for the embryonic station, furnishing power and propulsion a well a communication and rendezvous ability. When Endeavour's payload bay is within 10 foot of Zarya, Colonel Currie is to reach out with the robot arm and pull the Russian module into position over Unity. The mechanical arm ha never before moved anything so big. Zarya, while completely weightless in space, ha 21 ton of mass. If mishandled, it can crush and kill. As Col. Currie hold Zarya steady, Endeavour's commander, Col. Robert Cabana of the Marine Corps, a veteran of three space flight, is to nudge the shuttle forward to join the two station piece together. When mated with special attachment, Zarya and Unity will form the station's first element, 63 foot long and 78 foot wide out to the tip of the solar array. Starting Monday, a pair of space-walking astronaut are to hook up electrical connection and data cable between the unit, attach antenna and install tool and handrail for future visitor. The builder will be Col. Jerry Ross of the Air Force, 50, and Dr. James Newman, 42, a physicist. Their series of three space walk will continue Wednesday and end Saturday, Dec. 12. As construction go on outside, the astronaut inside Endeavour will be busy making preparation to enter the new station through a connecting tunnel and docking system. Next Thursday, the crew will enter the embryonic station for the first time, installing portable fan and light. Friday they will again enter, to prepare for the arrival in 1999 of the next major element, the first one both built and financed by Russia. The other astronaut on Endeavour are it pilot, Maj. Frederick Sturckow of the Marine Corps, and a mission specialist, Sergei Krikalev of the Russian Space Agency. After separating from the new outpost, the crew is to bring Endeavour back to the Kennedy Space Center on Dec. 15, with the mission length just shy of 12 day. Gretchen McClain, NASA's director in Washington for the international space station, said in an interview here that it overall cost were actually small for individual Americans. Over it lifetime, she said, the annual cost will equal that of a pizza and a soft drink for each of the nation's 96 million taxpayer. US. cost for construction, she added, were $24 billion, and for operation through the year 2012 were $10.4 billion, for a total of $34.4 billion. Most expert outside the agency consider this figure ridiculously low because it ignores many billion of dollar spent in early development work a well a the cost of numerous shuttle flight, which run about $800 million apiece. Following a series of intricate maneuver and the skillful use of the space shuttle Endeavour's robot arm, astronaut on Sunday joined the first two of many segment that will form the international space station. The shuttle and it crew of six snared the Russian-made Zarya control module after chasing it around the Earth in ever-closing orbit throughout the day. Less than an hour after a rendezvous 240 mile above the Earth shortly before 6 p.m., Lt. Col. Nancy Currie of the Army deftly used the 50-foot arm to grab the 40,000-pound cylinder a the craft passed above Russia and to slowly pull it toward the shuttle. Seeing Zarya up close, Col. Robert Cabana of the Marines, the shuttle commander, confirmed that two antenna had failed to deploy from the module following it launch from Kazakhstan on Nov. 20. There were earlier indication that the antenna, which will be used later by the station to manually assist spacecraft docking, had not extended. Currie took almost two hour to painstakingly move Zarya above the American-made Unity docking port positioned in Endeavour's cargo bay. When the two piece were aligned within inch of one another, Cabana fired small thruster rocket that raised the shuttle, allowing the module to clamp together. The two station piece, together measuring about 77 foot from end to end and having a combined mass of 70,000 pound, are the first of 100 major component to be united in space over the next five year to form an orbiting outpost that would weigh almost a million pound and span an area the size of two football field. More than 40 additional mission by US. shuttle and Russian rocket will be used to haul all of the component and other supply into orbit, and astronaut from both nation are to spend almost 1,800 hour doing spacewalks to assemble the entire structure. The spece station is expected to cost it partnership of 16 nation more than $40 billion just to construct. Bringing the piece together is only the first step in mating them. A pair of astronaut are to make three spacewalks this week, the first on Monday, during which they will hook up electrical and communication cable, remove cover, attach handrail and perform other task to get the module to work a one unit. The most difficult part of Sunday's mating of the $240 million Zarya to the $300 million Unity wa bringing them together after the shuttle caught up with the Russian unit. Currie had to use the Canadian-built robot arm to place Zarya on top of Unity without being able to see where the piece joined. Unity, raised in Endeavour's cargo bay on Saturday, is so large that it blocked Currie's view of the mating fixture from the shuttle's window. She used view from remote camera and a computerized vision system built on the arm to estimate the relative position of the two large segment. The computerized system examined marking on both module, computed their relationship to one another using the mark and displayed the result on a laptop computer. We've never done anything like this before, Currie said before the flight, adding that she had practiced the difficult maneuver more than 100 time over the last two year. The flight of Endeavour, which took off from Cape Canaveral, Fla., last Friday, had gone according to plan until early Sunday, when mission control ordered the shuttle to change it orbit slightly to avoid a piece of space debris. Air Force space debris tracker noted that the shuttle wa to pas within 1.6 mile of a spent stage of an American booster rocket launched last month. Although this wa considered a safe distance, shuttle controller decided to widen the separation to five mile a an extra precaution. Endeavour and it astronaut closed in Sunday to capture the first piece of the international space station, the Russian-made Zarya control module that had to be connected to the Unity chamber aboard the shuttle. Stacking the two giant cylinder 240 mile above the Earth wa considered the most difficult part of the mission. The job fell to Nancy Currie, the shuttle crane operator who had deftly hoisted and repositioned Unity in the cargo bay on Saturday. The two station piece are so big 77 foot from the tip of one to the tip of the other with a combined mass of 70,000 pound that Currie and her crewmates were going to have to rely on a computerized vision system and camera view, rather than direct line of sight. Such a blind docking had never been attempted before. Mission Control gave the astronaut plenty of time for the task. The main thing I've tried to do for the last two year working on this flight is make sure we have time. We have margin on everything, said flight director Bob Castle. Before beginning their final approach to Zarya Russian for Sunrise the shuttle's six astronaut had to steer clear of a chunk of a rocket launched last month from California. Mission Control ordered the pilot to fire the shuttle thruster to put an extra three mile between Endeavour and the space junk, putting Endeavour a total of five mile from the orbiting debris. The smaller gap would have been probably a little too close for comfort, Mission Control said. The bigger worry, by far, wa over Endeavour's pursuit and capture of Zarya, and it coupling with Unity. The shuttle's 50-foot robot arm had never before been assigned to handle an object a massive a the 44,000-pound Zarya, a power and propulsion module that wa launched from Kazakhstan on Nov. 20. It will provide all the necessary electricity and steering for the fledgling space station until a permanent control module can be launched next summer. The 36-foot, 25,000-pound Unity will serve a a connecting passageway, or vestibule, for future module. In case Zarya and Unity could not be connected with the robot arm, two spacewalking astronaut would have to manually fit them together. The astronaut would be going out anyway Monday to attach electrical connector and cable between the two component. In all, three spacewalks were planned for Endeavour's 12-day flight. NASA estimate 43 more launch and 159 more spacewalks will be needed after this mission to assemble the entire orbiting complex. Once completed, the 16-nation space station will have a mass of 1 million pound, be longer than a football field, and house up to seven astronaut and cosmonaut. Endeavour's astronaut connected the first two building block of the international space station on Sunday, creating a seven-story tower in the shuttle cargo bay. It wa the first time that the Russian-built Zarya control module and the made-in-America Unity chamber had ever touched. It looked to be a perfect and, hopefully, long-lasting fit. We have capture of Zarya, commander Robert Cabana announced the moment the two piece came together. Congratulations to the crew of the good ship Endeavour, replied Mission Control. That's terrific. The 240-mile-high construction job began two hour earlier with Nancy Currie's capture of Zarya (Russian for Sunrise) using the shuttle robot arm. We're halfway home, Cabana said. Then came the hard part: stacking the two giant cylinder in the cargo bay. The two station piece are so big 77 foot from the tip of one to the tip of the other with a combined mass of 70,000 pound that Currie and her crewmates had to rely on a computerized vision system and camera view, rather than direct line of sight. This wa the first time such a blind docking had ever been attempted. Currie positioned the solar-winged Zarya, still on the end of the shuttle robot arm, several inch directly above Unity. It wa slow going; she wanted and needed perfect alignment. Once she wa sure she had it, Cabana fired Endeavour's thruster, and the brief burst raised the shuttle and thereby Unity enough for the docking mechanism on the two station component to snap together. The historical moment occurred above the South Pacific. It took several try, however, for Zarya and Unity to be pulled tightly together. The docking ring between them would not retract properly; Mission Control quickly traced the problem to the attached robot arm and asked the crew to release it hold on the docked Zarya. That did the trick. The union intended to last the station's 15-year or more lifetime set the stage for a spacewalk by two astronaut on Monday to attach electrical connector and cable between the two component. Mission Control thought Sunday's work might take hour longer than planned and gave the six astronaut plenty of time for the task. But everything occurred more or le when and how it wa supposed to, aside from a piece of space junk that strayed too close. Before beginning their final approach to Zarya, the six astronaut had to steer clear of a chunk of a rocket launched last month from California. Mission Control ordered the pilot to fire the shuttle thruster to put an extra three mile between Endeavour and the space junk, putting Endeavour a total of five mile from the orbiting debris. The smaller gap would have been probably a little too close for comfort, Mission Control said. The bigger worry, by far, wa over Endeavour's pursuit and capture of Zarya, and it coupling with Unity. The shuttle's 50-foot robot arm had never before handled an object a massive a the 41-foot, 44,000-pound Zarya, a power and propulsion module that wa launched from Kazakstan on Nov. 20. It will provide all of the necessary electricity and steering for the fledgling space station until a permanent control module can be launched next summer. Minutes after Zarya's capture, Cabana called down that two antenna on the module were still undeployed a Russian flight controller had feared. The antenna must be fully deployed in order for Zarya's manual docking system to work; that system won't be needed before next summer, official said. The only other problem wa with a Zarya battery; the astronaut took up a replacement part. The 36-foot, 25,000-pound Unity, the first American-made component, will serve a a connecting passageway, or vestibule, for future module. It wa crucial that Zarya and Unity be joined; if they could not be connected with the robot arm, NASA would have sent out two spacewalking astronaut to manually fit them together. In all, three spacewalks are planned for Endeavour's 12-day flight, not only to hook up electrical connection between the two module but to install handrail and other tool for future crew. The joined module will be released from Endeavour once all of the work is completed. NASA estimate 43 more launch and 159 more spacewalks will be needed after this mission to assemble the entire orbiting complex. Once completed, the 16-nation space station will have a mass of 1 million pound, be longer than a football field, and house up to seven astronaut and cosmonaut. A last-minute alarm forced NASA to halt Thursday's launching of the space shuttle Endeavour, on a mission to start assembling the international space station. Another attempt for Endeavour and it crew of six astronaut is scheduled for Friday at 3:36 am. This wa the first time in three year, and 19 flight, that a shuttle countdown had been stopped after the spaceship wa fueled and the crew aboard the craft and ready to go. The uncommon delay prompted frown and furrowed brow here, although official stressed that it wa entirely warranted. We want to err on the conservative side, Ralph Roe, launch director at the Kennedy Space Center, said at a news conference after the sudden halt of the countdown just 19 second before liftoff. Everything had been going smoothly for a rare nighttime launching, set for 3:58 on Thursday morning. The weather, forecast to be iffy, turned out to be fine, and the sky wa alight with a nearly full moon. But the length of the so-called launching window wa, a planned, unusually short only 10 minute. That brevity wa a result of Endeavour's having to rendezvous with a space-station part that Russia put into orbit last month. The show-stopper arose about four minute before liftoff when the computer in the space shuttle set off a master alarm. Controllers studied the data and discovered a momentary pressure drop on one of the hydraulic system that control the movement of the shuttle's engine and it rudder and other flight surface. Officials eventually decided that the pressure drop wa insignificant, and they resolved to press ahead. But by then it wa too late: time had run out for one of the procedure needed to keep the shuttle's fuel supercold. So the countdown wa aborted just 19 second from blastoff. The six astronaut began to emerge from the shuttle an hour later and ultimately headed for bed to rest up for another attempt early Friday. ","On Friday the shuttle Endeavor carried six astronauts into orbit to start building an international space station.The launch occurred after Russia and U.S. officials agreed not to delay the flight in order to orbit closer to MIR, and after a last-minute alarm forced a postponement.On Sunday astronauts joining the Russian-made Zarya control module cylinder with the American-made module to form a 70,000 pounds mass 77 feet long.NASA estimates 43 more launches and 159 more space walks are needed to assemble the complex.When completed the 16-nation space station will be longer than a football field.It will be used to study adaptation to space flight.","Russia and NASA jointly decided against a Russian cost-cutting proposal to orbit the 2nd space station, a 16-country cooperative project, closer to Mir, citing complexity, risk, and bad sun angles.After 5 years of assembly, the research station will house 7 people.A 12-day shuttle mission will attach the US Unity module to the Russian Zarya, already in orbit.Thursday's launch was delayed by a pressure drop.A 2nd attempt Friday was perfect.Unity was attached to Zarya in a blind docking using cameras and computer images.Electrical and cable connections come next.Unity will serve as a passageway for future modules.Two Zarya antennas failed to deploy.","After discarding a suggested change of orbit, the Russian Space Agency went ahead with plans to launch its Zarya module of the international space station on Nov. 20, 1998.Although delayed for a day, U.S. plans to launch the space shuttle Endeavour carrying the U.S. module Unity and six astronauts were carried out on Dec. 4.The astronauts' job was to connect Unity with the already-orbiting Zarya as the first step in assembling 100 major components of the planned space station.Using the shuttle's 50-foot robot arm, the two modules were joined setting the stage for a spacewalk by two astronauts the next day to attach electrical connectors and cables.","The International Space Station when completed will have a million pound mass and be longer than a football field.It will house up to seven space explorers.The initial assembly of space station components involves linking the US Unity, carried into space by the shuttle Endeavour, with the Russian Zarya.The Russians had asked for a different launch profile in order to be able to transfer equipment from its MIR station, but that was not possible.Endeavour astronauts successfully completed the complicated maneuvers to join the two space objects.NASA estimates that 43 more launches will be required to completely assemble the 16-nation space station."
33,"Making their first collective decision about monetary policy, the 11 European nation launching a common currency on Jan. 1 cut interest rate Thursday in a surprise move that won market confidence. Ten of the 11 country joining European economic union dropped their key interest rate to 3 percent, with Portugal making the most significant plunge, from 3.75 percent. Austria made the smallest cut, from 3.2 percent. The exception wa Italy, which cut from 4 to 3.5 percent. It is expected to drop to the common rate by the time the euro is launched. Unifying the interest rate is a critical step in laying the groundwork for monetary union, and analyst generally expected rate to settle at around the level of Germany's, 3.3 percent before the cut, now 3 percent. However, interest rate level had become a contentious political issue with center-left government in Germany and France pushing for rate cut to help spur growth and combat unemployment, stuck at 10.9 percent in the nation adopting the euro. The head of the European Central Bank that will set monetary policy for the euro nation, Wim Duisenberg, again on Thursday suggested government should reform rigid labor market to create job, and not pressure him to cut rate. The remark in Brussels before the cut were made gave no hint that a rate drop wa imminent, but made clear his resistance to political pressure wa a strong a ever. So strong, in fact, that Dutch Finance Minister Gerrit Zalm said he had feared the bank would delay the decision. What had been feared wa that, in order to prove it independence, the ECB would go against it own analysis and would wait longer, which would have been nonsensical, Zalm said. Hans Tietmeyer, who run the German Bundesbank on which the ECB is modeled, hinted the rate cut wa designed to boost confidence in the new currency, dampened by global economic crisis and Europe's worsening outlook. The coordinated rate cut could lead to a reduction in the current pessimism and a reduction in financial market turbulence, Tietmeyer said. The cut seemed to have the desired impact. Frankfurt's main index closed up 2.1 percent, while France's wa up 1.8 percent. The cut also boosted market in Spain, Belgium, Italy and even Britain, which is not among the nation launching the euro. The reaction is, `Oh good, they're doing a little bit to prop up the euro economy.' But confidence ha taken quite a hit across Europe recently, and I think further action from the ECB will be needed next year, maybe down to 2.5 percent, James Mitchell, senior London-based strategist with Nomura. An economist at the Banque Bruxelles Lambert, Liesbeth Van de Craen, said the cut were timely. We are clearly headed for a slowdown, she said. Until recently, Europe's economy had held out relatively well against damage from Asia and Russia's economic crisis and unstable financial market. But just two day ago, Duisenberg painted the bleakest picture yet of Europe's economy, warning growth will likely slow to 2.5 percent next year from earlier expectation of 3 percent. The rate cut may help. By making it cheaper to borrow money, rate cut can lead to more investment and new business, making it le worthwhile to save and inducing people to spend. That expands the economy. The 11 country launching the euro are Austria, Belgium, Ireland, Italy, Finland, France, Germany, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Spain and Portugal. Wim Duisenberg, the head of the new European Central Bank, said in an interview published Wednesday that he won't step down after completing half his term a earlier agreed. I had hoped you wouldn't ask me that question. The answer is no, Duisenberg told the Le Monde daily, which had asked him if he would step down after four year on the job. Duisenberg wa named this spring a head of the new European Central Bank, which will govern the policy of the euro, the new single currency which go into effect Jan. 1. France surprised it euro partner by proposing it central banker, Jean-Claude Trichet, at the last minute for the job Duisenberg wa expected to secure easily. Although he wa elected easily, Duisenberg agreed to step down after four year of his eight year term although he ha since said no such gentleman's agreement exists. Duisenberg told Le Monde, a newspaper that fervently ha backed the euro, that the the introduction of the new currency is the most significant step so far toward European unification. However, he said that he would like to see further political integration, especially in the area of foreign tax and social policy. China made trading in the euro official Monday, announcing authorization for the European common currency's use in trade and financial dealing starting Jan. 1. The expected announcement from the central People's Bank of China and the State Administration of Foreign Exchange, carried by the official Xinhua News Agency, also authorized the opening of euro account. Financial institution, enterprise and individual in China can accept and use the euro in economic, trade and financial exchange with 11 member of the European Union effective January 1, 1999, Xinhua reported. In addition, they can convert, use and open the euro account, it said. Chinese official have said the government may convert a proportion of it dlrs 145 billion worth of foreign exchange reserve into the euro after the currency's Jan. 1 debut. The 11 country launching the common currency are Austria, Belgium, Ireland, Italy, Finland, France, Germany, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Spain and Portugal. The annual inflation rate in the 11 nation that adopt the euro a their shared currency on Jan. 1 fell to 0.9 percent in November, the European Union's statistic agency reported Wednesday. The fall continued the steady decline of inflation in the euro-zone over the past year. Annual inflation stood at 1 percent in October and 1.6 percent in November 1997, according to Eurostat's monthly report. In the 15 nation EU a a whole, inflation fell to 1 percent in November compared to 1.5 percent in the United States and 0.8 percent in Japan. Germany, France, Italy, Spain, the Netherlands, Belgium, Austria, Portugal, Finland, Ireland and Luxembourg are set to adopt the euro a a common currency at midnight on New Year's Eve. The latest figure may hint at trouble ahead for the euro-zone with significant increase over the year in Portugal and Ireland. With the European Central Bank setting a common interest rate for the whole bloc, some economist fear the low rate designed to boost core EU economy like France and Germany may bring overheating in smaller nation with faster growth. There wa good news for Greece which wa kept out of the euro-zone for failing to meet economic condition for joining, including low inflation. It's rate wa 3.9 percent in November down from 5 percent a year before. Greece hop to join the euro-zone in 2001. Denmark, Sweden and Britain decided to stay out of the euro for political reason. Eurostat gave the following rate for November 1998, with November 1997 in brackets: Sweden, 0.1 (2.7); France, 0.2 (1.4); Germany, 0.6 (1.4); Austria, 0.5 (1.1); Luxembourg, 0.5 (1.5); Belgium, 0.6 (1.3 percent); Denmark, 1.1 (1.6); Netherlands, 1.5 (2.5); Finland, 0.9 (1.8); Britain, 1.4 (1.9); Spain, 1.4 (1.9); Italy, 1.7 (1.8); Portugal, 2.6 (1.9); Ireland, 2.2 (1.1); Greece, 3.9 (5). In his most candid remark yet on the economy, European Central Bank President Wim Duisenberg said Friday that growth appears to be slowing in the 11 country adopting the EU common currency or euro on Jan. 1. Despite an area-wide survey that suggested a moderation in the pace of growth, Duisenberg said domestic demand will continue to boost the economy. He pointed also to a gradual improvement in labor market condition a supporting growth, a well a interest-rate cut toward the 3.3 percent level of the euro-zone's lowest rate country. Duisenberg, who spoke at an event in London, said the Dec. 1 and Dec. 22 meeting of the Central Bank's policy-making body will gauge the outlook for inflation and the EU economy. The bank, which will set monetary policy for the currency bloc, ha been under pressure from politician to keep interest rate low to help boost growth and create job. While inflation is at it lowest level in decade just 1 percent in the euro-zone unemployment in the 11 nation remains stubbornly high at 10.9 percent. Struggling to avoid being sidelined in the Continent-wide equity market promised by Europe's soon-to-be-introduced single currency, French authority said Thursday that the Paris stock exchange would join an alliance between London and Frankfurt that is seen a the precursor of a pan-European market. The Bourse in Paris also announced that it would play host to a meeting Nov. 27 of nine other European exchange to discus the step and condition needed to create a unifying and competitive pan-European equity market. The two announcement show how the introduction of the currency, the euro, is reshaping Europe's financial landscape, requiring Europeans to think in Continental rather than national term in finance and business. And it suggested that exchange authority in Paris, ruffled by the announcement in July of a strategic alliance between the London Stock Exchange and the Deutsche Borse in Frankfurt, had not only abandoned an effort to set up a rival market but were also seeking to gain the initiative by organizing the Nov. 27 gathering. Some doubt remained, however, about the timing and technicality of the French entry into the alliance. Foreign Minister Dominique Strauss-Kahn said, Paris is joining this alliance with the creation from January 1999 of a joint company. However, official in London and Frankfurt who welcomed the idea in principle declined to say whether the timing and the arrangement were a far advanced a Strauss-Kahn implied. I'm afraid I can't confirm anything like that, a spokeswoman at the London Stock Exchange said. The appearance are well ahead of the reality at this point, said an American banker, who spoke on the condition of anonymity. Not only that, the notion of a Europe-wide exchange raise technical question about the compatibility not just of trading system but also of the regulation governing stock market operation in the country that will use the euro beginning in January. That ha led some analyst to forecast that a pan-European exchange could not be up and running before 2000. There are an awful lot of issue to be resolved, the American banker said. The euro is to be introduced for electronic trading of equity, bond and future and for intergovernmental transfer. Notes and coin the pocket money that shopper and traveler will carry will be introduced only in 2002. Initially, the currency will group 11 European nation in a euro zone, leaving Britain, Denmark, Sweden and Greece on the outside. With it concentration of banking and trading, however, London is expected to continue a the main market center. The prospect ha heightened pressure for consolidation among exchange. Stock market official in Milan, Madrid, Amsterdam and Brussels have indicated they would be interested in joining the London-Frankfurt alliance, which will initially create a single point of liquidity for trading in British and German blue-chip issue. The London exchange estimate that a pan-European stock exchange would group together company with a market capitalization of $5.5 trillion, compared with $8.7 trillion on the New York Stock Exchange. The Paris Bourse, the third largest of the European exchange and the last major holdout toward a pan-European market, said that it had also invited official from exchange in Zurich and Stockholm to attend the Nov. 27 meeting. A spokeswoman said official from the London Stock Exchange would be at the meeting. Also Thursday, the New York Mercantile Exchange and the International Petroleum Exchange here acknowledged that they were considering a merger that would bring together the two biggest energy future market. Discussions began in July, and the exchange have formed a working group to study a merger. They already cooperate in the development of a system intended to coordinate after-hours electronic trading. Palm Pilot in one hand, cellular phone in the other, Jean-Marc Routiers, 26, wa juggling business call halfway between London and Paris. When his phone went dead a the high-speed Eurostar train pulled into the underwater tunnel that link England to the Continent, the London-based French banker loosened his Italian silk tie and introduced himself. I definitely describe myself a a European, he said in the fluent English he perfected working at an Australian bank. I may get sentimental when they play the Marseillaise, but for all the practical thing, I see myself a a citizen of Europe. I like the lifestyle in France, but I don't make my living there. The year 1999 is the official start-up date of the euro, the common European currency that will unite 11 country monetarily. But throughout Europe, a different kind of integration ha already taken root. Routiers, who wa spending a day in Paris to meet with his bank's French client, is at the vanguard of a new generation of Europeans who do not have to brace themselves for a shock in the new year. Mobile, fluent in several language and aggressively non-nationalistic, they are already living the kind of borderless, cosmopolitan existence that the single European currency is supposed to advance. They do not share their parents' memory of World War II or their parents' sense of national identity. People worry when they hear talk of a common European defense policy because it suggests that at the end of the day, we have one government, said Kleon Papadopoulos, a Greek banker based in London. Countries are afraid to lose their sovereignty, but I don't see it a a bad thing. If a government is good, stable and efficient, who care if it is based in Berlin or Athens? Papadopoulos, 36, who studied business in the United States and Britain, could serve a a model for the new Europeans. He work for a Swiss bank in London, speaks Greek, English and French, and in the past year ha traveled, among other place, to Belgium, the United States, Cuba, Switzerland and Italy. Like hundred of thousand of other Europeans, he chose London and it busy financial market a the best place to work. He said he doe not feel a if he life in England. He life in London, the clubhouse of financial Europe. And membership ha it privilege. Papadopoulos life in the fashionable Knightsbridge area, drive a Porsche he bought in Brussels, and work out at the fashionable gym of the Carleton Towers. I went to the London School of Economics in 1984, and the only other `foreigners' I met were from the Middle East, he say. Now friend and co-worker are Italian, French, Greek, Spanish, German, even Russian. You feel it everywhere. The street are jammed with foreigner. Not tourist people who live and work here. Baby-boomers in Europe often describe themselves a the 1968 generation, weaned on the protest and social turmoil that convulsed European society 30 year ago. Less dramatic but equally significant wa a 1968 law guaranteeing freedom of movement within what were then the six country of the Common Market. A Frenchman could work in Holland, an Italian could work in Germany without a permit. Back then some economist dourly predicted huge migration, particularly of unskilled laborer moving from southern country to the more prosperous north. Actually, a huge industry like steel shrank in the 1970s and '80s, so did the job opportunity for working-class Europeans. There are 15 country within what is now the European Union, but only a small percentage of their citizen have moved to other country, according to estimate prepared by Eurostat. Those who do mostly find job in the service industry a waiter, maid or garbage collector. There are still legal barrier preventing most doctor, lawyer and academic from finding work in other country. So far the European Union ha been most profitably put to use by white-collar business executive who eagerly followed career opportunity across national border, time zone and language barrier. Twenty-five year ago that kind of mobility wa the preserve of a far smaller elite, the top executive of major company or multinational corporation. Technology, from high-speed train to the ever-evolving apparatus of business lap-top computer, cell phone, fax machine ha made European mobility accessible to mid-level manager, young entrepreneur and even student. Cable television, which allows Germans to watch Italian game show or Swedes to watch French news program, ha spread the Zeitgeist to the mass. This year Superga, an Italian brand of sport clothes and shoe, opened a major advertising campaign with a series of magazine ad that show fashionable young people saucily cavorting with European leader a leggy young woman push her bicycle up the step of the Elysee Palace to greet President Jacques Chirac, a young man playfully stick his tongue out the window of the plane of the former German chancellor, Helmut Kohl. This kind of ad would not have been possible five or 10 year ago, said Aldo Cernuto, executive creative director of the Milan office of Pirella Gottsche Lowe, an international advertising agency. Now European unification is on the TV all the time; it ha seeped into people's unconscious. Even people who do not care about politics recognize the face of a Tony Blair or Jacques Chirac. Ten year ago, very few people did. According to the European Union, Britain ha twice a many EU citizen a France, but it is not the country with the highest concentration of resident from other European country. According to estimate based on survey prepared by Eurostat, nearly a third of the resident of tiny Luxembourg, which ha low unemployment and a high standard of living, are from other European country. Belgium, which ha the European Commission and NATO headquarters, is second, with 5.4 percent. Paradoxically, perhaps, Britain, the one major European nation that ha held off from joining the euro, is widely viewed a the nerve center of the new cosmopolitanism, headquarters for the New Europeans banker and business executive drawn by London's financial district, a more flexible bureaucracy and the universality of the English language. Perhaps just a surprisingly, London also serf a an example of another le obvious aspect of European cosmopolitanism the breakdown of certain social barrier. Studying abroad wa once a privilege reserved to the son and daughter of Europe's elite. Now the European Union ha a 12-year-old scholarship program, called Socrates-Erasmus, that this year allowed 200,000 European university student 5 percent of the EU's entire university population to study in other country within the Union for up to a year, free. In the last 20 year, business school in Europe have multiplied, and most offer U.S.-style MBA program that teach an American approach to business. This too ha allowed a measure of meritocracy to creep into European business. Juergen Schrempp, the head of Daimler, started a a car mechanic, noted Stephen Szabo, a professor of European Affairs at the Johns Hopkins University School for International Studies in Washington. That would have been unthinkable in Germany 20 year ago. Social mobility, moreover, is fueled by movement. When people transfer to another country, they find it easier to shed the psychological or cultural trapping of home. I could never have the kind of job I have had I stayed in Paris, Routier explained. France is still very hierarchical. Bosses want to know where you went to school, what your father doe. In London, none of that matter a long a you make money. Many Britons still view their country a weighed down by heavy class distinction. For example, Tony Smith, 36, editor of several Portuguese magazine in Lisbon, seized an opportunity to study in Vienna 14 year ago, and never looked back. He ha lived all over Europe, and is fluent in Portuguese, Spanish, German, French and Serbo-Croatian. His father, a car mechanic, had not traveled out of Britain until 1992. Smith said he could never have succeeded a well had he stayed home. I didn't go to public school or Oxbridge, he explained. I'm not saying it impossible, but it would have been much more difficult in England. Yet Continental Europeans who flock to London find themselves bypassing English society and joining a cosmopolitan world where birth and breeding do not matter a much. Ildiko Iliffe, 30, chose to work in London to escape the sexism she encountered on the Continent. Mrs. Iliffe, who is Hungarian, speaks fluent English, German, French and Italian, and met her Canadian husband, Roger Iliffe, 30, while both were attending the University of Bocconi business school in Milan in 1995. Like his wife, Iliffe speaks four language and ha lived and traveled all over the world. She work on the Eastern European desk of a British bank; he work for a major international consulting firm. Originally they planned to work in Italy, but Mrs. Iliffe said the prevailing attitude towards working woman there made it impossible for her to find a good a job. I went to job interview at Italian bank and they only asked me about my husband's job, she said with a grimace. And they made it clear that they were afraid I would get pregnant and ask for maternity leave. Philippe Haspeslagh, 48, a professor at Insead, the prestigious international business school in Fontainebleau, outside Paris, called Mrs. Iliffe's choice cherry-picking choosing the best deal for herself. As he put it, If they cannot find what they want in one country, they can pick up and seek it elsewhere. Twenty-five year ago, Haspeslagh wa a pioneer when he did the same thing. A Belgian who studied business at Harvard, he life and teach in France and doe consulting work all over Europe, from Sweden to the Czech Republic. The message on his cell phone is in three language French, Flemish and English. His student, a generation behind him, see nothing exceptional in his transnationalism. These Europeans form an advance guard that is still relatively small in number, but expert say they carry a disproportionate influence on their society. In Germany, for example, it is the business people who are pushing ahead with change and pulling politician along behind them kicking and screaming, Szabo said. They are looking at a larger market and feel the competitive pressure of globalization. Politicians are responding to a domestic constituency. They are answering to an international one. In a surprise move, nation adopting the new European currency, the euro, dropped key interest rate Thursday, effectively setting the rate that will be adopted throughout the euro zone on Jan. 1. Ten of the 11 country adopting the euro dropped their interest rate to 3 percent. Italy dropped to 3.5 percent from 4 percent. The coordinated move wa a key step in preparing for economic union. Setting a common interest rate had been a particularly contentious issue a center-left government in Germany and France pressed for lower rate to help boost growth and cut unemployment, a stubborn 10.9 percent in the euro zone. European Central Bank chief, Wim Duisenberg, gave no hint of the rate cut during a speech in Brussels earlier Thursday, instead suggesting that government should reform rigid labor market to create job. In Germany, the biggest economy in the future euro-zone, central banker cut the key interest rate to 3 percent from 3.3 percent. Rates before the cut had varied throughout the future currency zone, from 3.69 percent in Ireland to 3.2 percent in Austria. The European Central Bank said in a statement from it Frankfurt headquarters that the move wa decided during a meeting Tuesday of it the policy-making governing council. The governing council comprises the 11 head of national central bank plus a six-member directorate, including the bank president Duisenberg. The joint reduction in interest rate ha to be seen a a de facto decision on the level of interest rate with which the (bank) will start . monetary union, the statement said, adding the 3-percent rate would be maintained for the foreseeable future. In Germany, central bank president Hans Tietmeyer said the move reflected the worsening outlook for European economy, and wasn't a capitulation to political pressure Finance Minister Oskar Lafontaine. It's not a dramatic step. It wasn't in response to political pressure, Tietmeyer said, referring to Germany's cut. The coordinated rate cut could lead to a reduction in the current pessimism and a reduction in financial market turbulence, he said. But Tietmeyer, head of the bank on which the ECB is modeled, promised that the rate cut doe not signal the start of a volatile monetary policy. It's not a shift from the Bundesbank's steady-hand policy, he said. Growth in Europe ha been hit by the Asian and Russian economic crisis and turbulence on international financial market. Duisenberg ha said growth in the euro area country next year will be about 2.5 percent, lower than the 3 percent predicted earlier. Two day before the new euro currency go into effect for 11 European Union member, a growing number of Danes believe their country should take part, according to a poll published Tuesday. The survey by the Megaphone polling institute said 54 percent of the 1,009 people surveyed favor Denmark's participation, while 36 percent oppose that. The remaining 10 percent were undecided. The poll, conducted Dec. 18-22, wa broadcast by TV2 channel. Denmark is one of four EU country staying out of the monetary union for the time being. After voter in 1992 rejected the Maastricht treaty that established the system, Denmark won opt-out clause. The treaty then wa approved. Danish voter traditionally have been lukewarm supporter of the EU. Although many politician support the unified currency, they have been wary about bringing the issue to voter again. A poll published last October showed 46 percent of Danes favored the single currency, while 44 percent were opposed. It would take another national referendum for Denmark to adopt the new currency. The government ha said it ha no plan to hold a referendum before the year 2001. Europe's dream of monetary union becomes reality Thursday when 11 nation irrevocably lock their currency together to form the euro and create an economic giant whose boundary stretch from beyond the Arctic Circle to the shore of the Mediterranean. The euro's birth is being hailed a a historic turning point in international finance and is arguably the greatest single step in the drive to create a united Europe from the ruin of World War II. This Dec. 31, 1998, will be one of the great date in the history of the 20th century, French Finance Minister Dominique Strauss-Kahn, told France Info radio. It's the beginning of a new era. On what Europeans are calling E-day, economic and finance minister from the 11 nation will huddle at European Union headquarters to agree to the rate at which German mark, Italian lira and the rest are absorbed into euro. Strauss-Kahn said the euro would likely be worth 6.56 to 6.57 French franc. ","Eleven countries were to adopt a common European currency, the euro, on Dec. 31, 1998.In November and December there were various reactions.France made moves toward a pan-European equity market.Ten of the countries quickly cut interest rates causing fear of overheating in some economies.In Denmark, which had earlier rejected the euro, a majority was now in favor.And in faraway China, the euro was permitted in financial exchanges.Whatever the outcome, the euro's birthday, Dec. 31, 1998, would be an historical date.Some saw it as a step towards political union while others already considered themselves as citizens of Europe.","Eleven European nations are forming a ""Euro zone"".Britain, Denmark, Sweden, and Greece are not part of it.Danes favor joining.The Euro became official for intergovernmental transfers on Dec 31, 1998, but bills and coins will not come until 2002.The Paris, London, and Frankfurt stock exchanges have formed an alliance.Euro nations cut interest rates and inflation fell to an average 0.9%. China has authorized use of the Euro in trade.The president of the European Central Bank warns that growth is slowing and that he plans to complete his term.The EU monetary action has given rise to the new mobile, multi-lingual, non-nationalistic European.","France's offer to host a financial meeting for nine other European nations is seen as a precursor to a pan-European market.It shows how the new currency, the euro, is reshaping Europe financially.Eleven European nations lowered key interest rates in preparation for the conversion.China made trading in euro official Monday when it accepted its use in trade and finance starting Jan. 1.Denmark and Sweden may not join the euro for political reasons.Some smaller nations may become unstable from a growing inflation decline.A new generation, already cosmopolitan, won't be shocked.The head of the new European Central Bank will not step down at half term.","On 1 Jan 1999, the euro, a currency serving 11 European nations, entered the world financial market.As time grew short, questions remained over the pan-European market.When the head--serving an 8-year term--of the European Central Bank, which governs the euro, expressed fear of a slowing economy, the nations simultaneously dropped interest rates, spurring the market.Annual inflation rates also were encouraging.Denmark, who along with Sweden and Britain eschewed the euro, was becoming interested.As a step to a unified Europe, the euro will well serve the new, mobile, multi-lingual, business generation and could portend an economic giant."
34,"Bent on revenge for earlier attack on church, mob set fire to four mosque in West Timor Monday after a protest and strike by thousand of Christians degenerated into a riot, the military and a Muslim leader said. A rampaging crowd also burned down a market and a Muslim school. Troops and riot police patrolled the street. There were no immediate report of serious injury or arrest a fighting between Muslims and Christians continued after dark, said a military officer who spoke by telephone on condition of anonymity. The violence in the Christian-dominated city of Kupang wa in retaliation for the burning and ransacking of 22 church by Muslim mob in the capital, Jakarta, on Nov. 22, when 14 people were killed. Islamic leader urged Indonesia's Muslim majority not to retaliate with more violence. Adurrahman Wahid, head of Indonesia's largest Muslim grouping, the 30 million-member Nahdlatul Ulama, accused provocateur of whipping up religious strife when the sprawling Southeast Asian nation is trying to head toward democracy. I hope Muslims . are not deceived by such provocation, said Wahid, who ha been pushing for religious unity. West Timor share the same island a troubled East Timor, a former Portuguese territory dominated by Roman Catholicism and invaded by Indonesia in 1975. Christians, mostly Protestants, dominate Kupang, about 1,875 kilometer (1,172 mile) southeast of the Indonesian capital. However, a sizable Muslim minority also life there. The Kupang riot broke out after thousand of Christians staged a peaceful strike and street protest against the Jakarta church attack. Most office and shop were closed in the city of 120000, the capital of East Nusa Tenggara province, whose governor called for calm. Organizers of Monday's strike had called for a non-violent day of mourning. However, resident said fire broke out in three mosque after rival gang pelted each other with rock. Indonesia is the world's most populous Islamic nation. About 90 percent of Indonesia's 202 million people are Muslims, with the rest following Christian, Hindu, Buddhist or other faith. Religious diversity based on a belief in God is enshrined in the national philosophy, known a Pancasila, adopted when Indonesia declared independence from Dutch colonial rule in 1945. The upsurge in religious violence follows month of riot and protest in many part of Indonesia. Social tension in the sprawling Southeast Asian nation have intensified a it grapple with it worst economic crisis in decade. There is also political turmoil a student protester demand greater democracy after 32 year of authoritarian rule by former President Suharto, who wa forced to quit following deadly riot in May. Ismalil Hasan Metareum, head of the Muslim-dominated opposition United Development Party, urged his follower not to hit back. More than 100,000 party supporter filled a sport stadium in Jakarta Sunday at the opening of a four-day convention. Religious strife erupted recently in the eastern part of the main island of Java, where more than 150 people, many of them Islamic cleric, have been murdered, apparently by rival Muslim group. Many of the dead were accused of practicing black magic. Representatives of exiled East Timorese pro-independence group said Friday that Indonesian troop attacked unarmed civilian in a village in the disputed Southeast Asian territory, killing one East Timorese and wounding 22 others. The report could not be independently confirmed, and Indonesian official were not immediately available for comment. The attack took place Tuesday near Cailaco in East Timor, a former Portuguese colony, according to a statement issued by the pro-independence Christian Democratic Union of East Timor. Placido do Santos, a 28-year-old farmer, wa tortured and killed by the Indonesian military during the attack, the statement, which cited resistance source in East Timor's capital, Dili. The statement, released in the Portuguese capital of Lisbon, also said that 22 people were injured and 26 were missing. The name, age and occupation of the villager were listed. Roque Rodrigues, a Lisbon spokesman for the Socialist Party of Timor, another pro-independence group, said he had corroborated the report with six source inside East Timor and said he had no reason to doubt the truth of the statement. The United Nations, which is brokering talk between Lisbon and Jakarta over the territory's political future, still regard Portugal a the administering power in East Timor. The half-island territory lie some 2,000 kilometer (1,200 mile) southeast of Jakarta. Protesters on Sunday urged Australian military leader to identify Indonesian army officer trained here to allow closer monitoring of human right abuse in East Timor. The Australian military hold joint training exercise with Indonesian troop, including the elite commando unit accused ot atrocity in East Timor. In Queensland, about 100 activist gathered outside the Canungra Land Warfare Center, south of Brisbane, to mark the 23rd anniversary of the Indonesian invasion of East Timor. It is a peaceful protest against Australia training Indonesian soldier, spokesman Jason McLeod said. The protester wanted Australia to cut all military tie with Indonesia despite Defence Minister John Moore's recent announcement that joint exercise would resume, he said. The Australian government ha repeatedly refused to allow the Indonesians trained here to be identified, McLeod said. But we are demanding they be named along with their unit and battalion number because this will allow closer monitoring of human right issue, he said. McLeod said 40,000 East Timorese were killed by Japanese soldier for protecting Australian commando during World War II. When they finally left the country the Australians distributed leaflet saying they would never forget the people of East Timor, he said. The protester wanted to remind Australia's current soldier of that pledge. After Portugal abandoned it former colony in East Timor in 1975, Indonesia invaded it and annexed it the following year. The United Nations refuse to recognize the annexation a legitimate; Australia is one of the few nation that recognizes Indonesian sovereignty over East Timor. Representatives of exiled East Timorese pro-independence group said Friday that Indonesian troop attacked unarmed civilian in a village in the disputed Southeast Asian territory, killing one East Timorese and wounding 22 others. The attack took place Tuesday near Cailaco in East Timor, a former Portuguese colony, according to a statement issued by the pro-independence Christian Democratic Union of East Timor. Placido do Santos, a 28-year-old farmer, wa tortured and killed by the Indonesian military during the attack, the statement claimed. Jose Pau Lelo, 38, Rosito Borges, 35, and Leao Soares, 50, were in a coma due to injury they sustained in the attack, according to the statement which cited resistance source in East Timor's capital Dili. The statement, released in the Portuguese capital Lisbon, also said 19 men were wounded, eight seriously, and 26 others were missing. The name, age and occupation of the villager were listed. There wa no independent confirmation of the attack, and Indonesian official were wa not immediately available for comment. Indonesia invaded East Timor in Dec. 1975, following Portugal's colonial rule, and annexed it a month later. Indonesian troop have since then been fighting a small band of pro-independence guerilla. Roque Rodrigues, a Lisbon spokesman for the National Council of Timorese Resistance, said he also had corroborated the report with six source inside East Timor and said he had no reason to doubt the truth of the statement. The United Nations, which is brokering talk between Lisbon and Jakarta over the territory's political future, still regard Portugal a the administering power in East Timor. The half-island territory lie some 2,000 kilometer (1,200 mile) southeast of Jakarta. Indonesia on Tuesday denied claim that it troop massacred more than 40 East Timorese recently, and criticized Portugal for suspending U.N.-sponsored talk over the future of the troubled territory. Foreign Minister Ali Alatas questioned whether Portugal truly wanted to settle the problem of East Timor, a former Portuguese colony, the official Antara news agency reported. Portugal suspended the talk with Indonesia in New York last week following report of a massacre of dozen of East Timorese rebel in a series of clash with Indonesian troop. East Timor's spiritual leader, Roman Catholic Bishop Carlos Belo, ha said that between 30 and 40 people were reportedly killed near the village of Alas and Same, 40 kilometer (25 mile) southeast of Dili, East Timor capital. The 1996 Nobel Peace Prize winner said that so far, only 11 body had been identified. Alatas said the claim of a massacre were not true. The Portuguese delegation, without checking the truth of the information, decided to temporarily suspend the ongoing dialogue, Antara quoted Alatas a saying. The New York-based group Human Rights Watch said some death had occurred in fight between rebel and Indonesian force. However, it could not confirm claim that dozen of people had been killed. Alatas said it wa the third time that Portugal had unilaterally suspended talk over East Timor since 1986. Based on this, Alatas said, Indonesia wa skeptical about Portugal's sincerity, Antara reported. In response, Portugal's Foreign Ministry accused Indonesia of breaking promise to reduce it military presence in East Timor and called for a permanent UN. mission in the disputed territory. Unfortunately, Indonesia ha increased it deployment and the brutality of it military action in East Timor, said ministry spokesman Horacio Cesar. Meanwhile, about 500 student ended their noisy but peaceful rally outside the office of East Timor's governor in Dili Tuesday after receiving promise that the reported killing would be investigated. In a dialogue with the students' representative, Governor Abilio Osorio Soares and military chief Col. Suhartono Suratman agreed to set up a team to make a thorough investigation. The group earlier had spent one night occupying the provincial Parliament and vowed to stay at the governor's office. The student also demanded a total withdrawal of Indonesian soldier from East Timor. Meanwhile, an unidentified man, believed to be a rebel, wa reported to have shot and wounded Izildo Pereira, a civilian, in Baucau, 100 kilometer (62 mile) east of Dili. Izildo, 30, who wa shot Sunday, wa being treated at a military hospital in Dili. Indonesia invaded East Timor in 1975 and annexed it the following year. The United Nations, however, doe not recognize Indonesia's claim. Before being suspended, the talk centered on an Indonesian offer to give East Timor autonomy in return for international recognition of Indonesian sovereignty there. In a decision welcomed a a landmark by Portugal, European Union leader Saturday backed call for a referendum to decide the fate of East Timor, the former Portuguese colony occupied by Indonesia since 1975. A definitive solution to the East Timor question will not be possible without free consultation to establish the real will of the East Timorese people, the 15 EU leader said in statement after their year-end summit. Portuguese Foreign Minister Jaime Gama said the statement marked the first time the EU had backed Lisbon's call for the East Timorese to vote on whether to opt for independence or remain under Indonesian rule. Indonesia ha resisted such call for a referendum and maintains thousand of troop to keep order in the half-island territory. The EU statement also urged Indonesia to bring about a real and substantial reduction in troop level and called for the establishment of a permanent UN. presence in East Timor. The leader repeated a demand that Indonesia release jailed Timorese rebel leader Xanana Gusmao, and all political prisoner. Indonesia invaded East Timor in 1975 a Portugal prepared to grant independence, and annexed it the following year. The United Nations doe not recognize Indonesian rule. JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) - As a UN. envoy trotted toward an Indonesian army helicopter, East Timorese protester spilled onto the runway tarmac and shouted their anger at nervous soldier. Sent to make peace in Indonesian-controlled East Timor, Jamsheed Marker's recent hasty departure from the troubled territory signaled how easily tension there can boil over. Yet Marker, who is visiting Indonesia to promote a U.N.-designed blueprint for autonomy in the former Portuguese colony, said Monday that both side in the bitter conflict were displaying a newfound taste for compromise. In an interview with The Associated Press, Marker admitted that a peaceful solution remains distant. But in a big step forward, he said, many separatist activist were no longer pressing for an immediate vote on independence. They don't want independence tomorrow, said Marker, who wa interviewed in a Jakarta hotel suite after his trip to East Timor. In other progress, Indonesia and Portugal will send diplomat to open interest section in each other's capital next month. Formal diplomatic relation, however, will not be resumed. Also in January, the two country are scheduled to embark on a new round of U.N.-sponsored peace talk in New York. Turmoil ha plagued East Timor ever since Indonesian troop invaded in 1975, unleashing a separatist rebel war and the resentment of a population pummeled by human right abuse. Talks were revived earlier this year after the ouster of authoritarian President Suharto, but difference remain over a definition of autonomy that would suit all party. Separatists want it to be transitional, while Indonesia is offering East Timorese partial control of their affair in exchange for international recognition of it sovereignty. Jakarta want to handle foreign, defense and financial affair. Fears are widespread that more unrest in East Timor could derail the negotiation. On Monday, Marker voiced his concern in a meeting with East Timor's jailed rebel chief, Xanana Gusmao. I said there wa a lot of tension in East Timor and that he and his people ought to do everything they can to reduce it, said Marker, a former Pakistani ambassador to the United Nations. Tempers flared but there wa no violence during protest timed for Marker's weekend trip to Dili, the seaside capital of the half-island territory of 800,000 people. On Sunday, separatist protester tore down a fence at the commercial airport and pushed past soldier with automatic rifle a they tried in vain to speak to Marker a he left. During a visit last year, Indonesian soldier killed two pro-independence demonstrator outside a hotel where Marker wa staying. Activists have alleged that Indonesia secretly ferried troop into East Timor in spite of pledge to reduce the number. Marker said Jakarta had advised him of troop rotation and that UN. staff were monitoring the situation. Marker wa scheduled to talk with Indonesian President BJ. Habibie on Tuesday and will leave Indonesia on Wednesday to prepare for another batch of meeting in the New Year. If you ask me. `Do you have a solution?' then the answer is, `I don't,' he said. But I think there are way of getting there and the first thing is to have peace and quiet. Taiwan's Foreign Ministry on Thursday blamed administrative negligence for an incident in which Nobel Peace Prize winner Josi Ramos-Horta wa left stranded at the airport for hour after being refused entry. Opposition supporter alleged the incident Wednesday night wa politically motivated. Ramos-Horta is an advocate of independence for Indonesian-controlled East Timor, and newspaper reported Taiwan had formerly barred him to avoid antagonizing Indonesia. But Ramos-Horta's previous persona non grata status had been ordered lifted by the Foreign Ministry in August, leaving no reason why he should have been refused entry by airport immigration when he came to town Wednesday night, ministry spokesman Roy Wu told a news conference. This incident accentuated the problem with administrative relation, it need to be improved. . It's a fact, Wu told a news conference. Ramos-Horta had a rough time Wednesday night. Immigration official would not let him in, then he tried to catch a flight out but missed the plane. Eventually, the Foreign Ministry intervened and let Ramos-Horta enter Taiwan. He went only a far a the airport hotel. Conflicting report indicate Ramos-Horta wa stuck at the airport for between four and seven hour. Ramos-Horta wa carrying a Portuguese passport, which should have permitted him visa-free entry to Taiwan for up to 14 day, newspaper said. The opposition Democratic Progressive Party alleged Ramos-Horta had been refused entry because he planned to speak on behalf of Chen Shui-bian's campaign to be re-elected a mayor of Taipei. Chen is Taiwan's most prominent DPP politician. This sort of incident show that Taiwan is just not qualified to be called a democratic nation, DPP Secretary-General Chiu Yi-jen told a news conference. Ramos-Horta sought to play down the incident before leaving town Thursday. I don't want to make a big problem out of it. I have been to many country. The only country that don't allow me in would be country like Iraq, Iran, he told reporter before catching an afternoon flight to attend a conference in Australia. Indonesia invaded East Timor in 1975 and annexed it the following year. The United Nations doe not recognize Indonesian claim to East Timor.

When they finally left the country the Australians distributed leaflet saying they would never forget the people of East Timor, he said. The protester wanted to remind Australia's current soldier of that pledge. After Portugal abandoned it former colony in East Timor in 1975, Indonesia invaded it and annexed it the following year. The United Nations refuse to recognize the annexation a legitimate; Australia is one of the few nation that recognizes Indonesian sovereignty over East Timor. Representatives of exiled East Timorese pro-independence group said Friday that Indonesian troop attacked unarmed civilian in a village in the disputed Southeast Asian territory, killing one East Timorese and wounding 22 others. The report could not be independently confirmed, and Indonesian official were not immediately available for comment. The attack took place Tuesday near Cailaco in East Timor, a former Portuguese colony, according to a statement issued by the pro-independence Christian Democratic Union of East Timor. Placido do Santos, a 28-year-old farmer, wa tortured and killed by the Indonesian military during the attack, the statement, which cited resistance source in East Timor's capital, Dili. The statement, released in the Portuguese capital of Lisbon, also said that 22 people were injured and 26 were missing. The name, age and occupation of the villager were listed. Roque Rodrigues, a Lisbon spokesman for the National Council of Timorese Resistance, another pro-independence group, said he had corroborated the report with six source inside East Timor and said he had no reason to doubt the truth of the statement. The United Nations, which is brokering talk between Lisbon and Jakarta over the territory's political future, still regard Portugal a the administering power in East Timor. The half-island territory lie some 2,000 kilometer (1,200 mile) southeast of Jakarta.

36,"Portuguese novelist Jose Saramago, whose capricious vision includes a section of Europe breaking off and floating out to sea, on Thursday wa named the winner of the 1998 Nobel Literature Prize. In it citation, the Swedish Academy said it gave the award to Saramago for work that with parable sustained by imagination, compassion and irony continually enables u to apprehend an elusory reality. Saramago, 75, wrote his breakthrough novel in 1982, Baltasar and Blimunda. Perhaps his best-known work is The Stone Raft, in which the Iberian Peninsula break off from Europe for supernatural reason and float off into the Atlantic. That device allows him to comment ironically about the authority and politician, perhaps especially about the major player in power politics. Saramago's exuberant imagination and playfulness have made him one of Portugal's most popular contemporary novelist, and his work have been translated into more than 20 language. In Blindness, his most recent work to be translated into English, a nameless man in a nameless country suddenly go blind, and the affliction quickly spread through the country grim tale of social collapse. In 1991's The Gospel According to Jesus Christ, God and the devli negotiate about evil, and Jesus try to back out of his crucifixion. Saramago's idiosyncratic development of his own resonant style of fiction give him a high standing . he invokes tradition in a way that in the current state of thing can be described a radical, the Academy said in the citation for the 7.6-million kronor (dlrs 978,000 prize). Saramago (pronounced sah-rah-MAH-go) is the fourth consecutive European to win the prestigious prize, and the first laureate to write in Portuguese. He had long been seen a one of the strongest potential candidate for the prize and the frequent medium query about his prospect contrasted with his quiet personality. I am skeptical, reserved, I don't gush, I don't go around smiling, hugging people, trying to make friend, he told The Associated Press in a recent interview. I just write. Saramago on Thursday had planned to leave Frankfurt, Germany, where he wa attending the international book fair for his home in the Canary Islands. But Portuguese state radio said he wa taken off the plane before departure and driven back to the fair, where a crowd wa waiting for him. The literature prize is one of five established by Alfred Nobel, the Swedish industrialist and inventor of dynamite. The prize have been awarded since 1901; a sixth prize, in economics, wa started in 1969. According to the term of Nobel's will, the literature prize is to recognize writing that work in an ideal direction. How to interpret that term ha been widely debated. The Nobel Prize over the year ha been given to writer with world-views stretching from the bleak futility of Samuel Beckett's work to the vivid epic of Iceland's Halldor Laxness. The prize even ha gone occasionally to writer who did not work in fiction or poetry, notably Winston Churchill and Bertrand Russell. Last year's prize went to Dario Fo, the Italian playwright whose work combine gut-busting comedy with acid social and political commentary. The 1996 winner wa the Polish poet Wislawa Szymborska, a shy and delicate and Fo is boisterous. The Swedish Academy doe not reveal who wa nominated or who it considered on it shortlist. Nominations can be made by previous laureate, professor of history and literature, member of the Academy and president of some national authors' organization. The Nobel Prize in Medicine winner will be announced Oct. 12, the physic and chemistry winner on Oct. 13, the economics laureate on Oct. 14 and the peace prize on Occt. 16. All the prize announcement are in Stockholm, except for the peace prize which is given in Oslo, Norway. All the prize are presented on Dec. 10, the anniversary of Nobel's death. Robert F. Furchgott, Louis J. Ignarro and Ferid Murad of the United States on Monday won the Nobel Medicine Prize. They were given the prize for their discovery concerning nitric oxide a a signaling molecule in the cardiovascular system, according to the citiation from the Karolinska lnstitute. Furchgott is a pharmacologist at the State University of New York in Brooklyn, Ignarro is at University of California-Los Angeles and Murad is at the University of Texas Medical School in Houston. The citation said it wa a senation that the simple, common air pollutant (nitric oxide), which is formed when nitrogen burn . could exert important function in the organism. Because of the research, we know today that nitric oxide act a a signal molecule in the nervous system, a a weapon against infection and a a regulator of blood pressure. The prize amount of 7.6 million kronor (dlrs 978,000) is divided equally among the three. Last year, the prize went to Stanley B. Prusiner of the University of California at San Francisco for his discovery of prion, the rogue protein identified a causing Mad Cow Disease. Winners generally aren't known outside the medical community, although the list of laureate contains a few familiar name including Ivan Pavlov, tuberculosis pioneer Robert Koch, and DNA researcher Francis Crick and James Watson. Generally, they are researcher who have made discovery that sound small on paper but carry large consequence. Among other well-known name to receive the prize is David Baltimore, although he shared the prize in 1975, long before becoming one of the world's most visible AIDS researcher. Alan Cormack of the United States and Sir Godfrey Hounsfield may not be familiar name, but what they won the prize for in 1979 is a term known by most patients: computer-assisted tomography or CAT scan. The medicine prize wa the second of the six Nobels to be announced this year. Last Thursday, the literature prize went to Portuguese novelist Jose Saramago. The physic and chemistry prize will be announced Tuesday, the economics prize on Wednesday and the peace prize on Friday. All the announcement are in Stockholm, except for the peace prize which is given in Oslo, Norway. The prize are presented on Dec. 10, the anniversary of the death of Alfred Nobel, the industrialist and inventor of dynamite whose will established the prize. Jose Saramago became the first writer in Portuguese to win the Nobel Prize for Literature on Thursday. His personal delight wa seconded by a burst of public elation in his homeland. Saramago, 75, and Portuguese said they were pleased the Swedish Academy had finally acknowledged the literary contribution of Portugal, a small country of 10 million people bordering Spain on Europe's southwestern Iberian Peninsula. It ha taken all of this century to win a Nobel Prize for the Portuguese language, Saramago said at the Frankfurt Book Fair, speaking through an interpreter. Saramago, a soft-spoken man known for his hard-edged and iconoclastic view, said he shared the honor with his country and he hoped winning the prize would make Portugal and it language more visible and audible. I'm personally very happy for myself. I'm also happy for my country, he said at the Frankfurt Book Fair in Germany where he wa engulfed by well-wisher offering rose. Back home, President Jorge Sampaio said the award wa a cause for great collective satisfaction. Prime Minister Antonio Guterres said the award wa above all a prize for Portugal and the Portuguese language which is spoken by 180 million worldwide, mostly in Brazil, but also in Portugal's five former colony in Africa. Saramago's controversial opinion and atheistic outlook have frequently clashed with the establishment and the general public. Even on the day he won the prize, the Vatican newspaper L'Osservatore Romano attacked the Swedish Academy's choice, describing Saramago a an old-school communist who had a substantially antireligious vision. Undersecretary of State Sousa Lara wa so upset by one of Saramago's novel in 1992 that he withdrew his name from Portugal's nominee for the European Literature Prize. At the time, Lara said Saramago's 1991 novel O Evangelho Segundo Jesus Cristo (The Gospel according to Jesus Christ) offended Portugal's Roman Catholic religious conviction and divided the country. The book describes a Christ who, subject to human desire, life with Mary Magdalene and try to back out of his crucifixion. I have not come to bring peace but the sword, said Saramago, an atheist, at the time. He retreated in disgust with his Spanish wife, Pilar del Rio, to his home in Lanzarote in Spain's Canary Islands. He ha never courted the kind of fame offered by literary prize, and his bluntness can sometimes offend. I am skeptical, reserved, I don't gush, I don't go around smiling, hugging people and trying to make friend, he once said. A gaunt man with wisp of white hair, Saramago wa born in Azinhaga, a small town near Lisbon. From a poor family, he never finished university but continued to study part-time while supporting himself a a metalworker. His first novel, published in 1947 Terra do Pecado, or Country of Sin wa a tale of peasant in moral crisis. It sold badly but won enough recognition to propel him from the welder's shop to a literary magazine. But for the next 18 year, Saramago, a communist who opposed the 41-year conservative dictatorship of Antonio Salazar, published only a few travel and poetry book while he worked a a journalist. He returned to fiction only after Salazar's regime wa toppled by a military uprising in 1974. Since the 1980s, he ha been one of Portugal's best-selling contemporary writer and his work have been translated into more than 20 language. He first won critical acclaim abroad with his 1982 historical fantasy Memorial do Convento, published in English in 1988 a Baltasar and Blimunda. It is set during the Catholic-inspired inquisition and explores the war between individual and organized religion, picking up Saramago's recurring theme of the loner struggling against authority. He is most frequently compared with Colombian writer Gabriel Garcia Marquez because his prose is often rooted in recognizable setting but at the same time tinged with magical element. The Nobel citation praised his work that with parable sustained by imagination, compassion and irony continually enables u to apprehend an elusory reality. Saramago remains a prominent nonconformist through his regular newspaper and radio commentary, though his view are always inspired by his deep concern for his fellow man. Blindness, his most recent book to be translated into English, is an unsettling allegory about the social meltdown a an inexplicable blindness sweep through society. This blindness isn't a real blindness, it's a blindness of rationality, he said. We're rational being but we don't behave rationally. If we did, there'd be no starvation in the world. In the 1989 The History of the Siege of Lisbon, a Lisbon proofreader mischievously insert the word not into a text on the 12th century capture of the Portuguese capital from the Moors, thereby fictionally altering the course of European history with a stroke of his pen. Such historical and literary mischief are Saramago trademark. In his 1986 book, The Stone Raft, the Iberian Peninsula snap off from the rest of the European continent and float off into the North Atlantic apparently in a metaphorical search for identity away from the standardizing nature of the European Union, of which Portugal and Spain are enthusiastic member. Saramago will receive the dlrs 978,000 prize on Dec. 10 in Stockholm. Former US. President Jimmy Carter, who seems a perennial Nobel Peace Prize also-ran, could have won the coveted honor in 1978 had it not been for strict deadline rule for nomination. That prize wa shared by Egyptian President Anwar Sadat and Israeli Prime Minister Menachem Begin for signing the Camp David peace accord. However, the five-member Norwegian award committee also wanted to honor Carter for brokering the pact, only to be foiled by their own rule. The Nobel committee wanted to give the prize to all three, said Geir Lundestad, the current committee's nonvoting secretary, said on Sunday. But Carter had not been nominated when the deadline ran out. Nominations postmarked by Feb. 1 are accepted for that year's prize. The committee can add it own nomination at it first meeting of the year, usually in early March. The Camp David accord were not signed until Sept. 17, 1978, about five week before that year's peace prize wa annouCkuld not give him the prize, the Norwegian committee recognized in the 1978 award citation the positive initiative taken by President Jimmy Carter. Lundestad said the committee, which work in deep secrecy in it five or six meeting a year, tried to find a loophole in the rule, which are overseen by the Swedish Nobel Foundation. The Nobel Prizes were endowed by Alfred Nobel, a Swedish industrialist whose 355 invention included dynamite. In his 1895 will, Nobel endowed the prize, and said the peace prize should be picked by a Norwegian committee and the rest by Swedish institution. Lundestad said the committee turned to the Swedish Nobel Foundation for advice on Carter because it wa a question of principle. Stig Ramel, a Swede who wa then director of the Nobel Foundation, advised against breaking the rule, Lundestad said by telephone. Normally, the committee refuse to discus past candidate in keeping with a strict policy of secrecy in which selection detail are sealed for 50 year. Lundestad made an exception because Ramel revealed the Carter dilemma in his 1994 memoir. Carter ha repeatedly been nominated for the Nobel prize for his consistent and wide-ranging peace effort. He is also among the 139 candidate for the prize being announced in Oslo on Friday. However, early speculation lean more toward someone involved in the Northern Ireland peace process, Czech President Vaclav Havel to mark the 30th anniversary of the Soviet invasion of his country, or a human right activist to mark the 50th anniversary of the UN. Human Rights Charter. While the committee wanted to honor Carter and could not, with hindsight some regretted the prize for other reason. Four year after Begin won the prize, the Israeli prime minister ordered an invasion of southern Lebanon in which thousand of civilian died. Kare Kristiansen, who served on the peace prize committee from 1991 to 1994, once said that, had the committee waited, Begin probably would not have won. There's room for a few more name on a 20th century honor roll of writer, and one will be added this week when the Swedish Academy announces the latest Nobel Literature laureate. Who is chosen and why stimulates animated conversation with reader a well a academic, critic and the author themselves. This year's winner or, possibly, winner will be announced Thursday, the Academy disclosed Tuesday. The joke you hear is that it go to people you never heard of, said Ian Jack, editor of London-based Granta literary magazine. But the Nobel, awarded most every year since 1901, also shine a light, usually deservedly, on wonderful writer few people have read, he added. His favorite include Trinidad-born VS. Naipaul, though he's convinced Naipaul probably won't win because of his dark . pessimistic and often scathing portrayal of post-colonial African culture. The academy keep it deliberation secret. Who is considered seriously, even who's nominated, isn't disclosed. A writer's nationality, by the term of the prize founder Alfred Nobel's will, is supposed to be irrelevant. Two can share the prize, though the last time that happened wa 1974. Winners are expected to personally receive it: award are not given posthumously. Looking at the process from afar, Harold Bloom, a member of the American Academy of Arts and Letters, said the award committee ha an unsettling record of selection that are nationally 'correct' and politically 'correct.' The winner list is prestigious, he concedes, but by no mean uniformly lustrous. Absolutely not! Outrageously not, he said in a telephone interview from New York. They include all kind of fifth-raters. . James Joyce never got one, for heaven's sake. Neither did Marcel Proust. Bloom's US. favorite include Cormac McCarthy, author of Blood Meridian; Philip Roth, author of American Pastoral; and John Ashbery, the best living poet. A review of recent winner may foreshadow this year's laureate. Seven of the past 10 were men doe that favor a woman? Two of the past three were poet doe that favor a prose writer? Four of the past 10 wrote in English, and the last three laureate are European. In comparison, only three Asian writer have ever won. Bei Dao is a personal favorite of mine, said Abe Harumasa, editor-in-chief of the Japanese literary magazine Bungei. The choice could be interpreted a being motivated partly by politics, given the poet's association with China's democracy movement, but it's clear he's a wonderful poet. Minoru Takeuchi, a professor of Chinese literature at Japan's prestigious Kyoto University, cited novelist Pa Kin and Xie Bing Xin a worthy. The latter is known for her portrayal of the struggle of Chinese woman. China, which translates and publishes the work of many Nobel winner, desperately want it first laureate, he added. Spain's Nobel hope are pinned on Francisco Ayala, 92, winner of this year's renowned Prince of Asturias prize, said Jose Maria Martinez Cachero, an author, university professor and secretary of the jury that selected Ayala. Other presumed Latin candidate are Peru-born Mario Vargas Llosa, a member of the 200-year-old Royal Spanish Language Academy, Martinez Cachero said, and Portugal's Jose Saramago, whose work have been translated into more than 20 language. For his part, Saramago, 75, said in a recent Associated Press interview that he's weary of speculation that this year, once again, he might win. Let's not get into that, he said. I just write. Jose Saramago, a 75-year-old Portuguese writer who took up literature relatively late in life and whose richly imaginative novel soon won him a following of loyal reader across Europe and vocal admirer in the United States, wa awarded this year's Nobel Prize in Literature Thursday by the Swedish Academy in Stockholm. A tall, balding man whose large, tinted glass often give him a mien of severity, Saramago is the first Portuguese-language writer and one of the first card-carrying Communists to become a Nobel Literature laureate. He is also the fourth successive European to win the prize, after Italy's Dario Fo in 1997, Poland's Wislawa Szymborska in 1996 and Ireland's Seamus Heaney in 1995. In it citation Thursday, the Swedish Academy praised Saramago who with parable sustained by imagination, compassion and irony continually enables u once again to apprehend an elusory reality. Although Saramago discount the influence of Latin American magical realism on his work, his novel often use the supernatural, allegorical, paradoxical and irrational a way of addressing complex question of faith and existence. Many of his novel are set against a backdrop of political or historical event, but it is his unwavering concern for individual fate that give his fiction it distinctive voice and independent character. His best-known book, all published in the United States, are Baltasar and Blimunda, The Year of the Death of Ricardo Reis, The Stone Raft and The History of the Siege of Lisbon. His latest book available in English, Blindness, in which all but one of his character mysteriously become blind, wa described a his symphonic new novel by Andrew Miller in The New York Times Book Review on Sunday. There is no cynicism and there are no conclusion, just a clear-eyed and compassionate acknowledgment of thing a they are, a quality than can only honestly be termed a wisdom, Miller, himself a novelist, wrote. We should be grateful when it is handed to u in such generous measure. Saramago learned of his award Thursday at Frankfurt airport, where he wa preparing to fly home via Madrid to Lanzarote in the Canary Islands after attending the Frankfurt Book Fair. Earlier this week, he participated in a round-table of Portuguese writer on the topic, Why I am still a Communist. He immediately returned to the fair where he wa received with cheer and bouquet of rose. I am personally very happy for myself, he said. I am also happy for my country. Later he told a news conference: The Portuguese language had to wait 100 year for this. There have to be way and mean of protecting the language so that it doe not become a museum, but is something that is alive. The writer's role is to protect it and work with it. The award wa also celebrated in Lisbon, where President Jorge Sampaio described it a recognition of Portuguese culture, while the local Communist leader, Carlos Carvalho, saw it a a credit to his own party. As a member of our party, he noted solemnly, Saramago make a great contribution to our ideal and to the struggle for social change. The laureate's fiction, though, is never overtly political. Saramago, whose body of work includes poetry, essay, play and a journal a well a 10 novel, is unusual for having emerged a a major literary figure only at the age of 60. His novel have since been translated into 30 language, selling particularly well in Portugal, Brazil, Spain, Italy and Germany. While he ha not been well known in the United States, his novel have always been critically well received there. For all his late blooming, though, Saramago long dreamed of becoming a writer. Born into a family of rural laborer and raised in Lisbon, he wa forced by poverty to leave school while a teen-ager and learn the trade of car mechanic. Yet he managed to publish a small novel at the age of 25. Later, he found work at a Lisbon publishing company, but the oppressive and censorial atmosphere of the Salazar dictatorship discouraged him from writing. It wa only after Portugal's April 1974 revolution that Saramago felt free to find his voice. A member of the Portuguese Communist Party since 1969, he served a editor of a Lisbon newspaper, Diario de Noticias, during an 18-month period when the left looked likely to seize power in Portugal. But an anti-Communist backlash in November 1975 forced him out of the newspaper and he began translating French text into Portuguese to make end meet. In the late 1970s, he also turned to novel, publishing three in succession in 1977, 1978 and 1980. But it wa in 1982, with Baltasar and Blimunda (Memorial do Convento in Portuguese), that he achieved his international breakthrough. This is a rich, multifaceted and polysemous text that at the same time ha a historical, a social and an individual perspective, the Swedish Academy noted Thursday. The insight and wealth of imagination to which it give expression is characteristic of Saramago's work a a whole. Set in 18th-century Portugal during the Inquisition, the book tell of the baroque effort of a war veteran, Baltasar, and a visionary, Blimunda, to escape to the heaven aboard a flying machine powered by human will captured by the hypersensory Blimunda. This fantastic story take place against the very real background of the tortuous construction of the massive Mafra Convent by thousand of men held in the grip of the Inquisition. When the novel wa published in the United States in 1987, Irving Howe acclaimed it a brilliant in The New York Times Book Review. Mr. Saramago is constantly present a a voice of European skepticism, a connoisseur of irony, Howe wrote. I think I hear in his prose echo of Enlightenment sensibility, caustic and shrewd. In his next novel, The Year of the Death of Ricardo Reis, which is also a homage to the great Portuguese poet Fernando Pessoa, who appears in it a a ghost, Saramago set his story in the early year of the Salazar dictatorship, with the tale following the romantic and sexual misadventure of a poet-physician. Writing in The New York Times, Herbert Mitgang called it a rare, old-fashioned novel at once lyrical, symbolic and meditative. Saramago, whose sense of literary freedom is evident in his unconventional punctuation and conflicting use of tense, sought a different form of freedom in The Stone Raft, where he imago the confusion unleashed when the Iberian peninsula suddenly break free from the rest of Europe and begin drifting toward the New World and threatens to collide with the Azores. To the delight of Britons, Gibraltar is left behind. Unsurprisingly, the bitter satire, The Gospel According to Jesus Christ, proved controversial, with God shown a using the innocently human Jesus to create a religion that ha spawned violence and intolerance. When a Lisbon jury picked the book a Portugal's entry for a 1992 European literary prize, the country's conservative government vetoed the choice a blasphemous. It wa then that Saramago decided to leave his small, crowded apartment in Lisbon for the relative solitude of Lanzarote. The History of the Siege of Lisbon, published in the United States last year, is a whimsical tale set in motion by the decision of a humble proofreader at a publishing house to insert the word not into a key passage in a standard history of Portugal. With this lunatic creative act, a Edmund White put it in The New York Times Book Review, he totally derails the national saga by affirming that the crusader did not in fact help liberate 12th-century Lisbon from Moorish occupation. White ended his July 1997 review with a prescient remark. Word ha it that Saramago is overdue for a Nobel Prize, he noted. No candidate ha a better claim to lasting recognition than this novelist. With the recent publication of Blindness in the United States, only Saramago's latest novel, Todos o Nomes, or All the Names still awaits translation into English. In the tradition of Andre Gide and Julian Green, though, he ha now embarked on his journal. The fourth volume of these Cadernos de Lanzarote wa just published in Lisbon. Saramago will receive his Nobel Prize, worth the equivalent of $967,500 this year, at a ceremony in Stockholm on Dec. 10. Three American pharmacologist were awarded the Nobel Prize on Monday for their surprising discovery of how natural production of a gas, nitric oxide, can mediate a wide variety of bodily action. Those include widening blood vessel, helping to regulate blood pressure, initiating erection, battling infection, preventing formation of blood clot and acting a a signal molecule in the nervous system. The prize, for physiology or medicine, went to Dr. Robert Furchgott, 82, of the State University of New York in Brooklyn; Dr. Louis Ignarro, 57, of the University of California at Los Angeles, and Dr. Ferid Murad, 62, of the University of Texas Medical School in Houston. The announcement of a significant phase of the discovery by two of Monday's winner at a meeting in 1986 elicited an avalanche of research activity in many different laboratory around the world, said the Nobel committee at the Karolinska Institute in Stockholm, which make the award. Its citation said that the research had led to new treatment for treating heart and lung disease, shock and impotence. Ignarro discovered the principle that led to the use of Viagra a an anti-impotency drug, said Dr. Sten Orrenius, a professor of toxicology at the Karolinska Institute. Nitric oxide start the process by which blood vessel in the penis widen to produce an erection. Nitric oxide, a chemical relative of the anesthetic gas nitrous oxide, is better known a a common air pollutant formed when nitrogen burn, such a in automobile exhaust fume. But scientist now know it is distributed widely in the body. The discovery honored on Monday were made largely during the 1980s at a time when scientist knew that bacteria produced nitric oxide but did not think it wa important in animal and human. The award committee said that this wa the first discovery that a gas can act a a signal molecule in the organism. The discovery wa startling because nitric oxide is totally different from any other known signal molecule and so unstable that it is converted to nitrate and nitrite within 10 second. Recipients of the Nobel Prize, including some who have lobbied for it for year, often profess surprise on learning of their award. This year's winner were refreshingly candid. Furchgott said he had planned to sleep late on Monday, a holiday, but wa awakened at 5:30 at his home in Hewlett, NY. He said that he knew that previous Nobel prize winner had nominated him for the award, but that he still wa somewhat surprised to receive it. I guess I had some good friend voting, Furchgott said. He said he could not get back to sleep. Murad said he had pondered the odds and thought that maybe I could win the prize, if not now maybe in a couple of year. He described the award a the culmination of a career and said that when it happens, it's incredible. Ignarro wa traveling in Italy. Dr. Gerald Levey, the dean of UCLA, said we actually anticipated this day for about four year now. The three 1998 winner never worked together, but we talked a lot of shop talk at meeting, Furchgott said. Dr. Valentin Fuster, the president of the American Heart Association and the head of cardiology at Mt. Sinai Hospital in Manhattan, said that the discovery of nitric oxide and it function is one of the most important in the history of cardiovascular medicine. Doctors have learned from the prize-winning research that in heart disease, the endothelium, or inner lining of artery, make le nitric oxide. Drugs like nitroglycerine, however, can help replenish store of nitric oxide. Now, drug company are trying to develop more powerful heart drug based on newer knowledge of nitric oxide's role a a signal molecule. Researchers have also learned that nitric oxide produced in the endothelium rapidly spread through cell membrane to the underlying muscle cell in artery. Then it can shut off muscle contraction in the artery, thus widening them and reducing blood pressure. Inhalation of nitric oxide gas ha saved the life of some people with certain lung disease, particularly infant who have developed dangerously high pulmonary blood pressure. But regulating the amount of nitric oxygen inhaled is critical because too much can be lethal. Nitric oxide play a harmful role in the collapse of the circulatory system, or shock, resulting from overwhelming microbial infection. Bacteria can release product that cause white blood cell to release enormous amount of nitric oxide. As a result, blood pressure drop. Scientists are trying to develop drug that can block production of nitric oxide in such infection. White blood cell also play a role in attacking cancerous cell. The gas can also induce a type of programmed cell death known a apoptosis. Scientists are studying nitric oxide's effect on the immune system to stop the growth of cancer. They are also exploring nitric oxide's possible role in regulating body temperature. Doctors are measuring the production of nitric oxide in the lung and intestine to diagnose a number of ailment, including asthma and colitis, and are studying it role in menstruation. Nitric oxide formed in nerve cell spread rapidly in all direction to activate cell in the vicinity and influence many function, like behavior and the mobility of the intestinal tract. Nitric oxide is also being studied for it role in smell and memory. Nitric oxide's role is still unfolding; scientist have written thousand of scientific paper about it in recent year and have started a journal, Nitric Oxide. The Nobel committee cited Furchgott for performing in 1980 an ingenious experiment that showed that a drug, acetylcholine, widened blood vessel only if the inner layer, or endothelium, wa intact. Furchgott concluded that blood vessel widen because the endothelial cell produce a signal molecule that he called EDRF, for endothelium-derived relaxing factor, which relaxes smooth muscle cell in blood vessel. Furchgott's finding led to a quest to identify the factor, the citation said. (OPTIONAL TRIM CAN BEGIN HERE) The citation did not refer to an accident in Furchgott's laboratory that played a major role in his discovery. In 1995, in the Annual Review of Pharmacology and Toxicology, Furchgott wrote that on May 5, 1978, in the first of a series of planned experiment on artery from a rabbit, a technician did not follow direction correctly. The technician performed one step of the experiment before instead of after he wa supposed to wash out a drug used in an earlier phase of the experiment. Furchgott expected that the artery would contract. Instead, they relaxed. It wa the first time he had seen the drug under study produce such a reaction, and he used the insight to plan additional experiment. Furchgott omitted the technician's name in that paper and in another in 1996 in the Journal of the American Medical Association. On Monday, he said David Davidson wa the technician. (OPTIONAL TRIM ENDS HERE) The committee cited Ignarro for concluding in 1986, from a brilliant series of analysis conducted independently of Furchgott, that EDRF wa identical to nitric oxide. Furchgott said he and Ignarro made the announcement at the same symposium in 1986 at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minn., but the paper were not published until 1998. Murad wa cited for work conducted over the year while he worked at the University of Virginia in Charlottesville, Stanford University in Palo Alto, Calif., and Abbott Laboratories in Illinois. Murad said he felt fortunate to have heard Furchgott report his early work on EDRF in 1980. Murad showed that a gas could regulate important cellular function and studied how nitroglycerin and related heart drug led to the release of nitric oxide. (OPTIONAL TRIM CAN BEGIN HERE) In his early training at Case Western Reserve University in Cleveland, Murad worked in the laboratory of Dr. Theodore Rall, who also trained another Nobel prize winner, Dr. Alfred Gilman of the University of Texas Southwestern in Dallas. Gilman said in an interview that he believed Rall, now retired and living in Charlottesville, Va., wa the first scientist to have trained two Nobel Prize winner. In addition, Rall worked with Dr. Earl Sutherland, who also won a Nobel Prize. In his early reseach year, Murad worked on a chemical known a cyclic guanosine monophosphate, which later turned out to be critical in the nitric oxide story. Murad's trainee referred to the early work a dumping experiment because all they could do in the laboratory at the time wa crudely add various hormone and agent to slice of tissue, cell culture. It took year to develop the more refined technique that led to the understanding of nitric oxide's many role in the body. But for many year, most of the scientific community wa skeptical of the ability of a free radical like nitric oxide to activate an enzyme, Murad said in 1996 when he and Furchgott shared the Albert Lasker basic medical research award. (OPTIONAL TRIM ENDS HERE) The Nobel Prizes were created by the will of Alfred Nobel, whose invention of dynamite involved the use of nitroglycerine. The award committee noted an odd twist to this year's award. When Nobel developed chest pain from heart disease, it said, he refused to take the nitroglycerine his doctor prescribed because he knew it caused headache. Nobel dismissed nitroglycerine's benefit in the relief of chest pain. Nobel died in 1896. The prize that the three scientist will share is now worth $938,000. When Alfred Nobel wrote the direction establishing a literature prize in his name, he chose an unclear word and scratched out a few letter. Questions about the prize have engaged and piqued the literary world ever since. A new chapter in the mystery will be written Thursday, when the Swedish Academy announces this year's winner of the world's most prestigious prize for writer. The prize focus intense medium attention on the Swedish capital and the clamor of journalist generally drowns out a question: Why doe the world care so much about the literary choice of a handful of people in a quiet and remote country? Does the Nobel Prize really recognize the best? When asked that question, Swedish Academy permanent secretary Sture Allen smiled and said Look at the list of prizewinners! The answer obscures a much a it clarifies. On one hand, the Nobel Prize ha recognized world-renowned writer such a Isaac Bashevis Singer and brought little-known wonder to light, such a Wislawa Szymborska. But the prize arguably also ha honored the mediocre, heaping attention on those who would have been more fairly served by obscurity. Among them is the winner of the first prize in 1901, Sully Prudhomme. That choice wa denounced by Sweden's leading literary light, August Strindberg, and a group of Swedes sent a letter to Leo Tolstoy apologizing for the Academy's slight in not choosing him. Arguments over the Academy's choice are inevitable, considering the instruction they were given. Nobel's will say the prize should recognize literature that work in an ideal direction. What, exactly, he meant by ideal** is unclear and the Academy's choice have reflected the confusion. The Academy ha chosen to interpret the word to apply to work ranging from the good-hearted charm of Szymborska's poetry to the crushing hopelessness of Samuel Beckett's writing. When Nobel wrote the word ideal in Swedish idealisk** he superimposed the last couple of letter over previous one. Allen wa so curious to understand Nobel's thought that he engaged a forensic expert to try to find out what the earlier letter were. The expert succeeded to a point. He found that the first word Nobel wrote wa idealirad, a word that doesn't exist. Despite the inclarity around the edge, Allen said he is confident that the Academy's choice bolster Nobel's core idea that literature would be the basis for some kind of progress. About this year's choice, he won't say more than that: the Academy is bound to keep it deliberation secret. But observer love to speculate on who might win, even who's on the shortlist for the prize, this year worth 7.6 million kronor (about dlrs 974,000). Names that freuqently come up in the guessing include VS. Naipaul, China's Bei Dao and Pa Kin, American poet John Ashbery, and Jose Saramago of Portugal. A day after winning the Nobel Prize for literature, Portuguese novelist Jose Saramago insisted that while he wa delighted to win the award, it could just a easily have gone to many other Portuguese writer. I'm not the only one who deserved it, said the first Portuguese-language author to obtain the prestigious award. There have been other Portuguse author, like Fernando Pessoa, whose work would justify 1,000 Nobels Speaking at a packed press coference in Madrid, Saramago joked about how he heard he had won the prize from German air hostess at Frankfurt airport a he waited for a flight home to Spain's Canary Islands. The news left the 75-year-old writer no choice but to leave the airport and return to the city's book fair to meet the press and public. At that moment I wa over the moon and returning to the book fair the only thing I wa worried about wa that the whole thing wa an error, said Saramago. Dismissing the Vatican paper's disapproval Thursday of his achievment, Saramago, a known atheist, quipped that he wa aware that the Pope had been among the jury, I wouldn't have won the prize. The Vatican is easily upset, said Saramago, I think that the Vatican should keep it mind on it prayer and leave people alone. Meanwhile in Portugal, where Saramago is scheduled to arrive on Tuesday, the delight at the Swedish Academy's award for Saramago wa reflected in the daily paper, with even the country's three daily sport paper ample space to the event. The two leading daily, Publico and Diario de Noticias, gave over their entire front page to Saramago. Lisbon City Hall rushed out poster saying Congratulations Jose Saramago which were hung up around the capital during the night. Saramago wa born into a poor, illiterate family in Azinhaga, a small town near Lisbon. He never finished university but continued to study part-time while supporting himself a a metalworker. Nothing in my life would have led one to think I'd win the Nobel Prize, said Saramago. I wasn't born to win the Nobel. I didn't have my own book until I wa 18. His first novel, published in 1947 Terra do Pecado, or Country of Sin wa a tale of peasant in moral crisis. For the next 18 year, Saramago, a communist who opposed the 41-year conservative dictatorship of Antonio Salazar, published only a few travel and poetry book while he worked a a journalist. He returned to fiction only after Salazar's regime wa toppled by a military uprising in 1974. Since the 1980s, his work have been translated into more than 20 language. Regarding the future, Saramago said the book he is currently working on will be called The Cavern and deal with a modern version of myth of Plato and the cave. Three American researcher on Monday won the Nobel Medicine Prize for discovering how nitric oxide act a a signal molecule in the cardiovascular system, a breakthrough with application ranging from hardening of the artery to impotence. The prestigious prize went to Robert F. Furchgott, Louis J. Ignarro and Ferid Murad. Furchgott is a pharmacologist at the State University of New York in Brooklyn, Ignarro is at University of California-Los Angeles and Murad is at the University of Texas Medical School in Houston. The citation by the Karolinska Institute said it wa a senation that the simple, common air pollutant (nitric oxide), which is formed when nitrogen burn . could exert important function in the organism. Because of the research, we know today that nitric oxide act a a signal molecule in the nervous system, a a weapon against infection and a a regulator of blood pressure. Signal transmission by a gas that is produced by one cell, penetrates through membrane and regulates the function of another cell represents an entirely new principle, the citation said. Understanding how nitric oxide transmits the signal ha sparked research on a wide range of new drug, including those that can be used in the treatment of heart problem, artherosclerosis, shock and impotence. The prize amount of 7.6 million kronor (dlrs 978,000) is divided equally among the three. Last year, the prize went to Stanley B. Prusiner of the University of California at San Francisco for his discovery of prion, the rogue protein identified a causing Mad Cow Disease. Winners generally aren't known outside the medical community, although the list of laureate contains a few familiar name including Ivan Pavlov, tuberculosis pioneer Robert Koch, and DNA researcher Francis Crick and James Watson. Generally, they are researcher who have made discovery that sound small on paper but carry large consequence. Among other well-known name to receive the prize is David Baltimore, although he shared the prize in 1975, long before becoming one of the world's most visible AIDS researcher. Alan Cormack of the United States and Sir Godfrey Hounsfield may not be familiar name, but what they won the prize for in 1979 is a term known by most patients: computer-assisted tomography or CAT scan. The medicine prize wa the second of the six Nobels to be announced this year. Last Thursday, the literature prize went to Portuguese novelist Jose Saramago. The physic and chemistry prize will be announced Tuesday, the economics prize on Wednesday and the peace prize on Friday. All the announcement are in Stockholm, except for the peace prize which is given in Oslo, Norway. The prize are presented on Dec. 10, the anniversary of the death of Alfred Nobel, the industrialist and inventor of dynamite whose will established the prize. ","One of those mentioned for the 1998 Nobel Literature Prize was Jose Saramago, Portuguese writer, atheist and Communist.Saramago was weary of hearing again that this year he might win.But this time he did, much to the delight of Portugal, but not to the Vatican.In speculation on the Peace Prize it came out that only a strict deadline rule denied Jimmy Carter the 1978 prize.The 1998 Medicine Prize went to three American pharmacologists, Robert Furchgott, Louis Ignarro and Ferid Murad for their discovery of the role of nitric oxide in the nervous and cardiovascular systems, one of the most important discoveries in the history of cardiovascular medicine.","Announcement of the Nobel Prize awards always generates great interest.The prize for literature has always been one to receive varying responses.Past selections have been praised, questioned, or even written off as politically or nationally ""correct"".This year's winner is 75-year old Jose Saramago, the first Portuguese language writer to win.It is the fourth straight year that a European won.The Peace Prize always receives critical response.Then President Carter would have shared the 1978 Prize with Sadat and Begin, except for a missed deadline.The 1998 Nobel for medicine was awarded to three US researchers for discoveries with nitric oxide.","Jose Saramago is the first Portuguese-language writer and one of few communists to win the Nobel Prize for Literature.He is widely acclaimed for his imaginative allegories.Three American researchers, Robert Furchgott, Louis Ignarro, and Ferid Murad, shared the 1998 Nobel Prize for Medicine for discovering how nitric oxide acts as a signal molecule in the cardiovascular system.Their research led to new treatments for heart and lung diseases, shock, and impotence.The deliberations surrounding the awards are secret; however, Stig Ramel, a former director of the Nobel Foundation, revealed the committee wanted Jimmy Carter to share the 1978 peace prize.","1998's Nobel prize for literature went to a Portuguese for the 1st time, imaginative novelist Jose Saramago, long a candidate.Portugal celebrated but the Vatican called him a communist and anti-religious.The meaning of Nobel's advice to honor ""literature that works in an ideal direction"" is unclear.3 Americans won in medicine for 1980s discoveries concerning nitric oxide's function in the body, which sparked new research.Nobel nominations are secret.Prizes are awarded on Dec. 10th, the day of Nobel's death, all in Stockholm except the Peace prize in Oslo.The 1978 committee wanted to give the Peace Prize to Jimmy Carter but missed its own deadline."
37,"Ariel Sharon's appointment a the Israeli foreign minister serf a the bullet of mercy for the Middle East peace process, an official Syrian newspaper said Saturday. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu named Sharon foreign minister on Friday, effectively putting the hard-liner in charge of negotiating Israel's final border with the Palestinians. Many Arabs know Sharon for his role in Israel's 1982 invasion of Lebanon. An Israeli tribunal looking into the invasion found him indirectly responsible for the massacre of hundred of Palestinian refugee by Christian Lebanese militiaman at two Beirut camp. Sharon's appointment a foreign minister is a bullet of mercy to the (peace) process, which ha stopped on all track, said Tishrin, which often speaks for the Syrian government. Syrian-Israel peace talk broke off more than two year ago. Syria and the previous Israeli government had reached an informal agreement on a full withdrawal from the Golan Heights, which Israel captured from Syria in 1967. But Netanyahu's government rejected that agreement, saying it wa never completed. Netanyahu ha sent a clear message to all those who are deluding themselves and betting on Israel (to) change it anti-peace stand to give up their illusion, the paper said. A senior Palestinian negotiator say the success of a peace summit this week near Washington depends on a clear-cut yes from Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to an American initiative. It is time to deliver, Saeb Erekat told reporter Sunday night after a meeting of the Palestinian Cabinet. Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat met Jordan's Crown Prince Hassan in Amman Monday to brief him on talk with US. official on breaking the deadlock in the negotiation with Israel. Palestinians also were expressing growing unease over the naming of hawkish former Israeli general Ariel Sharon a Netanyahu's foreign minister. Sharon, whose appointment last week wa widely seen a a bid to keep far-right ally from toppling Netanyahu's government, ha been quoted a saying he would refuse to shake the hand of Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat. It's worrisome, Erekat said. Previously, the Palestinian leadership had said the appointment wa an internal Israeli affair. Monday wa a Jewish holiday and there wa no immediate Israeli comment on summit prospect. However, the Israeli newspaper Yediot Aharonot said over the weekend that Netanyahu's hard-line Cabinet, due to meet Tuesday, wa balking at agreeing to an American-authored plan for an Israeli pullback in the West Bank. Erekat said the Palestinians hope the four-day summit, set to begin Thursday outside the US. capital, would mark the end of a long round of meeting and the start of implementation of accord. It depends on Mr. Netanyahu. If he say `yes' to the American initiative and stop attempt to change the reference of the interim agreement, we will reach an agreement in no time, Erekat said. At the table is a U.S plan for an Israeli troop withdrawal from 13 percent from the West Bank. The Palestinians accepted the plan, which includes security condition they must fulfill.

Netanyahu ha sent a clear message to all those who are deluding themselves and betting on Israel (to) change it anti-peace stand to give up their illusion, the paper said. Lebanon's peace talk with Israel also have been suspended for more than two year pending progress in Syrian-Israeli negotiation. The independent An-Nahar newspaper quoted Lebanese Prime Minister Rafik Hariri a asking, Does the Israeli government really want peace a it is trying to delude the world? In a front page comment, Sahar Baasiri, said The mere announcement that he (Sharon) will lead negotiation (with Arabs) is tantamount to disaster. Ariel Sharon, the hawkish former general tipped to be Israel's next foreign minister, said in an interview published Sunday that if he get the job, he won't shake the hand of Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat. Sharon, who opposes ceding West Bank land to the Palestinians, is being considered for the government's No. 2 post. In it, he would be a pivotal figure in reaching a final peace settlement with the Palestinians. Even if I will be appointed foreign minister and run the negotiation, I won't shake Yasser Arafat's hand, Sharon wa quoted a saying in the Yediot Ahronot daily. The newspaper said Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is close to making a decision on the appointment. Netanyahu himself ha been acting foreign minister since the post wa vacated in January by David Levy, a moderate who opposed Netanyahu's hardline negotiating strategy with the Palestinians. Sharon's appointment would signal a toughening of Israel's position and could further strain relation with Arab neighbor. Sharon is the general who led Israel's 1982 invasion of Lebanon, and a former housing minister who strengthened Jewish settlement in territory Israel captured from Syria, Jordan and Egypt in the 1967 Mideast war. Sharon told the Haaretz newspaper he would accept the foreign minister's job if he were allowed to act to strengthen the country. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu appointed Ariel Sharon, a hawkish former defense minister, to be Israeli foreign minister on Friday in an effort to placate the far right a he move closer to turning over more West Bank land to the Palestinians. With his appointment, Sharon, 70, an ardent advocate for Jewish settlement in the West Bank, is expected to quell domestic opposition to the concession that Netanyahu is supposedly prepared to make at a peace summit conference in the Washington area next week. For month, Sharon, who is currently the minister of national infrastructure, ha maintained that redeploying Israeli troop from more than an additional 9 percent of the West Bank would be a national disaster. In assuming the role of foreign minister, however, he would be forced to abandon his public opposition to Netanyahu's decision to withdraw from another 13 percent of the Palestinian territory even if he vote against the accord. Sharon will be drawn directly into the issue, since Netanyahu ha appointed him to direct the final status talk with the Palestinians, which would follow the signing of an interim peace agreement. Last week Sharon told an Israeli newspaper that, negotiation or not, he would never shake the hand of Yasser Arafat, the Palestinian leader, whom he ha long disdained. Palestinian leader and Israeli leftist were divided in their reaction, in similar way. Some professed to be aghast, and some, like Nabil Sha'ath, the Palestinian transportation minister, said they were willing to forget history if Sharon's appointment provided Netanyahu the political backbone to sign a deal. In Washington, White House and State Department official pledged to work closely with Sharon and emphasized that the personnel in an Israeli government are an internal affair. Arik Sharon is the most fitting person in the state of Israel for the position of foreign minister, Netanyahu said, using his nickname. He brings with him rich experience, creativity, proven working ability and I think that he well know both the wound and damage of war a well a the fruit of peace. Sharon ha never hidden his belief, he continued, and his word have influenced the way that the redeployment will be carried out if not it extent. In a nod to Sharon, Netanyahu ha decided on a new location for the nature reserve that would constitute 3 percent of the West Bank land. It wa supposed to be in the Judean desert near Israel's eastern border, which Sharon argued would pose a strategic security risk. Instead, it wa decided on Thursday that the nature reserve would instead be on the slope of the Hebron hill, much closer to existing Jewish settlement. Many Israeli political observer believe that Netanyahu ha eviscerated his right-wing opposition with this appointment, signaling that he genuinely intends to bring home a peace agreement. Who is the right wing now if Sharon is in the foreign ministry and negotiating with the Palestinians? asked Uzi Benziman, an editorial board member of the newspaper Haaretz and author of a critical biography of Sharon. It will be just the settler and some real hard-liners who don't comprise more than 15 percent of public opinion. So it's really quite an intelligent move, suggesting that Netanyahu mean business in trying to get an agreement. But the Palestinians took the news hard, and read it differently. I think it's a clear-cut message from Bibi, Saeb Erekat, a lead negotiator for the Palestinians, said, using Netanyahu's nickname. I imagine people will try to explain Netanyahu's intention a trying to get the support of the right. What he is trying to do is make peace with the right wing at the expense of making peace with u. It mean he want to continue on the path of non-negotiations, because he want to continue to be prime minister at any cost. Sharon declined to be interviewed Friday because his appointment must still be approved by the Cabinet on Tuesday, an approval that is expected. An aide, Raanan Gisin, said Sharon accepted the position so that he could stem the tide of dangerous development and contribute to fighting the risk facing Israel. A retired general who fought in every Israeli war, Sharon, 70, is a leading figure of the Likud Party who ha done much battle with the Likud prime minister. At the most recent party convention, he said that Netanyahu didn't know his right hand from his left, which the prime minister dismissed Friday a a comment made in the height of political argument. And when Netanyahu first formed his Cabinet in 1996, the fact that he did not give Sharon a senior position caused an 11th-hour crisis before the swearing-in ceremony. Sharon retreated to his family farm in the Negev, and David Levy, who had been named foreign minister, said he would not serve unless Sharon wa given a post. Netanyahu then created a Cabinet job, the minister of infrastructure, especially for Sharon. Levy resigned in January after a lengthy power struggle with the prime minister, and since then Netanyahu ha been serving a his own foreign minister. Sharon, a member of the old guard, ha a complicated political past, highlighted by a string of military victory, and checkered, to many, by his indirect role, a defense minister, in the Lebanese Christian Phalangist massacre of unarmed civilian in the Sabra and Shatila refugee camp in Lebanon in 1982. Many Israelis, even those who despise his politics, see him a a strong, experienced figure who know his mind and who is capable of being moderate when he ha power. Friday afternoon, the right-wing political establishment nearly universally applauded the appointment. Uzi Landau, who is a Likud hard-liner, said he wa relieved to hear confirmed what ha been a rumor for week. I feel more safe about the negotiation if Minister Sharon is directly involved, said Landau, who head the Parliament's security and foreign affair committee. Undoubtedly it will facilitate the situation for the prime minister to show the right that Arik Sharon is identified with the program, so therefore they can live with it. Right before the announcement wa made, leader of the National Religious Party, who had threatened to bring down the government, changed their combative tone. They emerged mollified from meeting with Netanyahu late Thursday, saying they would leave the government intact. Still, they would not connect their change of heart to the nomination of Sharon. Appointing Sharon is a political step we like very much, said Shaul Yahalom, the minister of transportation and a leader of the National Religious Party. But it will have no effect on how we see the peace agreement. Our concern there is on whether any of the 160 Jewish settlement are endangered. The appointment of Sharon come against a backdrop of violence that ha erupted this week. Friday, a 19-year-old Israeli soldier, Michal Adato, wa stabbed to death by a Palestinian man a she got off a bus in her hometown, the settlement of Tomer in the Jordan Valley. Netanyahu reported that he had received a sympathy note from Arafat, who condemned the attack. Also Friday, in the continuing clash between Palestinian youth and soldier in the divided city of Hebron, 32 Palestinians were lightly injured by rubber bullet after the funeral of a Palestinian protester shot dead on Thursday. After Netanyahu made the announcement Friday, an Israeli reporter introduced a question by stating that Netanyahu had diminished the political threat from the right wing by appointing Sharon. Are you willing to sign on that? Netanyahu said. I do not know that. I do know one thing that when you are dependent on the vote of one or two people you can never know what will be. He wa referring to his razor-thin majority in parliament which some analyst perceive to be his key motivator in appointing Sharon. More than anything else, this reflects the political weakness of Netanyahu, said Yaron Ezrahi, a leading intellectual and critic of the prime minister. He ha recognized that the next redeployment is inevitable if he doesn't want to be seen a contributing to the wave of political violence that would follow a failure. But he doesn't have the domestic political power to carry out the big decision on his own. The New York Times said in an editorial on Saturday, Oct. 10: Just day before heading to the United States for critical negotiation with Palestinian leader, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu jolted the Middle East peace effort with the appointment of Ariel Sharon a Israeli foreign minister. The most optimistic reading is that Sharon, long an implacable foe of the Palestinians, is prepared to make peace with them and then sell it to the Israelis who are most opposed. Unfortunately, he is also capable of wrecking the entire peace effort. Much will depend on whether Netanyahu can control his strong-willed aide, a goal that ha eluded other Israeli leader. Like a political typhoon, Sharon ha roared across Israeli life for better than three decade a a brilliant military commander, a reckless defense minister and an ardent conservative, often leaving destruction in his wake. He still bear the burden of his role in the massacre of hundred of Palestinians by Christian militiaman in Lebanon in 1982. An Israeli inquiry found he wa indirectly responsible for the killing at the Sabra and Shatila refugee camp. As a leader of the most conservative wing of the Likud party, Sharon can help Netanyahu hold together his shaky Cabinet during potentially decisive negotiation with Yasser Arafat, the Palestinian leader. That will be fine if Sharon is willing to play a constructive role in the peace talk himself. But such behavior is not likely to be the first impulse of a man who ha famously said he would never shake hand with Arafat. Since Netanyahu ha designated Sharon a his chief negotiator, the new foreign minister will soon have the opportunity to act more responsibly. The first order of business when the two side get together next week outside Washington is to wrap up negotiation over the further withdrawal of Israeli force from the West Bank coupled with security guarantee from the Palestinians. Sharon can show statesmanship by helping Netanyahu close this deal, even though it is opposed by the Israeli settler whose cause Sharon ha long championed. Success in these talk would clear the way for the last and most difficult negotiation about a permanent settlement, including the shape and status of a Palestinian state and the future of Jerusalem. If Sharon ever hope to overcome the shame of Sabra and Shatila, he must become a force for peace in the Middle East. Brief biography of Ariel Sharon, named Israel's foreign minister: 1928: Born in Kfar Mallal in British-ruled Palestine. 1948 Mideast war: Fights a junior officer, wounded three time. 1953: Forms elite commando unit 101 and lead it on raid against Palestinian guerrilla who had been attacking Israeli border village. 1956 Sinai campaign: Commands a parachute brigade that is dropped behind enemy line, capture a key pas and cut off Egyptian army's retreat. 1967 Mideast war: Commands an armored division that break through into central Sinai Peninsula. 1973 Mideast war: Commands a division that cross the Suez Canal, turning the tide of the war on the Egyptian front. 1977: Elected to parliament and appointed minister of agriculture in the government of Menachem Begin. 1981: Defense minister in Begin government. 1982-83: Invades Lebanon in June 1982 to drive out PLO guerrilla, but is held indirectly responsible for Lebanese Christian militiamen's September 1982 massacre of hundred of Palestinian civilian in the Sabra and Shatilla refugee camp south of Beirut.

Oct. 9, 1998: Netanyahu appoints him foreign minister, place him in charge of negotiation with the Palestinians, marking his return to the center of Israeli politics and world political arena. Ariel Sharon's appointment a the Israeli foreign minister serf a the bullet of mercy for the Middle East peace process, an official Syrian newspaper said Saturday. In Beirut, Lebanese newspaper denounced the appointment a a disaster for peace. Many Arabs know Sharon for his role in Israel's 1982 invasion of Lebanon. An Israeli tribunal looking into the invasion found him indirectly responsible for the massacre of hundred of Palestinian refugee by pro-Israeli Christian Lebanese militiaman at two Beirut camp. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu named Sharon foreign minister on Friday, effectively putting the hard-liner in charge of negotiating Israel's final border with the Palestinians. The appointment is a bullet of mercy to the (peace) process, which ha stopped on all track, said Tishrin newspaper, which often speaks for the Syrian government. It said Netanyahu ha sent a clear message to all those who are deluding themselves into thinking that Israel will change it anti-peace stand. Syrian-Israeli peace talk broke off more than two year ago. Syria and the previous Israeli government had reached an informal agreement on a full withdrawal from the Golan Heights, which Israel captured from Syria in 1967. But Netanyahu's government rejected that agreement, saying it wa never completed. Lebanon's peace talk with Israel also have been suspended for more than two year pending progress in Syrian-Israeli negotiation. The independent An-Nahar newspaper quoted Lebanese Prime Minister Rafik Hariri a saying: Sharon's appointment make Lebanon and most world state ask: Does the Israeli government really want peace a it is trying to delude the world? An-Nahar's columnist, Sahar Baasiri, said in a front-page comment: `The mere announcement that he (Sharon) will lead negotiation (with Arabs) is tantamount to disaster. The man is a hero of Arab defeats; he is the firmest believer in the expansion of the land of Israel and in resolving the Palestinian problem at the expense of Jordan. He is a liar, Baasiri wrote. The conservative Ad-Diyar newspaper said in a front-page comment: The history of Ariel Sharon is known. He ha called for burning Beirut, annexing the Golan, occupying the (West) Bank and slaughtering and displacing the Arabs everywhere. Ariel Sharon ha a law degree, and fancy himself a farmer. But for more than three decade his role in Israeli public life ha been that of an unapologetic warrior, first on the battlefield and later in the bare-knuckled combat of domestic partisan politics. With his blunt tongue, barrel chest and bar-scrapper's demeanor, Sharon at 70 is to his many critic here a caricature of right-wing intransigence. To his equally numerous admirer he is a living symbol of unrelenting dedication to Israel's national survival. Still conveying physical vigor within an impressively expanding frame, he remains pugnacious to a fault. Both his friend and foe would agree that the new foreign minister is not a natural diplomat. A Zionist underground operative a a teen-ager and an infantry commander wounded in the 1948 war of independence, Sharon ha fought, and fought memorably, in virtually every major military engagement in his country's history. He commanded the legendary armored division that crossed and seized control of the Sinai in the 1967 Arab-Israeli war. He returned to active service after a three-month retirement to lead Israel's badly outgunned armored division to victory, again in the Sinai, in the war of 1973. As defense minister in 982, Sharon led Israel's invasion of Lebanon, defying international condemnation with unrelenting artillery assault on Beirut neighborhood and Palestinian refugee camp believed by the Israeli high command to be Palestine Liberation Organization redoubt. To some, both in Israel and abroad, Sharon's Lebanese incursion will forever be associated with the massacre by Lebanese Christian Phalangists, ally of the Israelis, of a reported 460 unarmed Palestinians in the Sabra and Shatila refugee camp. In an official inquiry in Jerusalem and in a subsequent libel trial he brought in New York, Sharon wa seen to have effectively refuted charge that he knew of and condoned the Phalangists' attack beforehand. But the government investigating commission held that his failure to prevent the killing constituted ground for his dismissal from the Defense Ministry. Since the 1982 invasion, Israel ha been mired in an unpopular open-ended occupation of southern Lebanon, an operation with constant casualty among young inductee for which Sharon is still often blamed. To many Israelis, however, the Lebanese incursion wa ultimately a risk worth taking, a it succeeded in crushing the PLO militarily and driving it force far from Israel's border. The PLO's defeat at Sharon's hand in Lebanon led eventually to it renunciation of armed warfare against Israel and embrace of the peace negotiation process for which Sharon a Foreign Minister will now be responsible. In civilian life he proved a savvy a political operator a he wa a military strategist, helping to break Labor's hold on the Knesset and making himself an indispensable binding force within successive fractious Likud coalition. His investiture a foreign minister next week will mark his sixth Cabinet appointment in 21 year. He previously held the agriculture and defense portfolio under Prime Minister Menachem Begin, trade and housing in Yitzhak Shamir's government, and national infrastructure essentially, a settlement support directorate in the administration of Benjamin Netanyahu. As a key member of the inner cabinet in Begin's first government, Sharon began the construction and systematic expansion of new Israeli housing development throughout the West Bank, Gaza Strip and Galilee area territory occupied by Israel since 1967, a policy that he and his opponent alike would agree remains his signal domestic political achievement. At 70, Sharon remains one of the great polarizing fixture of Israeli political life. An acerbic critic of the other leading soldier-politician of his generation, Yitzhak Rabin, Sharon attacked the Oslo peace accord a terrible and dangerous and condemned Rabin's negotiating partner, Yasser Arafat, a a war criminal. He angrily opposed any diplomatic discussion of the return of even an internationally demilitarized Golan Heights to Syria. A secular Jew in the manner typical of his generation of native-born Israelis, Sharon became an outspoken and effective defender of new Orthodox Jewish settlement in the predominantly Palestinian area of the West Bank, cementing his position a a bridge between the traditional secular right and the new militant religious faction within the Likud coalition. ","Ariel Sharon was named Israeli foreign minister just weeks before a scheduled peace summit in the US, aimed at negotiating an Israeli withdrawal from 13% of the West Bank.Arabs reacted strongly and said the hard-line, right-wing, warrior and former defense minister would kill any progress for a settlement in the mid-East.Many blame Sharon for a 1982 massacre of Palestinian civilians at refugee camps in Lebanon.Others believed his appointment was an effort to placate the far right and gain their support for the Netanyahu government and the concessions necessary for the peace process.Sharon vowed not to shake Yasser Arafat's hand.","Prior to his appointment as foreign minister by Israeli Prime Minister Natanyahu in 1998, seasoned warrior Ariel Sharon announced that if appointed, he would not shake hands with Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat.The remark fit Sharon's long history of unyielding bellicosity towards Palestine.When he was appointed some thought that Netanyahu was placating Israel's far right wing while striving for peace.Others saw it as a move to scuttle the peace effort.Arab commentary deemed the appointment ""tantamount to disaster"" and ""the bullet of mercy"" to the peace process.Peace talks in the U.S. were in the offing with the outcome in doubt.","Appointment of Ariel Sharon as Foreign Minister by PM Netanyahu does not bode well for the peace process.His appointment is surprising in that the two have differed on withdrawal from Palestinian territory and is seen as an effort to placate the right.Sharon, 70, is an unapologetic warrior on the battlefield and in partisan politics.He brings heavy baggage: right-wing intransigence and responsibility for failing to prevent the killings of 460 unarmed Palestinians in refugee camps during the Lebanon incursion.Sharon has said that he will not shake Arafat's hand and his appointment is seen as a ""bullet of mercy"" for the Middle East peace process.","In a move widely viewed as an effort to placate the far right as he moves to withdraw from more West Bank land, Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu named hardliner Ariel Sharon foreign minister and chief peace negotiator.Sharon, a military leader with legendary victories in the 1967 and 1973 Mideast wars, is infamous in the Arab world as the defense minister in the 1982 invasion of Lebanon during which Lebanese Christian militiamen, Israeli allies, slaughtered hundreds of unarmed Palestinians.His appointment as lead negotiator was denounced as a ""disaster"" in the Lebanese press and ""a bullet of mercy to the peace process"" in a Syrian paper."

Finalist city and any third party acting for them or on their behalf or in their favor are forbidden to conclude with IOC member, their relation, relative by marriage, their guest or companion, agreement, transaction or any other contract. In the event of a serious breach of the present regulation, the IOC executive board may further propose to the IOC session that it exclude the city having breached the regulation from the contest for the game. Swiss IOC executive board member Marc Hodler said Sunday he might be thrown out of the International Olympic Committee for making allegation of corruption within the Olympic movement. Asked whether he might resign, Hodler said, No, I don't resign. But maybe I will be expelled. You never know. Hodler, who made the allegation Saturday, said he ha since been muzzled by IOC president Juan Antonio Samaranch. His comment came a the leader of the Salt Lake organizing committee apologized Sunday for the alleged rule violation during the city's successful bid for the 2002 Winter Games. The IOC, meanwhile, said it wa prepared to investigate allegation made by Hodler of bribery in the selection of Olympic host city. Frank Joklik, 4th graf pvs A top IOC official on Saturday made explosive allegation of widespread Olympic corruption, saying agent demand up to dlrs 1 million to deliver vote in the selection of host city. Marc Hodler, a senior member of the International Olympic Committee executive board, alleged malpractice in the voting for the 1996 Atlanta Games, 2000 Sydney Olympics and 2002 Salt Lake Games. Hodler said a group of four agent, including one IOC member, have been involved in promising vote for payment. He declined to identify them. The four agent try to make a living out of this, he said. I missed a chance to be a rich man. Some of the agent do the following: they say, `I can offer this or that number of votes.' The price wold be between dlrs 500,000 and dlrs 1 million for a number of vote, a bloc. Hodler added that the agent then charge the city winning the bid something like dlrs 3 million to dlrs 5 millon. Hodler, an 80-year-old Swiss lawyer, said there is one agent who boast that no city ha ever won the Olympic Games without his help. No one can prove that, Hodler said. IOC president Juan Antonio Samaranch immediately disassociated himself from Hodler's allegation. The only official spokeman for the IOC executive board is (director general) Francois Carrard, Samaranch said. All the other comment are personal comment. They are not official comment. Hodler's allegation, made to a group of reporter, came a the IOC continued investigation into alleged financial misconduct by the Salt Lake City group which won the bid for the 2002 game. Hodler ha described a a bribe the dlrs 500,000 scholarship fund set up by Salt Lake which benefited the relative of six IOC member. It also came a the former minister in charge of Sydney's 2000 Olympic bid revealed he wa asked to offer bribe in exchange for vote. Bruce Baird, the former New South Wales minister, said he refused. Asked whether Atlanta's victory in the vote for the 1996 game wa clean, Hodler said, Certainly not.' Asked whether Sydney's election wa clean, he said, I would be surprised. I know what happened but I don't want to disclose it. I can't imagine that Sydney is different from the others, he said. Sydney pretend it is completely clean, clean, clean. Hodler contested the argument by the current Salt Lake organizing committee that it wa not directly involved in the controversial scholarship program and that the onus wa on former bid chief Thomas Welch. Yesterday the lawyer of Salt Lake City said, `Everything had been done by Tom Welch, who is not there any more. We know nothing.' My experience is that this is not true. The controversy center on scholarship including tuition assistance and athlete training program paid to relative of IOC member by the Salt Lake bid committee. From 1991 to 1995, the committee under the direction of Welch spent nearly dlrs 400,000 on scholarship to 13 individual six of them relative of IOC member, mostly from Africa. The current SLOC president, Frank Joklik, wa chairman of the bid committee at the time. SLOC vice president Dave Johnson wa also a high official on the bid committee. The mayor of the Japanese city of Nagano, site of the 1998 Winter Olympics, denied allegation that city official bribed member of the International Olympic Committee to win the right to host the game. Nagano Mayor Tasuku Tsukada wa responding to allegation by Marc Hodler, the Swiss member of the IOC executive board, of systematic buying and selling of the Olympic Games. I have never heard of such a thing, Tsukada told the Associated Press Sunday. As far a Nagano is concerned, we haven't done anything wrong. We were selected a host of the Olympics through our effort. We can't believe that Mr. Hodler ha made such a statement, he said. Tsukada wa vice chairman of the Japanese committee to invite the Olympics to Nagano. Nagano ha been criticized for spending a large amount of money to win the game. Sports Nippon, a leading Japanese sport newspaper, said more than 2 billion yen (dlrs 17 million) of the money Nagano spent to bring the game there ha not been accounted for. Japan Olympic Committee ha warned city seeking to host the game in the future that they should not entertain IOC member excessively, the newspaper said. Holder's accusation might effect the invitation activity for the 2008 summer Olympics by Osaka, Japan's second largest city, the paper said. Osaka is competing with Beijing, China and other city for the right to host the game. Nagano became the first Asian city to host the Winter Games since Sapporo, Japan played host to the 1972 game. Eighty-eight IOC member took part in a secret vote in 1991 to decide who would host the 1998 game. Nagano led in each of the five round, beating out Salt Lake city 46 vote to 42 in the final ballot. What started a a local controversy in Salt Lake City ha evolved into a full-blown international scandal. The International Olympic Committee ha ordered a top-level investigation into the payment of nearly dlrs 400,000 in scholarship to relative of IOC member by the Salt Lake group which won the bid for the 2002 Winter Games. IOC executive board member Marc Hodler said the scholarship fund described a humanitarian aid by Salt Lake official amounted to a bribe. I'm terribly sorry that even Salt Lake City by far the best place to hold the winter game had to use certain method in order to get the vote, Hodler said. IOC president Juan Antonio Samaranch assigned the international body's juridical commission which deal with legal and ethical issue to investigate. The inquiry will be headed by IOC vice president Keba Mbaye of Senegal, a highly respected former World Court judge. The scholarship fund wa first disclosed two week ago by a Salt Lake radio station. The controversy is now bound to overshadow the routine progress report which the Salt Lake Olympic Committee (SLOC) is scheduled to make to the IOC executive board this weekend. SLOC president Frank Joklik, who arrived in Lausanne Friday, welcomed the IOC investigation. I think that's who the matter should be taken up by, he told The Associated Press. Of course, we intend to collaborate fully with the IOC and it investigation. Joklik expressed concern that the case had harmed Salt Lake's image. I appreciate the perception of this matter is bad now, he said. Asked about Hodler's accusation of bribery, Joklik said he hadn't seen the remark yet and couldn't reply directly. But he sought to distance himself from the allegation by making a distinction between the action of the bidding committee and the current organizing committee. Presumably (Hodler's) remark are related to action of the bid commitee before 1995, Joklik said. The organizing committee certainly ha people of integrity and ethical standard that would stand any investigation. The fact were in the early 1990s when the bid committee wa operating. US. Olympic Committee deputy secretary general John Krimsky described the controversy a disruptive for Salt Lake's image and preparation for the game. It doesn't do u any good at all, he said. I hope we see a speedy resolution to Judge Mbaye's review. I hope it will be a footnote. I hope it never becomes a chapter. Salt Lake organizer, 10th graf pvs LAUSANNE, Switzerland (AP) IOC president Juan Antonio Samaranch on Sunday promised to expel any member if they are found guilty of accepting bribe. Samaranch said he wa surprised at the allegation of corruption in the International Olympic Committee made by senior Swiss member Marc Hodler. But he said the allegation would be considered by a special IOC panel looking into alleged rule violation by the Salt Lake group which won the 2002 Winter Games. If it is necessary, we will expel member if this commission feel these member are guilty, Samaranch said at a news conference. After we get the recommendation of the panel, we will take the measure necessary to arrange the problem. Samaranch said the IOC wa intent on protecting the integrity of the organization and the Olympics a a whole. If we have to clean, we will clean, he said. After, the IOC will be even stronger than before. Samaranch said he wa taken aback by Hodler's allegation, which were made to reporter Saturday. Samaranch said Hodler should have brought his allegation first to the IOC executive board. For me, I wa really surprised. If he ha name and evidence, he must go to the executive board. Hodler said he believed four agent including one IOC member had been involved in vote-buying over the past 10 year. He said he thought 5 to 7 percent of the IOC member currently numbering 115 were open to bribery. Samaranch denied that he muzzled Hodler, a the Swiss official claimed earlier Sunday. He said he had told all member of the executive board that only himself and director general Francois Carrad could speak to the medium. This is not the first time I do this, he said. Samaranch expressed his respect and admiration for Hodler and ruled out the possbility of expelling him from the IOC, an option the Swiss member had raised. Never, never, is anyone thinking to expel Mr. Hodler, Samaranch said. The IOC also ruled out any possibility of stripping Salt Lake City of the game over alleged rule violation during the bid. No, there is not any kind of possibiity, he said. We trust the organizing committee of Salt Lake City. The Salt Lake controvery center on a scholarship program that provided nearly dlrs 400,000 in tuition and other assistance to 13 individual including six relative of IOC member, mostly from Africa. Samaranch said the IOC would possibly consider a new procedure to eliminate the tempations for corruption in the selection of host city. Under current rule, all IOC member have a vote. Samaranch noted the IOC could adopt the formula used by sport federation such a FIFA, world soccer's governing body, which assign their executive board to select site. Saying if we have to clean, we will clean, Juan Antonio Samaranch responded on Sunday to allegation of corruption in the Olympic bidding process by declaring that IOC member who were found to have accepted bribe from candidate city could be expelled. It is a serious problem we have before u, Samaranch, president of the International Olympic Committee, said in a hastily arranged news conference at a tumultuous meeting of the IOC executive board. Samaranch compared the current climate to the Soviet boycott of the 1984 Olympics in Los Angeles and the sprinter Ben Johnson's expulsion from the 1988 Olympics in Seoul, South Korea. Those were difficult moment, Samaranch said. Now we are facing another difficult moment, but I'm sure we will solve this problem. Samaranch expressed surprise at allegation made by the IOC executive board member Marc Hodler of Switzerland that agent were offering to sell IOC. members' vote for payment from bidding city. Hodler, the second most senior member of the IOC, said Saturday that he knew of four agent, including one IOC member, who engaged in such activity. Hodler said he believed that 5 to 7 percent of the IOC membership, which currently number 115, asked for some sort of compensation for their vote. He ha called for a new electoral process, in which the executive board or some other select IOC group would decide which city become Olympic host instead of the full IOC membership. Samaranch agreed Sunday that the time had come to explore change. The system we have now is very complicated, very slow and very expensive, he said. Hodler, the former head of the International Ski Federation, also claimed that the Fiat tycoon Gianni Agnelli had given free van to influence vote for the Italian resort of Sestriere to hold the 1997 world skiing championship. Fiat denied the claim on Saturday, but Sunday Howard Peterson, a former senior American delegate to the ski federation, said he had been offered car by two Fiat executive. The issue of vote-buying came to the fore in Lausanne because of the recent disclosure of scholarship payment made to six relative of IOC member by Salt Lake City official during their successful bid to play host to the 2002 Winter Games. The Salt Lake Organizing Committee ha said the payment, which amounted to slightly le than $400000, came from a privately financed fund that wa started in 1991. And Intermountain Health Care, Utah's largest health care provider, confirmed Sunday that it gave free surgical service to at least two people associated with the IOC in 1994. A special commission headed by the IOC vice president Dick Pound wa appointed on Friday to investigate the issue and ha met with Salt Lake official. Sunday, Frank Joklik, president of the Salt Lake Organizing Committee, issued a public apology to the Olympic family and the citizen of Utah for the embarrassment caused by the scholarship program. Samaranch Sunday ruled out taking the Games from Salt Lake City. He said, If necessary we will expel member if this ad hoc commission think these member are guilty. Pound said his commission wa already satisfied Salt Lake City won the 2002 Games on the merit of the bid. He also said that his commission would expand it inquiry beyond the Salt Lake City bid only if it wa presented with evidence and not simply rumor of corruption in other bid. On Saturday, Hodler had suggested the bidding team from Atlanta and Nagano, Japan, that won the 1996 Summer Olympics and 1998 Winter Olympics had not run clean campaign. Billy Payne, who presided over Atlanta's bid, and Makoto Kobayashi, the general secretary of the Nagano organizing committee, denied those claim. Asked whether he regretted his statement Sunday, Hodler said, Not at all and later said that the city have been the victim and not the villain. Pound said there had been concern in the IOC for some time about agent. There always have been lobbyist, he said. In recent year, especially with the Olympics coming up every two year, there seems to be a professional class being created. Hodler, when pressed for further comment this afternoon at Olympic headquarters, initially covered his mouth with both hand and then said, Muzzle imposed by the president. Hodler, 80, is one of only four IOC member with life membership because he wa appointed before age limit were imposed in 1966. Asked if he might resign he said, I'm not going to resign, but I might be expelled. But the 78-year-old Samaranch said he had great respect for Hodler and no intention of asking for his resignation or pushing for his expulsion. Moving quickly to tackle an escalating corruption scandal, IOC leader questioned Salt Lake City official Friday in the first ever investigation into alleged vote-buying by an Olympic city. Acting with unusual speed, the International Olympic Committee set up a special investigative panel that immediately summoned the organizer of the 2002 Salt Lake Games to address the bribery allegation. The chief investigator refused to rule out the possibility of taking the game away from Salt Lake City though that scenario is considered highly unlikely. Frank Joklik, president of the Salt Lake Organizing Committee, and SLOC senior vice president Dave Johnson appeared before the IOC panel for 90 minute Friday night. Both side declined to comment after the talk, saying the inquiry wa still in process. Earlier, Joklik met with IOC president Juan Antonio Samaranch and other top official to provide information and document on the case. The controversy center on the payment of nearly dlrs 400,000 in scholarship to relative of IOC member by the Salt Lake bid committee which won the right to stage the 2002 game. Senior IOC executive board member Marc Hodler said the scholarship fund described a humanitarian aid by Salt Lake official amounted to a bribe to sway vote in the 1995 election. It's the most serious case of alleged ethical misconduct investigated by the IOC since former US. member Robert Helmick wa accused of conflict of interest in 1991. Helmick eventually resigned both a an IOC member and a president of the US. Olympic Committee. This is the first time the IOC ha ever investigated possible bribery by bidding city, despite previous rumor and allegation of corruption in other Olympic vote. The executive board take this matter very seriously, said Dick Pound, the IOC vice president heading the Salt Lake inquiry. Despite many request made in the past or evidence to support rumor that have been floating around, we have never had anything come forward. Specific allegation have now been made. The executive board acted very quickly to investigate. Also on the investigative panel are IOC vice president Keba Mbaye, executive board member Jacques Rogge and Thomas Bach, and IOC director general Francois Carrard. Pound said the panel would investigate allegation that there may or may not have been payment for the benefit of member of the IOC or their family connected with the Salt Lake City bid. Pound, a Canadian lawyer, said there wa no deadline for completion of the investigation but said it wa possible the inquiry could be wrapped up this weekend. Pound declined to speculate on what if any sanction could be taken against Salt Lake but did not rule out moving the game elsewhere. We're not going to make any conclusion or any speculation a to what we may decide until we know what the fact are, he said. Moving the game would be unprecedented and, with just over three year to go, would be a logistical nightmare. Most of the facility needed for the game in Salt Lake already are built. John Krimsky, deputy secretary general of the US. Olympic Committee, discounted any possibility of the game being moved. There is no chance at all, absolutely none in my mind, he said. I can't be stronger in saying I don't consider it a possibility whatsoever of the game being withdrawn from Salt Lake City. Salt Lake organizer have denied that the bid committee's dlrs 500,000 project wa an effort to buy key IOC members' support in the four year between vote on the 1998 and 2002 Winter Games. Salt Lake lost the '98 race to Nagano, Japan, in 1991, when the program wa begun. It won a landslide vote over Sion, Switzerland, for the 2002 Games in the 1995 balloting. From 1991 to 1995, the bid committee under the direction of former president Thomas Welch spent nearly dlrs 400,000 on scholarship to 13 individual six of them relative of IOC member, mostly from Africa. Olympic rule prohibit bidding city from giving IOC member or their relative any present or benefit exceeding a value of dlrs 150. I've already stated I do not regard what wa done a a bribe, Joklik said Friday. I recognize there have been perception contrary to that. I regret those perception, but I don't feel they are justified. Joklik wa chairman of the bid committee at the time, the No. 2 official behind Welch. Welch resigned last year a president of the organizing committee after being accused of domestic violence against his wife. He currently serf a a SLOC consultant. The organizing committee certainly ha people of integrity and ethical standard that would stand any investigation, Joklik said. The fact were in the early 1990s when the bid committee wa operating. Among those identified a receiving scholarship fund wa Sonia Essomba, the daughter of the late Rene Essomba of Cameroon. The elder Essomba, a prominent surgeon, wa the secretary general of the National Olympic Committees of Africa. A top IOC official on Saturday made explosive allegation of widespread Olympic corruption, saying agent demand up to dlrs 1 million to deliver vote in the selection of host city. Marc Hodler, a senior member of the International Olympic Committee executive board, alleged malpractice in the bid campaign for the game of 1996, 1998, 2000 and 2002.

I missed a chance to be a rich man. Some of the agent do the following: they say, `I can offer this or that number of votes.' The price would be between dlrs 500,000 and dlrs 1 million for a number of vote, a bloc. Hodler added that the agent then charge the city winning the bid something like dlrs 3 million to dlrs 5 millon. Hodler, an 80-year-old Swiss lawyer, said there is one agent who boast that no city ha ever won the Olympic Games without his help. No one can prove that, Hodler said. It could be possible. He said he believed agent had been buying and selling vote for the past 10 year. There are four agent we know, he said. One is an IOC member. He promise he will give enough vote so (the biddding city) can win. Asked whether all Olympic vote are tainted, Hodler said, I know of so many time. There is a good chance it is always the case. IOC president Juan Antonio Samaranch immediately disassociated himself from Hodler's allegation. The only official spokeman for the IOC executive board is (director general) Francois Carrard, Samaranch said. All the other comment are personal comment. They are not official comment. Hodler's allegation, made to a group of reporter, came a the IOC continued investigation into alleged financial misconduct by the Salt Lake City group which won the bid for the 2002 game. Hodler ha described a a bribe the dlrs 500,000 scholarship fund set up by Salt Lake which benefited the relative of six IOC member. It also came a the former minister in charge of Sydney's 2000 Olympic bid revealed he wa asked to offer bribe in exchange for vote. Bruce Baird, the former New South Wales minister, said he refused. Asked whether Atlanta's victory in the vote for the 1996 game wa clean, Hodler said, Certainly not. John Krimsky, deputy secretary general of the US. Olympic Committee, disputed Hodler's assertion. There is no basis for the charge against Atlanta at this point, Krimsky said. All these issue should be put to the IOC review commission. Hodler also leveled allegation against the head of the Athens bid which lost to Atlanta in the 1996 vote. Hodler said he overheard Spyros Metaxa, a wealthy Greek businessman who led the bid, describing Samaranch and IOC member a stupid for imposing restriction on the bidding process. For me there is only one purpose: winning the game, Hodler quoted Metaxa a saying. I will do whatever is necessary to win the game if it cost me dlrs 100000, dlrs 10 million or dlrs 100 million. Hodler said he didn't know of any misconduct in Athens' successful bid for the 2004 game. Asked whether Sydney's election for the 2000 game wa clean, Hodler said, I would be surprised. I know what happened but I don't want to disclose it. I can't imagine that Sydney is different from the others, he said. Sydney pretend it is completely clean, clean, clean. The committee which won the 1998 game for Nagano certainly had to do thing which are not legitimate, Hodler said. Hodler contested the argument by the current Salt Lake organizing committee that it wa not directly involved in the controversial scholarship program and that the onus wa on former bid chief Thomas Welch. Yesterday the lawyer of Salt Lake City said, `Everything had been done by Tom Welch, who is not there any more. We know nothing.' My experience is that this is not true.

The current SLOC president, Frank Joklik, wa chairman of the bid committee at the time. SLOC vice president Dave Johnson wa also a high official on the bid committee. Hodler said the blame shud be on those who put pressure on Salt Lake to offer the scholarship fund. Nobody blame Salt Lake City, he said. We blame those voter who can be bought not Salt Lake City. They were a victim. We should thank them for not paying money only scholarship. Joklik on Saturday denied any payment for vote. I don't even know what agent are, he said. The senior Olympic official who leveled stunning allegation of corruption within the IOC said Sunday he had been muzzled by president Juan Antonio Samaranch and might be throw out of the organization. Marc Hodler, the Swiss member of the IOC executive board, said Samaranch had ordered him to keep quiet. He said he wa told not to appear at a scheduled routine news conference.

At half-hour interval, six more plane are to come in from place such a Morocco and Spain. The European Union, which donated dlrs 38 million for equipment and training, is sending it Mideast envoy on a special plane. The airport opening had been held up for two year because of dispute between Israel and the Palestinian Authority over Israel's role in monitoring passenger and cargo. In the end, Israel will have a say over who and what is coming into the Gaza, but the Israeli monitor will operate discretely, behind one-way mirror, a they do now at the Rafah and Allenby Bridge crossing into autonomous Palestinian area. The airport protocol wa signed last week, a part of the Wye River land-for-security deal between Israel and the Palestinians. Tomer Degani, a spokesman for the Israeli military government in Gaza, said periodic security closure, which bar Palestinians from entering Israel, would not effect the operation of the airport. He said Israel wa inspecting certain gear such a X-ray machine and electro-magnet equipment for safety but that it wouldn't hold-up the airport from opening. The head of the Palestinian Civil Aviation Authority, Fayez Zeidan, wa not available Monday for comment. For the time being, it will still be a bit of an adventure to fly out of Gaza International or to land there. Palestinian official say the equipment for the control tower, the computer for the check-in counter and the flood light are still at the Israeli port of Ashdod. Nir Yarkoni, a spokesman for Israel's Civil Aviation Authority, acknowledged delay in some of the equipment reaching Dahanieh but said he did not know the reason. Degani, from the Israeli military government, said some equipment wa being held up by custom. Portable control, 12th graf pvs Israel ha threatened to close down the Palestinian-run Gaza airport over a security violation, an Israeli official said Tuesday, a move that could further undermine the already fragile peace process. Palestinian airport worker refused to allow Israeli security official to check the identity of passenger who arrived on an Egyptian plane Sunday afternoon, most of whom worked for the Palestinian Authority, according to Civilian Airport Authority Director Nir Yarkoni. The Transportation Minister asked me to tell the Palestinians that if this continues, we won't allow the airport operate, he told The Associated Press. Yarkoni said he conveyed the message in a letter sent Monday to chairman of the Palestinian Civil Aviation Authority Brig. Gen. Fayez Zeidan. Zeidan wa not immediately available for comment. Israel retains security control over flight arriving to Gaza International Airport. The airport's opening last month, stipulated by the accord brokered by US. President Bill Clinton at Wye River, Maryland in October, wa hailed by Palestinians a a milestone toward independence and statehood. Since then, Israel ha accused the Palestinians of failing to contain anti-Israel violence, and ha frozen the accord. The Palestinians, in turn, accuse Israel of reneging on an agreement to release Palestinians jailed for anti-Israel activity. Taking a major step toward statehood, the Palestinians on Tuesday inaugurated Gaza International Airport, their first gateway to the world, with cheer, tear and an outpouring of patriotism. An Egypt Air plane wa the first to land on the desert tarmac in the southern Gaza Strip at 8:30 am. (0630 gmt). But the emotional highlight wa the touchdown of the first Palestinian Airlines plane, a Fokker 50. After landing, the pilot and co-pilot raised Palestinian flag high above their head a they descended the stairway. A chant of Allahu Akbar, or God is Great, rose from of a crowd of thousand of Palestinians who had pushed their way onto the airfield to join the celebration. You are a beautiful sight, Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat later told the Palestinian crew in the VIP lounge lavishly decorated with deep red Oriental carpet and wall mosaic. Throughout the morning, Arafat walked from the lounge to the tarmac seven time to greet plane from Egypt, Morocco, Jordan, Spain, the European Union and two Palestinian Airlines flight. This is a preparation for the declaration of the Palestinian state, Arafat said, smiling broadly and flashing a V sign. However, Israel continues to control the airspace and ha the authority to shut down the airfield at any time. It will monitor arriving passenger and cargo, and can keep traveler or good out if it considers them a danger to Israeli security. Disputes between Israel and the Palestinian Authority over security had delayed the airport opening for more than two year. In a sign of cooperation, Israeli and Palestinian security agent approached the Egypt Air jet together Tuesday and collected the passport of the passenger, including Egyptian Cabinet minister and comedian Adel Imam, in white bag. Throughout the morning, there were spontaneous celebration. As a police marching band played bagpipe, airport worker, policeman and Cabinet minister held each other by their hand and danced in a circle. Some kissed and embraced their neighbor, others wiped away tear and several officer waved their rifle in the air. In one corner of the airfield, about 300 people gathered around a man and a boy riding mule that moved to the beat of drum. The dlrs 75 million airport will provide a boost to the troubled Palestinian economy, permitting the export of Palestinian flower and farm produce that until now were shipped out via Israel, often with difficulty and delay. The airfield will also make it easier for Palestinians to travel abroad, although a majority of Gazans are probably too poor to be able to afford an air ticket. Until now, Palestinians wanting to fly abroad needed permission to enter Israel and fly out of Ben Gurion International airport near Tel Aviv. The other option wa to travel by land to Jordan and catch flight there. Palestinians living in the West Bank still need a permit to cross Israel into Gaza to get to the airport. Travel is expected to become easier once a land route between the West Bank and Gaza open next month. Israel's government doe not permit Israelis to use the Palestinian airport, citing security reason. However, Israeli Foreign Minister Ariel Sharon said Tuesday that this might change in the future. The opening of the airport wa negotiated during last month's U.S.-sponsored Mideast summit near Washington. As part of the accord, Israel also withdrew troop in the northern West Bank last week and released 250 Palestinian prisoner. A Palestinian industrial park between Gaza and Israel is to open next month, while Israeli-Palestinian negotiation on a Palestinian seaport in Gaza are continuing. Gaza International, with the call letter LVGZ, wa designed in an Oriental style with graceful arch and elaborate tile imported from Morocco. The airport ha one passenger terminal, a VIP lounge and a three-kilometer (two-mile)-long runway. A 1-meter (4-foot)-tall poster of Arafat hang from the control tower wall. Palestine Airlines, with a small fleet that includes one Boeing 727, will begin direct flight to Jordan, Egypt and Saudi Arabia next week. In the first week, airport operation will have to rely on some improvisation. Major piece of equipment, including the control for the control tower, are still held up at the Israeli port of Ashdod. Tuesday's plane were guided to a safe landing by a portable control panel installed in a van. Despite it temporary shortcoming, many Palestinians consider the airport a big step toward independence. For those living in the small, overcrowded Gaza Strip, which is ringed by the Mediterranean on one side and by barbed wire on the other three, it may help ease the feeling of being trapped. Now we will be able to travel without the Israeli procedure that we usually must go through, said Khaled Salmeh, who study economics at Gaza City University and plan to fly next month to Saudi Arabia, for a pilgrimage to Mecca. The first Palestinian commercial flight landed at Amman's Marka Airport on Saturday, inaugurating an air route between Jordan and the autonomous Gaza Strip. The Falcon F-50 short-haul plane carried 48 passenger, mostly Palestinian businessmen and student. The plane will return later in the day. Last weekend, the Palestinians inaugurated an airport in the Mediterranean city of Gaza under the U.S.-brokered Wye River accord which envisages Israel ceding more land to the Palestinians in return for security guarantee. Jasser Ziyyad, director-general of the Jordanian Civil Aviation Authority, said Jordan agreed with the Palestinians earlier in the week on four weekly flight between them two by the Palestinian airline and two for Jordan. Meanwhile, Jordanian newspaper quoted unnamed Palestinian aviation official a saying one more passenger plane will be added to the Palestinian fleet of three short-haul aircraft. It said the addition wa necessary to transport an estimated 3,600 Palestinian Muslims who wish to travel to Saudi Arabia in early March to perform the annual pilgrimage to holy shrine in that country. Amid a flurry of last minute preparation, the young Palestinian Authority prepared Thursday for a milestone on the road to maturity: it very own airport. As part of the latest Mideast peace accord, Israeli and Palestinian official were to sign a protocol for the airport Friday and Palestinian negotiator said Gaza International Airport would open Sunday. The airport ha been nearly completed for month but Thursday official there added a few extra touch of yellow paint and fresh flower. It wa not clear who would be the first arrival at the airport. Officials said Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat may travel by car to Egypt in order to fly into the airport. Others hinted the first international flight may be reserved for US. President Bill Clinton who is scheduled to visit Gaza in December. Egypt's Middle East News Agency said the first plane to land would be carrying Egypt's health minister and several doctor bearing medical supply a gift. Israel, which will oversee security at the airport, ha forbidden it own citizen from using the airport initially, Israel's Channel 2 TV said. And all flight, which must be approved by Israel in advance, would not be allowed to fly over their airspace. After touring the airport Thursday, a US. official said more work needed to be done before the airport wa ready for Clinton. It may be a landing site for President Clinton, but we're not confirming, said the official who spoke on condition of anonymity. When you fly Air Force One, you're flying several plane and a lot of equipment, he said. The airport will be the first unfettered access route Palestinians will have out of the Gaza Strip. Israeli security official delayed two plane from taking off from the Palestinian airport on Wednesday, the latest tension in a rare area of Israeli-Palestinian cooperation. A plane bound for Amman, Jordan wa delayed for two hour over an Israeli demand that Palestinian official inspect the luggage of a Palestinian passenger, Israel radio reported.

Israeli airport security official were not available for comment. Abdel Razek Yehia, a Palestinian official who helped negotiate the airport's opening, confirmed the delay. He said such difference did not undermine the peace process. Every day we have difference, he told The Associated Press. We are all doing all our best to continue the peace process.

Palestinian official said that Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat and his entourage were aboard the plane in question, and that exempted the plane from Israeli security check.

(1903 GMT), the moment when the plane disappeared from the radar screen above Scotland. This wa a very positive, emotional day, Bert Ammerman of River Vale, New Jersey, whose brother Thomas died in the crash, said after the service. He said the people of Lockerbie have proven over the past 10 year that good intention can overcome evil. Earlier in the day, Prince Philip, the queen's husband, laid a wreath in Lockerbie's cemetery, where the town's Roman Catholic parish priest at the time of the crash spoke to about 200 victims' relative and townspeople about the ticking bomb of justice. Ten year ago, for you and for u, a bomb wa ticking, the Rev. Pat Keegans told the crowd, many of them visibly moved. Be assured of this there is another bomb ticking the irresistible bomb of justice and truth. Be certain that our wreath-laying today is not a symbolic gesture. It is a declaration that we will not rest until we have justice and truth, until all who are responsible for your death are held accountable, he said. Two Libyan suspect have been indicted in connection with the bombing, but have not yet been turned over for trial. Last week, Libya's Parliament gave it conditional approval for a trial in the Netherlands by a Scottish court, but said some obstacle remained. The plane had just reached it cruising altitude of 31,000 foot (9,400 kms), 42 minute after taking off from London's Heathrow Airport for New York, when it exploded in the night sky. The aircraft wa felled by a small amount of high explosive smuggled on in a portable radio hidden inside a suitcase, which made it way a checked baggage from Malta to Frankfurt, Germany, and then to London. Louis Farrakhan, the leader of a US. Muslim group, met with Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi on Sunday and congratulated him on his recovery from a hip injury, state-run Libyan radio reported. Improved health will enable Gadhafi to carry on his leading role in the service of Islamic cause in the world, Farrakhan wa quoted a saying by the radio, monitored by the British Broadcasting Corp. Later, state-run television showed Gadhafi dressed in a brown robe and holding a cane meeting Farrakhan at his ceremonial tent in the Libyan capital, Tripoli. The broadcast wa monitored in Cairo. Gadhafi underwent surgery last July after injuring his hip, reportedly while exercising. The visit wa Farrakhan's fifth to Libya in the past three year. The leader of the U.S.-based Nation of Islam most recently visited in December 1997. It wa not immediately clear how Farrakhan arrived in Libya or how long he would stay. Most visitor arrive by ferry from Malta or travel overland from Egypt or Tunisia; UN. sanction imposed in 1992 ban air travel to and from the country. Farrakhan repeatedly ha urged an end to the sanction, which were imposed to try to force Gadhafi to surrender two Libyans wanted in the 1988 bombing of a Pan Am jetliner over Lockerbie, Scotland, that killed 270 people. Citing the sanction and US. regulation, the Treasury Department prohibited Farrakhan from accepting a dlrs 250,000 prize he wa awarded by Gadhafi in September 1996 for human right work. The Treasury also barred his group from accepting Gadhafi's offer of a dlrs 1 billion gift for Nation of Islam activity. His Nation of Islam is a black nationalist group that say it is guided by the Koran. It is not considered a true Muslim sect by others who practice Islam. Farrakhan's message to America's black community is one of self-reliance, discipline, spirituality and separatism. Over the year, he ha said that white and black should live separately, that Jews are bloodsucker who have a gutter religion, and that white are subhuman. He accuses news medium of taking his comment out of context. TRIPOLI, Libya (AP) UN. Secretary-General Kofi Annan arrived in Libya Saturday for talk aimed at bringing to trial two Libyan suspect in the 1988 Pan Am bombing over Lockerbie, Scotland. Annan's one-day visit to meet with Libyan leader Col. Moammar Gadhafi followed report in the Libyan medium that Gadhafi had no authority to hand over the suspect. This position would indicate that Gadhafi is giving himself enough diplomatic room in the event he decides against giving up the suspect. Annan flew aboard a special plane from the Tunisian resort island of Jerba after receiving a clearance from the UN. Sanctions Committee to make the flight. A Libyan official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said Annan had arrived in the country but refused to give detail. Libyan medium, controlled by the government, did not report on the visit in a sign that the subject is of great sensitivity. It wa not known where Annan will meet with Gadhafi but diplomat said Friday the meeting will likely take place in the northern coastal town of Sirte, 400 kilometer (250 mile) east of the Libyan capital of Tripoli. Libya ha been under UN. sanction since 1992 for it refusal to hand over the two alleged intelligence agent, Abdel Basset Ali al-Megrahi and Lamen Khalifa Fhimah. They are accused by the United States and Britain of blowing up a Pan Am airliner over the Scottish village of Lockerbie on Dec. 21, 1988. All 259 people aboard the Boeing 747 and 11 people on ground were killed. A Libyan legal team ha been meeting regularly with Annan's legal counsel to discus a U.S.-British proposal to try the suspect in the Netherlands according to Scottish law and using Scottish judge. Dutch authority say they have made arrangement to hold the trial at Camp Zeist, a former air force base near Utrecht. On Friday, Annan said the UN. team ha done some good work on the Lockerbie dossier. We will try to resolve some problem and to find solution together once and for all, Annan said. But in an apparent bid to distance the Libyan leader from a decision on the suspect, Libya's official news agency JANA said Friday that Gadhafi is neither president nor prime minister nor foreign minister, but only the leader of the Libyan revolution. As such, Col. Gadhafi is not empowered to sign an agreement, the report said. JANA suggested that a decision on handing over the suspect would have to be approved by some 500 grassroots national committee before being decided by the Parliament. The Netherlands wa chosen a a venue for the trial after Libya itself proposed the trial be held in a third country. Since then a new hurdle ha cropped up over the imprisonment of the suspect, if convicted. Libya want them jailed in the Netherlands or Libya, but the United States and Britain say they should be imprisoned in Scotland and refuse to negotiate the issue. The UN. sanction on Libya do not cover oil export, Libya's economic lifeblood. They ban air travel to and from the country and arm sale. Some Libyan asset abroad have also been frozen. But many African country have defied the air ban and their leader have flown in and out of Libya. Libya's justice minister on Wednesday said the two suspect in the 1988 bombing of a Pan Am jetliner should not become victim of Western politics when they go on trial. We want to be sure that the only aim of the trial is to show the truth . and that it is held without a political or security background, Justice Minister Mohammed Belgasim al-Zuwiy said. He wa addressing the General People's Congress, or Parliament, which opened a debate that will decide the fate of the two men who are wanted in connection with the Dec. 21, 1988 bombing. A total of 270 people on board and on ground were killed when the jetliner blew up over the Scottish town of Lockerbie. Libya ha accepted in principle to a trial before a panel of Scottish judge in the Netherlands. But the hand over of the suspect ha been held up over Libya's demand for a guarantee that the two men, if convicted, will be jailed in Libya. The United States and Britain insist that the two suspect serve their prison term in Britain. The Parliament meeting, expected to last five day, is being held in the northern coastal town of Sirte and wa broadcast live on national television. Libyan medium have suggested that Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi doe not have the authority to hand over the suspect and that any decision would have to be approved by the Congress. Our argument is that since this is an exceptional trial, therefore this exception should include serving the jail term in Libya, maybe under UN. supervision, al-Zuwiy said. He said Libya is seeking the guarantee from the West to ensure that the trial will be honest, just . and without loophole that (would) leave our citizen in illegal, unjust and inappropriate circumstance. Opening the debate, Foreign Minister Omar al-Muntasser gave the background to the controversy since the Security Council imposed sanction on Libya in 1992 to force it to hand over the Lockerbie suspect for trial. The sanction include a ban on air travel from and to Libya, restricting diplomatic personnel and banning the purchase of oil equipment. Al-Zuwiy, the justice minister, said the two suspect will have the right to an appeal in the same court if it find them guilty. On Saturday, UN. Secretary-General Kofi Annan met with Gadhafi to iron out the detail. No agreement wa reached but Annan said Libya is expected to reach a decision soon. ","The UN, US,and Britain continue to press Libya to turn over the two Libyans accused of the Pan Am bombing over Lockerbie, Scotland.Libya has agreed to a trial for the two by a Scottish court in the Netherlands, but if found guilty, insists they be jailed in Libya, not Scotland as Britain wants.UN Secretary General Kofi Annan has visited Libya to urge the turnover of the two.Libyan leader Moammar Qadhafi feels the pressure of sanctions against his country, but has the support of neighboring Tunisia, Qatar, and US Muslim leader Louis Farrakhan.People in the US and British Isles attended special services marking the 10th anniversary of the bombing.","On the eve of the 10th anniversary of the 1988 downing of Pan Am 103 over Lockerbie, Scotland, there is hope that the Libya suspects might soon be brought to trial.UN General Secretary Kofi Annan has met with Libyan officials and an agreement in principle has been reached on the need for a trial.Libya seeks assurances that the trial will not be politicized.Libya has been under a UN flight ban since 1992 in an effort to get them to turn over the suspected bombers for trial by Scottish authorities.The citizens of Lockerbie marked the anniversary of the bombing with a memorial service.","UN sanctions barring air travel force Gadhafi to travel by land to visit Tunisia.Farrakhan visits Gadhafi and urges the UN to lift sanctions imposed to force the hand over of 2 1988 Pan Am bombing suspects.UN Secretary General Annan goes to Libya for talks aimed at bringing the suspects to trial.Annan thinks an arrangement could be made soon.Libya is serious and ready to find a solution.Libya agrees to the suspects being tried by Scottish judges in the Netherlands, but wants them jailed in Libya if convicted.The U.S. and Britain insist on British prison.Qatar supports Libya's position.U.S. and British leaders vow to bring the suspects to justice.",Kofi Annan talked with Gadhafi in Libya on bringing the 1988 Pan Am bombing suspects to trial.He thinks it will happen soon.Libya agrees to a trial in a 3rd country.The West demands any sentence be served in Scotland.Libya insists on a Libyan jail.Libya claims Gadhafi doesn't have authority to give up the suspects.The UN bans air travel to and from Libya to force the turning over of the suspects.Gadhafi traveled by car to visited Tunisia.Annan had UN clearance to fly to Libya.Qatar reaffirms its support for Libya.Louis Farrakhan visits Libya but the US bars him from accepting Libyan money.Ceremonies were held on the bombing's 10th anniversary.
44,"Turkey stepped up pressure on Italy for the extradition of captured Kurdish rebel leader Abdullah Ocalan, saying Sunday that granting him asylum would amount to opening door to terrorism. Kurds in Italy, Germany, Austria and Romania launched protest and hunger strike in fervent show of solidarity with the rebel leader. Kurds came to Rome by bus and car from across Western Europe for a 1,500-strong protest outside the military hospital where Ocalan is believed held under tight security. If Italy sends Ocalan back to Turkey, he'll be tortured for certain, said Dino Frisullo, an Italian supporter among the singing, chanting Kurds outside the military hospital. And very possibly he'll be killed. Ocalan wa arrested Thursday at the Rome airport a soon a he stepped off a plane from Moscow, where he had sought asylum after fleeing his hideout in Syria. He lead the outlawed Kurdistan Workers Party, PKK, which ha been fighting for Kurdish autonomy in southeastern Turkey since 1984. The conflict ha killed nearly 37,000 people. To Turkey, Ocalan is the nation's most-wanted criminal. If Western European nation open their arm (to the rebel) they will be taking on this great terrorism problem, Deputy Premier Bulent Ecevit told reporter in Ankara. If Italy continues to show the tolerance it showed yesterday, it will be opening it door to terrorism, Ecevit added, referring to Italy's handling of brawl that broke out during the first day of protest Saturday outside the Rome military hospital. The protest in Rome wa peaceful Sunday. Elsewhere in Europe, dozen of Kurds protested in Bucharest until chased away by police; 1,000 Kurds rallied in Bonn, some waving picture of the Kurd leader; and 100 Kurds in Vienna set up tent outside Parliament and declared a hunger strike. In Turkey, four Kurdish prison inmate were in critical condition after setting themselves on fire to protest Ocalan's arrest, the independent Human Rights Association said. Ocalan face the death penalty in Turkey, a fact that ha heightened opposition in Italy to his extradition. Although there have been no execution in Turkey since 1984, Italy ha consistently refused to extradite anyone if there were even a risk of capital punishment. Foreign Minister Ismail Cem left for Rome on Sunday to attend a meeting of European defense and foreign minister, saying he would tell Italian Foreign Minister Lamberto Dini that we expect a serious and fair approach. He criticized an Italian Justice Ministry official, who reportedly said Italy would deny Turkey's extradition request. To announce the result of an extradition trial that ha not yet even begun doe not go hand in hand with justice, Cem told reporter before departing. Turkish Defense Minister Ismet Sezgin indicated to reporter in Rome that Italian company could be shut out of Turkey's billion of dollar of defense contract if it fails to turn over the Kurd. In Italy, Dini told reporter in the city of Trento that the government would decide Ocalan's request for asylum in a clear and responsible manner. It wa up for the court to decide Turkey's extradition request, a well a an expected one from Germany, he said. In Istanbul, Turkish inmate at a prison took an Italian prisoner hostage to increase pressure for Ocalan's extradition. Metris prison official said the jail director wa talking to the inmate captor. Ocalan founded the Marxist-inspired PKK in 1978. He turned the group toward armed struggle in 1984, finding wide support among poor Kurds in the underdeveloped southeast. The Turkish army claim to have all but wiped out the PKK within Turkey but the rebel have haven in Iran, Syria, and Iraq and the fighting continues. INNSBRUCK, Austria (AP) -- Italian authority have turned back at least 136 people along the Austro-Italian border during an immigration crackdown prompted by the arrest of Kurdish leader Abdullah Ocalan, Austrian official said Monday. Most of those sent back since the crackdown began Saturday were refused entry into Italy because they had no visa or residence permit, the Austrians said. On Monday alone, about 70 people were refused entry at the Brenner Pass crossing point. They included Pakistanis, Indians, Yugoslavs and Chinese a well a Kurds, the Austrians said. The border crackdown appeared designed to prevent large number of Kurds living in Western Europe from flocking to Rome for protest in connection with Ocalan's arrest. Turkey ha asked for Ocalan's extradition. Austrian authority said many of those turned back had come from Germany. A Red Cross station wa set up at the border to assist those turned away to return to Germany if their residence permit were in order. Those without proper paper were detained by Austrian immigration. Greek medium and official leveled strong opposition Sunday to the possible extradition of Abdullah Ocalan, the arrested Kurdish guerrilla leader, to Greece's traditional rival Turkey. Ocalan, whose Kurdistan Workers Party ha waged a 14-year war with Turkey for autonomy in southeastern Turkey, is in prison custody in Rome where his arrest wa announced Friday. We do not give advise to other country, said parliament speaker Apostolos Kaklamanis. Europe ha a tradition of civilization and human right and I think a a rule it abides by that tradition. Greece ha not officially responded to Ocalan's arrest, which wa welcomed by the United States. But Greek government official have stressed support for Kurdish self-determination. We have repeatedly brought attention to the problem created by the blatant violation of human right in southeast Turkey, government spokesman Dimitris Reppas said late Saturday. In the past, Greece ha accused Ankara of waging a campaign of genocide against it Kurdish population. Ankara counter that Greece is harboring PKK terrorist. Both side angrily deny the charge. Thousands of Kurdish refugee from northern Iraq and Turkey have sought refuge in Greece. A group of more than 100 Kurds began a three-day fast in a downtown Athens square Saturday in support of Ocalan. Within hour of the PKK leader's arrest, Turkey requested his extradition to face a number of terrorism-related charge, which could carry the death penalty. Italy know what the fate of the Kurdish rebel will be if he fall into the hand of the Turkish military regime, said an editorial Saturday in the Greek daily Eleftherotypia. Ocalan ha requested political asylum in Italy a head of the Kurdish liberation movement and should be allowed to remain in a democratic country. He must not be extradited to Turkey. Greece's Communist party and a small leftist opposition party called on the government to exercise it influence on Italy to keep Ocalan there. The move wa also supported by a number of parliamentary deputy from the governing Socialist party. Earlier this month, a bloc of 109 lawmaker in the 300-member parliament issued an invitation for Ocalan to visit Greece. Turkish authority negotiated with an imprisoned mob leader for a second day Monday to secure the release of an Italian inmate held hostage to pressure Italy into extraditing a Kurdish rebel leader, a prosecutor said. The Italian, Mario Calascibetta, wa taken hostage Sunday by a group of inmate affiliated with mob leader Yasar Oz, to push for the return to Turkey of rebel leader Abdullah Ocalan, Turkey's most-wanted man. Ocalan is currently being held in Rome. Calascibetta, imprisoned in Istanbul's Metris jail since his detention in August, wa due to be handed over to Swiss police Monday. He is wanted for questioning in Switzerland in connection with a killing. Turkey's Anatolia news agency said Oz wa determined not to free his hostage until Italy agreed to Turkey's demand to send back Ocalan who is Turkey's most wanted man. He is not in any life threatening danger. We are not alarmed for his safety, said prosecutor Celil Demircioglu. The negotiation are continuing, we believe he will be freed very soon. Demircioglu said Calascibetta's extradition would now be delayed by a few day. He denied Turkish press report that the Italian wa being held at gun point. Oz is currently on trial on drugs-related charge. The mob ha often supported right-wing party and ultranationalist cause. At a time when the state is under pressure to crack down on the mob, it seemed convenient for Oz to show he wa backing the government's cause. A Kurdish rebel group fighting for autonomy in Turkey's southeast face an uncertain future following the detention in Rome of it founder and leader. Italian authority captured Abdullah Ocalan at Rome's international airport Thursday. Turkey ha asked for his extradition and Ocalan ha asked for political asylum. Some believe that without Ocalan, who ruled some 10,000 loyal rebel with an iron fist, his Kurdistan Workers Party, or PKK, will be left in disarray. If the head is dethroned, the rebellion get a mortal blow, said Cengiz Candar who ha been following the Kurdish insurgency for daily Sabah. But Ocalan ha been absent from the battlefield for at least a month, and others contend that the PKK is capable of operating without him. Let u not fall into false expectation that this will be the end of the PKK. The PKK ha already been acting like a headless monster for too long, said Ilnur Cevik of the English-language Turkish Daily News. Turkish newspaper have carried frequent report of power struggle within the PKK and said that Ocalan's grip on the PKK wa beginning to waver. Better known a Apo, Ocalan founded the Kurdistan Workers Party, PKK, in 1978. The movement turned to armed struggle in 1984, mainly focusing on guerrilla-style warfare in the southeast, but also carrying out bomb attack on civilian in western Turkey. Close to 37,000 people died in the conflict. His presence in Europe could also be a blessing in disguise for the group, forcing the PKK to transform itself from a rebel army into a political movement. Ocalan seemed to be moving in this direction before his detention. While living in Damacus, he increased his meeting with European deputy. This may be the PKK's best option. The Turkish military claim it ha made important battlefield gain and captured the PKK's second-in-command this year. The rebel also seem to have lost the support of Syria, which appears to have forced Ocalan to leave after Turkey threatened to attack it. Two Iraqi Kurdish group controlling Turkey's border with Iraq have also grown lukewarm. The PKK ha used their base in Syria and Iraq to wage cross-border operation. The PKK had two option. Either they choose to fight until they get control of the area, regardless of what image they project abroad, or they try to take on a political image. I believe (Ocalan) wanted to leave the Middle East so he could become a political figure, said Hikmet Tavak, managing director of the London-based Kurdish television, MED-TV. In Rome, spokesman for the PKK said Ocalan had carefully selected Italy because he felt there wa sympathy there for his cause. They also said Italian authority were warned that Ocalan would be arriving. There is a fair amount of sympathy for the Kurds in Europe, and if the movement gain political momentum, Turkey could come under more pressure from it western ally to grant the Kurds minority right. There are an estimated 8 to 15 million Kurds in Turkey. They are not recognized a an official minority and barred from using Kurdish in education or broadcasting. Kurdish politician have been jailed and group banned on charge of supporting the PKK. About 1,000 policeman were assigned to protect Turkish President Suleyman Demirel, who arrived Tuesday on a three-day official visit. President Thomas Klestil's invitation for the visit wa issued to take place during Austria's European Union presidency. Austrian government official reportedly will try to open up a longer-term perspective for Turkey's EU membership. A related topic certain to come up is Cyprus, among six country with whom the European Union started formal membership talk on Nov. 10. In a rare joint statement, the Netherlands, Germany and France said the inability of Greek and Turkish Cypriots to reconcile their difference weighed heavily on their island's membership chance. They spoke of fundamental problem in the Cyprus negotiating process, adding a political solution is urgently required. Austrian police took special measure to ensure the safety of the Turkish visitor. The political situation requires comprehensive security measure, the Austria Press Agency quoted Walter Zehetmayr, a senior police officer, a saying. The extra effort wa prompted by the arrest last week in Rome of Abdullah Ocalan, the chief of the Turkish Workers Party PKK, Zehetmayr said. He hinted that he expects large protest of Turkish group in Vienna. Demirel, who wa accompanied by five Cabinet member and a large trade delegation, is the first head of state of the Turkish Republic to visit Austria, APA said. Following his talk with Klestil and a luncheon in the president's residence, Demirel wa scheduled to meet Parliament president Heinz Fischer and other senior official. He wa also to deliver a speech to the Foreign Policy Society later Tuesday. Facing his first real foreign policy test, Prime Minister Massimo D'Alema must decide what to do with a prominent Kurdish rebel leader who wa arrested at the Rome airport on Thursday. Turkey want Italy to extradite the rebel, Abdullah Ocalan, leader of the Kurdistan Workers' Party, which is seeking Kurdish autonomy in southeastern Turkey. He is viewed in Turkey a a terrorist. Germany also ha a warrant out for his arrest on homicide charge. But D'Alema, a former Communist who wa appointed prime minister last month, is under pressure from leftist in his coalition to offer Ocalan political asylum. In a news conference Monday, D'Alema recognized the extent of the problem. The last thing we wanted wa an awkward and complicated situation like this one, he said. He noted that Italian law prohibits extradition of suspect to country that have the death penalty. Turkey ha capital punishment, though it say it will soon abolish it. Ocalan is being tried in absentia there on charge that could bring the death penalty. D'Alema said a committee in the Interior Ministry would determine whether Ocalan would qualify for political asylum, which would be possible if Ocalan's promise to renounce terrorism, issued Monday, hold up. We do not want someone who organizes terrorism in Italy, D'Alema said. This is an opportunity to find an exit from a bloody conflict. Earlier Monday, while member of D'Alema's government met with Turkish official who were in Rome for a European ministerial meeting, thousand of Kurds flooded into Rome to hold a demonstration and hunger strike in support of Ocalan. D'Alema's decision wa further complicated on Sunday when Turkish inmate in a prison in Istanbul took an Italian prisoner hostage, saying they would release him only after Italy extradited Ocalan. Monday, D'Alema said he would not bow to pressure. Turkey stepped up the pressure on Italy for the extradition of captured Kurdish rebel leader Abdullah Ocalan, warning Sunday that granting him asylum would amount to opening door to terrorism. In Rome, 1,500 Kurds massed for a second day of demonstration outside the military hospital where Ocalan is believed to be held. Kurds arrived from Germany and France to show solidarity with the rebel leader and a Kurdish group stopped at Rome's airport launched a hunger strike. If Italy sends the Kurd leader back to Turkey, he'll be tortured for certain, said Dino Frisullo, an Italian supporter among the singing, chanting Kurds outside the military hospital. And very possibly he'll be killed. Ocalan wa arrested at the Rome airport on Thursday a soon a he stepped off a plane from Moscow, where he had sought asylum after recently fleeing his hideout in Syria. He lead the outlawed Kurdistan Workers Party, PKK, which ha been fighting for Kurdish autonomy in southeastern Turkey since 1984. The conflict ha killed nearly 37,000 people.

He had been seeking political asylum in Russia after fleeing his hideout in Syria. He ha, 3rd graf Thousands of Kurds living in Romania closed down restaurant, shop and company to protest the arrest of leader Abdullah Ocalan by Italian authority, a newspaper reported Tuesday.

45,"Whether or not the talk between Exxon and Mobil lead to a merger or some other business combination, America's economic history is already being rewritten. In energy a in business like financial service, telecommunication and automobile, global competition and technology have made unthinkable combination practical, even necessary. Oil company like Exxon Corp. and Mobil Corp. have an additional pressure, one unthinkable le than two decade ago. Crude oil price have fallen sharply, plunging 40 percent just this year to level, adjusted for inflation, not seen since before the first oil embargo 25 year ago. As such, the oil company, having spent year cutting their cost, are desperate for further saving in order to continue operating profitably with such low price. Exxon and Mobil are the two largest, strongest competitor to emerge from the nation's most famous antitrust case, the 1911 breakup of John D. Rockefeller's Standard Oil Trust. Now they face a Royal Dutch/Shell Group that is larger than either of them. They will also confront a British Petroleum PLC made far more potent in the United States by it agreement this summer to buy Amoco Corp. for $48.2 billion. Industry executive say further deal on this scale are inevitable. Executives at both company did not return call Thursday for comment on the talk, and it wa unclear Thursday night what the outcome might be. But if Exxon and Mobil agree to become one, antitrust regulator are likely to be cautious about putting back together much of what they long ago broke apart. Even so, most oil industry analyst contend that improved efficiency from combining giant energy company would do more to lower cost than the more concentrated ownership of gas station and refinery would do to raise them. The ultimate beneficiary of all this will be the consumer, said Daniel Yergin, the chairman of Cambridge Energy Research Associates. If Exxon and Mobil ultimately do combine, the cost could prove heaviest for energy industry employee. Analysts say that of the about 80,000 global employee at Exxon, based in Irving, Texas, and the more than 40,000 at Mobil, in Fairfax, Va., thousand would be likely to lose their job. Exxon, with Lee R. Raymond, and Mobil, with Lucio A. Noto, both have chief executive who have been preoccupied with the humbling accommodation that low oil price have made necessary. Oil company were everybody's favorite target during the trust-busting era early this century and again during the Arab oil embargo of the 1970s. Now they seem especially vulnerable a demand weakens in much of the world, especially in economically troubled Asia, weighing further on already depressed price. They're pitiful, helpless giant, said Ronald Chernow, the author of Titan, a biography of John D. Rockefeller, Standard Oil's founder. As such, these giant are compelled to continue cutting cost and spreading the risk of their huge, expensive international project that are needed to develop oil reserve needed for the next century. Mobil, with $58.4 billion in sale last year, might seem large enough to undertake anything. But in competing for right to develop huge natural gas field in Turkmenistan, a former Soviet republic, Mobil wa unable to match Shell's offer to build a pipeline for $1 billion or more. Oil company have decided that they cannot count on a rebound in oil price to revive their fortune any time soon. Earlier this month, the Energy Department predicted that the collapse of Asian demand would continue to depress oil price for nearly a decade, and by a much a $5.50 a barrel in the year 2000. And Thursday, the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries put off until March any decision on extending their oil production cutback to prop up price. Moreover, improving technology for exploration and production and the opening of new region to development have added to the already huge supply of oil that is on hand now. In response, many energy company have already begun a new wave of cutback in their staff and operation. To further reduce cost, company like Mobil are forming partnership that stop short of full merger. Two year ago, Mobil agreed to combine it European refining and marketing operation with British Petroleum's, resulting in annual saving of about $500 million. Shell and Texaco then formed a refining partnership in the United States. In the face of these partnership, said Amy Jaffe, an energy analyst with the James A. Baker III Institute for Public Policy in Houston, if you're an Exxon, how do you compete? Though Mobil and Exxon might have high concentration of gas station in certain area of the United States, analyst say they have far more competition at the pump than before oil price collapsed in the 1980s. Thousands of convenience store now also sell gasoline produced by a variety of refining company, and foreign national oil company, like Venezuela's, sell their supply through acquired company like Citgo. Under Noto, Mobil ha been hunting for way of becoming large and lean enough to survive. He took the lead in the deal with British Petroleum and ha considered buying up smaller company. And he ha made it clear that corporate or personal pride would never block a deal. In the European agreement with British Petroleum, Mobil's red flying horse have come down from the front of many gas station, while the green and yellow BP logo have gone up. As major oil company team up, said John Hervey, an analyst with Donaldson Lufkin &AMP; Jenrette, If the price is right, ego will not get in the way. In the past, Mobil reportedly had further talk with British Petroleum about other combination, a well a talk with Amoco about forming an American refining venture. The company wa also interested in Conoco Inc. when DuPont Co. began looking to divest itself of that oil and gas business. But no deal were reached. More recently, there wa speculation on Wall Street that Mobil had been talking with Chevron Corp. British Petroleum purchase of Amoco put more pressure on Noto to seek a deal, Hervey said. I don't think this whole thing would have started if British Petroleum had not pulled the trigger, he said. The British Petroleum-Amoco deal, progressing quickly since the August announcement towards an expected $2 billion in annual saving, ha put even company a large a Exxon on the spot. There, Raymond ha so far concentrated more on making his operation more efficient than on finding ally. Though Royal Dutch/Shell's financial resource are greater than Exxon's, some analyst say Exxon still ha the size and soundness to absorb a company of Mobil's size. Only the largest oil company can afford to take advantage of today's best opportunity. Finding new field in the deep water off the coast of West Africa or in the Gulf of Mexico can require platform costing $1 billion or more. Producing oil in the state of the former Soviet Union ha taken more time and money than many investor anticipated. In September, Noto wa among the American executive invited by a Saudi leader visiting Washington to greatly step up investment in his country, too. Noto spent from 1977 to 1985 in Saudi Arabia himself, building up Mobil operation including a huge refinery. But any new partnership with the Saudis might require both Mobil's connection and Exxon's capital. Back when Standard Oil organized it operation by state, Exxon wa Standard Oil of New Jersey, while Mobil wa Standard Oil of New York. Even after the Standard Oil monopoly wa broken up, they remained for several year in the same building in Manhattan. Chernow, the Rockefeller biographer, noted that two piece of the Standard Oil trust are already likely to be united. British Petroleum bought Standard Oil of Ohio in the 1970s, and Amoco wa once Standard Oil of Indiana. The break-up of Standard Oil and the resulting competition ha often been cited a a precedent for the current antitrust action against Microsoft. Chernow see no reason why allowing an Exxon acquisition of Mobil to go through should suggest more leniency for Microsoft. Exxon would not be obviously larger than it leading competitor, the way Microsoft is, he said. In the energy business today, he added, there are other large dinosaur that stalk that particular jungle. The board of Exxon Corp. and Mobil Corp. are expected to meet Tuesday to consider a possible merger agreement that would form the world's largest oil company, a source close to the negotiation said Friday. The source, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the prospect were good for completing an agreement. Exxon and Mobil confirmed Friday that they were discussing way to combine. They cautioned, however, that no agreement had been reached and there wa no assurance they would reach one. The statement sent the stock of both company surging, suggesting investor believe the company will combine. Shares of Exxon, the biggest US. oil company, rose $1.6875, or 2.3 percent, to $74375. Shares of Mobil, the No. 2 US. oil company, rose $7.625, or 9.7 percent, to $86. Some analyst said that if the two giant reached an agreement, it wa likely to be in the form of a takeover by Exxon of Mobil. Exxon is far larger and financially stronger. Analysts predicted that there would be huge cut in duplicate staff from both company, which employ 122,700 people. Adam Sieminski, an oil analyst for BT Alex. Brown, said that the company would probably make cut to save about $3 billion to $5 billion a year. Sieminski and other analyst said Exxon would have to offer a premium of about 15 to 20 percent over it price prior to Monday, when serious speculation of an Exxon takeover of Mobil first circulated and sent Mobil share up sharply. They said the transaction would probably be an exchange of Mobil share for Exxon share. Based on Mobil's $75.25 share price a week ago, a takeover of the company would be worth about $70 billion. The merger discussion come against a backdrop of particularly severe pressure on Lucio Noto, the chairman, president and chief executive of Mobil, to find new reserve of oil and natural gas and to keep big project profitable at a time of a deep decline in crude oil price. This is one of the most intelligent chief executive in the business and a man of considerable ability but he inherited some serious structural problem in his company, said J. Robin West, the chairman of Petroleum Finance Co., a consulting group to the energy industry based in Washington. He said that Mobil's prime asset include the Arun natural gas field in Indonesia, one of the largest in the world, which ha contributed up to one-third of Mobil's profit for year but is beginning to run down. The field, in production since 1977, supply liquefied natural gas to Japan and Korea. Although Mobil under Noto ha moved quickly to cut cost and muscle it way into promising new area such a Kazakhstan, where it is a partner in a joint venture to develop the huge Tengiz oil field, the payoff from such venture is many year away. Other company face similar strain. The challenge is to replace their crown jewel and grow in an increasingly competitive environment, West said. Noto ha not been shy about sitting down with other company such a British Petroleum and Amoco this year to see if a combination made sense. Although Exxon chairman Lee Raymond head a much stronger and bigger company than Mobil, he ha not been immune to the strain on the global petroleum business. Those strain intensified this year when Russia's economic collapse raised the risk of Exxon's extensive exploration venture in that country. Exxon ha also been more of a follower than a leader in huge project in the deep offshore field, where major find have been made near West Africa and in the Gulf of Mexico. News that Exxon and Mobil, two giant in the energy patch, were in merger talk last week is the biggest sign yet that corporate marriage are back in vogue. Even before that combination came to light, deal-making wa fast and furious. On Monday alone, $40.4 billion in corporate acquisition were either announced or declared imminent. Driving the resurgence in merger is a roaring stock market, the recognition by major corporation that it is getting harder to increase revenue internally and growing confidence among market player that the economy will not plunge into a recession next year. There are also industry-specific issue, like low crude-oil price that are driving oil giant into one another's arm. But for investor, mega-marriages are not where the real money is to be made. Rather, it is among smaller company, whose still-depressed stock price are luring bigger acquirer with stock that again are near their peak. If Exxon buy Mobil at close to current price, deal this month will have a total value of more than $140 billion off from April's peak of $244 billion but three time the volume in September, when the stock market wa falling. Which industry are likely to witness the most merger? Tom Burnett, director of Merger Insight, an institutional investment advisory firm in New York, say more deal are a certainty in energy, which is suffering from low crude-oil price. Burnett also say health care executive are finding it tougher than ever to lift earnings. But smaller company may be a better way to play the takeover game. Charles LaLoggia, editor of the Special Situation Investor newsletter in Potomac, Md., said: Some of the premium in high-profile merger aren't so great anymore. The value are in small-cap stock. Another reason is that deal involving smaller-cap candidate are le likely to incur the wrath of antitrust regulator. LaLoggia reckons that the odds of picking takeover winner increase if an investor focus on company already partially owned by another. In the energy sector, Houston Exploration qualifies, he says; the oil and gas driller is 66 percent owned by Keyspan Energy. He also belief more deal are imminent among drug chain and supermarket. Longs Drug Stores and Drug Emporium, he say, remain acquisition candidate, though neither is controlled by another concern. In supermarket, LaLoggia like the Great Atlantic &AMP; Pacific Tea Co., 55 percent owned by Tengelmann Group of Germany. Another pick is Smart and Final, an operator of warehouse-style store that is 55 percent owned by the US. subsidiary of Groupe Casino, France's largest supermarket chain. Both A&AMP;P and Smart and Final are trading at just about book value, LaLoggia said. Takeovers typically occur above book value. Finally, he recommends National Presto Industries, a maker of housewares and electrical appliance, which is trading near $39, close to it low for the year. The company ha $30 a share in cash on it balance sheet, no debt and a dividend yield of 5 percent. After last month's announced acquisition of Rubbermaid by the Newell Co., LaLoggia think National Presto could find itself in an acquirer's cross-hairs. It wa new high again for the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock and Nasdaq composite index Friday a anticipation of a new wave of merger and a general rush by investor to join the equity rebound pushed stock up. Oil stock led the way a investor soaked up the news of continuing talk between Exxon and Mobil on a merger that would create the world's largest oil company. Internet and computer stock also rallied, helped in part by the announcement on Tuesday of America Online's purchase of Netscape Communications in a three-way deal involving Sun Microsystems. At the same time, Germany's Deutsche Bank and Bankers Trust are scheduled to formally announce their merger on Monday. There is no question that the merger euphoria is the headline, said Hugh Johnson, chief investment officer at the First Albany Corp. But the flow into mutual fund is also strong. Exxon rose 1 11/16, to 74], while Mobil jumped 7|, to 86. Chevron, reflecting the bounce that other oil company got from the merger news, climbed 5\, to 85|. Exxon and Chevron, along with IBM, which rose 3\, to 170, were the main driver of the Dow Jones industrial average. It climbed 18.80 point, or two-tenths of a percent, to 9,33308. It now stand just 41 point short of the record it set Monday and up 1.9 percent for the week. Mobil, along with Exxon, Chevron, IBM and Microsoft, which rose 3 13/16, to 128 1/16, were the power behind the S &AMP; P. It climbed 5.46 point, or five-tenths of a percent, to 1192.33, a new high, the second of the week. It jumped 2.5 percent in the last five trading day. Cisco Systems, up 2 15/16, to 80; MCI Worldcom, up 1 11/16, to 62 7/16; Sun Microsystems, up 4|, to 80], and Microsoft pushed the Nasdaq index to it first new high since July 20. The technology-heavy index finished 31.23 point, or 1.57 percent, higher, at 2,01644. It wa up 4.6 percent for the week. Whether Friday's gain will stick will not be known before Monday. It wa a shortened trading session, with the New York Stock Exchange closing at 1 p.m., and trading volume, at 257 million share, made it the lightest day of the year. In the bond market, which also closed early because of the Thanksgiving weekend, the price of the 30-year Treasury bond rose 11/32, to 101 12/32. The bond's yield, which move in the opposite direction from the price, fell to 5.16 percent from 5.18 percent on Wednesday. Long-term and short-term yield all slipped lower this week despite new economic data that indicated the economy wa stronger in the third quarter than expected and seems to be moving along at a good pace in the current quarter. This small recovery in the face of stronger growth is probably because new inflation number show that price are in check and analyst are still forecasting that the economy will begin to slow down next year. Many analyst have noted during the eight-week stock market rally, in which the Nasdaq composite index jumped 42 percent, that investor were buying again even though major financial problem around the world including a slumping Asia, a weakening Latin America and a troubled Russia have not been resolved. Johnson said he thought that investor, inspired by the Federal Reserve's three interest rate cut in two month and by the new stimulus package in Japan, assume that these problem will be solved. Investors are looking over the valley and they like what they see, he said. But he worry that the financial crisis, which began in Thailand in July 1997 and wa intensified by the effective default of Russia in August, will not go away quickly. It seems that in every financial crisis, everybody get the impression that the storm ha passed, Johnson said. But it is never that easy. Exxon Corp. and Mobil Corp. have held discussion about combining their business operation, a person involved in the talk said Wednesday. It wa unclear Wednesday whether talk were continuing. If the company were to merge, it would create the largest US. company in term of revenue. A possible merger wa reported separately by both The Financial Times of London and Bloomberg News. The reported talk between Exxon, whose annual revenue exceeds that of Wal-Mart and General Electric, and Mobil, the No. 2 US. oil company, come a oil price have sunk to their lowest in almost 12 year. A combined company would be bigger than Royal Dutch/Shell Group, the world's largest oil company by revenue. Financial term of the discussion could not be determined Wednesday. Neither Exxon or Mobil would comment. Any union would reunite two part of John D. Rockefeller's Standard Oil Trust, which wa broken up by the Supreme Court in 1911. Exxon wa then known a Standard Oil of New Jersey, and Mobil consisted of two companies: Standard Oil of New York and Vacuum Oil. Both Exxon, which ha a market value of $176.7 billion, and Mobil, which ha a market value of $61.1 billion, have a history of being fiercely independence. Both have already cut back on staff and made themselves lean in order to survive long period when oil price are low. But this ha been a particularly unsettling year for the oil industry, and there is little prospect that crude oil price will recover soon. Consequently, chief executive of most oil company have had to swallow their pride and look for suitable partner. This summer, British Petroleum announced a $48.2 billion agreement to buy Amoco Corp., creating the world's third-largest oil company and prompting analyst to predict even more widespread consolidation. It showed that megamergers are doable, said Adam Sieminski, an analyst for BT Alex. Brown. He added, however, that a combination between Exxon and Mobil would not be an easy match because Mobil ha been known for being a proud company that ha said in the past that it would not want to merge. Exxon, he added, is a well run company that like to grow it own business. He added that the head of both company, Lee Raymond, the chairman of Exxon, which is based in Irving, Texas, and Lucio Noto, the chairman, president and chief executive of Mobil, which is based in Fairfax, Va., are different personality. It will not be easy, he said of combining the two far-flung company, which have vast network of refinery and gas station that overlap in the United States and Europe. If you offer enough money you can make anything happen, he added. Both company are under pressure to find new field of oil to help them survive in the long term. Like other oil company, they had hoped to quickly tap into the vast reserve of Russia. Even though they were prepared to spend billion, they have held back because of the political and economic crisis in Russia and great reluctance by Russian official and oil company to give up control of vast field. Thus they have had to fall back on their own exploration area such a the deep water in the Gulf of Mexico and West Africa. Such exploration is very expensive, and even when large field are found it often take platform costing $1 billion to bring the oil into production. Oil price have been under pressure for more than a year, falling more than 40 percent from the $20-a-barrel level because of growing inventory of petroleum and declining Asian demand caused by the economic crisis there. On Wednesday, crude oil for January delivery fell 29 cent, or 2.6 percent, to $11.86 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange, close to the 12-year low of $11.42 reached on June 15. Members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries and some other oil-producing nation, notably Mexico, have tried to stem the price drop with pledge to cut back on production. But those pledge have not always been honored, and rally in the oil market this year have proven short-lived. OPEC member on Wednesday continued their discussion on extending their production cutback, and an agreement is expected a early a Thursday. In the spring, OPEC agreed to reduce production by 2.6 million barrel a day, about 3 percent of the daily world supply of 74 million barrel. The main result of that agreement appears to have been to keep oil price from falling below $10 a barrel. Washington regulator said Wednesday that they had not been notified about the Exxon-Mobil discussion. The Federal Trade Commission is still reviewing British Petroleum's pending purchase of Amoco. An Exxon-Mobil deal would be certain to receive several months' worth of scrutiny by the commission, which would review how much of the industry such a merger would control. Analysts and investment banker were split about the logic of the possible merger. Some pointed to difficulty that the company could face if they were combined. If you asked me if Exxon needed to be bigger, the answer is probably no, said Garfield Miller, president of Aegis Energy Advisors Corp., a small independent investment bank based in New York. It is hard to say that there is anything in particular to gain. In particular, Miller said, the two company have enormous similarity in their domestic refining and marketing business. They really do overlap quite a bit, he said. You really do wonder what is the benefit of all that redundancy. Another investment banker in the energy business, speaking on the condition of anonymity, also questioned the rationale for the discussed merger. When you look at the BP-Amoco deal, you can rationalize it, the banker said. But none of those reason apply to an Exxon-Mobil deal. But Amy Jaffe, an energy research analyst with the James A. Baker III Institute for Public Policy, said the combination of the two company would be logical, in part because it would give them greater influence in bidding for project in Middle Eastern country. This is a deal that make sense, Ms. Jaffe said. With this combined company, there is no project that would be too big. In addition, Ms. Jaffe said, the merger would provide each company with new oil and gas asset in area of the world where they had little influence. There are a lot of complimentary asset where they are not redundant, she said. She said that Exxon, for example, ha a strong presence in Angola, while Mobil doe not. And Mobil ha significant asset in the Caspian Sea and Nigeria, where Exxon is weak. Exxon and Mobil, the nation's two largest oil company, confirmed Friday that they were discussing a possible merger, and antitrust lawyer, industry analyst and government official predicted that any deal would require the sale of important large piece of such a new corporate behemoth. Those divestiture would further reshape an industry already undergoing a broad transformation because of the low price of oil. But the merger and other corporate combination are also beginning to create a new regulatory climate among antitrust official, one that may prove particularly challenging to Exxon and Mobil. Although the company only confirmed that they were discussing the possibility of a merger, a person close to the discussion said the board of both Exxon and Mobil were expected to meet Tuesday to consider an agreement. Shares of both surged on the New York Stock Exchange. Oil exploration and drilling interest would not necessarily present antitrust problem in an Exxon-Mobil merger because competition in those area is brisk. But in retailing and marketing operation, an Exxon-Mobil combination would be like Ford merging with General Motors, Macy's with Gimbels, said Stephen Axinn, an antitrust lawyer in New York who represented Texaco in it acquisition of Getty more than a decade ago. In the United States, the deal would come under the purview of the Federal Trade Commission, which under the Clinton administration ha examined large corporate merger with a vigor not seen since the 1970s. The agency ha blocked a number of proposed merger, such a the $4 billion combination of Staples and Office Depot, the two largest office supply discounter, and two deal involving the four largest drug wholesaler. On the other hand it ha approved other big merger, such a Boeing's $14 billion acquisition of McDonnell Douglas. The agency's analysis of an Exxon-Mobil combination, a senior official said Friday, will turn on how it might resemble John D. Rockefeller's Standard Oil trust before it wa dismantled by the Supreme Court in 1911. The big antitrust issue is whether, by a merger or alliance, they will be able to get the competition of one another off their back, particularly against the background of BP-Amoco and Shell-Texaco, said Eleanor M. Fox, a professor at the New York University School of Law and an antitrust expert. It may be that we are looking at a consolidation on the world level that looked like the consolidation on the national level 100 year ago. The Federal Trade Commission recently approved a significant joint venture between Shell and Texaco after the venture agreed to sell a refinery and divest some retailing operation in Hawaii and California. It is also considering the proposed $54 billion merger of British Petroleum and Amoco and will now have to re-examine that combination in light of the new talk between Exxon and Mobil. In the past, when there have been two merger involving the same industry, the government ha considered them together in deciding how to deal with them, said Terry Calvani, a former commissioner at the Federal Trade Commission whose client now include Chevron. But coming in the aftermath of the Shell-Texaco and BP-Amoco deal, a combination of Exxon and Mobil, which have significantly overlapping retail and refinery business in the United States and Europe, pose question that antitrust official have not confronted since the 1980s. It's a real test case, said Frederick Leuffer, a senior energy analyst at Bear Stearns. If the FTC let this one go through without major divesting, then everything would be fair game. Why couldn't GM merge with Ford? While the 1911 breakup of Standard Oil is viewed by Washington official and industry executive a ancient history, Exxon and Mobil have become the dominant rival in some retailing and refining market, and in the production of lubricant and petrochemical. Leuffer said he believed divestiture necessary in this case could be so large that they are deal-breakers. Other analyst and lawyer, while disagreeing that the required divestiture could kill the deal, said the company would nonetheless have to shed significant operation and that they expected challenge to be raised by a broad spectrum of constituent, including competitor, customer and state official. These are not absolute obstacle, said John Hervey, an analyst at Donaldson Lufkin &AMP; Jenrette. In the past, when two big oil company have merged, aggressive attorney general from the state have almost always become involved in raising question because of the high visibility of the local gas station. When a state attorney general drive by and see four station on a corner and two of them are Mobil and Exxon, they are certain to raise question, Axinn said. Exxon and Mobil have significant concentration of retailing and marketing concern in the Northeast, the Southwest and the West Coast, where they also have big refining operation. Because the two company are involved in everything from exploration and shipping to refining and retailing, the meaning of the deal for consumer will take month for the regulator to sort out. The regulator examining such a transaction would dissect each business, determine whether it market is global, national or more local, and determine whether the combined entity ha too high a concentration of the business in those area. Experts agreed that the regulator are most likely to permit Exxon and Mobil to keep their exploratory and oil production business because those area are already highly competitive and a merger would not result in higher price. Hervey said those market are already so fragmented that the combined market share of major American and European oil company is only 17 percent. They have been downsized, cut back and re-engineered. So when the 900 or so remaining blue-collar worker here at Mobil's largest domestic refinery, out of about 1,500 a decade ago, heard last week that their company wa discussing a possible merger with Exxon, it wa like a siren warning them that an already suspect valve might be about to blow. I think it's a terrible thing, said Dick Mabry, a refinery operator, a he emerged in the plant's artificial twilight from the main gate after his 12-hour shift ended at 4:30 on Sunday morning. He stopped to rub eye rimmed with red, but on this topic his bedtime could be delayed. It's a revival of the Standard Oil Company. It's going to put 20 or 30 thousand people out of work. I think the Justice Department should step in and stop it. Ernest Lewis, whose overall bore a Big E patch appropriate to his scale, added his uh-huh's. The latest evidence of where thing were heading hulked right nearby, he said, glancing over at a new power plant likely to be operated by an outside company without the union that now man the refinery's generator. But if the Mobil Corp. ha to be sold, Lewis said, noting the gain in his company stock holding, a buyer a solid and large a the Exxon Corp. might be the least of all evil. If we merged with Chevron, we'd be Moron, he added. A growing American economy that can make a billionaire out of someone with an unproven idea for Internet marketing is still sloughing off worker in older industry, in petroleum a much a any. Those here point to the tote board by the Beaumont plant's brick headquarters, that they say show they have already handled 171 million barrel out of 130 million planned for the full year. But the number that matter even more are the one like 89.9, 88.9, even 81.9, on nearby gas station the lowest price, after inflation, since the Depression. Which is why Mobil and Exxon are considering combining into the world's largest oil company. Some people close to the talk cautioned that no deal would be considered by their board until at least Tuesday, maybe Wednesday. And that is why, beginning last Wednesday evening, the phone at the home of Jimmy Herrington, the president of the Oil, Chemical and Atomic Workers Local 4-243 rang without stop. No, he didn't know about that merger talk on television, said Herrington, who also work full-time producing lubricant. He had asked some Mobil manager, in a meeting earlier this month, about all the rumor, but they said they had heard nothing. Oil industry analyst say that the first target of a combined company's effort to cut billion of dollar in annual cost would be the office staff and the professional, like geologist and engineer, in the field. One company's accountant could almost do the work for two. But the crew here fully expect that an Exxon or any other buyer would ask yet again whether the refinery could turn more crude oil into gasoline, motor oil and other product with even fewer people. Union leader raise the prospect that Exxon would have to sell the refinery. Antitrust regulator, they say, are bound to notice that Exxon ha refinery an hour's drive in one direction and three hour in the other, along a Gulf of Mexico crescent that form the petrochemical industry's home. The Beaumont plant, a steaming, humming chemistry set lining the Neches River off the Gulf, ha become the prime provider of livelihood here since it wa built almost under the spray of the nearby Spindletop gusher. With mounting overtime that can stretch a shift to 16 hour or more, worker regularly make $55,000 or $65,000 a year. People go there to retire there, Herrington said, a he drove around the plant's fenced periphery. Lewis, in his 17th year, is a third-generation employee. But his nephew laboring here too is the exception. The worker streaming to and from the plant before dawn are mostly balding or going gray, a sign that for a full generation the refinery ha been more concerned about how to get rid of worker than how to attract them. The cutback have, so far, come through attrition, with retirement often encouraged by incentive. But the plywood sheet covering the window of most of the fast food place and gas station around Herrington's union hall advertise that the best time are long gone. His member chafe at the expert who come in from Wall Street to question the justification for every person's job. In tiring and dangerous task, they question the elimination of most relief laborer in favor of covering vacation and sickness with overtime (although some like the extra pay, and they say the plant ha become safer over the years). They complain about the growing number of outside contractor taking over formerly unionized task. But with many worker choosing to invest at least some retirement saving in Mobil stock, a 1990s ethos is gaining. Some share credit with the plant's management for the efficiency measure they agree are necessary for true job security. Some take the attitude that every company is always for sale. They will not be too concerned about what we feel about it, said Sam Salim, one of the electrical plant worker whose future is uncertain. But if they fork out $60 billion? I'd look it over. With most Mobil executive saying a little a possible for now, call on Sunday to the local plant manager and a company spokesman did not elicit a peep. Union leader, however, are already squawking. I don't believe creating new monopoly is the way to prop up the industry, said Robert Wages, a former refinery operator himself and now the union's president, by telephone Saturday. Nevertheless, with admirable foresight the union negotiated a clause in last November's three-year contract extension guaranteeing that any company buyer would have to keep to it term. Many member, who typically came to work after high school, are already molding the oil companies' latest exploit into case study fit for rapacious MBA's. They're the biggest, said Bobby Whisneant, an assistant operator in the gasoline and lubrication oil unit, referring to Exxon. He wa coming, early on Sunday morning, through a plant gate whose white canopy seems borrowed from a self-service station. So they go buy the second biggest. That's one way to get rid of the competition. I just hope it's not something like the 80 buying company and scrapping them. Or something like the Robber Baron era a century before, said Mabry, another operator. Didn't the teacher teach u all through school that the Standard Oil Company would never come back? Remember that? he said, looking to his friend, Lewis, the Big E, for agreement. But I better shut up. I still work for Mobil. Used to, Lewis said. Exxon Corp. and Mobil Corp. have held discussion about combining their business operation, a person involved in the talk said Wednesday. It wa unclear Wednesday whether talk were continuing. If the company were to merge, it would create the largest US. company in term of revenue. A possible merger wa reported separately by both The Financial Times of London and Bloomberg News. The reported talk between Exxon, whose annual revenue exceeds that of General Electric Co., and Mobil, the No. 2 US. oil company, came a oil price sank to their lowest in almost 12 year. A combined company would be bigger than Royal Dutch/Shell Group, the world's largest oil company by revenue. Financial term of the discussion could not be determined Wednesday. Neither Exxon or Mobil would comment. Any union would reunite two part of John D. Rockefeller's Standard Oil Trust, which wa broken up by the Supreme Court in 1911. Exxon wa then known a Standard Oil of New Jersey, and Mobil consisted of two companies: Standard Oil of New York and Vacuum Oil. As oil price have plummeted to level last seen in the mid-1980s, oil company have been under pressure to cut cost. Exxon, which ha a market value of $176.7 billion, and Mobil, which ha a market value of $61.1 billion, both have history of being fiercely independent, and both have already cut back on staff and made themselves lean to survive even during a prolonged period of low oil price. But this ha been a particularly unsettling year for the oil industry, and there is little prospect that crude oil price will recover soon. Consequently, chief executive of most oil company have had to swallow their pride and look for suitable partner. This summer, British Petroleum announced an agreement to buy Amoco Corp. for $48.2 million, creating the world's third-largest oil company and prompting analyst to predict even more widespread consolidation. It showed that megamergers are doable, said Adam Sieminski, an analyst for BT Alex. Brown. He added, however, that any combination between Exxon and Mobil would not be an easy match because Mobil ha been known for being a proud company that ha said in the past that it would not want to merge. Exxon, he added, is a well-run company that like to grow it own business. He added that the head of both company, Lee Raymond, the chairman of Exxon, which is based in Irving, Texas, and Lucio Noto, the chairman, president and chief executive of Mobil, which is based in Fairfax, Va., are different personality. It will not be easy, he said of combining the two far-flung company, which have vast network of refinery and gas station that overlap in the United States and Europe. If you offer enough money you can make anything happen, he added. Both company are under pressure to find new field of oil to help them survive in the long term. Like other oil company, they had hoped to quickly tap into the vast reserve of Russia. Even though they were prepared to spend billion, they have held back because of the political and economic crisis in Russia and great reluctance by Russian official and oil company to give up control of vast field. Thus they have had to fall back on exploration area of their own such a the deep water in the Gulf of Mexico a well a West Africa and part of Asia. Such exploration is very expensive, and even when a big field is discovered, platform costing $1 billion or more are required to bring the it into production. Oil price have been under pressure for more than a year, falling more than 40 percent from the $20-a-barrel level because of growing inventory of petroleum and declining Asian demand caused by the economic crisis there. On Wednesday, crude oil for January delivery fell 29 cent, or 2.6 percent, to $11.86 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange, close to the 12-year low of $11.42 reached on June 15. Members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries and some other oil-producing nation, notably Mexico, have tried to stem the price drop with pledge to cut back on production. But those pledge have not always been honored, and rally in the oil market this year have proven short-lived. OPEC member on Wednesday continued their discussion on extending their production cutback, and an agreement is expected a early a Thursday. In the spring, OPEC agreed to reduce production by 2.6 million barrel a day, about 3 percent of the daily world supply of 74 million barrel. The main result of that agreement appears to have been to keep oil price from falling below $10 a barrel. Washington regulator said Wednesday that they had not been notified about the Exxon-Mobil discussion. The Federal Trade Commission is still reviewing British Petroleum's pending purchase of Amoco. An Exxon-Mobil deal would be certain to receive several months' worth of scrutiny by the commission, which would review how much of the industry the combined company would control. Analysts and investment banker were split about the logic of a potential deal. Some pointed to difficulty that the company could face if they were combined. If you asked me if Exxon needed to be bigger, the answer is probably no, said Garfield Miller, president of Aegis Energy Advisors Corp., a small independent investment bank based in New York. It is hard to say that there is anything in particular to gain. In particular, Miller said, the two company have enormous similarity in their domestic refining and marketing business. They really do overlap quite a bit, he said. You really do wonder what is the benefit of all that redundancy. Another investment banker in the energy business, speaking on the condition of anonymity, also questioned the rationale for the discussed merger. When you look at the BP-Amoco deal, you can rationalize it, the banker said. But none of those reason apply to an Exxon-Mobil deal. But Amy Jaffe, an energy research analyst with the James A. Baker III Institute for Public Policy, said the combination of the two company would be logical, in part because it would give them greater influence in bidding for development project in the Middle East. This is a deal that make sense, Ms. Jaffe said. With this combined company, there is no project that would be too big. Ms. Jaffe said the proposed deal would provide each company with asset in area where it had little influence. There are a lot of complementary asset where they are not redundant, she said. She said that Exxon, for example, ha a strong presence in Angola, while Mobil doe not. And Mobil ha significant asset in the Caspian Sea and Nigeria, where Exxon is weak. Times are tough in the oil patch. Still, it boggles the mind to accept the notion that hardship is driving profitable Big Oil to either merge, a British Petroleum and Amoco have already agreed to do, or at least to consider the prospect, a Exxon and Mobil are doing. Still, Big Oil and small oil are getting squeezed by low petroleum price and the high capital cost of exploration. Given the exotic locale of the most promising, untapped field, it seems unlikely that exploration will get cheaper. And with West Texas crude trading at around $12 a barrel, it seems a safe bet oil that won't be selling for $100 a barrel by the turn of the century a price some analyst in the early 1980s were predicting it would reach. Philip K. Verleger Jr., publisher of Petroleum Economics Monthly and a senior adviser to the Brattle Group, a Cambridge, Mass., consulting firm, spent some time late last week talking about Mobil, Exxon and the changing dynamic of the oil business. Following are excerpt from the conversation: Q. (italics)There is a lot of focus on the antitrust aspect of an Exxon-Mobil deal. Do you see any problems?(end italic) A. Let me say right off that I don't think this is a done deal. I think it is far from that. But if it were to happen, I don't see many problem. BP Amoco is the perfect end-to-end merger, one in which there is little or no overlap with the company you are merging with. Exxon-Mobil come close. The first issue is competition in local market. The only possible problem area there is on the West Coast, but both company are pretty small player there. If there is a reason this merger might get extra attention, it will be because Exxon and Mobil have not been terribly friendly toward either the Clinton administration's or the European Union's position on global warming. Q. (italics)Why are you skeptical about the deal?(end italic) A. Well, Mobil ha been trying to get bigger. They had talk with Amoco. They wanted to buy Conoco. But I don't understand where Lucio Noto, Mobil's chief executive, fit into this. That could be an impediment to an agreement, because in a merger I don't think he ha a place, and he ha been a very strong leader. Q. (italics)Mobil is the country's second-biggest oil company, behind Exxon. Why do they need to get bigger?(end italic) A. In the first decade of the next century, the really big exploration opportunity will be very capital intensive, and only company with the deepest pocket will be able to stay in the game: Royal Dutch, Exxon and BP Amoco. Companies of Mobil's size are probably marginal player. Q. (italics)That suggests Mobil ha been harder hit than Exxon by the downturn in prices.(end italic) A. From 1988 to 1996, Exxon's exploration and production expenditure rose 8 percent. Mobil's rose 14 percent. But Mobil's expenditure were much more sensitive to price elasticity of oil than Exxon's. They were pushing the envelope, and when price fell they had to cut back. Exxon ha tried to build a very large presence systematically, without paying much attention to month-to-month or even year-to-year fluctuation in oil price. They are brutally efficient. Q. (italics)Earlier this month the Energy Department said oil price would stay soft for nearly a decade. Do you agree?(end italic) A. You know, every time I see forecast that go out that far I want to go out and buy stock in oil company. I think we are going to see low oil price for six month to a year. It is conceivable we could go into the next century with oil at $5 a barrel, depending on what happens to the world economy. During that period, we are going to see a substantial reduction in investment in exploration and production, leading to a reduction in supply coming out of non-OPEC country. That will strengthen the hand of the OPEC country. And when the Asian economy start growing again that will lead to a good deal higher oil price, say $20 a barrel, in the next 18 month. Q. (italics)The number of oil company is going to shrink in coming year, regardless, isn't it?(end italic) A. We are probably heading toward a world in which there are no more than five or six big oil company, possibly eight. There is really no precedent for having a many big player a we have in the oil business in this modern society. Q. (italics)Do you think oil stock are a good investment?(end italic) A. I think oil company are still a worthwhile investment, but it is not a place where an investor should plan on making money over the next 9 to 12 month. And it is an area where investor need to be careful, because in that period there will be a good deal of consolidation among smaller company. Times are tough in the oil patch. Still, it boggles the mind to accept the notion that hardship is driving profitable Big Oil to either merge, a British Petroleum and Amoco have already agreed to do, or at least to consider the prospect, a Exxon and Mobil are doing.

46,"The raw passion were such that the House Democrats did not to hesitate to bellow You resign! You resign! at Speaker-elect Robert Livingston when he called from the House floor for President Clinton to quit the White House in the face of certain impeachment. Shockingly, stunningly, Livingston did just that. He quit in one breathtaking utterance, a if flicking a trump card onto the heap of impeachment angst festering before his eye in the debating chamber. In his one and only strategem in leading his fellow House Republicans, Livingston's decision struck Congress like a verbal bomb. Stunned Democrats saw their fury vaporized upon the instant. They had to stand, almost staggering to their foot, to join the Republicans in a prolonged, emotional ovation for Livingston and his undeniable self-sacrifice. As they stood, the Democrats sensed Livingston had most suddenly closed a trap on the president and his defender. For, with the impeachment issue set to move to the Senate, Livingston, whose own marital indiscretion were now before the public to his obvious misery, chose to show how the question of a political leader's resignation wa very much in play in this tumult-tossed city. I must set the example that I hope President Clinton will follow, Livingston declared, flabbergasting all attending the impeachment debate and the nation watching beyond. Livingston walked off the floor like the sheriff in some bullet-pocked political High Noon, discarding the leadership badge he had wrested from the earlier speaker-casualty, Newt Gingrich. In the corridor just beyond, a doorman shouted to a police officer: Livingston just resigned! What? What? came the reply from the officer, who obviously thought the momentous announcement would be about Clinton's impeachment, not Livingston's political self-immolation. Just so, the Democrats, already deep into bone-raw exhaustion after their long fight to save the president, grasped for bearing. It is a surrender to a developing sexual McCarthyism! declared Rep. Jerrold Nadler, D-N.Y., a leading presidential defender trying to rally Democrats around the argument that Livingston should not resign any more than President Clinton should quit under fire. But the Republicans were surging to the fore on the strength of Livingston's announcement, fighting tear a they rose to salute him a the ultimate political role model in the grueling impeachment process a it roared into the final minute of debate. For some it is no longer good enough to make a mistake, to confirm that mistake and take the consequence of that mistake, said Tom DeLay, the Republican whip, his hand shaking, his eye tearing a he addressed the House and sought to drive the example of Livingston all the way down Pennsylvania Avenue. He understood what this debate wa all about honor, duty, integrity and the truth, said DeLay arguing that in one swift blow, Livingston had demonstrated himself to have been a far better speaker than Clinton ha been a president. With something of the political elan the president showed in initiating the Iraq attack a his own impeachment loomed, House Republicans, battered in public opinion poll, had found a rocket's red glare of their own. I have hurt you all deeply and beg your forgiveness, Livingston told the House, the nation and his family a he announced retreat. Only moment before, Democrats openly hissed the man a Livingston firmly read his own judgment upon the president: Sir, you have done great damage to this nation over the past year. Presidential resignation wa in order, he continued, and then came the shout of You resign! You resign! And a Livingston closed the circle on his career, he stunned the place into a collective breath of disbelief and somehow almost threatened to reduce the dark historic issue before the House the impeachment of the president into a matter of anticlimax. They must not succeed, David Bonior, the Democratic whip said of the Republicans a he wa given the task of refocusing the day on the misdeed of the president, not the departure of the speaker. We are here to debate impeachment and should not be distracted from that, he declared. The only way we can stop this vicious cycle, Bonior cried out from the floor, is if we refuse to give into it, whether it is Bill Clinton or Bob Livingston. But the House wa still reeling through the frenzied day a the fateful vote on the presidency approached and the notion of resignation licked about the capital city like a flame in a forest. Rejecting a last-minute Democratic attempt to soften it action to censure, the House of Representatives moved to impeach President William Jefferson Clinton for perjury on Saturday and to call on the Senate to try him, convict him and remove him from office. But even before the vote, Republicans pressed another line of attack, demanding Clinton's resignation. Rep. Robert Livingston, nominated for speaker last month by his party, startled the House when he announced he would not run for speaker and would resign from the House after 21 year of service. He urged the president to heal the wound that you have created. You, sir, may resign your post. Angry Democrats booed and shouted, You resign! Livingston continued, I can only challenge you in such fashion if I am willing to heed my own word. Apologizing again for extramarital affair revealed two day ago, he said, I believe I had it in me to do a fine job. But I cannot do that job or be the kind of leader that I would like to be under current circumstance. Then he bolted from the House chamber, nearly knocking reporter and member down. (The House voted 228-206 to approve the first article of impeachment, accusing Clinton of committing perjury before a federal grand jury. The vote wa announced at 1:24 pm. EST, leaving the 42nd president to face trial in the Senate on whether he should be removed from office.) Clinton rejected the advice immediately. His spokesman, Joe Lockhart, said, The president ha no intention of resigning. By calling on Livingston to reconsider, the president argued more broadly against resignation under fire. Perhaps speaking to both case, Lockhart said, It would be wrong to give in to this insidious politics of personal destruction. Unless Clinton change course, this would be only the second impeachment of a president in the 209-year history of the Republic, and the first since Andrew Johnson wa acquitted in 1868. Sen. Trent Lott of Mississippi, the majority leader, ha insisted that no bargaining over censure can prevent it from starting. But the Senate could halt a trial later a part of a deal. Considering the degree of partisanship displayed Saturday, assembling the two-thirds majority required under the Constitution for conviction is most unlikely. Sixty-seven vote would be required, and there are only 55 Republicans in the Senate, along with 45 Democrats. Four article of impeachment before the House charged Clinton with perjury in lying about his affair with Monica Lewinsky to a federal grand jury here on Aug. 17. He wa also charged with perjury in the Paula Jones sexual harassment suit, obstruction of justice and abuse of power. The Republican argument, over and over, wa that Clinton had lied in denying having sexual relation with Ms. Lewinsky. Rep. Dick Armey of Texas, the majority leader, said, A nation of law cannot be ruled by a person who break the law. Rep. Nancy Johnson of Connecticut said: There can be no justice without the truth. That is just profoundly so, and that is why perjury matter. Rep. Gerald Kleczka of Wisconsin began the Democrats' argument by saying, What the president did wa wrong, both personally and morally, but his act did not threaten our democracy and thus do not rise to the level of impeachable offense a defined by our founding father in our Constitution. Rep. Charles Schumer, New York's senator-elect, said: The rule of law requires that the punishment fit the crime. Allow u to vote for censure. Saturday's vote were the penultimate step in the most serious conflict between Congress and a president since Richard M. Nixon resigned in the face of impeachment and certain conviction on Aug. 9, 1974. But while that case spun out from a 1972 break-in at Democratic headquarters in the Watergate complex, this one began with a murky land deal in Arkansas in 1978. Through the effort of Kenneth Starr, the independent counsel under the law enacted in the wake of Watergate, the investigation spread to examine Clinton's affair with a White House intern. All year it ha preoccupied the capital despite an immense disconnect with public opinion; since the scandal became public in January, poll have shown that the public opposed impeachment and wanted the inquiry brought to an end. Even on Friday night, after a 13-hour debate, a CBS News Poll of 548 people showed that only 38 percent wanted their representative to vote for impeachment; 58 percent wanted a no vote. The conflict now enters uncharted sea, since the Nixon resignation cut the matter short and the Johnson trial occurred in a different America, with no nuclear weapon or cable television or public opinion poll. But the capital wa still rife with confident speculation. Some guessed, or hoped, that the result of the recent poll, which showed increase in support for resignation a a way to spare the nation a trial in which Ms. Lewinsky and Linda Tripp would be star witness, would weaken Clinton's resolve. Others thought the Republicans, seeing dismal number in poll about their party's standing in the United States, would be the first to blink. With a majority in the Senate, they have the power to end a trial at any time after the Senate receives notice of impeachment on the day it convenes, Jan. 6, or the next day. But while Clinton ha focused on the poll, and the CBS News survey showed that 64 percent still approve of his handling of his job a president, resignation could almost immediately subject him to criminal prosecution. And Republicans have steadfastly ignored the poll all year, and confronted them directly on Saturday. Representative JC. Watts of Oklahoma, newly elected a chairman of the Republican caucus, said: What's popular isn't always right. You say poll are against this. Polls measure changing feeling, not steadfast principle. Polls would have rejected the Ten Commandments. Polls would have embraced slavery and ridiculed women's right. You say we must draw this to a close. I say we must draw a line between right and wrong, not with a tiny fine line of an executive fountain pen, but with the big fat lead of a No. 2 pencil. And we must do it so every kid in America can see it. The point is not whether the president can prevail, but whether truth can prevail. Last weekend, when the Judiciary Committee recommended the four article of impeachment, Clinton's side still hoped to prevail with the help of 20 to 30 Republican moderate who were uncommitted. As the week wore on, almost all of them broke against the president. One who did not, Rep. Christopher Shays of Connecticut, said Saturday: After Judge Starr's report to Congress in September, and his presentation to the Judiciary Committee in November, I concluded that impeachable offense were not proven, and that the proven offense were not impeachable. But the president's continued failure to come to grip with his action, the sincerity and argument of member of the Judiciary Committee from both side of the aisle, the change of heart and conviction by member on my side of the aisle who originally opposed impeachment and who now support it, and the strong and powerful opinion of so many of my constituent who oppose my position and who wanted the president impeached caused me to rethink my position. He added: Yesterday morning, before I visited with the president, I concluded that my original position wa the correct one, for me. I believe that the impeachable offense have not been proven, and that the proven offense are not impeachable. But Rep. Tom DeLay of Texas, who ha led the Republican effort to force Clinton from office, dismissed his and other argument a moral relativism. He began by praising Livingston: There is no greater American in my mind, at least today, than Bob Livingston, because he understood what this debate wa all about. It wa about honor and decency and integrity and the truth; everything that we honor in this country. It wa also a debate about relativism v. absolute truth. He continued, The president's defender have said that the president is morally reprehensible, that he is reckless, that he ha violated the trust of the American people, lessened their esteem for the office of president and dishonored the office which they have entrusted him, and that but that doesn't rise to the level of impeachment. Rep. Jose Serrano of New York said, My constituent don't hate Bill Clinton; they love him and they're praying for him right at this very moment. You may have the vote today to impeach him, but you don't have the American people. And let me tell you something, I grew up in the public housing project of the South Bronx. I can see a bunch of bully when I see them. The bully get theirs, and you're going to get yours, too. Rep. Henry Hyde of Illinois, the Judiciary Committee chairman who brought the charge to the House floor, said the Congress and the American people needed to distinguish between private act of infidelity and public act by public official. In Clinton's case, he said, the House wa dealing with a serial violator of the oath who is the chief law-enforcement officer. He said that the Senate could be innovative and creative in deciding how best to punish Clinton, but that the House wa bound by the Constitution to move ahead with article of impeachment. Justice is so important to the most humble among u, Hyde said. Equal justice under the law that's what we're fighting for. Democrats, reading from the same Constitution, voiced diametrically opposite conclusion, and attacked the fairness of the proceeding that culminated Saturday. We're losing track of distinction between sin and crime, said Rep. Jerrold Nadler, D-NY. We're lowering the standard of impeachment. What the president ha done is not a great and dangerous offense to the republic. Democrats also criticized Republicans for impeaching Clinton at the very moment that US. troop waged war against Iraq. Six day before Christmas our troop are in battle, and a lame-duck Congress is rushing to overthrow the commander in chief, said Rep. David Bonior of Michigan, the second-ranking House Democrat. The ghost of Watergate hung over the House chamber. One Republican cited the parallel between the charge the House Judiciary Committee brought against Nixon 25 year ago, and the count that the same committee brought to the House floor for affirmation on Saturday. Nixon cheated. He cheated the electoral system, said Rep. Lindsey Graham, a South Carolina Republican on the Judiciary Committee. And now, Graham said, the full House is voting to impeach Clinton because we believe he committed crime that result in cheating our judicial system. But most of the day's debate wa firmly rooted in Clinton's effort to conceal his sexual affair with Monica Lewinsky. Rep. Bob Barr, a Georgia Republican on the Judiciary Committee who is one of Clinton's fiercest critic, held up copy of the US. Criminal Code, the Judiciary Committee's report on the impeachment inquiry and, finally, the Constitution, in defending his decision to impeach the president. Today, we rely on the three pillar of our society: the law itself, evidence and the Constitution, said Barr. There is no joy in upholding the law, Watts said. If we cannot see lawlessness, our child cannot recognize it. How can we tell our child honesty is the best policy when we don't demand it a a policy? But Democrats assailed the very premise on which the Republican majority built it impeachment case against Clinton. Rep. John Conyers Jr. of Michigan, the ranking Democrat on the Judiciary Committee, assailed the four article of impeachment, count by count, a unfounded by evidence and failing to rise to impeachment. He saved his most savage scorn for the final count, abuse of power. The majority ha simply tried to dress up the perjury count in the Watergate abuse-of-power language, Conyers said. Rep. Bob Livingston, who confessed to his colleague Thursday night that he had had adulterous affair, stunned the House chamber Saturday morning by saying in the impeachment debate on President Clinton that he would not serve a speaker and would quit Congress in six month. He urged the president to follow his example and quit, too. But at the White House, where call for Clinton's resignation are derided a a Republican strategy, the president sent a spokesman into the driveway to urge Livingston to reconsider his resignation. Livingston stood in the well of the House he ha served for two decade and called on Clinton to resign his office rather than force a trial in the Senate, drawing boo from his colleague and cat-calls that he should quit instead. He then did just that. I must set the example that I hope President Clinton will follow, Livingston announced to a shocked and silent chamber in an act that left the Republican Party in total chaos just hour before the vote to impeach Clinton. The decision also left the party leaderless on the eve of the opening of the 106th Congress, when Republicans must govern with one of the narrowest majority in history. Several Republicans, including Rep. Tom DeLay of Texas, the majority whip, somberly welcomed the news, suggesting it relieved them of an excruciating embarrassment. In lauding Livingston's move, DeLay said, He understood what this debate wa all about it's about honor and decency and integrity and the truth, everything we honor in this country. But Democrats said they were aghast, and many including Clinton called on Livingston to reconsider his decision. Mr. Livingston's resignation wa wrong, declared Rep. Jerrold Nadler, D-NY. It is a surrender to a developing sexual McCarthyism. Are we going to have a new test if someone want to run for public office are you now or have you ever been an adulterer? He called on the country to distinguish between sin and crime. White House press secretary Joe Lockhart said Clinton wa disappointed at the news of Livingston's plan and wished that he would reconsider. Lockhart said the president firmly belief that the politics of personal destruction in this town and this country ha to come to an end. He reaffirmed that Clinton would not resign, saying: The president is going to do what's in the best interest of the country. It would be wrong to give in to this insidious politics of personal destruction. Livingston's announced resignation wa all the more stunning for it disclosure in a process that could result in the president's removal from office. The speaker is second in line to the presidency, after the vice president. Newt Gingrich, the outgoing speaker, who wa driven from the post after Republicans lost five seat in the November election, technically remains speaker until Jan. 6, when Livingston's election wa to be ratified by the new Congress. But Gingrich ha removed himself from the daily operation of the House at this extraordinary session and ha begun to dismantle his office. Livingston's decision wa said to be driven in part by the anger of a group of about a dozen conservative in his party who were disillusioned that he had withheld news of his affair from them. They had threatened to withhold their vote for him in the election in January that would formally make him speaker. He wa also concerned about the pain caused to his family by further disclosure, some member said. They added that, not lost on many in his party, wa the example he would set for the president by offering to resign his post now. DeLay, No. 3 in the House Republican leadership, is expected to fill the power vacuum at least temporarily, in deed if not in title, while the party regroups to find a new speaker. Many member quickly rallied around Rep. Dennis Hastert of Illinois. Hastert, one of DeLay's deputy whip who is well respected among his colleague, had been promoted a a candidate for majority leader last month, but never mounted a campaign. Rep. Dick Armey of Texas only precariously held on to his majority-leader post last month and wa not considered a likely candidate for speaker. He is expected to manage the reorganization, which Republican leader have set for Jan. 4. Livingston met privately with his closest adviser Friday a the impeachment debate unfolded. Some of his colleague believed he had made a mistake in disclosing Thursday night just a the House wa moving into the divisive debate over impeachment that he had on occasion strayed from my marriage. He told Republican leader late Thursday afternoon that Hustler magazine wa going to expose his affair early next year. Some leader urged him to keep quiet, but his wife, Bonnie, encouraged him to tell his colleague immediately, despite the momentous vote that wa nearing on the floor. At that point Thursday night, Roll Call, a newspaper on Capitol Hill, reported on it Web site that Livingston wa going to admit to the affair and wa going to offer to resign. In a closed-door meeting with his fellow Republicans, he did admit to the affair but made no offer to step down, receiving three standing ovation instead. Thursday night, Livingston stated that he would not be intimidated by these effort to exploit his past. But Friday he removed himself from public action and that night drew his closest adviser into his confidence. His aide said Saturday that they had no clue what wa he wa contemplating, and few other member were aware of his plan. Asked if he had any advance word, Rep. JC. Watts of Oklahoma, a newly elected member of the Republican leadership, said: I had no idea. Asked if there had been internal party pressure on Livingston to resign, Rep. Harold Rogers, R-Ky., said: I didn't know about it if there wa, but added, There were some member who were critical of it. As the leader tried Saturday to hold the party together on and off the House floor, most Republicans stuck to their prepared script on the floor in favor of impeaching the president. But some began expressing their anguish. Rep. Henry Hyde, R-Ill., who admitted to his own adulterous affair earlier this year, said after Livingston's resignation: Those of u who are sinner must feel wretched today. Something is going on repeatedly that ha to be stopped, and that is a confusion between private act of infidelity and public act. To much applause, Hyde declared: Congress ha no business intruding into private act. Republicans, indeed Livingston himself, had made this same distinction between Clinton's sexual indiscretion and Livingston's, saying that Clinton lied about his private act and therefore abused the legal system and his power. As Livingston said in his statement Thursday: These indiscretion were not with employee on my staff and I have never been asked to testify under oath about them. Democrats hoped that Livingston's seemingly drastic action would wake up the House to how poisoned the atmosphere had become and might prompt Republicans to reconsider the impeachment of Clinton. Rep. Paul Kanjorski, D-Pa., said, We are now starting to offer up sacrificial lamb to whatever terrible disease this is. In a stirring speech applauded even by some Republicans, Rep. Dick Gephardt of Missouri, the Democratic leader, praised Livingston a a worthy, good and honorable man and said his resignation wa a grave mistake. It's a terrible capitulation to the negative political force that are consuming our political system and our country, Gephardt said, adding that the event of the last few day showed life imitates farce. We need to stop destroying imperfect people at an unattainable altar of public morality, he said, urging his colleague to step back from the abyss and reject resignation, impeachment and vicious self-righteousness. The New York Times said in an editorial for Sunday, Dec. 20: The Republicans' drive for a partisan impeachment based soley on party-line voting power rather than any sense of proportion produced an unexpected sideshow in the resignation of Rep. Bob Livingston from his role a future speaker of the House. Analysts on both side of the struggle over President Clinton's future will point to Livingston's downfall a evidence of a generalized breakdown in legislative civility on Capitol Hill. Democrats will see a moral symmetry, depicting Livingston a a victim of the sexual puritanism he wa wielding against Clinton. But the one thing that no one should fall for is Livingston's invitation to use his resignation a a model for resolving the crisis at the White House. Livingston's statement rocked Congress, but it should not shake the foundation of the somber constitutional process now underway. By lying under oath, Clinton made it necessary for the House to consider impeachment. The evidence convinced most Americans that the president should be censured, but not removed from office. Livingston allowed GOP partisan to block censure in the House. The result is that after Saturday's expected impeachment vote, after Livingston's unexpected announcement, the mission of the Senate remains the same. It must resist those Republicans who want to short-circuit the constitutional process with demand for resignation, and it must use the upcoming Senate trial a a forum for finding a censure commensurate with the president's personal dishonesty and offense against the law. These require stern punishment but not removal from office. In undertaking this work, the Senate must also reassure the American people that a decisive wisdom at the core of our messy-looking political system ha not melted down. In such distempered time, this is a shining opportunity for the Senate. Its member pride themselves on being the Republic's fire wall against presidential excess and the popular or partisan passion that sometimes seize the House of Representatives. No one can predict whether Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott will rise to the defining challenge of his career or whether he will surrender to the mean streak he acquired during 16 grumpy year a a minority member of the House. We would like to see Lott reach for a starring role in history. Lott's growling response to question about censure is not encouraging. He may be right that the Constitution requires him to convene a trial, but nothing in that document prevents him from speedily guiding the Senate toward censure negotiation. Indeed, a simple majority vote 45 Democrats plus 6 cooperating Republicans can end the Senate trial at any time, clearing the way for introduction of the kind of censure resolution suggested by former Sen. Bob Dole. In an intriguing report on NBC, Tim Russert described discussion among a bipartisan group of senator about a censure that would involve some form of presidential confession, a fine and a joint congressional request that Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr not prosecute Clinton in the court. If Lott refuse to allow a bipartisan search for censure, the burden will fall upon respected member like Joseph Lieberman on the Democratic side and Orrin Hatch for the Republicans. Through cooperation, they can guide the Senate toward a punishment that fix Clinton in history a a president who lied under oath, but avoids the taint of partisan vengeance associated with the House impeachment vote. The Senate's historic reputation for prudence requires it to find appropriate punishment for a personally weak president who ha damaged the rule of law, but not threatened the stability of the government. House Speaker-elect Robert L. Livingston presented a fresh note of shock to the impeachment debate against President Clinton on Thursday night a the Republican leader wa forced to admit to his Republican colleague that he had carried on adulterous affair in his past. It ha suddenly come to my attention that there are individual working together with the medium who are investigating my personal background in an effort to find indiscretion which may be exploitable against me and my party on the eve of the upcoming historic vote on impeachment, Livingston declared in a statement after appearing before a shocked House Republican conference to head off the disclosure a it surfaced in news report. After hearing his admission in a closed session, Livingston's colleague gave him a standing ovation of support and said the question of his resigning had never arisen. My fate is in your hand, Livingston told the Republicans, according to lawmaker who were present. The debate over the president's fate would go forward, Republicans later insisted, drawing distinction between the speaker-elect's revelation and the sex-and-mendacity scandal that ha put Clinton on the brink of impeachment. The president is charged in an impeachment resolution with perjury and abuse of power in his attempt to hide sexual indiscretion. Democrats offered no immediate comment, but Republicans were braced to hear Livingston's admission alluded to in the debate Friday by Democrats who have decried the investigation of the president a basically a partisan and unfair rummaging through his sex life. Livingston, saying he had sought spiritual counseling and had received the forgiveness of his family, noted he had several time told reporter during his campaign to become speaker that I wa running for speaker, not sainthood. He added, There wa a reason for those word. During my 33-year marriage to my wife, Bonnie, I have on occasion strayed from my marriage, and doing so nearly cost me my marriage and family, Livingston said in his brief prepared statement. But he attempted to draw a contrast with the allegation against the president, asserting: I want to assure everyone that these indiscretion were not with employee on my staff and I have never been asked to testify under oath about them. The disclosure of the speaker-elect's marital infidelity, disclosed in Rollcall, a Capitol Hill newspaper, sent a new jolt of uncertainty among lawmaker a they prepared for the momentous debate over the president's admitted misbehavior in office and whether he should be impeached and tried by the Senate. Rep. Henry Hyde, the Republican chairman of the House Judiciary Committee who is to bring the impeachment charge against the president, previously wa cited by a magazine for an extra-marital affair in his past. Then, a on Thursday night, Republicans voiced suspicion that Democratic defender of the president instigated medium investigation in an effort to embarrass the Clinton's principal accuser. But no proof wa offered a Republicans left their conference, facing the uncertainty of a debate that already promised to be bare-knuckled in it partisanship. Livingston left the conference surrounded by Capitol police, not taking question from waiting reporter. His chief leadership aide immediately rallied in support. Some who would rather not struggle with this constitutional question continue to try to twist the debate into an unseemly investigation of private life, said Rep. Dick Armey, the Republican majority leader. In it report on the internet Thursday night, Rollcall did not disclose it source but made an oblique reference to Hustler, the sex magazine. Larry Flint, publisher of Hustler, earlier this year advertised an offer of a $1 million bounty for information about e of member of Congress guilty of sexual indiscretion. It break your heart because we're all subject to human frailty, said Asa Hutchinson, R-Ark., a he left the conference. This is not a comfortable circumstance for anyone, he added, insisting the president and the speaker-elect presented two separate issue. We've got a duty to do under the Constitution. It ha gotten to the point where drastic action may be necessary. You know those movie about Ebola virus outbreak, where the guy in sterile suit come in, seal off the area and completely irradiate it? They may have to do that to Washington. Just eradicate u and start from scratch. In a few, short day we have managed to make the term surreal, bizarre, split-screen America, shocking, runaway train and politics of personal destruction useless cliche. We no longer govern here. We just roll around in the gutter wondering who's next in this sexual auto-de-fe. On Saturday morning, we had the surreal, shocking, bizarre, split-screen image of Bob Livingston, the speaker-elect, stepping down after his marital infidelity were revealed. We are all pawn on the chessboard, Livingston said, before asking the president to resign and then resigning himself. Livingston's rabid pursuit of the president, even a he hoped to hide his own dirty laundry, made him an avatar of hypocrisy in a capital rotting with hypocrisy. On Thursday night, when Livingston first confessed his sin to Republicans in hope of keeping his hold on his post, his colleague gave him a standing ovation. And after he made his surprise announcement Saturday, the Republicans gave him another ovation and stepped up to deliver encomium to their lost speaker. One's self-esteem get utterly crushed at time like this, sighed Henry Hyde, another tormenter of the president who also had to admit that he had succumbed to temptation. Tom DeLay, the jagged-edge exterminator who may next-up in the speaker roundelay, wa choked up, praising the greatness of Livingston for understanding that this wa a debate about relativism versus absolute truth. What could be more relative than a Republican who ha hidden a lot of affair trying to impeach a president for lying about his? Spurred by Larry Flynt's bounty for sinnuendo, the city wa braced for more craziness. The Ship of Fools reached cruising speed on Friday evening, when we had the frightening scene of Republicans so crazed with hatred of the president that they were railroading through an impeachment even though the United States wa at war with Iraq, even though the House chamber wa mostly empty, even though Republicans were huddled in a glass house on the issue of sex and lie, and even though the White House wa still pitching a tent and planning sleigh ride for a Winter Wonderland press party on Monday. (The White House wa keeping the journalist quarantined outside this year, but encouraged them to bring their kid. To soak up some of that cozy family atmosphere, no doubt. Why are the Republicans so obsessed, when everyone in his right mind agrees that impeachment is an outlandishly over-the-top punishment for Clinton and a self-destructive course for the country? Because they genuinely hate the president. They think he's a dishonest, immoral, issue-stealing, selfish child of the '60s. They don't think they're going to pay a political price for this, and if they do, they don't care. It might be a great time to see a lot of combovers, but it's not a great time to see a lot of stature. The House debate wa not history. It wa just a more hideous version of The McLaughlin Group. While Republicans tried to draw the distinction that Clinton had perjured himself, they ignored that the president had been lured by the Starr-Jones attorney team into testifying on Monica Lewinsky. Ordinarily one would feel sorry for Livingston. But the Republicans have brought this sexual doomsday machine on themselves by focusing so single-mindedly on Clinton's sex life. The Republicans were so determined to do their high-tech lynching that they engaged in wacky role reversal. Many Republican hawk argued that Bill Clinton should not be bombing Saddam, claiming the timing wa suspicious, even though they had hammered him for not bombing five week ago. In an incredibly unseemly display, Trent Lott, the majority leader, and former Bush national security adviser Brent Scowcroft and Bush Secretary of State Lawrence Eagleburger chimed in on the attack. There's too much hate here. And I hate it. We are here to debate impeachment and should not be distracted from that, the minority whip, Rep. David Bonior, Democrat of Michigan, said during Saturday's House debate, in what leaped out a an impossible goal. It would have taken a kaleidoscopic television screen to capture the constantly shifting image competing for center stage: impeachment, Iraq, the resignation of Rep. Robert Livingston, the response from the White House. The month leading up to the impeachment of President Clinton had become a series of televised anticlimax, but the hour before the vote made up for that lack of drama. There were hardly enough shorthand term or split screen to cover the activity. All the network and cable channel carried the moment that unexpectedly set the tone, a Livingston, a Louisiana Republican, announced during the debate that he would not become House speaker. The commentator had been set to carry the congressional ratification of the inevitable vote, but suddenly the most plugged-in reporter were caught off guard. As Tim Russert said to Tom Brokaw on NBC, Tom, knock u all over. In the echo chamber that television news so often becomes, the shared mantra had been weightier in early morning. For only the second time in American history a president would be impeached, went the standard line. Yet despite all the pundit speculating and politician telegraphing every move, no one had hinted at the Livingston resignation. The announcement wa, a Brokaw put it, at least partly a political ploy, and the repercussion were immediate. Reporters began gathering word from Capitol Hill about candidate for the speaker's job, and the conversation moved to the next stage of the political tug of war. The Republicans used Livingston's resignation to say that the president should resign, too; the Democrats immediately countered with the idea that the president would stay and that Livingston should a well. That led to one of the less-expected split screen of the day, and it wa not a bad choice. While Congress wa debating, CNN showed anti-aircraft fire in Baghdad in one box. In the other, Joe Lockhart, Clinton's press secretary, stood in the White House driveway telling reporter that the president would like Livingston to reconsider his decision. There wa more stateliness in the House than television usually offer, and one reason wa purely visual. Keep in mind that we do not control the picture, Dan Rather said on CBS, explaining that the television camera in Congress are provided by the House, not the individual network. There wa no way to roam and zoom in for reaction shot, a at a political convention. But the sense of history and decorum didn't last long at CBS. At noon, before the vote, CBS went to a football game, becoming the only network to leave the news coverage. CBS' corporate decision to try to have it both way meant that Rather would break in with update from Washington. I'll see you very soon, he said a he signed off the complete coverage, looking like a trouper. But he wa in a position no news anchor should have been in on this day. He later announced impeachment vote on a split screen with the football game in progress in the upper part of the screen. On the other network and cable channel, the vote itself literally happened in the background. As TV screen toted up the number of the electronically-cast vote, member of Congress milled around and chatted on the floor. Even the brief Democratic walkout after a motion to consider censure wa defeated wa thoroughly forecast. As the Democrats straggled down the step of Congress, it looked curiously undramatic on television, though it probably made a better still photograph once they were all in place. And while the vote were in progress, the jockeying for the speaker's job heated up. We already have a presumptive leader, Gwen Ifill of NBC News said in midafternoon, naming Rep. Dennis Hassert, R-Ill., who had also been cited by the other network a a likely candidate. If the political and military action had not intruded, it might have been more obvious that the debate on the House floor sent a message about vast division in politics and morality, signaling how deep a cultural fissure this crisis ha opened. The impeachment, said Rep. Tom DeLay, R-Texas, wa a debate about relativism v. absolute truth. Rep. Jerrold Nadler, D-N.Y., contended that Congress had lost the distinction between sin and crime, and argued against the sexual McCarthyism that ha become prominent. And against the backdrop of the revelation of adultery that led to Livingston's resignation, Rep. Dick Gephardt, the minority leader, declared the politics of personal destruction ha to end. But a all the jabbering and political posturing continued, a reporter raced to cover the president's statement about the impeachment and the latest briefing from the Pentagon, there wa little time to focus on the profound cultural message beneath those rhetorical flourish. Bob Livingston, the incoming speaker of the House, took no public role Friday a the debate unfolded on whether to impeach President Clinton. His previous 24 hour had been his most visible in the month since his party nominated him a speaker and perhaps the most excruciating in his public career: He spent most of the day in a chaotic procedural wrangle over the term of Friday's debate; he ended it by telling his Republican colleague that he had had extramarital affair during his 20-year tenure in Congress. His disclosure followed an investigation by Larry Flynt, publisher of Hustler, the sex magazine, who said Friday at a news conference in Beverly Hills, Calif., that his publication had learned that Livingston had had adulterous affair during the last 10 year. Flynt said earlier this year that he wanted to expose the hypocrisy of those in Washington who are investigating Clinton and in October offered $1 million to anyone who could prove they had had affair with member of Congress. He said Friday that this larger investigation, to be published perhaps a soon a January, would reveal what he described a indiscretion of several other Republicans. He said he had no connection with the White House but that he had hired an investigative firm based in Washington and made up of former employee of the FBI and the CIA. He would not confirm whether the firm is Terry Lenzner's Investigative Group Inc., which ha done work for the president's private lawyer. Livingston wa unavailable to reporter Friday. He spent some time Friday morning sprawled in a chair in the back of the House chamber, listening to the debate over whether to impeach Clinton for lying about his own sexual indiscretion. Several colleague knelt at Livingston's knee, whispered to him and patted him on the back. He spent most of the day in a private office off the chamber, avoiding the gauntlet of reporter who lay in wait for him between the House and his regular office across the street. The only word out of his aide wa that the Navy had awarded contract worth million of dollar for ship to be built in his Louisiana district at the Avondale Shipyards. During Friday's debate, a handful of Democrats made only oblique allusion to human failure. For example, Rep. John Lewis, D-Ga., said: Let he that ha no sin cast the first stone. Who, who among u ha not sinned? But no one said that Livingston's disclosure or the mild Democratic attempt to exploit it would influence their vote on impeachment. Rather, on the House floor and in hallway chitchat, Livingston's conduct seemed to be the last thing that either Republicans or Democrats wanted to talk about. Bob Livingston is a first-rate human being, said Rep. David Obey, D-Wis., who ha worked closely and sparred with Livingston on the Appropriations Committee, in an interview. I will repeat what the nun taught me at St. James a long time ago: We would all be a hell of a lot better off looking after our own soul rather than trying to evaluate somebody else's. None of u have any business even having an opinion on it. Even conservative Republicans seemed ready to overlook the disclosure. We're not going to say, `Bob, you can't be speaker because you violated your vow with your wife,' said Rep. Lindsey Graham, R-SC. Like many, including Livingston, Graham distinguished Livingston's conduct from Clinton's by saying that the president had trampled on the legal system whereas Livingston's behavior wa strictly private. Despite Flynt's claim, many Republicans blamed the Clinton administration for smearing Livingston, although they offered no evidence. This isn't just happening on it own, said Rep. Dana Rohrabacher, R- Calif. The only thing certain now is uncertainty. The smart money shout that President Clinton will never resign, and he concurs. The smart money argues that the Senate could not muster the 67 vote that would be needed to remove the wounded president from office, which would require the defection of 12 Democrats if all the Republicans stand against him. The smart money insists that someone will cut a deal to end all this. Maybe so. But the smarter money whisper, Remember. Remember that everyone in Washington, including Rep. Henry Hyde, R-Ill., chairman of the Judiciary Committee, said the House would never, ever, treat impeachment a a partisan issue. Wrong. Remember that all the pundit predicted Democratic loss in the midterm election, and when the opposite happened, they said impeachment wa dead. Twice wrong. And remember that in the New Year the nation may travel down a road it ha never traveled before. One other president, Andrew Johnson of Tennessee, ha been tried by the Senate, of course. But that happened in a different country one with only 37 state, with primitive communication, with a simple economy based largely on agriculture, with only minimal commitment abroad. In the toxic politics of century's end in Washington, the inconceivable ha become the commonplace. The wholly unanticipated announcement Saturday morning by Rep. Robert Livingston, R-La., that he would not serve a speaker and would resign from Congress, following his equally unanticipated disclosure on Thursday night of several extramarital affair, only deepened the capital's profound sense of insecurity. The deadly sweep of the scythe of neo-puritanism appears unstoppable, at least for the moment, and Livingston's forthcoming resignation will increase the pressure on the president to do likewise. You've set before u an example, the leader of House Republican majority, Rep. Dick Armey of Texas, told Livingston Saturday. The example is that principle come before power. The Democrats made the opposite point, arguing that the Livingston case showed how very wrong it wa to savage people for personal pecaddillos. One transcendently important thing remains the same: Although surrounded by judicial trapping and presided over by the chief justice, trial of president are political process, with power residing in the hand of elective politician. In addition to narrow legal issue of guilt or innocence, they can weigh consideration of party, the nation's future, their own individual political well-being and almost anything else they care to weigh in reaching a verdict. The longer they took, the more numerous the call for resignation would probably be. Even before Saturday's epochal roll-calls, four of ten Americans interviewed in the latest New York Times/CBS News Poll said they thought the president should step down if he were to be indicted, despite the fact that a large majority voiced disapproval of the impeachment proceeding. What lie behind that seeming contradiction, of course, is the fear that Clinton, and the country with him, would be incapacitated. No one took Andrew Johnson very seriously after he escaped conviction by a single vote. But Clinton, a man of powerful will whose whole life ha been a series of comeback, ha already embarked on an effort to show that he can do the nation's business. Richard Nixon clawed his way back to respectability after leaving the White House when no one thought he could; Clinton intends to re-establish his authority while still in office. He ha one great advantage: Two-thirds of the American public continues to voice it approval of his political stewardship, whatever it think of him a a man. The president will press hard, despite his much-reduced leverage, for a deal on censure. Indeed, in a fine a piece of political irony a one could ask for, he ha already sought to enlist former Sen. Bob Dole, the Republican he defeated in 1996, a an emissary to the Senate majority. The number are not unpromising: with the help of six Republicans, the 45 Democrats could end the trial at any time and pas a censure resolution that the House would surely take up. There are enough Republican moderate and sometime party-buckers to make that a plausible target. But the Republican leader in the Senate, Trent Lott of Mississippi, who ha made his unwillingness to take the president's word plainly evident in recent day, is determined to fight such a trial-aborting arrangement. It is clear that Clinton's reputation ha been stained forever, no matter what the Senate doe. The spot will not out. History will remember this man who so coveted a glowing legacy not a an impresario of economic growth, not a the Moses who pointed the way to the 21st century, but a the second president ever to be impeached, if not a the first to be ousted. That harsh word, impeachment, will cling to his name a surely a Teapot Dome cling to Harding's and Depression to Hoover's. But he is not alone in having suffered grievous injury in the political avalanche that wa shaken loose by the disclosure of Clinton's sexual relationship with a former White House intern, Monica Lewinsky. The Republicans' public support ha shriveled to 40 percent in the new Times/CBS News poll, it lowest level in 14 year, and it could go lower once the fact of impeachment sink in. Journalists are seen by many a jackal, indifferent to whatever personal suffering or national angst they may cause a long a they get the story, and none too concerned about accuracy. In fact, the whole political culture of the 1990s, with it criminalization of political conduct and it seeming indifference to important national and international issue, ha fallen into disrepute with ordinary Americans. The last week seemed to crystallize the long-term decline in political civility. Republicans called Clinton a liar, even a he wa committing American pilot to the sky over Iraq, and Democrats accused their rival of conducting a political lynching or a political coup d'etat. Bipartisanship may have been the biggest victim of all. Party line on Saturday's roll call held a firm a leg iron. Almost all of the Republicans who opposed impeachment did so not exclusively on legal principle but at least partly because of special political circumstance the Democratic majority in Rep. Constance Morella's district in the Maryland suburb of Washington, for example, and the gratitude of Rep. Peter King, R-N.Y., for Clinton's peacemaking in Ireland. It is hard to see who ha emerged from it with reputation enhanced, except perhaps Hillary Rodham Clinton, staunch in the face of deception. If some of the threat and dire prediction uttered by House Democrats in recent day are to be taken at face value, the nation is entering upon an Era of Bad Feelings, the polar opposite of a second Era of Good Feelings, similar to that of the 1820s, that Clinton had hoped to preside over. Rep. Tom Sawyer, D-Ohio, compared Clinton on Friday to Sir Thomas More, executed for treason in 1535 because of his religious belief. He quoted More's word a an admonition for today: What you have hunted me for is not my action but for the thought of my heart. It is a long road you have opened. God help the statesman who walk your road. But amidst all the loose talk about permanent damage to this institution or that, remember: Things change with startling speed in modern American politics, and the institution of American government have proved extraordinarily resilient. President Nixon, it wa almost universally agreed in 1974, had weakened the American presidency for many decade to come. Nobody said that after eight year under Ronald Reagan, and that wa only 15 year later. In the end, the will of the people meant nothing. Bob Livingston couldn't have been clearer about that. His mind and the mind of his follower were closed. Even a the bombing continued in Iraq and Americans from coast to coast were clamoring for an alternative to impeachment, even a his own adulterous past wa being flushed out in the grotesque invasion of privacy that inevitably followed the relentlessly prurient pursuit of the president, even a the country began to contemplate the destructive effect of a lengthy and bitter Senate trial, the speaker-designate arrogantly and stupidly proclaimed: Let u disregard the outside influence. The radical on the Hill would hear nothing but the echo of their own fanaticism. Impeach! Impeach! And that continued even after the stunning announcement Saturday morning that Livingston would quit the House. Dismayed by the partisan stampede, Dick Gephardt, the Democratic leader, warned during the impeachment debate on Friday: In your effort to uphold the Constitution, you are trampling the Constitution. David Bonior, the Democratic whip, said: This is wrong. It is unfair. It is unjust. At a time when event in the world and the challenge at home demand that we stand united, censure is the one solution that can bring u together. To my colleague across the aisle, I say let go of your obsession. Listen to the American people. But the voice of reason would not be heard. Livingston and his right-wing colleague, the Tom DeLays, the Henry Hydes, the Bob Barrs, were on a mission of destruction and would not be denied. Ordinary Americans could cry out all they wanted. They could protest and demonstrate, send fax and E-mails. It didn't matter. The right wa on the march and democracy wa on the run. Rep. Thomas Barrett, a Democrat from Wisconsin, tried to remind his Republican colleague that the Constitution doe not allow you to remove a president from office because you can't stand him. He wa, of course, ignored. The Republicans will pay a huge price for their brazen, utterly partisan attempt to drag a president from the White House in defiance of the will of the people. The party's contempt for the voter wa arrogantly but quite adequately summed up by Alan Simpson, the former senator from Wyoming, who said: The attention span of Americans is which movie is coming out next month and whether the quarterly report on their stock will change. If the voter are the dope that Mr. Simpson think they are, then come 2000 everyone will have forgotten there wa an impeachment crisis. But Rep. Robert Menendez, D-N.J., wa probably closer to the truth when he said, I warn my colleague that you will reap the bitter harvest of the unfair partisan seed you sow today. One of the many strange event of the past couple of week wa the way in which virtually all of the previously undecided Republicans, the so-called moderate, surrendered their independence and lined up like lackey to follow the right wing's lead. All proclaimed loudly that they were voting on principle, but in fact it wa an exercise in mass cowardice, exemplified by Rep. John McHugh of upstate New York. McHugh announced on Tuesday that he would vote for impeachment. But if his decision wa based on principle, he had an odd way of expressing it. The Washington Post said McHugh appeared to have no stomach for a Senate conviction or removal of the president from office. Of his colleague in the Senate, McHugh said, I, for one, would accept, even welcome, their mercy. In other word, let the Senate do the heavy constitutional lifting. McHugh may have wished out loud for mercy, but he clearly wa too frightened of the right-winger in the House to cast a compassionate vote himself. The GOP can no longer conceal that it is a party of extremist, of right-wing absolutist, a party out of step with the political and cultural orientation of most Americans. Bob Livingston may be leaving, but his arrogant comment can still serve a his party's slogan. Let u disregard the outside influence. Let u disregard the people.

47,"The first part of the international space station wa smoothly orbiting Earth on Friday after a faultless launch that marked the start of a new age in space exploration and colonization. A Russian Proton booster rocket carried the module into it initial orbit 200 kilometer (125 mile) above the Earth and the unit wa operating a planned, official said. Russia's Zarya, or Sunrise, module is to fly alone for two week before a rendezvous with the American space shuttle Endeavour, which is to be launched Dec. 3 carrying the Unity connecting module. Space official from 16 nation taking part in the project cheered a the rocket soared into the cloudy sky above the central Asian steppe from the Baikonur launch pad Friday a year later than planned. During the, pickup 4th pvs Endeavour's astronaut connected the first two building block of the international space station on Sunday, creating a seven-story tower in the shuttle cargo bay. It wa the first time that the Russian-built Zarya control module and the made-in-America Unity chamber had ever touched. It looked to be a perfect and, hopefully, long-lasting fit. We have capture of Zarya, commander Robert Cabana announced the moment the two piece came together. Congratulations to the crew of the good ship Endeavour, replied Mission Control. That's terrific. The 240-mile-high construction job began two hour earlier with Nancy Currie's capture of Zarya (Russian for Sunrise) using the shuttle robot arm. We're halfway home, Cabana said. Then came the hard part: stacking the two giant cylinder in the cargo bay. The two station piece are so big 77 foot from the tip of one to the tip of the other with a combined mass of 70,000 pound that Currie and her crewmates had to rely on a computerized vision system and camera view, rather than direct line of sight. This wa the first time such a blind docking had ever been attempted. Currie positioned the solar-winged Zarya, still on the end of the shuttle robot arm, several inch directly above Unity. It wa slow going; she wanted and needed perfect alignment. Once she wa sure she had it, Cabana fired Endeavour's thruster, and the brief burst raised the shuttle and thereby Unity enough for the docking mechanism on the two station component to snap together. The historical moment occurred above the South Pacific. The union intended to last the station's 15-year or more lifetime set the stage for a spacewalk by two astronaut on Monday to attach electrical connector and cable between the two component. Mission Control thought Sunday's work might take hour longer than planned and gave the six astronaut plenty of time for the task. But everything occurred more or le when and how it wa supposed to, aside from a piece of space junk that strayed too close. Before beginning their final approach to Zarya, the six astronaut had to steer clear of a chunk of a rocket launched last month from California. Mission Control ordered the pilot to fire the shuttle thruster to put an extra three mile between Endeavour and the space junk, putting Endeavour a total of five mile from the orbiting debris. The smaller gap would have been probably a little too close for comfort, Mission Control said. The bigger worry, by far, wa over Endeavour's pursuit and capture of Zarya, and it coupling with Unity. The shuttle's 50-foot robot arm had never before handled an object a massive a the 41-foot, 44,000-pound Zarya, a power and propulsion module that wa launched from Kazakstan on Nov. 20. It will provide all of the necessary electricity and steering for the fledgling space station until a permanent control module can be launched next summer. Minutes after Zarya's capture, Cabana called down that two antenna on the module were still undeployed a Russian flight controller had feared. The antenna must be fully deployed in order for Zarya's manual docking system to work; that system won't be needed before next summer, official said. The only other problem wa with a Zarya battery; the astronaut took up a replacement part. The 36-foot, 25,000-pound Unity, the first American-made component, will serve a a connecting passageway, or vestibule, for future module. It wa crucial that Zarya and Unity be joined; if they could not be connected with the robot arm, NASA would have sent out two spacewalking astronaut to manually fit them together. In all, three spacewalks are planned for Endeavour's 12-day flight, not only to hook up electrical connection between the two module but to install handrail and other tool for future crew. The joined module will be released from Endeavour once all of the work is completed. NASA estimate 43 more launch and 159 more spacewalks will be needed after this mission to assemble the entire orbiting complex. Once completed, the 16-nation space station will have a mass of 1 million pound, be longer than a football field, and house up to seven astronaut and cosmonaut. Russian space official gave the first module of the international space station a routine tweak Saturday to push it into higher orbit, and convened a meeting on Earth to map out it future. Flight controller fired one of the module's two maneuvering engine to raise it to an orbit about 230 kilometer (157 mile) in space, the station's public affair office said. Russian Space Agency general director Yuri Koptev told reporter the maneuver wa carried out with great accuracy, and the 24-ton core module wa cruising through space without any problem. The module, called Zarya, or Sunrise, lifted off Friday from the Baikonur launchpad in Kazakstan into an initial orbit 200 kilometer (125 mile) above Earth. Zarya is to serve a a space tugboat in the early stage of the international project, providing propulsion, power and communication. It will fly alone for two week before a rendezvous with the American space shuttle Endeavour, which is to be launched Dec. 3 carrying the Unity connecting module. The international space station is a U.S.-led successor to Russia's Mir space station, and is being heralded by space official a the vehicle for unprecedented international cooperation in space in the 21st century. The head of the space agency of the United States, Russia, Japan and Canada, along with the European Space Agency, met in Moscow on Saturday to discus the project, the Interfax news agency reported. The space agency head agreed on a schedule for future meeting and on holding a scientific conference on the project somewhere in Europe, at an unspecified date. Also Saturday, the head of Russia's Mission Control, Vladimir Lobachev, wa quoted a saying that Russia would take the lead role in managing the international space station during it first five year. Previously, space official have said the station would be jointly controlled from Moscow and Houston, with the US. space agency NASA taking a lead role. According to Interfax, Lobachev said it made sense for Russia to control the project because the Russian-built Zarya and a Russian-built service module would perform most of the life support and navigational function for the station's first five year. Furthermore, Russian engineer are more experienced in this job and NASA official are aware of this, he said. The space station is expected to cost at least dlrs 40 billion, of which the United States is expected to pay dlrs 24 billion. Russia's financing problem delayed the initial launch by a year, and some critic have said the station amount to an expensive way for NASA to keep Russia's beleaguered space program alive. The station will serve a an orbital home for visiting astronaut and cosmonaut for at least 15 year. Endeavour's astronaut connected the first two building block of the international space station on Sunday, creating a seven-story tower in the shuttle cargo bay. It wa the first time that the Russian-built Zarya control module and the made-in-America Unity chamber had ever touched. It looked to be a perfect and, hopefully, long-lasting fit.

Russian space expert were making final preparation Thursday at the Baikonur rocket base to launch the first component of a multibillion dollar international space station after a year of delay. Built by a Russian company and to be launched atop a Russian booster rocket, the 24-ton Zarya (Sunrise) control and cargo module is a U.S.-funded component of the station. It will serve a a space tugboat in the early stage of the project, providing propulsion, power and communication. The unmanned launch, set for 9:40 Moscow time (0640 GMT) Friday from Baikonur in Kazakhstan, ha been delayed for one year mainly because of the cash-strapped Russian space agency's failure to complete another part of the station. After year of discussing, planning and replanning, we are about to launch hardware, Gretchen McClain, deputy associate administrator for the new station, said at a news conference earlier this week. We are ready to begin a project that will bring u into the millennium with woman and men living and working in space permanently. Russian official added their traditional note of superstition. It is not in the Russian tradition to preface a launch with . some advance statement. I would like to knock on wood, which is rather common in the Russian tradition, said Alexander Krasnov, a deputy chief of Russian Space Agency's manned flight department. The station, involving 16 nation with the United States and Russia playing the biggest role, will consist of more than 100 element that will take 45 assembly flight to complete. It is due to be completed by 2004. The station will weigh 500 ton (more than a million pound) and is expected to cost at least dlrs 40 billion, with the United States planning to pay dlrs 21 billion. It will serve a an orbital home for visiting astronaut and cosmonaut for up to 20 year. Zarya is to fly alone for two week before a rendezvous with the American space shuttle Endeavor, which is to be launched Dec. 3 carrying the Unity connecting module. The shuttle crew will attach the two module together in three space walk, using the Endeavors robot arm. The 12.4-meter (41.2-feet) Zarya hold more than 6 ton of fuel in it 16 tank and is capable of flying independently for 430 day. Its control system consists of 36 thruster and two large engine for major orbital change. It will be launched by a three-stage heavy-lift Proton booster rocket that would put Zarya into orbit in le than 10 minute after the blastoff. In the ensuing day, the ground controller will gradually adjust it orbit in preparation for the meeting with Endeavor. The space station will not be inhabitable until early 2000, following the launch of a Russian crew module which is set to blast off next July or August. Russia ha repeatedly failed to meet deadline for constructing the crew module, putting the whole project behind schedule. Having lost hope of getting the promised government fund, the Russian space agency ha sold it early research time on the station to NASA for dlrs 60 million to complete the segment. Agency chief Yuri Koptev said that taking part in the new station is the only hope for the beleaguered Russian space industry, whose funding ha collapsed since the Soviet collapse. The project would allow Russia to keep up to 80,000 job over the next 15 year. Koptev assailed some Russian space engineer who continue to insist that more money should be put into Russia's own battered 12-year old Mir space station to extend it lifetime instead of committing more fund to the new space outpost. The choice mustn't be determined by emotion. Some people are glued to one thing (Mir) and don't care about the rest, Koptev said at a recent news conference. We must proceed from the understanding of what would take u into the future, allow u to preserve our industry. The Russian Khrunichev company ha earned over dlrs 200 million for building Zarya, whose design wa based on earlier Soviet spacecraft, including some of the Mir's six module. WASHINGTON NASA and the Russian Space Agency have agreed to set aside a last-minute Russian request to launch an international space station into an orbit closer to Mir, official announced Friday. While putting the new station closer to Russia's 12-year-old Mir station would make it easier to transfer equipment and supply from the old outpost to the new one, the request came too late to be acted on, said Randy Brinkley, NASA's space station program manager. NASA wa surprised last week when Russia's prime station contractor proposed the orbital position change just two-and-a-half week before launch of the first part of the new station. Delaying the Nov. 20 flight by 10 hour to match the orbit would have forced similar shift in the subsequent assembly flight, and resulted in potentially unfavorable sun angle on the solar-powered station, engineer said. We have mutually concluded that it would not be prudent to make these change, Brinkley said during a news conference held at the Johnson Space Center in Houston. It added technical complexity and risk to the mission that were not justified. The decision, which followed frank and candid discussion between the two partner, wa not imposed by the United States, he said. The conclusion were mutual, Brinkley said. Both side concluded that it did not make sense. The Russians, struggling to find money for their space program with their nation in economic collapse, had said they wanted to transfer thousand of pound of newer equipment and scientific instrument from Mir a an economy move. However, some critic questioned the Russians' motif, wondering if the requested orbital change wa part of plan to delay the decommissioning and destruction of Mir, which the Russians have agreed to do next summer. The Russians have so little money that the United States and other partner in the international station fear that money spent on Mir will prevent Russia from meeting it obligation with the new project. The Mir competes with the international space station for very critical resource and for funding, Brinkley said. NASA will consider idea for salvaging Mir's research equipment to use on the international space station, he said, but only if it doe not interfere with assembling the new station. The United States and 15 other nation plan to begin building the new station in orbit next week when the Russians launch a module that will supply power and propulsion during the early stage of the five-year construction period. The space shuttle Endeavor is to follow on Dec. 3 with the second station part, a U.S.-built connecting passageway that attache to the first module. The first piece of the international space station wa orbiting Earth Friday, sprouting antenna and unfolding solar power panel a it awaited other segment, which will eventually grow into the largest orbital laboratory in history. The module, called Zarya from the Russian term meaning sunrise or dawn, took a flawless ride into space atop a three-stage Russian Proton booster rocket that lifted off at 1:40 am. Eastern time from the Baikonur cosmodrome in Kazakhstan. The launching wa witnessed by the head of the space agency of the 16 nation that are sponsoring the station, which will cost at least $40 billion to build over the next five year. Zarya, built in Russia with $240 million from the United States, is to be joined in two week by the first American module, a docking hub called Unity. The space shuttle Endeavour is to take off on Dec. 3 to rendezvous with Zarya and attach the two unit. This is to be followed by 43 more flight by American and Russian rocket carrying more than 100 part to be assembled in space to form a 900,000-pound research station housing up to seven astronaut. Daniel Goldin, the administrator of NASA, said at a news conference following the launching, Now we only have 44 launch to go, about 1,000 hour of space walk and countless problem. But because of all the partner nation trusting each other and working together, he said, the international space station is going to be a reality. Even a the new space station is coming together, question continue about the fate of Russia's existing space laboratory, the 12-year-old Mir. Because of the collapse of the Russian economy, doubt that Russia can produce enough rocket and other equipment to support both project led Russia to promise that it would abandon Mir and destroy the station by next summer. However, in recent week Russian official have been lobbying to find way to extend Mir's life. According to a report by the news agency Reuters, President Boris Yeltsin's space adviser, Yevgeny Shaposhnikov, said Friday he wa preparing a number of proposal on extending Mir's life past the year 2000. Support for such option ha been growing in recent week among Russian space official, astronaut and nationalist, who see Mir a a symbol of Russian achievement in space. James Van Laak, NASA's deputy manager of operation for the space station, said Friday that the agency had not received any formal proposal about extending Mir's life. NASA would find such a proposal unacceptable if it ha any measurable impact on the international space station, Van Laak said in a telephone interview from the Johnson Space Center in Houston, No one ha any objection to Mir or keeping it operational if the Russians find a way to support both project, but they have to demonstrate they can. Yuri Koptev, head of the Russian Space Agency, said the launching of Zarya, a 42,000-pound space tugboat that will supply power and propulsion in the early stage of station construction, wa a needed vindication for the troubled Russian space program. The Russian space industry is alive and well and is perfectly able to fulfill all of it commitment on the international space station, Koptev said. A Russian Proton booster rocket carried the first part of the international space station into orbit Friday, heralding the start of a new era in international space colonization. Russian space official and others cheered a ground control announced that the capsule had separated from it booster rocket and reached it first orbit at about 200 kilometer (125 mile) above the Earth. Success, shouted one exultant official some 10 minute after the giant rocket blasted off and entered orbit. The head of the space agency of 16 nation participating in the project watched the lift-off from a distance of about 5 kilometer (3 miles). Strategic Rocket Forces troop who had prepared the launch were in underground bunker to avoid poisoning by the highly toxic rocket fuel. Russian and US. official said the launch wa flawless and the module performed well during initial test. They cautioned that much work remains to be done to get the ambitious space station project up and working. Now we only have 44 launch to go, about 1,000 hour of space walk and countless problem, but because of the trust and mutual respect . the international space station is going to be a reality, NASA chief Daniel Goldin told a press conference after the launch. His Russian counterpart, Yuri Koptev, said the launch wa a vital vindication for the troubled Russian space industry, proving it could play a major role in space operation. Today we made a truly epoch-making step to carry out this project. The Russian space industry is alive and well and is perfectly able to fulfill all of it commitment on the international space station, he said. The launch went smoothly, with the rocket soaring into the cloudy sky above the central Asian steppe. The huge roar of the rocket reverberated for dozen of kilometer (miles) across the empty plain around the base. The mood at the launch pad wa tense before the launch, with space official and worker anxiously making last-minute check to ensure there were no problem. Solar power panel on the module were successfully deployed shortly after it reached it first orbit and all system were working normally, official said. The launch of the Russian cargo module, which had been delayed for more than a year, usher in a new era of cooperation among former space-race rival. Space official expressed optimism that cooperation would further promote world stability following the end of the Cold War. We still have some contradiction, we still have combat missile aimed at each other, but the predominant trend is the state of cooperation and doing thing together, said Yuri Semyonov of Russia's Energia space company. The 12.4-meter (41.2-feet) Zarya, or Sunrise, wa launched by a three-stage Proton booster rocket. Zarya is designed to serve a a space tugboat in the early stage of the project, providing propulsion, power and communication. Engineers finished final preparation early Friday for the liftoff of the 24-ton module. The rocket blasted off under cloudy sky and strong wind, and disappeared behind the cloud 40 second later. The international space station, the U.S.-led successor to Russia's beleaguered Mir, involves 16 nation and is due to be completed by 2004. It will consist of more than 100 element that will take 45 assembly flight to complete. Russia's crucial participation ha been hampered by the country's financial problem. The launch of the first segment wa postponed repeatedly, mainly because the chronically broke Russian space agency couldn't afford to complete another part of the station that is to go up later. Zarya is to fly alone for two week before a rendezvous with the American space shuttle Endeavor, which is to be launched Dec. 3 carrying the Unity connecting module. The space station will not be inhabitable until at least early 2000, following the launch of a Russian crew module which is set to blast off next July or August. The space station is expected to cost at least dlrs 40 billion, with the United States planning to pay dlrs 24 billion. It will serve a an orbital home for visiting astronaut and cosmonaut for at least 15 year. Russia ha repeatedly failed to meet deadline for constructing the crew module, putting the whole project behind schedule. Having lost hope of getting promised government fund, the Russian space agency ha sold research time on the station to NASA for dlrs 60 million to complete the segment. Russia rent the Baikonur launching pad from Kazakstan. Endeavour and it astronaut closed in Sunday to capture the first piece of the international space station, the Russian-made Zarya control module that had to be connected to the Unity chamber aboard the shuttle. Stacking the two giant cylinder 240 mile above the Earth wa considered the most difficult part of the mission. The job fell to Nancy Currie, the shuttle crane operator who had deftly hoisted and repositioned Unity in the cargo bay on Saturday. The two station piece are so big 77 foot from the tip of one to the tip of the other with a combined mass of 70,000 pound that Currie and her crewmates were going to have to rely on a computerized vision system and camera view, rather than direct line of sight. Such a blind docking had never been attempted before. Mission Control gave the astronaut plenty of time for the task. The main thing I've tried to do for the last two year working on this flight is make sure we have time. We have margin on everything, said flight director Bob Castle. Before beginning their final approach to Zarya Russian for Sunrise the shuttle's six astronaut had to steer clear of a chunk of a rocket launched last month from California. Mission Control ordered the pilot to fire the shuttle thruster to put an extra three mile between Endeavour and the space junk, putting Endeavour a total of five mile from the orbiting debris. The smaller gap would have been probably a little too close for comfort, Mission Control said. The bigger worry, by far, wa over Endeavour's pursuit and capture of Zarya, and it coupling with Unity. The shuttle's 50-foot robot arm had never before been assigned to handle an object a massive a the 44,000-pound Zarya, a power and propulsion module that wa launched from Kazakhstan on Nov. 20. It will provide all the necessary electricity and steering for the fledgling space station until a permanent control module can be launched next summer. The 36-foot, 25,000-pound Unity will serve a a connecting passageway, or vestibule, for future module. In case Zarya and Unity could not be connected with the robot arm, two spacewalking astronaut would have to manually fit them together. The astronaut would be going out anyway Monday to attach electrical connector and cable between the two component. In all, three spacewalks were planned for Endeavour's 12-day flight. NASA estimate 43 more launch and 159 more spacewalks will be needed after this mission to assemble the entire orbiting complex. Once completed, the 16-nation space station will have a mass of 1 million pound, be longer than a football field, and house up to seven astronaut and cosmonaut. Two astronaut ventured back out on another spacewalk Wednesday to attach antenna to the international space station under construction nearly 250 mile above Earth. For the second time this week, Jerry Ross and James Newman floated out the hatch of the shuttle Endeavour to work on the seven-story, 35-ton station taking shape in the open cargo bay. Their No. 1 priority wa to attach two 100-pound antenna to Unity, the American-made side of the space station. Their other job, time permitting, wa trickier: trying to open a stuck antenna on Zarya, the Russian-built control module. The planned seven-hour spacewalk wa not nearly a difficult or crucial a Monday night's outing, during which Ross and Newman hooked up 40 electrical connection between Zarya and Unity. The plan called for the men to lug two suitcase-size antenna about halfway up Unity and install them on opposite side of the 36-foot cylinder. Once activated, the antenna will provide a direct, virtually uninterrupted communication link between Unity and NASA's Mission Control. Otherwise, US. flight controller would have to rely on the sporadic coverage provided by Russian ground station. The electronic and computer hookup for the antenna will be made inside Unity on Thursday, after the entire crew enters the orbiting station for the first time. Other spacewalking chore for Ross and Newman on Wednesday evening included erecting a sunshade over a computer mounted to the outside of Unity. Mission Control decided just before the spacewalk to let Newman take a crack at unjamming the Zarya antenna. Flight controller urged caution. The antenna wa rolled up on a spool, and engineer worried the 3-foot strip might pop open with enough force to hurt him if he got too close. Newman had a 10-foot grappling hook for the job. The antenna is one of two that failed to open properly following Zarya's Nov. 20 launch from Kazakstan. One more spacewalk is planned for Endeavour's 12-day mission: On Saturday, Ross and Newman will conduct a photo survey and take out a sack of tool that will be used by future station visitor. Newman also may try to unjam the other Zarya antenna. This wa the sixth spacewalk for Ross during his 18-year NASA career, the most by an American, and the third for Newman. ",NASA and the Russian Space Agency readied the first part of an international space station for launch from Baikonur base.They decided not to change the orbit of the Zarya module as Russia had requested.Zarya's Nov. 20 launch was a success.The Zarya module orbited Earth for 2 weeks before a rendezvous with U.S. shuttle Endeavor to join it to the Unity module.It was tweaked and working well.It will serve as a space tugboat.The first 2 building blocks of the international space station were successfully joined by Endeavor astronauts in the shuttle's open cargo bay.Endeavor astronauts made 2 of 3 planned spacewalks to work on the space station modules.,"Russia launched the first piece of the international space station into orbit a year after the originally scheduled date.The launch follows a last minute Russian request to change the orbit of the space station to put it closer to Mir.This request was set aside.Two weeks later, the U.S. carried the Unity chamber into orbit.U.S. astronauts aboard the Endeavor shuttle then joined the Unity chamber to the Russian Zarya control module.The resulting 7 story structure appeared to be a perfect fit.In a subsequent second space walk, the astronauts were to install antennas on the Unity chamber as well as to attempt to unjam a Russian antenna.","Jerry Ross and James Newman spacewalked to attach antennas to Unity, the American half of the first stage of the 16-nation space station.Unity will be a connecting passageway for other modules.The other portion of the fledgling station, the Russian- built and launched Zarya module, will provide power and propulsion to the facility.The successful launch of Zarya, which had been delayed over a year due to funding woes, was hailed by the Russian Space Agency head as proof that the Russian space industry ""is perfectly able to fulfill all of its commitments on the international space station"".Russia is scheduled to launch the crew module next year.","After a year's delay Russia launched the first unit of the international space station, then pushed it to a higher orbit.Zarya will provide propulsion, power, and comms.US shuttle Endeavour made a blind docking with Zarya.Two spacewalks made electrical connections with Unity, which will serve as a passageway, attached its antennas and attempted to open a stuck Zarya antenna.A Russian cost-cutting proposal to orbit the station closer to Mir jointly vetoed.Russia promised to destroy Mir but now wants to extend its life.Russia sold early research time on the station to NASA to pay construction costs but claims the management lead for 1st 5 years."
48,"Caught in the middle of an economic crisis, many Brazilian factory fear they won't be able to pay their worker the mandatory year-end bonus. So they're considering paying with product instead of cash. Some workplace have already offered their employee such thing a hammer, nail, screw and bolt instead of the traditional cash bonus that normally is equivalent to one month's wage, said the head of Brazil's largest federation of trade union. The idea is completely unacceptable, said Joao Antonio Felicio, secretary-general of the federation, which represents more than 2,000 union and 19 million worker. We will recommend our union reject such a preposterous proposal. But strapped for cash and punished by high interest rate and declining sale, factory owner may have no other choice, said Joseph Curi, president of the Sao Paulo State Association of Small Industries, which represents 110,000 factory that employ nearly 800,000 worker. Access to credit is almost impossible, Curi said. If bank and the government don't create some kind of emergency credit line, the only option many of our associate will have will be to use product to pay the bonus. Factories that produce clothes, shoe, food, toy and household appliance were the most enthusiastic about the idea, Curi said. Curi predicted even harsher time for Brazil with the belt-tightening austerity package newly re-elected President Fernando Henrique Cardoso is expected to announce Tuesday. The measure, aimed at curbing the country's ballooning budget deficit equal to about 7 percent of gross domestic product are expected to include spending cut and, possibly, more tax. There is a lot of talk of increasing tax, which mean le cash circulating in the market and more credit restriction, Curi said. It is a shortsighted approach that will spell more recession and the collapse of many small factory. Brazil ha been a major casualty of the global economic crisis, buffeted by loss of investor confidence and a strong outflow of capital. The country's foreign reserve have fallen below dlrs 50 billion, from dlrs 70 billion at the end of July. In an effort to prevent a collapse of the nation's currency, the real, and stem capital flight, interest rate were hiked to 50 percent a year. For union leader Felicio, the proposed product-for-cash swap is a clear sign of the despair the business sector is feeling because of the recessive economic policy brought by the Real Plan, the economic stabilization program put together in 1994 when Cardoso wa finance minister. The plan succeeded in slashing inflation from 2,400 percent to almost zero today. But it also brought recession and unemployment, which now stand at almost 8 percent, the highest in a decade. President Fernando Henrique Cardoso's effort to repair the largest economy in Latin America may depend on the outcome of this weekend's gubernatorial election. Cardoso want to impose tough measure that would slash government spending and impose new tax to try to halt the slide in Brazil's economy and restore investor confidence. But his plan, expected to be unveiled next week, must be approved by Congress, and state governor have enormous sway over local delegation. The influence governor have on their congressional bloc is overwhelming, said University of Sao Paulo political scientist Eduardo Kugelmas. Brazil ha been caught up in the financial turmoil that began more than a year ago in Southeast Asia. As wary investor have fled it financial market, Brazil's foreign reserve have fallen below dlrs 50 billion from dlrs 70 billion at the end of July. On Sunday, voter return to the poll for runoff election in 12 state and in the Federal District of Brasilia. The outcome will likely determine how successful Cardoso is in getting Congress to approve his economic program, which is aimed at trimming the budget deficit. New income, fuel and bank transaction tax are expected to be proposed. Kugelmas said opponent of the president stand a good chance of winning in four large state Sao Paulo, Minas Gerais, Rio de Janeiro and Rio Grande do Sul. If they win, the president will face a tough uphill battle, he said. Cardoso need the governors' support not only in influencing the congressional delegation, but also in holding down their own spending. The problem is that none of the candidate in Sunday's election . want to be identified with unpopular austerity measure, said Kugelmas. So they promise to spend more money on school, hospital and public work project. Sao Paulo, Brazil's industrial and financial powerhouse, is perhaps the state most critical to the success of Cardoso's austerity plan. With more than 34 million inhabitant, nearly equal to the entire population of neighboring Argentina, it alone account for more than one-third of Brazil's economic output and 70 of the 513 congressional seat. While incumbent governor Mario Covas, a Cardoso ally who is seeking re-election, ha committed himself to the austerity plan, Covas opponent Paulo Maluf is a question mark. If Maluf win, he will use his victory a a launching pad to the presidency in 2003, Kugelmas predicted. And that mean he will try to stay a far away a possible from any austerity measure. Brazil and the International Monetary Fund moved closer Tuesday to agreement on an expected dlrs 30 billion rescue package for the world's ninth-largest economy. A joint statement by the IMF and the Brazilian government said the two side agreed Brazil should aim to reduce it budget deficit from an expected eight percent of gross domestic product to zero by 2000. The statement wa issued after weekend talk between IMF official and a Brazilian delegation headed by Pedro Parente, executive secretary of the Finance Ministry. Representatives of the World Bank and the Inter-American Development Bank took part in the talk. Both organization a well a private bank are expected to contribute to the rescue package. Brazil is the latest country to be hit by the financial crisis that began 15 month ago in Asia and then spread to Russia. Brazil ha lost about dlrs 25 billion in foreign currency reserve since August when Russia defaulted on it debt and sparked a new crisis of confidence in emerging market country. If instability continues in Brazil it could affect Argentina, it main trading partner, and other Latin American economy. Despite the re-election of Fernando Henrique Cardoso for a second term a president and the announcement Oct. 8 that Brazil and the IMF had agreed on the broad outline of a financial assistance package, investor continued to withdraw large sum of money from Brazil. Cardoso is preparing an emergency program of budget cut to restore investor confidence and prevent a devaluation of the country's currency. Investors want Cardoso to outline the plan this week but he is expected to wait until after Sunday's second round of election for state governor, whose support he need for his budget cut. The joint statement said the Brazil-IMF discussion were aimed at preparing the ground for prompt support by the international community, including the IMF, for the multi-year fiscal program to be announced soon by the Brazilian authority, which will include new policy initiative. The statement reiterated Brazil's goal of achieving a primary budget surplus of 2.6 percent of it gross domestic product in 1999, 2.8 percent in 2000 and 3.0 percent in 2001 which would fulfill the government target of stabilizing the ratio of net consolidated public sector debt to GDP by the year 2000. The two side are to continue their talk with the objective of reaching early agreement, the statement said. There's no such thing a a free lunch any longer in Brazil, President Fernando Henrique Cardoso is telling government worker. No haircut or phone call, either. Eager to bolster the sagging economy, Cardoso want to slash dlrs 19 billion (23.5 billion real) from the budget deficit, and he's beginning by paring perk for the more than 2,000 worker at the presidential palace in Brasilia, the capital. Sure, it's not much when compared with a deficit of some dlrs 65 billion, or 7 percent of economic output. But a Cardoso ready a package of spending cut and tax increase, he clearly want to show Brazilians that economy start at home. So goodbye to the afternoon courtesy snack of sandwich, fruit and juice, a palace tradition. Three barber shop in the palace were closed, and the use of cellular phone and copier wa restricted. The price of a buffet offered employee for lunch wa raised from dlrs 6 to dlrs 8.50 (7 real to 10 reals). Cardoso himself ha promised to travel le and more cheaply. On a trip to a summit in Portugal this month, he took a delegation of just eight, half the usual number. The saving at the palace could come to nearly dlrs 145,000 (170,000 real) a month, said Nilson Rebello, chief administrator of the president's office. Cardoso, under pressure to repair an economy battered by the world financial turmoil, is expected to unveil the full scope of his deficit-cutting plan next week. It is believed to include a spate of new tax on fuel, income, personal fortune and bank transaction. The plan is part of a deal with the International Monetary Fund for a rescue package estimated at dlrs 30 billion. The money would strengthen and, hopefully, restore investor confidence in the world's ninth-largest economy, now at the center of the financial crisis buffeting developing nation for more than a year. Brazil already ha agreed to annual target to sharply reduce it deficit through the year 2001. On Wednesday, newspaper published a joint statement from Brazil and the IMF, although a final agreement hasn't been reached yet. Despite Cardoso's effort, many Brazilians were le than impressed by the palace penny-pinching. The leftist Workers Party said the government wa making a big deal of insignificant saving while it failed to cut other dubious project, such a a dlrs 800,000 (1 million real) moat being built around Congress to keep protester from easily entering the building. The Globo TV network also suggested there still wa plenty of fat to cut, citing government expense for running shoe, Persian carpet and gold cufflink, intended a present for visiting dignitary. Cardoso is counting on help from friendly state governor to control spending. But the governor, some facing runoff election on Sunday, are promising pay raise and public work project that could sink the austerity plan. In Brasilia, Joaquim Roriz ha promised civil service raise, bonus and new job that his opponent estimate would cost some dlrs 1 billion (1.2 billion reals). Roriz hasn't explained where the money would come from. In powerful Minas Gerais state, the government will almost certainly have to lay off worker the state payroll consumes 78 percent of the budget. To rein in the free-spending habit of provincial politician, Cardoso reportedly want to hold local government to bimonthly limit on spending. Federal money would automatically be cut off if spending get out of hand. Latin American leader flew Friday to Portugal for a weekend summit to figure out how they can shield their economy from the global financial crisis. Not since the early 1980s have so many country been in recession, and the crisis now threatens to cripple Latin America's developing economy. An early arrival, Cuban President Fidel Castro, described the turmoil in world financial market a the most important issue facing the world at the moment. I don't know if we are coming to the end of the world economic order. It will be interesting to know, the Cuban leader said at a hotel press conference shortly after his arrival for the annual Ibero-American summit. Emphasizing the scale of the threat, Castro said President Clinton wa aware that if South America fall into crisis, it will be extended inevitably also to the United States, which is heavily involved in investment and loan in the region. Jittery investor have abruptly pulled cash out of Latin America with devastating effect on stock market and currency reserve. The head of state and government from Latin America, Spain and Portugal will explore measure to ward off the financial turmoil that already ha devastated Asia and Russia. Stock market also fell in Portugal and Spain, heavy investor in Latin America. The Latin American leader must gauge the need for unpopular reform of their public finance, including austerity package which risk social unrest and political upheaval. A joint declaration will be signed Sunday in this ancient port city on the Douro River in northern Portugal. Diplomats said there wa consensus on the form of the final statement. The declaration call on the international community, and Group of Seven country in particular, to take the necessary measure to promote stability in international financial market, which is a necessary condition for sustained economic growth, said Luis Augusto Castro Neves, of the Brazilian Foreign Ministry. Latin America's leader favor creating some kind of regulatory system for global financial transaction that would place control on speculator, like measure to slow down the internatioal flow of money. They also want reform that allow international financial institution to head off crisis rather than react to them with rescue package. International institution must be active in tackling crisis like the recent one . and contribute to stability, Portuguese Foreign Minister Jaime Gama said. Countries that have progressive policy should not be penalized, they should be given incentive, Gama added in reference to Latin American nations' effort to modernize their economy. Brazil, the continent's largest economy and a potential bulwark against creeping recession, is waiting for news of a dlrs 30 billion bailout package from the International Monetary Fund. The president of the World Bank and InterAmerican Development Bank also were expected at the talk. The move by the US. Federal Reserve to cut interest rate Thursday revived Latin America's financial market, but analyst expected the reprieve to be short-lived because of deep concern about the continent's economic health. The recent economic trouble stemmed in part from the structural weakness of Latin American economy. A strike being waged by state employee in Colombia against a government austerity package offer a glimpse of the trouble that could arise if tough reform are introduced. Brazil is drafting an austerity package that will hit public spending, especially social security. Brazilian official ended four day of meeting with representative of the International Monetary Fund on Tuesday without living up to their public pledge to announce concrete measure to reduce government deficit. In Washington, Pedro Parente, executive secretary of the Brazilian Finance Ministry, offered only detail on Brazil's plan for raising a primary account surplus over the next three year. With only five day to go before gubernatorial runoff on Sunday, neither he nor President Fernando Henrique Cardoso, in Brasilia, said how the government planned to achieve the saving. Important ally of Cardoso are lagging behind in three key state, and despite the government promise, market analyst did not expect an announcement until after the election. Instead, the strategy in Brasilia and Washington appeared to focus on reassuring the market that work on cutting the deficit wa going forward, without providing fodder for opponent in domestic election. The discussion continue with the objective of reaching agreement soon on the detailed program, said a joint statement by the IMF and the Brazilian Finance Ministry. Because of Brazil's enormous deficit, the collapse of emerging market ha hit the nation particularly hard, draining foreign currency reserve and pushing the economy toward recession. Finance official in Washington and around the world fear that a collapse of Brazil, because of it size and link to other economy, would worsen financial instability throughout the hemisphere. With 160 million people, Brazil represents the world's ninth-largest economy and is the financial engine of Latin America. Throughout the day, government official met with Cardoso in Brasilia and were expected to fine-tune a three-year austerity package that Cardoso wa to discus with congressional party leader on Wednesday morning. In Brasilia, official said that among the measure being considered were a tax increase on financial transaction, to three-tenths of a percent from two-tenths of a percent, and extending the Fiscal Stabilization Fund, which set aside 20 percent of all tax collected for presidential discretionary spending. The fund wa to have expired by 1999. Speaking in Washington, Parente said that Brazil would aim toward a surplus of 2.6 percent in 1999, 2.8 percent in 2000 and 3 percent in 2001. It had already been announced, at the end of the IMF's annual meeting in Washington two week ago that Brazil would have to reach a primary account surplus of 2.5 percent to 3 percent to qualify for IMF aid. The primary account cover government expense, without interest payment on debt. Ernest Brown, senior economist for Latin America at Morgan Stanley Dean Witter, said sign that the Brazilian government and the IMF were moving closer to an aid package were reassuring, and that he did not expect much more than reassurance until next week. I call this the `We have a pope' scenario, Brown said. You're just going to hear that we have a pope, maybe see the white smoke rising, he said, and not figure out who the pope is until after the election. The United States is preparing to commit US. taxpayer fund a part of a lending program of at least $30 billion to try to insulate Brazil, and with it the rest of Latin America, from the worst effect of the financial turmoil circling the globe, according to US. and foreign official assembling the program. Details of the US. contribution, which is expected to total several billion dollar in direct aid or loan guarantee, have yet to be negotiated. But several congressional leader have been alerted to the likelihood that the administration would have to act while Congress is in recess. This early warning from the administration reflects memory of how Congress erupted with objection and hearing in 1995 when President Clinton committed $20 billion in US. fund to the bailout of Mexico. But administration official said last week that their early sounding indicate that member of Congress are deeply concerned about preventing an economic collapse in Latin America that would resound in the United States, and thus they expect few objection. The timing of an aid package for Brazil originally expected within the next few day is complicated by unexpected delay that have cropped up in dealing with the Brazilian government. The government of President Fernando Henrique Cardoso face politically risky gubernatorial election on Sunday, which may well determine whether Brazil can execute an austerity program that is the key condition for the loan it is concurrently negotiating with the International Monetary Fund. The biggest role in the rescue program for Brazil will be taken by the International Monetary Fund, which said last week that it would contribute at least $15 billion and appears to be under pressure from the United States to do even more. Another $9 billion or so will come from the World Bank and the Inter-American Development Bank, and the remainder from the United States and other major industrial nation. Germany and Japan, though, have been reluctant to take part, one US. official noted, suggesting that Latin America is chiefly Washington's problem, not their own. So far, US. official working behind the scene to organize the aid package have said nothing in public about the detail of plan for a direct contribution to Brazil. Brazil is very important to the economic well-being of the region, the United States and the international community, and all of u are very much focused on seeing how we can be helpful, Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin said on Friday. But in a wide-ranging interview about the global economic turmoil, Rubin declined to say what strategy he would pursue in dealing with Brazil's problem and insisted that no decision had been made about how the United States might contribute. But he discussed Brazil a an opportunity to engage in the kind of preventive financial diplomacy that President Clinton advocated in speech to the IMF and the World Bank here three week ago. At the time, Clinton argued that the monetary fund should provide contingent finance to help country ward off global financial contagion rather than wait for disaster to strike. Direct US. aid to Brazil would clearly send a symbolic message: that after a year of trying to manage the financial crisis through the monetary fund, the United States is now ready to put a limited amount of it own capital at risk to prevent further havoc not only for Brazil but to stop chaos spreading to Argentina, Mexico and other country that are major US. trading partner. That would be a change of strategy. So far, the United States ha operated almost entirely through international financial institution, chiefly the IMF But it would also be a risky move for President Clinton, economically and politically. Even though Congress objected to the $20 billion in US. fund committed to the bailout of Mexico, it turned out that only $12 billion wa ultimately needed, and it ha since been paid back, with interest. But Rubin noted on Friday that it's a very different environment now. Other administration official say they believe that there would be few objection in Congress to direct US. participation in a Brazil bailout. I think there are a lot more people in Congress who are now scared to death by what's been happening in the market, and what could happen in their own district, a White House official said last week, and they won't say much a long a they don't have to vote on it. By acting soon to stabilize Latin America, the administration is hoping to capitalize on two week of relative calm after the late-summer panic that engulfed Russia and, at it height, led to an outflow of a billion dollar a day from Brazil, for fear that it would be the next country forced to devalue it currency. Whether this calm mark the beginning of a turnaround or just another pause in the wildfire that have erupted since Thailand's currency crisis in July 1997 is a matter of considerable debate. But many expert cite the confluence of several event that have reassured jittery investor around the world: two successive interest-rate cut in the United States, Japan's long-delayed move to prop up it banking system with $500 billion in taxpayer fund, and a steady strengthening of currency in Thailand, Indonesia and South Korea, the first sign that investor may be preparing to return. Always circumspect when it come to commenting publicly on market, Rubin acknowledged that in the last several week there have been a number of significant, positive development. But the former trader, burned during a 26-year career by many false market rally, warned that serious issue remain and that it will take some time for the world to work it way out of what he ha repeatedly called the most serious international financial disruption of the last 50 year. In fact, Rubin's aide are clearly nervous about the possibility of another outbreak that could set off a new round of panic, which ha made it virtually impossible for many emerging-market country to borrow money on world market. Brazil and Japan are the two obvious tinderbox, said Jeffrey Garten, dean of the Yale School of Management, who served a undersecretary of commerce for international affair during Clinton's first term. In Brazil, the issue is whether the package that is coming together will really be big enough to deal with an exploding debt problem. And in Japan the question is whether there is real reform that go along with the money. But after spending 18 month in negotiation with the Japanese, Rubin clearly sens that the United States ha little leverage in Tokyo; it problem are chiefly rooted in political gridlock, not lack of resource. In Brazil, though, the United States ha a better chance of buying time and influencing an economic reform program, a long a it doe not appear to be dictating term publicly to Cardoso and his team. But demonstrating economic support will probably require tapping the Exchange Stabilization Fund, created during the Roosevelt administration to help stabilize the dollar. The money is under Rubin's control, with presidential approval, and he reached into it to circumvent congressional objection to aiding Mexico in 1995. But the reaction wa so strong for a time Congress restricted tapping the fund for international bailouts that Rubin ha been extraordinarily cautious ever since. He committed $3 billion in a second line of defense in emergency aid program for Indonesia and South Korea last year, but no money wa ultimately dispersed to either country. US. official said that South Korea did not need the extra help, and that the collapse of the Suharto government in Indonesia so changed the political scene there that it would be too risky to offer direct US. aid. In the bailout of Russia whose economy collapsed after President Boris Yeltsin abandoned an agreement to reform the economy and dismissed the leading reformer the United States offered no direct help. Those event set off a panicked exit by investor from all emerging market, and greatly worsened Brazil's trouble. So far, Brazilian official have successfully calmed the market by constantly talking about a forthcoming aid program from the IMF, convincing speculator that it would be dangerous to bet against the country. But at the same time, the Brazilian official have maintained the pose that they do not really need the cash and are certainly in no hurry to get it. US. official and top official of the IMF are clearly nervous, worried that the longer the negotiation drag on, the greater will be the risk of Brazil being caught in another round of market turmoil. The Brazilians want everyone to think that it's all under control, said an investment banker involved in the talk. But the fact is that there's still a real risk that sometime in the next 18 month the government is going to be forced to devalue it currency, which is pegged to the dollar, but adjusts about 7.5 percent a year in a carefully controlled fall. To prevent a sudden devaluation, the Brazilian government ha had to raise interest rate to more than 50 percent, choking off credit for most company. Meanwhile, the country is slipping into recession. The aid would buy time for the Brazilians, but it is contingent on Cardoso's success in persuading the legislature to end huge deficit, chiefly through unpopular cut in social spending. The first deputy managing director for the International Monetary Fund, Stanley Fischer, spent Friday in Brazil to review the country's austerity plan, which is expected to be announced after Sunday's election but before the international package, to avoid the appearance that the global lender is dictating condition to Brazil. Brazil ha to do a lot, Fischer said last week before leaving on his trip. In return, I expect the international community will make a large contribution. Leaders from 19 Latin American nation, Spain and Portugal put finishing touch Saturday on an Ibero-American summit declaration warning of global recession unless action is taken to stabilize the international financial system. The draft declaration said recent financial market turmoil show that adjustment must be made quickly to keep the difficulty affecting a few from becoming a crisis for all. The declaration address the world's seven richest nation. The Group of Seven is composed of the United States, Japan, Britain, Germany, France, Italy and Canada. The final declaration will be approved at Sunday's summit in this port city in northern Portugal. Brazilian President Fernando Henrique Cardoso said Saturday that Brazil and China, two of the world's largest economy, had become the dike of resistance to global recession. Protecting their economy from the spreading economic turmoil, which is affecting more country than at any time since the early 1980s, is key to world economic stability, he said. Brazil is Latin America's biggest economy and the eighth-largest in the world, and it economic collapse could take the rest of the continent with it. To halt Brazil's slide toward recession, Cardoso is preparing austerity measure including spending cut, tax hike and lower interest rate. The reform would help Brazil qualify for an International Monetary Fund rescue package estimated at dlrs 30 billion. The IMF ha put together bailout package totaling dlrs 137 billion since the financial crisis struck Thailand 15 month ago and then spread from Asia to Russia. US. President Bill Clinton's administration, aware of the impact that a Latin American recession would have on the United States, ha actively pushed the IMF and the World Bank to support Brazil after it wa hit by investor flight. There's no such thing a a free lunch any longer in Brazil, President Fernando Henrique Cardoso is telling government worker. No haircut or phone call, either. Eager to bolster the sagging economy, Cardoso want to slash dlrs 19 billion from the budget deficit, and he's beginning by paring perk for the more than 2,000 worker at the presidential palace in Brasilia, the capital. Sure, it's not much when compared with a deficit of some dlrs 65 billion, or 7 percent of economic output. But a Cardoso ready a package of spending cut and tax increase, he clearly want to show Brazilians that economy start at home. So goodbye to the afternoon courtesy snack of sandwich, fruit and juice, a palace tradition. Three barber shop in the palace were closed, and the use of cellular phone and copier wa restricted. The price of a buffet offered employee for lunch wa raised from dlrs 6 to dlrs 850. Cardoso himself ha promised to travel le and more cheaply. On a trip to a summit in Portugal this month, he took a delegation of just eight, half the usual number. The saving at the palace could come to nearly dlrs 145,000 a month, said Nilson Rebello, chief administrator of the president's office. Cardoso, under pressure to repair an economy battered by the world financial turmoil, is expected to unveil the full scope of his deficit-cutting plan next week. It is believed to include a spate of new tax on fuel, income, personal fortune and bank transaction. The plan is part of a deal with the International Monetary Fund for a rescue package estimated at dlrs 30 billion. The money would strengthen and, hopefully, restore investor confidence in the world's ninth-largest economy, now at the center of the financial crisis buffeting developing nation for more than a year. Brazil already ha agreed to annual target to sharply reduce it deficit through the year 2001. On Wednesday, newspaper published a joint statement from Brazil and the IMF, although a final agreement hasn't been reached yet. Despite Cardoso's effort, many Brazilians were le than impressed by the palace penny-pinching. The leftist Workers Party said the government wa making a big deal of insignificant saving while it failed to cut other dubious project, such a a dlrs 800,000 moat being built around Congress to keep protester from easily entering the building. The Globo TV network also suggested there still wa plenty of fat to cut, citing government expense for running shoe, Persian carpet and gold cufflink, intended a present for visiting dignitary. Cardoso is counting on help from friendly state governor to control spending. But the governor, some facing runoff election on Sunday, are promising pay raise and public work project that could sink the austerity plan. In Brasilia, Joaquim Roriz ha promised civil service raise, bonus and new job that his opponent estimate would cost some dlrs 1 billion. Roriz hasn't explained where the money would come from. In powerful Minas Gerais state, the government will almost certainly have to lay off worker the state payroll consumes 78 percent of the budget. To rein in the free-spending habit of provincial politician, Cardoso reportedly want to hold local government to bimonthly limit on spending. Federal money would automatically be cut off if spending get out of hand. The Commerce Department on Tuesday provided a concrete measure of the effect of the global economic downturn on the American economy, reporting that the nation's trade deficit widened by $2.2 billion in August to $16.77 billion. That is the widest gap since the government recalculated the way it measure trade flow in 1992. It resulted from a decline in American export and a sharp increase in what this country buy from abroad. So far this year, the trade deficit is running roughly 50 percent above last year's level and is up to a projected $170 billion for the year, a gap that is expected to widen even further. One senior administration official who deal with economic issue, speaking on condition of anonymity, said Tuesday that internal projection suggest that the trade deficit in 1999 could reach $300 billion, a figure that he said will certainly cut into growth, and could well become a major political problem. Trade deficit carry with them both good and troubling signal about the economy. The current flood of import is helping contain inflation to some of the lowest level in decade. And while sale of American aircraft, computer chip and other good are suffering, the weakening of the dollar on world market in recent week may provide an end-of-the-year boost for American exporter. But at this moment of global upheaval, the biggest problem facing American company is the inability of many nation and some large company in Asia and Latin America simply to borrow money to make ordinary purchase. The result is such a freeze of economic activity that empty shipping container are stacking up on American pier. And the effect are hurting everyone from Midwest farmer who can no longer send wheat to an impoverished Russia, to East Coast fisherman who are discovering that Japan's appetite for salmon and lobster ha been ruined by the banking crisis. Among the most surprising element of Tuesday's report is that more than a third of August's deficit wa with one country that so far ha managed to ward off the worst effect of the global troubles: China. Despite continued growth of the Chinese economy, export to China have slowed dramatically and import of Chinese-made good have exploded, a the country desperately seek to sell here good that would ordinarily be sold elsewhere in Asia. That increased the monthly deficit with Beijing to $5.9 billion, level previously only seen in trade with Japan. The Chinese besieged by flood, deeply troubled state-owned industry and an incipient banking crisis have signaled to the United States in recent week that they have little interest in any swift move to open their market further in return for entry into the World Trade Organization. That amount to a major setback for President Clinton, who for three year ha been using the negotiation over China's entry to the world body a the centerpiece of his effort to open China both economically and politically. Ostensible progress in this area ha been cited by the administration until recently a one of the success of the administration's China policy, but now official say privately that the progress is evaporating. The decline in export will trim the growth of the American economy, and it wa one factor in the Federal Reserve's decision to lower interest rate two time in recent week. So administration official were going out of their way Tuesday to portray the number a another warning sign, but not a crisis. While the United States remains strong and sound, the troubled condition of the global marketplace continue to strongly influence the US. trade balance, Commerce Secretary Williams Daley said in a statement Tuesday. After China, the biggest deterioration in the American trade balance in August came in Mexico, where the peso ha weakened markedly a economic contagion ha spread through Latin America. Exports to Mexico have remained unchanged. But import from Mexico have increased markedly chiefly automobile and automotive part and telecommunication equipment a American manufacturer have taken advantage of the weakening currency. In contrast, America's trade surplus with Brazil, the latest focus of concern by the administration and the International Monetary Fund, barely budged from the same period a year ago. Normally, that would be cited a a sign of continued demand for American product in Latin America's largest economy, but there is fear it might be imperiled. The news come a the United States and the IMF complete a bailout package of $30 billion or more for Brazil, intended to help it stave off the kind of economic trouble that have swept through Asia, Russia and several other nation. Tuesday the IMF and Brazil reached agreement on the country's fiscal target for this year and next, a sign that the aid will likely be announced after election in Brazil this weekend. But for all these potential problem, the rising trade deficit ha barely caused a ripple on Capitol Hill. Because the rising level of import doe not appear to be triggering any unemployment here, the subject ha barely come up in race for the House and Senate around the country. The only exception ha been in region where the steel industry is strong. The major steel company have charged in recent week that Asian nation are dumping product on the American market at price well below their cost. The Commerce Department ha begun an inquiry. The Commerce Department's number showed that the deficit rose 15.3 percent to $16.77 billion in August, up from a revised figure of $14.55 billion in July. The department said that the resumption of production at General Motors Corp. after last summer's strike may have increased the size of the deficit's rise in August, a GM brought in part from abroad.

49,"SEOUL, South Korea (AP) US. President Bill Clinton won South Korea's support Saturday for confronting North Korea over a suspected nuclear site, and he warned the North's communist leader not to squander an historic chance to make a lasting peace on the peninsula. President Kim Dae-jung, appearing with Clinton at a news conference, pledged that his government would spare no effort in supporting the US. endeavor to resolve the nuclear question. He called for full access for US. inspector at a North Korean underground facility and said the North must constrain it development and export of missile. On the first of two day in South Korea, Clinton also held a roundtable discussion with business leader to hear their prescription for putting the nation's economy back on track. Economics and security are Clinton's twin theme on a five-day Asia trip that began in Japan. Clinton acknowledged that US. intelligence official are not yet certain that the suspicious underground construction project in North Korea is nuclear related. But he said the North risk closing the door on cooperation if it refuse a US. inspection of the site. It raise a strong suspicion, Clinton said at a joint news conference with Kim at the Blue House, the presidential mansion overlooking the capital. We need access to it. The foundation of US. effort to ease North Korea's decades-long hostility toward the South is a 1994 agreed framework in which the North halted it nuclear weapon program in exchange for a Western commitment to build modern nuclear energy source there. That deal would be shattered if the suspect site turned out to be a clandestine nuclear project. And that, in turn, would jeopardize preliminary North-South peace talk that could produce a treaty to replace the shaky armistice that ended the Korean War in 1953. Kim, who ha moved South Korea to a sunshine policy of engaging North Korea on cultural and economic front, firmly said his government support Clinton on the nuclear issue. We must require full access and way to ascertain the nature and the purpose of the construction site, Kim said. If it is, in fact, proven that it is nuclear related, we should demand immediate close down. He also said the North must limit it missile development, citing the great shock in Japan when the North Koreans test-fired a missile it way Aug. 31. In a dinner toast, Kim said that despite tension, North Korea is cautiously but noticeably taking measure to increase interaction and cooperation between the South and the North. And Clinton saluted Seoul's battle against Asia's economic woe. I believe Asia will emerge from this present crisis more prosperous, more stable, more democratic thanks in no small measure to Korea's example. After the state dinner, Clinton made a surprise late-night stop at a concert at the Sejong Culture Center where his younger brother, Roger, and his band were performing. The president listened to song off stage before his brother introduced the president a a very special person. The audience of 2,000 people stood and applauded. In meeting this week in Pyongyang, the North Korean capital, US. official were rebuffed in their request to see the suspicious underground site, which American intelligence official fear could be a secret effort to revive the North's nuclear weapon program. US. spy satellite photo show thousand of worker digging a massive complex. US. special envoy Charles Kartman said Thursday after the Pyongyang talk that there wa compelling evidence of an underground nuclear facility. But in a statement distributed by the US. Embassy here Saturday, Kartman backtracked, saying instead that the United States lack conclusive evidence the site is a nuclear facility. There is strong information that make u suspicious, but we lack conclusive evidence that the intended purpose of the underground site is nuclear related and, if so, what type of nuclear facility it might be, Kartman said, offering a clarification of his earlier remark. Kim said his government would spare no effort in supporting the US. endeavor to resolve the nuclear question. The North Koreans have denied the underground construction site ha any nuclear purpose, and it ha demanded a dlrs 300 million payment for proving that. In remark in Tokyo on Friday, Clinton rejected the idea of compensation. Directing his remark at North Korea, Clinton noted the significance of a new tourism deal that is bringing South Koreans to the North on cruise ship an arrangement touted by Kim a a sign the North may be opening up to it 1950s Korean War enemy. To risk that kind of cooperation and progress with America on other issue by stonewalling on the suspected nuclear site is contrary to the North's long-term interest, he said. Nothing could ever be put into that hole in the ground, given our defense partnership here, nothing could ever be put in that hole in the ground that would give the North Koreans a much advantage, a much power, a much wealth, a much happiness, a more of those ship going up there full of people from here, Clinton said. To underscore the US. military commitment to South Korea, Clinton wa scheduled to venture out of the capital on Sunday to visit US. Army troop at a training range north of Seoul. He also planned to address American troop at Osan Air Base from a U-2 spy plane hangar. North Korea ha demanded that the United States pay hundred of million of dollar for the right to inspect a huge underground center that US. intelligence analyst fear house a nuclear-weapons program, Clinton administration official said Wednesday. The United States rejected the request during meeting this week in Pyongyang, the North Korean capital, between North Korean official and a US. government delegation. As we expected, the North Koreans brought up the issue of compensation, and we flatly rejected it, said State Department Spokesman James Rubin. Asked how much money the North Koreans had demanded, Rubin said payment of the fee wa so not on a a possibility that I don't care to get into the figure. Other administration official said the fee would have been hundred of million of dollars; one put it at $300 million. The North Koreans have denied that the complex, which is being built on a mountainside about 25 mile northeast of Yongbyon, the former North Korean nuclear research center, is intended to be used for a nuclear weapon program. They have repeatedly said US. inspector could visit the site a long a Washington agreed to pay a large fee in compensation for what the North Koreans describe a the administration's slander. The North Korean representative at the United Nations, Kim Chang Guk, said last week that the United States could inspect the site on condition that when it is confirmed not to be a nuclear facility, the United States should pay compensation for slandering and defaming my country. US. intelligence agency fear that by building the complex, North Korea may have decided to abandon a four-year-old agreement with the United States in which North Korea pledged to give up it nuclear weapon program in exchange for billion of dollar in aid. The US. delegation, led by Charles Kartman, President Clinton's special envoy on North Korean issue, left Pyongyang on Wednesday after 12 hour of negotiation over three day with a team from the North Korean Foreign Ministry. The talk ended a Clinton began a trip to Asia that will include a visit to South Korea, where the issue of the North Korean construction site is expected to be among the major topic discussed with President Kim Dae-jung. Rubin said the US. delegation to North Korea had pressed for access to the site. We told them that access to the site is essential, he said. We've expected that this would be difficult, and we told the North Koreans, a we've said before, that verbal assurance, a they are wont to give, are simply unacceptable. US. official have said the construction of the underground site may not yet have technically violated the accord, because there is no evidence that North Korea ha begun pouring cement for a new reactor or a reprocessing plant to convert nuclear waste to bomb-grade plutonium. But if the United States determines that North Korea ha revived it nuclear program, Rubin said, it would go against the entire letter and spirit of the objective of the agreement, and it would affect the viability of the agreement. The administration ha expressed growing concern over North Korea's intention after several provocative act, including the underground construction near Yongbyon and the test firing last August of a missile over Japan. Last week Clinton named former Defense Secretary William Perry to review US. policy toward North Korea. Administration official say Perry is being asked to study way to salvage the 1994 nuclear agreement with North Korea, which had been among the administration's proudest achievement in foreign policy. North Korean news medium on Thursday said the communist nation's military is on full alert for war with the United States if a dispute over nuclear inspection come to blow. The North's official Korean Central News Agency reported that North Korean soldier and people of all walk of life were on full alert for war. North Korea typically sends out belligerent rhetoric, especially when it enters high-stake talk with Washington. The United States and North Korea are set to resume talk Friday about inspection of an underground North Korean site suspected of being used to produce nuclear weapon. KCNA broadcast brimmed with anti-American saber-rattling. Our People's Army will blow up the US. territory a a whole if the United States start a war on the divided Korean Peninsula, Vice Defense Minister Jong Chang Ryol wa quoted a saying Thursday. The general staff of the North Korean military accused Washington on Wednesday of pushing the situation in Korea to the brink of war by demanding inspection and talk aimed at preventing Pyongyang from developing nuclear weapon and long-range missile. Under the prevailing touch-and-go situation, the Korean People's Army is now bracing itself for a fight against the US. imperialist aggressor, KCNA quoted Jong a saying. The agency also quoted various party official, plant manager, even museum curator a pledging a thousandfold revenge or vowing to arm themselves with the spirit of human bomb and of suicidal attack. Washington demand unconditional inspection of the North's underground project. But North Korea asked Washington to pay dlrs 300 million for the right to inspect the site. Concerns that North Korea wa developing long-range missile capable of striking all of Japan and part of the United States escalated when North Korea fired a rocket on Aug. 31. Believed to be a test of it Taepo Dong missile, the rocket flew over Japan and landed in the Pacific Ocean. The North's 1.1 million-strong military is the world's fifth largest. It form the backbone of the North Korean government, with leader Kim Jong Il ruling the country a the head of the military. A congressman who visited remote part of North Korea last week said Saturday that the food and health situation there wa desperate and deteriorating, and that million of North Koreans might have starved to death in the last few year. The congressman, Tony Hall, D-Ohio, who ha had a longtime interest in world hunger, passed through Tokyo on his return to the United States and showed photograph he had taken of North Korean child with patchy hair, protruding bone, open sore and other sign of severe malnutrition. Hall also brought back a bag of what official called substitute food being distributed by a government food station: dried leaf and straw, so coarse that even cattle would normally turn away. They grind it into powder and make it into noodle, Hall said. The noodle have no nutrition and are indigestible, leaving people holding their aching stomach, he said. North Korea ha admitted that it is facing serious economic difficulty, but there have been sharply diverging assessment of how serious these are. Some visitor with the United Nations and other organization have said that the food situation seems to be a bit better now than a year or two ago. Hall said that the divergence might have arisen because in the North Korean capital, Pyongyang, life did seem to be slightly better than during his three previous trip to North Korea. But in rural area where foreigner are not often allowed to visit, he added, the overall situation is worse than ever. Based on visit to four hospital, Hall also emphasized that public health care had declined sharply. In one hospital, assistant were holding down a patient while surgeon conducted a stomach operation without electric light or anesthesia. Ordinary North Koreans are suffering, in part, because their government's hard-line policy have alienated would-be donor and aid agency. The United Nations ha repeatedly appealed for relief aid for North Korea, but the latest appeal ha raised le than one-third of the target. In September, Doctors Without Borders announced that it wa pulling it staff of 13 from North Korea because it feared that it aid wa going to the politically connected rather than to the most needy. North Korea doe not release mortality figure or health statistic, but Hall said that the United Nations had gathered and would soon release data indicating that 30 percent of North Korean child under age 2 are acutely malnourished and that 67 percent of all child are physically stunted. Hall said he thought that overall at least 1 million people had died and that the total wa probably closer to 3 million. In an indication of the seriousness with which professional demographer view the situation, the US. Bureau of the Census recently published estimate suggesting that North Korea's population peaked in 1995 at 21.55 million and ha since fallen to 21.23 million this year. That would be a decline of 320,000 over three year, a period when North Korea's population would have been expected to grow by about 925,000 people, based on the population growth rate of the early 1990s. Nicholas Eberstadt, an American specialist on North Korean population figure, say that there simply is not enough hard information for him to estimate the death toll from the famine. But he note one political tidbit: North Korea's constitution stipulates that there should be one delegate to the country's people's assembly for every 30,000 citizen. This year's assembly did not expand a previous one did, but rather had just 687 delegate, the same a the previous assembly held in 1990. While Eberstadt counsel caution, that could mean that North Korea's population, after eight year in which it had been expected to add several million people, is now back to 20.6 million people or fewer. The United States ha been supplying grain to North Korea, but strain are growing over a secret underground complex in the North that some expert worry may be the heart of a new nuclear weapon program. The United States warned last week that the agreed framework that is the basis for it relation with North Korea will be in jeopardy unless the North let American expert visit the underground complex and resolve their doubt. North Korea ha said that it will show off the complex only if Washington promise that if the complex is not a nuclear one, it will pay for vilifying u and impairing our prestige. Washington refuse to pay, and North Korea is warning that the standoff could lead the agreement to fall apart. Their shameless and wicked demand is an open infringement upon our sovereignty and wanton interference in our internal affair, declared North Korea's leading newspaper, Rodong Sinmun. A South Korean lawmaker said Friday communist North Korea could be producing plutonium and could have more secret underground nuclear facility than already feared. Without naming his source, Rep. Kim Deog-ryong of the Parliament's Foreign Affairs Committee said he had information that two underground facility captured on US. spy satellite photo may be nuclear plant. He said in a Parliament session that one of them is believed to already be producing plutonium and the other would be able to produce enough for 10 nuclear bomb starting around 2004. If true, the assertion paint a worse picture of suspected North Korean nuclear activity than already made public. Kim said he asked the government's Unification Ministry about the issue earlier this week and wa suspicious of it answer. It wa not sufficient or sincere, so I came to suspect that the government is trying to hide the truth, Kim said in a seven-page press release. US. and South Korean official said in August they had detected a huge underground construction site on a mountainside 40 kilometer (25 mile) northeast of Yongbyon, the country's main nuclear complex. The United States ha said it suspect the construction is nuclear-related, though it ha no evidence. North Korea ha denied it. Kim, a lawmaker from the main opposition Grand National Party, said there may actually be two underground facility not far from the Yongbyon complex. It wa activity at Yongbyon that prompted the United States to negotiate a 1994 accord promising development of two light-water reactor and fuel-oil shipment if North Korea would halt nuclear weapon development. At the time, North Korea wa believed to have made enough plutonium for one or two atomic bomb. The Yongbyon complex, which house a 500-megawatt laboratory nuclear reactor, ha been frozen under the 1994 accord. Kim said Friday that one new facility is already operating and the other is under construction and will be operational in four to six year. We estimate that the reactor will go on-line in 2002 or 2003, enabling the production of enough plutonium to build one nuclear weapon within six to 12 month, Kim said. North Korea would be able to make sufficient plutonium to make eight to 10 nuclear weapon every year after that. North Korea ha said the underground construction is for civilian use and not nuclear-related. It ha offered to open the facility to US. inspector, but say Washington must pay compensation if the facility is been proven to be for civilian use. President Clinton made an unusual, direct appeal to North Korea on Saturday to set aside any nuclear ambition in favor of strengthening tie to South Korea and the United States. The appeal came during a meeting with reporter at which he also counseled patience over Iraq's refusal to comply with a request from weapon inspector. I think it's important that we not overreact here on the first day, Clinton said in response to report that Iraq had balked at a request by UN. inspector for document on it weapon program. But, speaking at a joint appearance with South Korean President Kim Dae Jung, Clinton called the requested document quite important and said Iraq had some affirmative obligation to help weapon inspector. Aides to Clinton denied that his comment represented any softening toward Iraq. They said that because the situation wa still developing and the president wa preparing for meeting with Kim he had not been briefed in detail on Iraq's resistance when he appeared before reporter Saturday. National Security Adviser Sandy Berger said the administration wa consulting with other member of the UN. Security Council about the matter. If Iraq fails to meet it obligation under UN. resolution, he said, We obviously are prepared to act. Last weekend, Clinton called off a strike against Iraq minute before it wa to begin, delayed his departure for Asia to monitor the crisis and said that US. force remained poised to strike if Iraq reneged on it agreement to let UN. weapon inspector do their work. In his appearance with Kim, the president addressed a handful of question that ranged from North Korea to Indonesia to whether the Congress should punish him over the Lewinsky scandal. Before leaving Washington for this five-day trip to Japan, Korea and Guam, he drew a parallel between the government of Iraq and North Korea, saying, We must be no le concerned by North Korea's weapon activity. The Clinton administration is urgently seeking to inspect a vast construction site in North Korea that it belief may be the beginning of a nuclear weapon plant. Saturday, Clinton called that site, together with North Korea's test firing in August of a missile over Japan, cause for deep concern. But the Clinton administration is trying a very different approach toward North Korea than toward Iraq, partly at the urging of Kim, who is pursuing a sunshine policy of engagement with the North. As Clinton and Kim delivered prepared statement and answered question Saturday, Clinton became most animated in describing what he called a very beautiful picture that he happened to spot after turning on his hotel television on arriving in Seoul on Friday night: film of a cruise ship recently permitted to carry South Koreans on a tour into the North. I ask the North Koreans to think about this, he said, arguing that Kim's policy of engagement with the North presented them with a great opportunity. Nothing could ever be put in that hole in the ground that would give the North Koreans a much advantage, a much power, a much wealth, a much happiness a more of those ship going up there full of people from here. The Clinton administration fear that the construction site may be evidence that North Korea ha abandoned a 1994 pledge to the United States to give up it nuclear weapon program in exchange for billion of dollar in aid. The North Koreans have denied that the complex is intended to help build nuclear weapon. But they have demanded that the United States pay $300 million to inspect it, a request rejected this week by a US. delegation to Pyongyang, the North Korean capital. The new complex is being built on a mountainside about 25 mile northeast of Yongbyon, the former North Korean nuclear research center. Kim continued Saturday to emphasize his hope for a new opening toward North Korea. But he said, We will not tolerate any possible attempt of North Korea to proliferate nuclear weapon, missile and other weapon of mass destruction. The Clinton administration plan to resume negotiating with North Korea over inspecting the site in December. In addition to strategy for easing the Asian financial crisis, Clinton discussed North Korea during a visit to Tokyo on Thursday and Friday. The subject of North Korea consumed most of his two hour of meeting with Kim here Saturday at the Blue House, which contains the Korean president's office and home. The administration ha been criticized in Congress and in this region for letting it policy on North Korea drift, but Clinton called that policy a clear-eyed mix of diplomacy and deterrence. He said that so far the 1994 agreement had worked, because without it North Korea already would have produced a sizable amount of weapons-grade plutonium. Under pressure from congressional critic, Clinton last week appointed William Perry, his former defense secretary, to review his policy on North Korea. On other matter, Clinton declined to criticize the government of Indonesia for using force to crack down on protester there, saying that he did not have enough fact at this moment to give you the right answer. But he said he hoped there would be no backsliding in Indonesia. Clinton followed his appearance with Kim with a visit to the National Folk Museum here, where he conducted an hourlong conversation with six Korean academic, businessmen and union leader about the troubled state of Korea's economy and it impact on the society. He attended a state dinner Saturday night, before stopping by a concert where his brother, Roger, a musician, happened to be performing. Clinton repeatedly congratulated Kim for his effort at economic reform, noting that interest rate had fallen here and the currency had stabilized. But he also pressed Kim during their private meeting to restructure the five huge conglomerate, or chaebols, that account for some 40 percent of the Korean economy. In describing the leaders' conversation, Berger called restructuring the chaebols perhaps the most serious remaining problem in the South Korean economy. Clinton said during the economic forum Saturday afternoon that he felt impatient about South Korea's failure to act on the chaebols. It may be necessary to proceed slowly with the restructuring, he said, but they should begin. On Sunday, Clinton plan to visit some of the 37,000 American troop stationed here. In a green aviator jacket and black cap, President Clinton spent Sunday visiting American troop stationed in South Korea. He promoted a private, sang birthday greeting to a sergeant major and described the threat to his hope for peaceful engagement with North Korea. Lately, sign of danger have intensified, Clinton said in an address to airman here, standing before a gunmetal gray F-16 and A-10 parked nose-to-nose. So we must remain vigilant. And thanks to you, we are. For all his eagerness to talk about information-age economic danger like quicksilver currency flow, Clinton ha returned again and again during his five-day trip to Japan and South Korea to the old-style regional military threat posed by North Korea. The subject consumed most of his meeting with President Kim Dae-jung of South Korea on Saturday and formed the backdrop for his visit with the troop Sunday. It's kind of tense around here, said John Kelley, a 26-year-old airman from Wisconsin, describing life on this base. You know you're only four minute away from a missile. In his speech, Clinton pointed to recent North Korean missile test, incursion into the south and a mysterious underground site that may be a nuclear weapon installation a sign of the potential threat. And he compared North Korea to Iraq, saying that North Korea wa also a major concern because of it chemical and biological weapon. Until North Korea fully commits itself to a constructive role on this peninsula, he said, we must remain ready. Clinton restated his support for Kim's policy of engagement with North Korea, though, saying that there were some hopeful sign to justify it. He pointed to talk that began over the summer between the American military command in Korea and the North Korean military to prevent problem along the demilitarized zone between the south and north. Clinton planned to leave South Korea early Monday and return to Washington Monday night, after paying a visit to Guam. On a bright but icy afternoon, Clinton wa warmly received here by soldier in camouflage and black boot, some of whom waited almost three hour, shifting from foot to foot and rubbing their hand. The official crowd estimate wa only 3500, but the turnout seemed even smaller. The base, about 30 mile south of Seoul, is one of two major American airfield in Korea, housing 7,500 airman. Others who wanted to see the president were bused in from site that are hour away. Before flying here by helicopter, Clinton attended church on an Army base in Seoul, then visited a firing range just 12 mile from the demilitarized zone. In a brief ceremony there, he promoted Matt Prickett of West Liberty, Ohio, from private first class to specialist. And he led the troop in a round of Happy Birthday for Sgt. Maj. Charles Thomas of Wilson, N.C., who turned 45 on Sunday. It definitely caught me off guard, Thomas said. SEOUL, South Korea (AP) US. President Bill Clinton won South Korea's support Saturday for confronting North Korea over a suspected nuclear site, and he warned the North's communist leader not to squander a chance to achieve lasting peace on the peninsula.

US. spy satellite photo show thousand of worker digging a massive complex. US. special envoy Charles Kartman on Friday retracted an assessment he made Thursday that there wa compelling evidence that North Korea is building an underground nuclear facility. In a statement distributed by the US. embassy here today, Kartman said instead, There is strong information that make u suspicious, but we lack conclusive evidence that the intended purpose of the underground site is nuclear related and, if so, what type of nuclear facility it might be. Kim said his government would support US. effort to resolve the nuclear question. The North Koreans have denied the underground construction site ha any nuclear purpose, and have proposed a dlrs 300 million payment for allowing inspection. Clinton rejected the idea of compensation. Directing his remark at North Korea, Clinton noted the significance of a new tourism deal that is bringing South Koreans to the North on cruise ship an arrangement touted by Kim a a sign the North may be opening up to it 1950s Korean War enemy. Nothing could ever be put into that hole in the ground, given our defense partnership here, that would give the North Koreans a much advantage, a much power, a much wealth, a much happiness, a more of those ship going up there full of people from here, Clinton said. In his meeting with Korean community and business leader at Seoul's National Folklore Museum, Clinton praised South Korea's progress in recovering from it financial crisis. On a darker note, he mentioned recent tension over Asian steel export to the United States, which have skyrocketed this year at great cost to the domestic US. steelmaker. Japanese steel is the biggest problem, but South Korean steel export also are on the rise. Clinton said the US. economy could tolerate increased import if they are not concentrated in just a few industry, and if the result is that the Asian economy begin to recover. We have to be sensitive if the price of doing that is to basically erase an entire sector of the US. economy, Clinton said. North Korea ha agreed to receive a US. delegation next month to discus American concern about the construction of a vast underground complex that is widely feared to house a nuclear weapon program, the State Department said on Wednesday. The delegation, led by Charles Kartman, will press for access to the site, which American intelligence agency believe could be the centerpiece of an effort to revive a frozen nuclear arm program. We've made clear to the North Koreans that any attempt by North Korea to pursue a nuclear weapon development program would be unacceptable, the State Department spokesman, James Rubin, said. The talk in Pyongyang, the capital, he added, are aimed at completely satisfying US. concern about the suspect construction. American intelligence agency fear that building the complex could be an effort to break out of a four-year-old pact in which North Korea pledged to give up it nuclear-weapons program in exchange for billion of dollar in aid from the United States, South Korea and Japan. American official have said spy satellite have recently photographed thousand of North Koreans around the huge site 25 mile northeast of Yongbyon, the nuclear center where North Korea wa believed to have stockpiled enough plutonium before the 1994 accord to build six or more bomb. Although they have not explained exactly why the government is building the complex, North Korean official have denied that it would be used to develop nuclear weapon. The official North Korean press agency said last week that the government wa building civilian underground structure on which any `doubt' cannot be cast and suggested that American official would be allowed to inspect the complex if they pressed for access. If the US. side persists in inspecting our underground structure, the press agency said, we can show it to them. Rubin said the United States had received no formal assurance that Kartman, the American special envoy for Korean nuclear issue, and his delegation would be allowed to inspect the site on the trip, which is to begin on Nov. 16. We are beginning a discussion with them in which we will demand access, Rubin said. The history of the U.S.-North Korea discussion involves usually a lengthy discussion process before there is agreement to our requirement. So we are not expecting to walk in one day and be able to have access the next. The trip wa announced a sign grow about a relative warming of relation between the United States and North Korea. Representatives of the United States, China and the two Koreas met recently in Geneva and agreed to step to reduce tension on the Korean Peninsula. In September the United States pledged to provide an additional 300,000 ton of grain to North Korea, which ha for year been crippled by severe food shortage. In addition the White House disclosed that the United States would provide more heavy fuel oil promised to North Korea under the 1994 agreement, despite concern that North Korea may intend to revive it nuclear program. American official have said the activity near Yongbyon may not yet have technically violated the accord, because there is no evidence that North Korea ha begun pouring cement for a new reactor or a reprocessing plant to convert nuclear waste to bomb-grade plutonium. This city ha always kept an unwritten list of foreign leader dictator, unfriendly authoritarian and consistently annoying ally who it think can make an enormous contribution to peace, security or America's agenda by taking early retirement, at a minimum. In the 1950s, the leftist leader of Iran and Guatamala made the Top 10, in the '60s it wa populated by Diem and Sukarno and other Southeast Asians. President Richard M. Nixon and his adviser infamously agreed at a secret meeting in the '70s that the best way to deal with the government of Salvador Allende Gossens in Chile wa to make the economy scream. Diplomatic etiquette, though, ha usually discouraged shouting America's enemy list from the White House rooftop. After all, foreign policy isn't about personality, right? But last week, driven by frustration, or anxiety, or perhaps the lure of sounding tough for camera, the Clinton administration piped up, twice. In very different situation, in opposite corner of the world, the United States spoke loudly because it can't find a stick. Sunday, hour after he called off an attack on Iraq, Clinton finally volunteered the obvious, that the focus of US. policy toward Iraq is the removal of President Saddam Hussein what Clinton called supporting the force of change in Iraq. No matter that covert effort to do just that have failed miserably. The bigger surprise came Monday, when polite-to-a-fault Al Gore used his visit to Malaysia for an Asian economic summit meeting to throw US. support behind protester calling for reformasi, the code word on the street of Kuala Lumpur for dumping Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamed. He ha long been a burr in Washington's side, denouncing America, it currency trader and it Jews. He recently imprisoned his Western-thinking finance minister, Anwar Ibrahim, who ha suddenly become Asia's most visible jailed dissident. But Mahathir is no Saddam, not by a long shot. Gore's aide insist that his speech wa a call for reform, not a demand that Mahathir step down. But it wasn't interpreted that way. The New Zealanders called it megaphone diplomacy. The Malaysian government called it disgusting and an interference in internal affair. Predictably, executive of several US. company that have flocked to Kuala Lumpur told the Malaysians that Gore wa rude, while assuring Washington that he had uttered word that needed to be said. Whatever the wisdom of the Gore's word, they raised the question of what it take these day for the world's most powerful nation to begin publicly suggesting that it's time for a nettlesome leader to go. Because there is no official list, there are no real criterion for getting on it. Some leader mysteriously escape mention, like Kim Jong Il of North Korea. President Clinton is spending the weekend on the Korean Peninsula, staring across the demilitarized zone at a dangerous state that everyone suspect is attempting to break out of it 1994 agreement to freeze it nuclear weapon project, in return for billion in Western energy aid. Yet Washington ha never called on the starving North Koreans to revolt against Kim's repressive regime. His government, taking a page out of the Saddam playbook, suggested last week that if the United States really want to look at a mountain tunnel that the Pentagon belief is a nuclear installation in the making, it should write a check for another $300 million. No one even called for Kim's removal when, a few month ago, he lobbed a three-stage missile over Japan just to show he knew how. The rule for calling for the end of a regime are pretty murky, said Richard Feinberg, a professor at the University of California at San Diego who served in the Clinton administration's first term. When they really want to push someone out, it is because that country is part of a larger strategic concern at the time. But the country itself usually doesn't have great strategic weight it's another matter to call for a change of leadership in Beijing or Moscow and it help if there is some kind of domestic opposition that we can point to. Clinton's call for Saddam's ouster last weekend created barely a ripple because, after all, he is a proven murderer and an avid stockpiler of anthrax and plutonium (even if Brent Scowcroft, who wa President George Bush's national security adviser, insisted last week that Saddam nowadays is simply an irritant, an annoyance, a pest and a problem, but not a threat to the region at the moment). Mahathir, however, is far more complex case. He's a prime example of how opposing Washington's political and economic agenda for an interconnected world can move a leader from the list of authoritarian whom Washington tolerates to the list of authoritarian who have outlived their usefulness. Like other Asian strongman Ferdinand Marcos of the Philippines and Suharto of Indonesia come to mind he wa useful when the fear wa that Malaysia would become a communist domino. But he also seemed eminently tolerable long after the Cold War wa over. He ha never been accused of enormous corruption. He turned his country into a model of competitiveness, and Malaysia became the exemplar of the big emerging market that Clinton's Commerce Department touted until thing went sour last year. Sure, he wa always prickly. But he is no terrorist or killer US. company have flocked to his country, and say they want to stay and his iron control over political discourse is no stronger than in neighboring Singapore. Just this summer, US. Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin paid him an ostensibly friendly, if strained, visit and made no reference to human right. That all changed when Ibrahim wa arrested and beaten in jail. He ha long been an advocate of the Western-style solution to economic turmoil more openness, more freedom and the protest movement against Mahathir only surfaced once he wa in jail. Gore leapt on that opportunity particularly striking because, in the case of Indonesia earlier this year, it took the administration month to come to the conclusion that President Suharto had to go. He went.

50,"It wa a surprising scene three month ago when Dennis Rivera, one of New York City's most left-leaning labor leader, wa singing the praise of Sen. Alfonse M. D'Amato. Rivera, president of the largest union in New York City, praised D'Amato for persuading Trent Lott, the Senate majority leader, to support legislation that financed health coverage for hundred of thousand of uninsured child. It looked a if Rivera's politically potent union might endorse D'Amato or at the very minimum stay neutral in this year's US. Senate race in New York. But on Monday, Rivera's 150,000-member union, 1199, the National Health and Human Service Employees union, endorsed Rep. Charles E. Schumer, D-N.Y., and thereby risked D'Amato's wrath. The endorsement is risky, labor leader acknowledge, because angering this powerful senator could make him far le responsive to labor's need when union turn to him for help in the future if he is re-elected. Although it may seem illogical, two word go far to explain why Rivera's union backed Schumer: Monica Lewinsky. Largely a a result of the Lewinsky scandal, Democrats say they suddenly fear that the Republicans will gain a filibuster-proof, 60-seat majority in the Senate, where the Republicans have 55 seat to the Democrats' 45. For labor leader like Rivera, the notion of a strong Republican majority is a nightmare. That fear ha helped push other New York union into Schumer's column, even though D'Amato had long courted them. Those union include the teamsters' joint council in New York City and District Council 37, an umbrella group representing 120,000 municipal employee. Labor leader say they fear that with a filibuster-proof Republican majority, the Senate would push through anti-union legislation, like recently defeated Republican proposal to curb labor's political spending and cut financing for the National Labor Relations Board. We are worried about legislation that will not allow the labor movement to survive into the next century, Rivera said. Alarmed that the Democrats will lose Senate seat in California, Illinois, Wisconsin, Nevada and South Carolina, Rivera's union concluded that it wa worth backing Schumer. The decision, Rivera emphasized repeatedly, wa not personal but wa based on national consideration. Unfortunately, the leadership of the Republican Party at the national level in the person of Newt Gingrich and Trent Lott are not necessarily from the same culture a the Republicans of the Northeast, he said. They're far more conservative, far more anti-labor, far more anti-worker, far more pro-business. We fear that the Democratic Party face irrelevance in the United States Senate if we go below 41 seat. Trying to avoid a rupture with D'Amato, Rivera praised him a an effective senator. The endorsement could be a boon for Schumer. Rivera's union and the teachers' union have labor's strongest political operation in New York. In addition, Schumer will get thousand of dollar from the local a well a use of it renowned phone bank, which can make 50,000 political call a day. A spokesman for D'Amato said, Al D'Amato's proud that he's been endorsed by over 100 union federation and local, representing more that 400,000 working men and woman, and he'll continue his effort on behalf of working middle class family. His labor endorsement include the New York City Patrolmen's Benevolent Association and the New York State Building and Construction Trades Council. Besides the backing of 1199, Schumer also received the endorsement of 1199's parent union, the Service Employees International Union, which ha 350,000 member in New York State. Rivera who did not support D'Amato the last time he ran either announced the endorsement during the founding convention of the New York State Council of the service employee union. The convention packed Town Hall, and the new group aim to make the service employee a power to be reckoned with by bringing together a dozen union local to forge a common political and legislative strategy. Earlier this year, 1199 merged with the service employee, and a part of that agreement, Rivera became head of the service employee in New York State. Nearly 60 year behind the time, the House voted Friday to condemn the Nazi-Soviet nonaggression pact of 1939. The measure, a nonbinding resolution, wa brought to the floor by Rep. John Shimkus, R-Ill. He is of Lithuanian descent, ha a pocket of Lithuanians in his hometown of Collinsville and want to try to highlight his support for the Baltic states' past effort against Soviet repression. Shimkus' measure is an example of how member of Congress are spending their time a they stand idle and wait for Republican leader to reach agreement on spending bill with the White House, thus avoiding a government shutdown and allowing them to go home and campaign for the November election. With time on their hand, many Republicans are using the House floor a their personal stage to elicit vote on topic that they can boast about to the folk back home. Most of these matter have little chance of finding their way into law, but member hope to turn them to their advantage on Election Day. There are plenty of other item whose sponsor hope will not attract attention. These tend to be special-interest matter that member hope will escape scrutiny in the rush to leave town. The sponsor of these measure now have the added advantage of the impeachment inquiry, which ha been preoccupying Congress, the news medium and the public and giving them cover to move their pet cause quietly into the gigantic omnibus package that Congress will eventually present to Clinton for signing. These quieter measure include one proposed by Mississippi's two senator, Trent Lott and Thad Cochran, both Republicans. They want agriculture export credit to buy chicken for Russia, which ha bought the chicken but cannot pay for them. The chicken are from Mississippi. Democrats have little influence in the Republican-controlled Congress. But some Democrats are close enough to Republican leader, and to Republican goal, that their measure are taken seriously. These include Rep. John Murtha, D-Pa., the ranking Democrat on the national security subcommittee of the Appropriations Committee, who is pushing a measure to increase military pension. Perhaps the best example of an attempt to force a vote for political advantage is a measure that would require minor to notify their parent if they are seeking contraceptive from federally funded family planning clinic. House leader allowed the measure to be brought to the floor a a way to appease the more conservative member, who believe they have been shortchanged by the budget process. It passed the House by a vote of 224-200 but ha almost no chance of becoming law. The Senate doe not plan to take it up, and Clinton would almost certainly veto it. But Rep. Tom Coburn, R-Okla., said that vote like these were important because they put their sponsors' ideological foe on the record a opposing something that sound reasonable, and that opposition can be used against them in the Nov. 3 election. It wa not a voice mail message that Dr. Marilyn Rymer, a neurologist in Kansas City, Mo., would routinely delete, even a a registered Democrat. Speaker Newt Gingrich's office, it said, wa calling to discus a national leadership award. Dr. Rymer ha won acclaim a the director of a prominent stroke-treatment center, but this proposition seemed particularly grand. When she returned the call, she said she wa told she would also be named honorary chairman of an elite committee to advise Gingrich on legislation. Too good to be true? Well, Dr. Rymer would have to pay her own way if the committee should actually meet, and a an honorary committee chairman, she discovered, she would be a member of a committee composed entirely of honorary chairman. And oh, the speaker wanted a donation of $500 to $1,000 to help our effort, according to a transcript of a similar chat with another doctor, to elect a bigger Republican majority in the House of Representatives. With the approach of the midterm election next month, it turn out that the National Republican Congressional Committee, which support candidate for the House, ha been sponsoring similar call to ten of thousand of small-business owner, including doctor. With this and other fund-raising program, the committee say it ha amassed $62 million for the election. But campaign finance watchdog say the solicitation mark a new departure in political fund raising, one they call akin to the practice of marketing company like the Publishers' Clearing House that hook consumer with vision of million-dollar windfall to induce them to subscribe to magazine. By citing the speaker and promising celebrity and influence, they say, the call are a bait-and-switch scheme to seize the attention of people who might otherwise hang up. Dr. Rymer say she wa incensed. So wa Dr. Stanley Turecki, a child and family psychiatrist in New York who vote a an independent and wa also called. I wa absolutely outraged, he said. Anybody else who would do that would fall into the category of consumer fraud. Kenneth Gross, a Washington lawyer who specializes in election law and represents both Democratic and Republican client, said, I have never heard of that particular device. But it doesn't appear illegal, he said, adding, It's a fund-raising gimmick to get attention. Fred Wertheimer, president of Democracy 21, a nonprofit, nonpartisan advocate of campaign finance reform, said, This is a new version of caveat emptor buyer be damned instead of buyer beware. When business do it, he added, Congress order investigation. But this isn't going to be investigated because it's member of Congress who are doing it. Todd Harris, a spokesman for the National Republican Congressional Committee, said that he had not heard of any complaint and that there wa no intent to deceive. The national leadership award is a part of what we call donor and member fulfillment, Harris said. It's part of bringing them into the process. It's important that they be recognized for the support they give the party. There's no quid pro quo that people solicited could receive award for past contribution, he added. What most peeve Drs. Rymer and Turecki is the message left with secretary and answering machine invoking Gingrich's office and proposing the award. They say they envisioned a senior aide at a telephone in the speaker's chamber under the Capitol Dome. The call, however, are not placed by aide to Gingrich, by any of his office or by anyone in Washington. They are made by people with headset and computer at the home of InfoCision Management Corp., a telemarketing firm and Congressional committee client in Akron, Ohio. On it Web page, InfoCision say it 1,400 employee operate 1,584 telephone line and 9 phone center. Every word in the script is approved by our client, the company say on it Web site. Every conceivable objection is scripted with a powerful rebuttal. Besides telemarketing for business, said Jamie Blair, a supervisor at the center, we specialize in helping the Republican Party and conservative political group. However far they are from Gingrich, the telemarketers are instructed to answer return call with: Republican Congressional Committee, Newt Gingrich's office. May I help you? A doctor in Kansas City, Mo., who is a registered Republican and who declined to be named, dialed the Gingrich number (888-484-1644) left on answering machine and secretly recorded the ensuing discussion, which is legal in Missouri. We were asked to contact you on behalf of the speaker, say a woman who picked up the call and identified herself a Nancy. He is right now aggressively pushing legislation to cut tax by a much a half, and he's also interested in legislation to cut capital gain to a single rate of 15 percent. To assure passage of the legislation, the speaker want to increase his Republican majority, she say, adding, To help u do that, the speaker is pulling together a group of individual such a yourself and is inviting you to be an honorary chairman on his advisory council. Nancy continues: There will be correspondence with the speaker, such a conference call. It's a great way that he can get your input and thought on legislation that doe concern you. Or maybe survey or questionnaire. Later, Nancy says: As a member of his committee, you would be receiving from the speaker our national leadership award, which is really quite an honor. And to be honest, he will be asking each of our chairman if they could help our effort to increase our majority with a one-time contribution of $500 or $1,000. Now that would be used on the nationwide medium campaign that Newt ha undertaken to target those seat we really need. And a someone who I'm sure would also benefit from this, could I tell the speaker he could count on your help? The doctor demur. I am a registered, you know, Republican in Kansas, she tell Nancy. Probably if I were to do something it would be to go through my own representative. Then the doctor try to ascertain where Nancy is located. Is this congressman Gingrich's office that I'm talking to? the doctor asks. The speaker's office, say Nancy. This is the speaker's office. That I'm talking to, say the doctor, double-checking. Uh-huh, Nancy reply. The law prohibits political fund-raising call from federal office. Vice President Al Gore is under a Justice Department investigation for fund-raising call he allegedly made from his office in the 1996 presidential campaign. But the call can be made from just about anywhere else, including campaign office. Harris said the call are in no way related to the speaker's OFFICIAL office. He added: What is more important is not where the call get routed. People are more interested in an award with the speaker's good name on it than whether the call get routed to Washington or Ohio. Turecki disagrees. I see it a basic sleaze, he said. The last time George Voinovich ran for office, he won re-election a Ohio's governor with 72 percent of the vote, stunning even his most optimistic supporter and setting a 20th-century record for victory margin in Ohio politics. This year, Voinovich, a Republican who is barred from seeking a third term, is running again, this time for the Senate seat held by John Glenn, a Democrat who is retiring. And while there are few who expect Voinovich to repeat his electoral benchmark of four year ago, politician of both party generally acknowledge that he is well positioned to increase the Republican majority in the Senate. That ha not prevented Voinovich's Democratic opponent, Mary Boyle, from undertaking a vigorous campaign. Ms. Boyle, a former commissioner in Cuyahoga County, which encompasses Cleveland, is crisscrossing the nation's seventh-most populous state in what she describes a a grass-roots campaign that, while operating on a comparative shoestring, ha nonetheless attracted to her side nationally known Democrats President Clinton foremost among them on the campaign trail. Glenn, the former astronaut who is preparing to return to space this month at the age of 77, ha not made an endorsement in the Senate race. Like many candidate this year, Ms. Boyle, 55, is campaigning hard on the issue of education, seeking to portray Voinovich, 61, a a lackluster steward who allowed the state's school to decline. He promised to be the education governor, said Ms. Boyle. But after seven and a half year he ha failed the student of this state. Her role in the campaign, she said, is to remind the people of the state of Ohio that George Voinovich made a promise and that he didn't deliver on it. Specifically, she discus a decision last year by the Ohio Supreme Court that cited wide disparity in the quality of the state's school and ruled unconstitutional the formula for funding them. She ha also attacked her Republican opponent for supporting a proposal to raise the state's sale tax by one percent. Under that plan, half the additional fund would have been used for school improvement with the remainder earmarked for reducing property tax. That statewide ballot initiative last May proved to be wildly unpopular, with about 80 percent of the voter opposing it. While the topic of tax and education are hot one this political season in Ohio, it is not clear that Ms. Boyle's emphasis on them ha helped her campaign. Despite some narrowing in the opinion poll, she is still trailing Voinovich by 15 percentage point in some poll and a much a 20 point in others. There is also a sharp fund-raising disparity. Ms. Boyle, who is running her first statewide race and ha widespread union support, ha raised nearly $2 million so far, far le than the nearly $7 million Voinovich ha taken in. Also, Voinovich, a former lieutenant governor, ha been on statewide ballot five time over the last 20 year and thus is the better-known candidate. The electoral dynamic of Ohio are also aiding Voinovich. The northern half of the state, with it history of industrial, unionized city, ha a tradition of voting largely for Democratic candidate, while the southern tier of the state is considered more conservative and typically lean Republican. But Voinovich and Ms. Boyle share the same home terrain, depriving Ms. Boyle of the geographic advantage that often accompanies Democratic candidate. Indeed, a a boy, Voinovich once delivered newspaper to the Boyle home in the working-class Collinwood section of Cleveland. And Voinovich, a former mayor of Cleveland, ha developed a reputation a a moderate Republican who work well with Democrats. Voinovich, while campaigning vigorously himself, is keeping a full schedule of official duty, assuming the role of the experienced, elected official. If I get into the Senate, I will probably know more about domestic policy than any member of the Senate, he said in an interview on Wednesday in Canton, sandwiched between a ribbon-cutting ceremony and a fund-raising reception at a vacuum cleaner museum. As mayor, I had my nose rubbed into the problem of urban America and wa fairly successful in dealing with them. And, a governor, I have dealt with the problem of Medicaid, welfare and education. I'm the only person in the United States who ha been president of the National League of Cities and chairman of the National Governors Association. To his opponent's charge on his record on education, Voinovich is dismissive. I'm probably the only Republican in the United States who ha been endorsed by the Ohio Education Association and National Education Association, he said, adding that Ms. Boyle wa a member of the state Legislature during the period cited in the Supreme Court ruling. Mary Boyle wa vice chairman of the Ways and Means Committee and a member of the Democratic leadership during those year, Voinovich said. They did nothing to fix the building, they did nothing for technology and the urban school district. Ms. Boyle, who ha not yet begun to run campaign commercial on television, said her status a the underdog had allowed me to be more focused, more intense. Pausing after a campaign fund-raising breakfast with former Democratic Sen. Bill Bradley of New Jersey here on Wednesday, Ms. Boyle said: This ha been a marathon and it's been pretty much uphill. But now, we're down to the last three mile. It's a tough race. In a cocoon of loyal and wealthy supporter, President Clinton said Friday that he must live with the consequence of his mistake, although he contended that Democrats should take pride in the achievement of his presidency and take heart from it possibility. Clinton ha stopped apologizing for his conduct with Monica Lewinsky, but he ha taken to making glancing, at time humble, reference to it, before moving on to attack the Republican Congress a indifferent to Americans' need. He did so Friday at a series of fund-raisers. In one deft sentence, he acknowledged his personal pain while claiming credit for the country's economic strength, making a compact appeal for both sympathy and support in an appearance earlier in the day in Cleveland. After thanking the gathered donor for the very kind personal thing they had said to him, the president declared, If I had to do it all over again, every day, I would do it in a heartbeat, to see America where it is today a compared to six year ago. As the applause died away, Clinton continued, I want you to understand, too, that we all have to live with the consequence of our mistake in life. He added with a chuckle: Most of u don't have to live with it in quite such a public way. But nobody get out of life for free. To the music of a saxophone and a hammered dulcimer, Clinton raised about $200,000 over lunch in a private home in Cleveland for the Democratic Senate candidate in Ohio, Mary Boyle. Then he flew to Philadelphia to raise half a million dollar for the Democratic Party. By midsummer, the president's aide were delighted to have persuaded him to condense his fund-raising remark to just 10 minute of policy point and partisan jabbing. But a his trouble have grown and the mid-term election have approached, his free-form remark have become longer. In Cleveland on Friday, he spoke for 26 minute and here on Friday evening he spoke for almost 20 minute. These fund-raising visit have fallen into a pattern since Clinton's videotaped grand jury testimony on Aug. 17. He is lauded, applauded and embraced by his host and the donor. Mr. President, these are your friend here today, said Tony George, the host of the Cleveland event, offering the refrain of those who have played a similar role. But in Cleveland a elsewhere, protester who were scattered along the president's motorcade route were reminder of call for his resignation and impeachment, and of the mockery some are heaping upon his presidency. At a rally for the president outside city hall here Friday night a group of Teamsters chanted, two more year. Clinton's motorcade route wa lined downtown with hundred of people, some of them carrying supportive or condemnatory sign. After an impromptu shopping trip, during which he wa greeted with shout of We love you, Clinton told some donor at the beginning of an impassioned reprise of his Cleveland speech: I didn't even mind the protester, that's the American way. But, he added, he preferred it when they were in the minority, and that seemed to be the case. As he rode into Cleveland, Clinton passed a billboard for a local radio station, WNCX. Lovin', touchin', squeezin', it read, the word superimposed on a cartoon of the president with his arm over Ms. Lewinsky's shoulder, the Washington Monument beside them. The president left it to his aide on Friday to respond directly to the latest gusher of grand jury disclosure in Washington. Instead, in his remark, Clinton spoke with pride of his record and with urgency about addressing the international economic crisis and the need of struggling farmer and schoolchildren. As he typically doe now before such partisan audience, he also walked through his political calculation for the mid-term election. Clinton said in Cleveland that Republicans had bragged privately to him about their prospect. They tell me, `Oh, we're going to do very well, Mr. President, in these mid-terms because we have so much more money than you do,' and because Democrats who turned out to re-elect Clinton would not return to the poll in an off-year. That argument, of course, would also insulate Clinton from any blame for depressing the Democratic vote. But he often go further than that, saying that his predicament could actually help the Democrats. Lower-income Democratic voter, he said, might not bother to vote in a typical election. The people that were good enough to serve you here at this event today, they've got a lot of hassle in their life, he said. But, he said, adversity is our friend, because it can overcome apathy and focus u on what is at issue here. What should be at issue, Clinton said, are his achievement and agenda and the Republicans' record, which he described harshly. What have they done? he asked in Cleveland. They killed the minimum wage increase for 12 million Americans. They killed campaign finance reform. They killed the tobacco reform legislation. White House official and gay Democrats, concerned that the nation's largest gay and lesbian political organization is about to endorse Sen. Alfonse D'Amato for re-election, are intensely lobbying the group to try to shift it support to the Democratic challenger, Rep. Charles Schumer. Publicly, official in the organization, the Human Rights Campaign, said they were still deliberating their position in the closely watched race, considered among the tightest in the nation. They said they would probably make an endorsement by Friday. But privately, organization official and gay activist from both party who have been monitoring the debate say the group is most likely to endorse D'Amato, a Republican seeking his fourth term. They also raised the possibility that the group would endorse both candidate, or remain neutral. If the group endorses D'Amato, said official who spoke on the condition of anonymity, the endorsement would be based on three major factors: The group tends to favor incumbent, ha been searching for ally among the Senate Republican majority and considers D'Amato's recent record on gay issue to be quite strong. An endorsement by the group, which is held in high regard by many gay and lesbian voter, could prove important in swinging voter to D'Amato in a tight race. It would also be a major symbolic victory for the senator, who ha sought to recast himself a a centrist in recent year and could use the endorsement to build his standing among moderate swing voter. A D'Amato endorsement would also weaken Schumer's effort to portray the incumbent a a right-wing extremist and would signify to many voter a fraying of the traditional Democratic coalition that ha included black and gay voter, woman and labor union. The intensity of the debate surrounding the endorsement underscore the importance of the New York Senate race to Democrats across the nation, who see defeating D'Amato a one of their best opportunity to prevent the Republicans from gaining 60 seat in the Senate enough to stop a Democratic filibuster. The Republicans currently hold a 55-to-45 majority. There is sentiment in the community that if the Republicans get 60 vote, that Trent Lott will basically be in charge politically for the next two year, said David Mixner, a close friend of President Clinton's who is gay. He wa referring to the Senate majority leader, who ha called homosexuality a sin and likened it to kleptomania. Saturday, Schumer picked up his own endorsement from New York's largest gay and lesbian political organization, the Empire State Pride Agenda. Although the Human Rights Campaign is bipartisan, it ha been very close to the Clinton administration, ha many Democrats on it board and receives much of it money from Democratic contributor. Largely because of the group's strong Democratic tie, gay Democrats, New York liberal and White House official are infuriated that it is even considering endorsing D'Amato, who also run on the Right to Life and Conservative Party line and often receives high rating from the Christian Coalition, which typically opposes legislation on civil right for gay people. Although the organization ha been thought to be inching toward a D'Amato endorsement for month, the lobbying campaign for Schumer ha picked up intensity in the last two week, driven partly by a growing sense that the race is now closer than ever. Democrats and advocate in both party who support right for gay people said that Vice President Al Gore, Hillary Rodham Clinton and Secretary for Health and Human Services Donna Shalala have made personal appeal to Human Rights Campaign official urging them not to endorse D'Amato. White House official said they did not know whether the three had made such appeal, and Human Rights Campaign official declined to comment. Schumer met privately with the group's top official last week to make one last pitch for the endorsement. Clinton administration official have also been buttonholing the group's board member at every opportunity, from cocktail party to fund-raisers, raising concern about a D'Amato endorsement. Some New York advocate of civil right for gay people have flooded the organization with phone call, e-mail message and letter. Democratic official have been encouraging the group's major donor to express their opposition to D'Amato. People involved in the lobbying effort said that at best, they are hoping the group will endorse both candidate, or make no endorsement at all. Chuck Schumer ha been a strong supporter of issue that are important to gay community, said a senior White House official who spoke on the condition of anonymity. The last thing that they should want to do is hurt the candidacy of someone who ha been so supportive of their agenda. The Human Rights Campaign is considered the most influential gay and lesbian organization in Washington, with a national membership of 250,000 and an annual budget of more than $13 million. The group wa created in the early 1980s in large part to counter the rise of the Christian right and Ronald Reagan. Paradoxically, D'Amato wa first elected in the Reagan landslide of 1980 and remained a strong supporter of President Reagan. For D'Amato, who ha aggressively courted gay voter, the endorsement would represent a crowning achievement in his effort to reposition himself a a moderate. Since 1993, the senator ha backed the right of gay citizen to serve in the military, sponsored legislation to prevent job discrimination against gay worker and opposed his own leadership's attempt to block the nomination of two openly gay men to position in the Clinton administration. To gay supporter of D'Amato, an endorsement by the Human Rights Campaign would signify the political maturation of the gay electorate and help the organization insulate itself from accusation that it is too close to the Democratic Party. Those who support a D'Amato endorsement, including top official within the Human Rights Campaign, contend that in the current political climate, where Congress is almost certain to remain under Republican control after November, gay people must build alliance with moderate Republicans. Human Rights Campaign official also say their standing policy is to support friendly incumbent, even when their challenger have better voting record on gay issue. That is the case in New York, where Schumer's rating by the Human Rights Campaign ha been consistently better than D'Amato's. Both men, however, have angered advocate of right for gay people by voting for legislation that allows state to not recognize gay marriage. In a precedent widely cited by D'Amato supporter, the organization endorsed Sen. John F. Kerry, a Democrat, over the Republican challenger, William Weld, in the 1996 Massachusetts Senate race, even though Weld's record on gay right wa considered stronger. The move angered gay Republicans, who now contend that snubbing D'Amato would prove that the group is biased toward Democrats. But there is clearly a large number of Human Rights Campaign contributor and board member who strongly feel that endorsing D'Amato will permanently damage the group, particularly among woman. They fear that abortion right supporter will quit the group in drove because D'Amato ha never wavered in his opposition to abortion during 18 year in Congress. Many New York gay activist would also be deeply upset if the group endorses D'Amato, whom they blame for installing the state Senate majority leader, Joseph Bruno, whom they consider to be strongly anti-gay. Matt Foreman, executive director of the Empire State Pride Agenda, cited D'Amato's role a the architect of the state Republican Party a a major reason the group endorsed Schumer. While he ha criticized fellow Republicans in Washington for their intolerance, here at home, his own party's blatant discrimination is still the order of the day, Foreman said. For that reason, some White House official say they think a Human Rights Campaign endorsement of D'Amato will be almost meaningless among gay voter. They contend that it might even hurt the senator among his conservative base. I don't think anybody will vote for Al D'Amato because of an HRC endorsement, said a White House aide who spoke on the condition of anonymity. But I think some people in the Right to Life Party and some upstate people are going to say, `Who is this guy and why should we vote for him?' White House official and gay Democrats, concerned that the nation's largest gay and lesbian political organization is about to endorse Sen. Alfonse D'Amato for re-election, are intensely lobbying the group to try to shift it support to the Democratic challenger, Rep. Charles Schumer. Publicly, official in the organization, the Human Rights Campaign, said they were still deliberating their position in the closely watched race, considered among the tightest in the nation. They said they would probably make an endorsement by Friday. But privately, organization official and gay activist from both party who have been monitoring the debate say the group is most likely to endorse D'Amato, a Republican seeking his fourth term. They also raised the possibility that the group would endorse both candidate, or remain neutral. If the group endorses D'Amato, said official who spoke on the condition of anonymity, the endorsement would be based on three major factors: The group tends to favor incumbent, ha been searching for ally among the Senate Republican majority and considers D'Amato's recent record on gay issue to be quite strong. An endorsement by the group, which is held in high regard by many gay and lesbian voter, could prove important in swinging voter to D'Amato in a tight race. It would also be a major symbolic victory for the senator, who ha sought to recast himself a a centrist in recent year and could use the endorsement to build his standing among moderate swing voter. A D'Amato endorsement would also weaken Schumer's effort to portray the incumbent a a right-wing extremist and would signify to many voter a fraying of the traditional Democratic coalition that ha included black and gay voter, woman and labor union. The intensity of the debate surrounding the endorsement underscore the importance of the New York Senate race to Democrats across the nation, who see defeating D'Amato a one of their best opportunity to prevent the Republicans from gaining 60 seat in the Senate enough to stop a Democratic filibuster. The Republicans currently hold a 55-to-45 majority. There is sentiment in the community that if the Republicans get 60 vote, that Trent Lott will basically be in charge politically for the next two year, said David Mixner, a close friend of President Clinton's who is gay. He wa referring to the Senate majority leader, who ha called homosexuality a sin and likened it to kleptomania. Saturday, Schumer picked up his own endorsement from New York's largest gay and lesbian political organization, the Empire State Pride Agenda. Although the Human Rights Campaign is bipartisan, it ha been very close to the Clinton administration, ha many Democrats on it board and receives much of it money from Democratic contributor. Largely because of the group's strong Democratic tie, gay Democrats, New York liberal and White House official are infuriated that it is even considering endorsing D'Amato, who also run on the Right to Life and Conservative Party line and often receives high rating from the Christian Coalition, which typically opposes legislation on civil right for gay people. Although the organization ha been thought to be inching toward a D'Amato endorsement for month, the lobbying campaign for Schumer ha picked up intensity in the last two week, driven partly by a growing sense that the race is now closer than ever. Democrats and advocate in both party who support right for gay people said that Vice President Al Gore, Hillary Rodham Clinton and Secretary for Health and Human Services Donna Shalala have made personal appeal to Human Rights Campaign official urging them not to endorse D'Amato. White House official said they did not know whether the three had made such appeal, and Human Rights Campaign official declined to comment. Schumer met privately with the group's top official last week to make one last pitch for the endorsement. Clinton administration official have also been buttonholing the group's board member at every opportunity, from cocktail party to fund-raisers, raising concern about a D'Amato endorsement. Some New York advocate of civil right for gay people have flooded the organization with phone call, e-mail message and letter. Democratic official have been encouraging the group's major donor to express their opposition to D'Amato. People involved in the lobbying effort said that at best, they are hoping the group will endorse both candidate, or make no endorsement at all.

I don't think anybody will vote for Al D'Amato because of an HRC endorsement, said a White House aide who spoke on the condition of anonymity. But I think some people in the Right to Life Party and some upstate people are going to say, `Who is this guy and why should we vote for him?' In other election year, Reps. David Price and Julia Carson would have had little in common other than that they were Democrats with relatively safe seat. Price is a centrist who ha represented this high-tech district in North Carolina for all but 2 of the last 12 year, a political scientist who ha taught at Duke and Yale. Mrs. Carson, fairly liberal, is a House freshman who worked her way up in politics from the grass root, having been reared in poverty. But party official who opened this election year with high hope of recapturing the House are beginning to worry that Democratic incumbent like Price and Mrs. Carson share something else: greater-than-expected peril on Election Day. As in many congressional race, the biggest variable is the White House scandal, which ha injected fear and uncertainty into campaign around the country. Other Democratic incumbent who Republican official cite a locked in contest that are more competitive than expected include Reps. Corrine Brown of Florida, Vic Snyder of Arkansas, Lois Capps and Ellen Tauscher of California, Martin Frost of Texas, Melvin Watt of North Carolina, John LaFalce of New York and Sander Levin of Michigan. Here in North Carolina's 4th Congressional District, Price, acknowledging that his own poll showed him in a tight race, said: This is a swing district that is sensitive to any tide or trend. It's something you think about a lot in connection with the president's trouble. The effort of Price and Mrs. Carson to contain the Lewinsky debacle and their opponents' attempt to capitalize on it offer important clue suggesting how Clinton's problem are influencing the conduct of race around the country. Many Democrats are straddling a line that seems to shift a bit with every new scandal-related disclosure: they do not want to appear close to a president whose conduct embarrasses them, and yet, sensing the possibility of a public backlash against Republicans, they are weighing their word carefully and are wary of hopping on any impeachment bandwagon. And while publicly these Democrats express confidence that the scandal will have little impact on them, their campaign are preparing for the worst by placing greater emphasis than ever on behind-the-efforts to prod their core constituency to vote. In a reflection of the uncertainty that the Clinton scandal ha cast even among Republicans, the challenger in the Price and Carson district both are political novice seeking office for the first time have differing strategies: Tom Roberg, a computer executive in Raleigh who is taking on Price, ha broadcast a television commercial exploiting the scandal. Tom Roberg ha called for Bill Clinton's resignation, the narrator say. This is not the time to be silent, Price. Where do you stand? But in Indianapolis, Gary Hofmeister, a conservative jeweler challenging Mrs. Carson in Indiana's 10th Congressional District, is taking a more subtle approach: rather than mention the scandal directly, he note a often a he can that Julia vote with Clinton almost 100 percent of the time. Asked why he wa not much raising the scandal directly, Hofmeister said: Don't murder somebody when they're in the process of committing suicide. There would be a danger if we went overboard. The best evidence of the discomfort of both Price and Mrs. Carson is that when asked in separate interview whether they would want Clinton to campaign in their district, both said it would be impossible at this late date for the White House to schedule a visit. What if there wa a sudden schedule change? Both paused, squirmed a bit and mustered answer that were hardly affirmative. Given the president's popularity, I doubt it will hurt me, Mrs. Carson said. And Price? I don't think that would be such a good idea, he said. I've never had a president campaign here, and I wouldn't want to start this time although he is eagerly welcoming Erskine Bowles, the president's chief of staff and a popular native son in North Carolina, to stump with him here this Sunday.) Making strategy for the stump is further complicated by anecdotal evidence that run counter to Democratic fear and Republican hope. In three day of campaign stop here in North Carolina and in Indianapolis, the scandal wa rarely raised by any voter being courted by the candidate of either party. When a reporter asked about it, many voter said that a appalled a they were at Clinton's behavior, they had a hard time relating it to their decision on which way to vote in the congressional election in five week. As Hofmeister walked through the parking lot outside a gun and knife show at the Indiana National Guard Armory in Indianapolis last Sunday, Billy Derringer, a 57-year-old machinist who is retired on disability, called him over to express outrage about the million of dollar that had been spent to investigate Clinton. It's pathetic to spend all of our money, said Derringer, who identified himself a an independent. It shouldn't have gotten this far. Hofmeister tried his best to make the Republicans' case. There ha to be rule of law, he said. Mrs. Carson said she hoped that Democrats and swing voter alike would become so fed up with the Lewinsky inquiry that the issue might even help her. To that end, she proudly informs audience that she voted against making public the report delivered to the House by Kenneth Starr, the Whitewater independent counsel. I wa one of 63 member of Congress who voted against putting all that filth on the Internet, she said, adding that Starr's inquiry had been a cruel hoax in term of fiscal responsibility and accountability. The Carson campaign is counting on voter like Timothy Daly, a 38-year-old real estate executive who voted for a Republican two year ago but now favor Mrs. Carson. I'm pulling the Democratic ticket because I'm tired of it: the right side of the Republican Party is playing politics, Daly said. We'd like to see them go on with the people's business. Back here in the 4th District, Price ha some reason to be worried. He wa first elected to the House in 1986 but, a a four-term incumbent, wa ousted in the Republican sweep of 1994 (only to win his seat back two year later). In addition, the district wa redrawn last year to include a large Durham section where voter do not know him well. Determined not to be a midterm casualty of Clinton once again, Price say he is waging the most vigorous get-out-the-vote ground campaign of his career. Rather than engage Roberg over the Clinton scandal, Price ha begun broadcasting a television commercial that emphasizes his central issue: education. The congressman's adviser say they intentionally produced an advertisement that appears decidedly nonpolitical it feature school child in a play in an effort to break through the television clutter about the scandal. But the Price campaign also ha a weapon it is holding in reserve, in the event Roberg appears to be riding the Clinton scandal to advantage: the incumbent's adviser say they would not be timid about running commercial underscoring that he earned a divinity degree before getting his doctorate in political science. At a coffee with voter in a wealthy enclave of Raleigh the other night, Roberg opened his remark by asserting that Clinton had lost the moral authority to lead. Yet none of those assembled asked him about the scandal; they were more concerned about the state's plan to build a highway near their neighborhood. The last time George Voinovich ran for office, he won re-election a Ohio's governor with 72 percent of the vote, stunning even his most optimistic supporter and setting a 20th-century record for victory margin in Ohio politics. This year, Voinovich, a Republican who is barred from seeking a third term, is running again, this time for the Senate seat held by John Glenn, a Democrat who is retiring. And while there are few who expect Voinovich to repeat his electoral benchmark of four year ago, politician of both party generally acknowledge that he is well positioned to increase the Republican majority in the Senate. That ha not prevented Voinovich's Democratic opponent, Mary Boyle, from undertaking a vigorous campaign. Ms. Boyle, a former commissioner in Cuyahoga County, which encompasses Cleveland, is crisscrossing the nation's seventh-most populous state in what she describes a a grass-roots campaign that, while operating on a comparative shoestring, ha nonetheless attracted to her side nationally known Democrats President Clinton foremost among them on the campaign trail. Glenn, the former astronaut who is preparing to return to space this month at the age of 77, ha not made an endorsement in the Senate race. Like many candidate this year, Ms. Boyle, 55, is campaigning hard on the issue of education, seeking to portray Voinovich, 61, a a lackluster steward who allowed the state's school to decline. He promised to be the education governor, said Ms. Boyle. But after seven and a half year he ha failed the student of this state. Her role in the campaign, she said, is to remind the people of the state of Ohio that George Voinovich made a promise and that he didn't deliver on it. Specifically, she discus a decision last year by the Ohio Supreme Court that cited wide disparity in the quality of the state's school and ruled unconstitutional the formula for funding them. She ha also attacked her Republican opponent for supporting a proposal to raise the state's sale tax by one percent. Under that plan, half the additional fund would have been used for school improvement with the remainder earmarked for reducing property tax. That statewide ballot initiative last May proved to be wildly unpopular, with about 80 percent of the voter opposing it. While the topic of tax and education are hot one this political season in Ohio, it is not clear that Ms. Boyle's emphasis on them ha helped her campaign. Despite some narrowing in the opinion poll, she is still trailing Voinovich by 10 percentage point in some poll and a much a 18 point in others. There is also a sharp fund-raising disparity. Ms. Boyle, who is running her first statewide race and ha widespread union support, ha raised nearly $2 million so far, far le than the nearly $7 million Voinovich ha taken in. Also, Voinovich, a former lieutenant governor, ha been on statewide ballot five time over the last 20 year and thus is the better-known candidate. The electoral dynamic of Ohio are also aiding Voinovich. The northern half of the state, with it history of industrial, unionized city, ha a tradition of voting largely for Democratic candidate, while the southern tier of the state is considered more conservative and typically lean Republican. But Voinovich and Ms. Boyle share the same home terrain, depriving Ms. Boyle of the geographic advantage that often accompanies Democratic candidate. Indeed, a a boy, Voinovich once delivered newspaper to the Boyle home in the working-class Collinwood section of Cleveland. And Voinovich, a former mayor of Cleveland, ha developed a reputation a a moderate Republican who work well with Democrats. Voinovich, while campaigning vigorously himself, is keeping a full schedule of official duty, assuming the role of the experienced, elected official. If I get into the Senate, I will probably know more about domestic policy than any member of the Senate, he said in an interview on Wednesday in Canton, sandwiched between a ribbon-cutting ceremony and a fund-raising reception at a vacuum cleaner museum. As mayor, I had my nose rubbed into the problem of urban America and wa fairly successful in dealing with them. And, a governor, I have dealt with the problem of Medicaid, welfare and education. I'm the only person in the United States who ha been president of the National League of Cities and chairman of the National Governors Association. To his opponent's charge on his record on education, Voinovich is dismissive. I'm probably the only Republican in the United States who ha been endorsed by the Ohio Education Association and National Education Association, he said, adding that Ms. Boyle wa a member of the state Legislature during the period cited in the Supreme Court ruling. Mary Boyle wa vice chairman of the Ways and Means Committee and a member of the Democratic leadership during those year, Voinovich said. They did nothing to fix the building, they did nothing for technology and the urban school district. Ms. Boyle, who ha not yet begun to run campaign commercial on television, said her status a the underdog had allowed me to be more focused, more intense. Pausing after a campaign fund-raising breakfast with former Democratic Sen. Bill Bradley of New Jersey here on Wednesday, Ms. Boyle said: This ha been a marathon and it's been pretty much uphill. But now, we're down to the last three mile. It's a tough race. Sen. Alfonse D'Amato, the New York Republican who is running for re-election, went to Manhattan's Grand Central Terminal the other morning to accept an award from mass-transit advocate. But the reporter who had gathered there showed little interest in the shiny train car at the senator's back. Instead, they repeatedly asked him how he would vote on an impeachment of President Clinton. Look, I'm not going to make any comment with respect to that subject matter, D'Amato responded. I am not just a citizen. I am a citizen-senator who may be called upon to make a decision. But D'Amato is something else a well: a candidate in what may be the tightest Senate race in the nation. And variation of his elliptical response can be heard in Senate race around the country, where both Republicans and Democrats are encountering similar question. All of which suggests that after the House voted Thursday to authorize an impeachment inquiry, this year's 34 race for the US. Senate have become, beyond what they already were, the electoral equivalent of jury selection. If the House vote to impeach Clinton, the matter go to the Senate, which must decide by a two-thirds majority whether to convict him and, thus, remove him from office. As a result, the Monica Lewinsky matter ha suddenly injected a new disruptive force into the Senate contest. Voters, even those who support Clinton, expect their political leader, Republican or Democratic, to renounce Clinton's behavior, and candidate have been doing that. But impeachment is another matter; most poll show the nation is against it. The danger for Senate candidate is that with impeachment now a real possibility, the debate may move beyond the president's behavior about which there is little disagreement to the more problematic issue of whether he should be removed from office. For most of the strategist involved in the race, there is little guidance on how to handle the impeachment issue. Advisers to candidate of both party said in interview last week that they were perplexed and worried, unsure what they can or should do on the issue to gain the advantage or guard against harm. I can't tell how this one is going to go, said Mike Russell, a spokesman for the Republican Senatorial Campaign Committee. This is a very surreal environment. Of the 34 Senate seat in play, 18 are held by Democrats and 16 by Republicans, who now hold 55 seat in all. Republicans would have to win 28 of the 34 race to produce the 67 vote necessary for conviction, assuming such a vote were to go along party line. Only an electoral catastrophe for the Democrats, which seems almost unthinkable, could produce such a huge loss. Jennifer Duffy, who follows Senate race for the Cook Political Report, a nonpartisan newsletter, said that so far, at least, none of the Senate candidate ha made an explicit appeal for vote based on how they would vote on a presidential jury. But she and others are wondering if this may be about to change. This is difficult ground to measure. One of the central question of this political year ha been how Clinton's dealing with Ms. Lewinsky might affect turnout. For a long time, politician assumed that dispirited Democrats would stay home a a rebuke to Clinton, just a many Republicans did in November 1974, three month after President Richard M. Nixon resigned. But now some analyst wonder if the partisan fight in Congress last week might have the opposite effect among some Democrats. That's the problem, said Stuart Rothenberg, the editor of an independent political newsletter in Washington. It's not that we don't know, and that the politician don't know, where the general public stand on impeachment. The problem is that we don't know where the electorate stand on impeachment. And asking voter to think ahead to an impeachment proceeding a they cast their ballot in a Senate race is, in the word of Stuart Stevens, a Republican consultant, a double bank-shot. Such strategy, he said, tend to work only with a small number of single-minded or sophisticated voter. Against that complicated backdrop, the prevailing thinking is that the use of the impeachment issue will vary from race to race, state to state and week to week, depending on the circumstance of the candidate and the composition of the electorate. If Democrats try to turn the image of Clinton in the dock to their advantage, it would be in state with a Democratic edge or with sizable number of black voter, who overwhelmingly support the president. In contest like those, it might well prove to be in the interest of a Democratic candidate to, a one consultant put it, sit down in front of a camera and tape an advertisement in which the candidate denounces the president's behavior but solemnly pledge to vote against impeachment. Strategists in both party believe that kind of approach could prove effective. This is an issue where there is a huge disconnect between the elite and the public, said Fred Yang, a Democratic consultant with client in Wisconsin and the Carolinas. That kind of Democratic strategy might emerge in California, New York, Illinois, Wisconsin, Washington and perhaps Arkansas. By contrast, Democrats in South Carolina, Georgia and Nevada would be le likely to oppose Clinton's impeachment. On the other side, Republican consultant are telling their candidate to stress Clinton's misdeed and stay away from talk of impeachment. The last thing the party want is to turn the Senate election into a referendum on whether Clinton should be forced from office. The White House might think from the overall public number that maybe they would like to make this a referendum election, said Ed Goeas, a Republican pollster who is working in Senate race this year. Republicans certainly aren't going to let that happen. D'Amato responded to question about Clinton with the language that Republican consultant have been suggesting to their candidate. When and if that matter come to the Senate, I will decide on the fact that are presented to me at that time, D'Amato said. It would be very premature for me to suggest any course of action without it being referred. Because, indeed, we may be called upon to act a a jury of some kind. But Schumer, a member of the House Judiciary Committee, which is conducting the impeachment investigation, virtually embraced the issue. In a live telecast of the hearing, he said the president deserved a lesser punishment, such a censure or reprimand. And Schumer plan to campaign in New York on Monday with Clinton at his side. Schumer's medium adviser, Hank Morris, seemed to suggest last week that impeachment will grow a an issue. Senator D'Amato claim he doe not want to share his opinion with the people of New York, Morris said. And if he doesn't have an opinion, he's the only New Yorker who doesn't have an opinion. Asked if Schumer would raise the issue in a television commercial, Morris responded: We don't talk about what we're going to do. I wouldn't rule it in and I wouldn't rule it out.

51,"The Yugoslav war crime tribunal Monday acquitted a Muslim military commander of war crime against Bosnian Serb prisoner in 1992, but convicted three underling in the first UN. case dealing with anti-Serb atrocity. The Yugoslav war crime tribunal cleared Zejnil Delalic, a Muslim, of responsibility for war crime committed against Serb captive at a Bosnian government-run prison camp under his command. Prosecutor Grant Niemann said he would appeal Delalic's acquittal, and asked judge to keep him in custody pending the outcome of the appeal. The UN. court convicted camp commander Zdravko Mucic, a Croat, of 11 war crime and grave breach of the Geneva Conventions because he oversaw guard who murdered nine Serbs and tortured six. Mucic smiled a he heard his sentence of seven year in prison read out. His conviction wa the first by an international court on the basis of so-called command responsibility since post-World War II tribunal convicted Nazi and Japanese superior for the crime of their subordinate. Mr. Mucic wa clearly derelict in his duty and allowed those under his authority to commit the most heinous of offense, without taking any disciplinary action, said presiding Judge Adolphus Karibi-Whyte. Hazim Delic, a Muslim who served a Mucic's deputy, wa found guilty of two murder and of raping two woman a well a torturing other inmate. He wa sentenced to 20 year. Esad Landzo, a Muslim guard, wa convicted of three murder and the torture of at least three other inmate. He wa jailed for 15 year. All four defendant had faced up to life imprisonment, the maximum punishment at the tribunal, which ha no death penalty. Monday's verdict ended a marathon 20-month trial that focused on the brutal mistreatment of the Bosnian Serbs, themselves blamed for the vast majority of the conflict's war crime. During the trial the tribunal's longest to date involving 122 witness survivor described the campaign of terror unleashed against Serbs in the area. Inmates at the Celebici prison camp were beaten to death by guard wielding baseball bat, wooden plank and rifle butt, according to testimony. Others were set on fire, raped and forced to commit sexual act with member of their own family. The 49-page indictment detailing atrocity at Celebici asserts that at least 14 prisoner were killed in 1992. One prisoner wa beaten to death and had a Muslim party badge nailed to his head, a witness claimed. Yet a few witness also praised Delalic and Mucic for humanitarian gesture, such a getting food and clothing to some prisoner and releasing others. The tribunal, set up by the Security Council in 1993, ha convicted only one other person following a trial Bosnian Serb Dusan Tadic, who wa sentenced in May 1997 to 20 year for killing and torturing Muslims in 1992. Two other men have confessed to killing Muslims, handing the tribunal two more conviction while sparing it the need for trial. He called himself the Serb Adolf, and his crime were a chilling a his nickname. In a trial opening Monday at the Yugoslav war crime tribunal, UN. prosecutor were seeking to convince a three-judge panel that Goran Jelisic is guilty of genocide, the court's most serious offense. The 30-year-old former Bosnian Serb mechanic confessed in October to murdering 12 Muslims and Croats in 1992, astonishing many observer by reversing his earlier declaration of innocence. Although his guilty plea mean an automatic conviction for war crime and crime against humanity and the likelihood of a maximum life sentence Jelisic ha denied that the killing spree constituted genocide. By pressing on with a genocide trial, prosecutor will be able to call evidence about the background of Jelisic's murder, including the involvement of more senior Serbs. The trial also will give survivor of his ruthless campaign a chance to tell their story in court. To convict Jelisic of genocide, prosecutor must prove that the murder most of them carried out with close-range shot from an automatic pistol were part of a campaign intended to wipe out an entire ethnic group in the northern Bosnian town of Brcko. Jelisic, who wa arrested in January by US. troop serving in the NATO force in Bosnia, ha pleaded guilty to a total of 31 count of war crime and crime against humanity. The charge cover the murder a well a three beating and the plundering of property. In entering those guilty plea, Jelisic told the tribunal he wanted to cleanse my soul. He will officially be convicted of those charge during the genocide trial. Jelisic's victim were killed in or near the Serb-run Luka prison camp, a former port complex on the bank of the Sava River. Although most victim were men, Jelisic also clubbed one female inmate with a police baton and then fatally shot her. UN. prosecutor say Jelisic identified himself to prisoner a the Serb Adolf, a reference to Hitler, and bragged about the number of Muslims he had killed. Set up in 1993, the UN. court ha convicted three Muslims, two Bosnian Croats and a Bosnian Serb of war crime including murder, rape and torture, but it ha yet to register a genocide conviction. An earlier genocide trial wa halted when the defendant, Bosnian Serb Milan Kovacevic, died of a ruptured artery in his tribunal cell. The Yugoslav war crime tribunal Monday acquitted a Muslim commander of war crime against Bosnian Serb prisoner in 1992, but convicted three underling in the first UN. case dealing with anti-Serb atrocity. The Yugoslav war crime tribunal cleared Zejnil Delalic, a Muslim, of responsibility for war crime committed against Serb captive at a Bosnian government-run prison camp under his command. Prosecutor Grant Niemann said he would appeal Delalic's acquittal, and asked judge to keep him in custody pending the outcome of the appeal. The UN. court convicted camp commander Zdravko Mucic, a Croat, of 11 war crime and grave breach of the Geneva Conventions because he oversaw guard who murdered nine Serbs and tortured six. Mucic smiled a he heard his sentence of seven year in prison read out. His conviction wa the first by an international court on the basis of so-called command responsibility since post-World War II tribunal convicted Nazi and Japanese superior for the crime of their subordinate. Mr. Mucic wa clearly derelict in his duty and allowed those under his authority to commit the most heinous of offense, without taking any disciplinary action, said presiding Judge Adolphus Karibi-Whyte. Hazim Delic, a Muslim who served a Mucic's deputy, wa found guilty of two murder and of raping two woman a well a torturing other inmate. He wa sentenced to 20 year. Esad Landzo, a Muslim guard, wa convicted of three murder and the torture of at least three other inmate. He wa jailed for 15 year. All four defendant had faced up to life imprisonment, the maximum punishment at the tribunal, which ha no death penalty. Monday's verdict ended a marathon 20-month trial that focused on the brutal mistreatment of the Bosnian Serbs, themselves blamed for the vast majority of the conflict's war crime. During the trial the tribunal's longest to date involving 122 witness survivor described the campaign of terror unleashed against Serbs in the area. Inmates at the Celebici prison camp were beaten to death by guard wielding baseball bat, wooden plank and rifle butt, according to testimony. Others were set on fire, raped and forced to commit sexual act with member of their own family. The 49-page indictment detailing atrocity at Celebici asserts that at least 14 prisoner were killed in 1992. One prisoner wa beaten to death and had a Muslim party badge nailed to his head, a witness claimed. Yet a few witness also praised Delalic and Mucic for humanitarian gesture, such a getting food and clothing to some prisoner and releasing others. The tribunal, set up by the Security Council in 1993, ha convicted only one other person following a trial Bosnian Serb Dusan Tadic, who wa sentenced in May 1997 to 20 year for killing and torturing Muslims in 1992. Two other men have confessed to killing Muslims, handing the tribunal two more conviction while sparing it the need for trial. Hundreds of people gathered at Sarajevo airport on Saturday to welcome Zejnil Delalic, who wa cleared of war crime charge earlier this week after spending 980 day in jail of the international war crime tribunal in The Hague. Delalic, a Muslim, wa cleared of charge of war crime committed in 1992 against Serb prisoner in the Muslim-led Bosnian Army prison camp Celebici near his hometown of Konjic. Three others involved in the same case were convicted and will serve prison term at The Hague for crime committed a camp guard. Delalic held up his verdict a he arrived and wa first greeted by his family and then by many friend from Konjic, 50 kilometer (31 mile) south of Sarajevo, where a huge welcome party for him wa planned. This is the book of 500 page in which it say 12 time Delalic is not guilty, he told reporter. More important is that act commited by some weren't ordered by officer of our Bosnian Army. These act were qualified a act of individual that happened on a daily basis, he said. Edina Residovic, Delalic's lawyer, said she will seek compensation for wrongful imprisonment on behalf of Delalic, who spent almost three year in confinement. Yugoslavia must cooperate with the UN. war crime tribunal investigating alleged atrocity during the war in Croatia and Bosnia, international legal expert meeting in Belgrade said Sunday. The meeting wa the first international debate in Yugoslavia over the UN. tribunal's work and the government's cooperation with it. The tribunal, established by the UN. Security Council in 1993, sits in The Hague, Netherlands. Despite objection to the tribunal, Yugoslav authority allowed the two-day discussion organized by the Belgrade-based, non-governmental Humanitarian Law Center to take place without any problem. State-run medium largely ignored the event. Though there were some disagreement, participant in the discussion generally agreed that crime against humanity cannot go unpunished. The indicted who are not in The Hague are at-large because of the refusal by Croatian and Yugoslav authority to arrest and extradite them, said Mark Ellis, a lawyer and representative of the American Bar Association. Present-day Yugoslavia, consisting of Serbia and Montenegro, cooperates with the tribunal in case where Serbs were the victim in Bosnia and Croatia, the two former republic that fought war for their secession. But Yugoslavia ha questioned the tribunal's jurisdiction and refuse to indict three army officer wanted for alleged war crime in Croatia. Last week, it also refused to allow UN. investigator to probe alleged atrocity in Serbia's southern Kosovo province where ethnic Albanian separatist are fighting government force. The tribunal wa founded to satanize Serbs, said Miodrag Mitic, a former legal adviser in Yugoslavia's foreign ministry. He said the UN. court wa influenced by powerful country that dominate the international body. On Saturday, David Scheffer, the US. State Department's ambassador at-large for war crime, demanded Yugoslavia's full cooperation. Some of the closest combat in the half year of the Kosovo conflict, to the point of fighting room to room and floor to floor, occurred near this village six week ago, in the day before 21 woman, child and elderly member of the Delijaj clan were massacred by Serbian force, their mutilated body left strewn on the forest floor. Piecing together what happened, from surviving family member, ethnic Albanian separatist force and official Serbian information, a story emerges of fierce guerrilla resistance to an onslaught by Serbian tank, artillery and infantry. The Serbian force fighting here appear to have suffered unusually heavy loss and, after the guerrilla finally fled, took revenge against the civilian, shooting woman and child at close range a they tried to run away from their pursuer. According to relative who found the body, Pajazit Delijaj, 65, wa decapitated, his brain left on display on the ground. Hava Delijaj, 65, wa shot and one of her foot cut with a knife so that it hung by a thread of skin. Young woman and child who had run a few hundred yard up a rocky path were mowed down. Miraculously, a 6-week-old baby, Diturie, wa found by her father alive in the clasp of her dead mother, Lumnije, 30, more than 24 hour after the killing. Blood wa in her mouth and her mother's hand on the baby, said Imer Delijaj, the father, an avowed member of the Kosovo Liberation Army, the ethnic Albanian guerrilla force, who returned in uniform to discover the body. I moved her hand and at that moment she opened her eye. I realized she wa alive. I tried to clean the blood from her mouth and she put her tongue out. Several member of the Delijaj clan survived. Zejnije Delijaj, 39, who had cooked for the guerrilla at the family compound when they returned from fighting in the day before the massacre, recalled how she fled, crawling, falling, running and hiding in the wood a the Serbs shot at her. I could feel the dirt hitting me from the impact of the bullet, she said in an interview, her nose still bloodied from what she said wa a heavy fall during her flight. First it wa machine gun, then grenade, then cannon, she said. Every time I moved and they heard leaf rustling, they shot. The massacre of the Delijajs, whose forebear settled in the Drenica Valley about 150 year ago, wa not the first in the conflict that ravaged the Serbian province between March and October and ha now lulled into an uneasy truce. Indeed, the conflict between Serbian force bent on keeping Kosovo in Serbia and guerrilla fighting for the independence of it heavily ethnic Albanian population first drew international attention with the massacre of the Jasari clan in early March by Serbian unit at Prekaz, in central Kosovo. But the killing of the Delijajs, ranging from the paralyzed patriarch, Fazli, 94, who wa burned in his bed, to the slaughter of Valmir, 18 month, who wa found shot, is the most thoroughly documented so far. Human Rights Watch, a New York-based group, belief the knowledge gathered so far increase the possibility of prosecution by the UN. war crime tribunal in The Hague, Netherlands. The Hague's prosecutor could also draw on the observation of diplomat, human right monitor and reporter who saw the body scattered in the ravine where the victim were killed before they were buried in shallow graf in the clan's nearby compound. In other Kosovo massacre, body had been moved from the site before they were seen by independent observer. Further, family member who survived the assault have described what they saw and the circumstance in the hill and valley around Obrinje a the Serbs pushed forward early Saturday morning, Sept. 26, from their headquarters at Likovac, north of here. By then, the Albanian guerrilla had fled the area around the Delijaj compound, dispersing after what a senior commander of the Kosovo Liberation Army, Naim Maloku, termed particularly fierce combat with the Serbs. In the day before Sept. 26, he said, the guerrilla caught in a Serbian pincer movement had decided to fight rather than surrender. The fighting sometimes house to house, even room to room took an unusually heavy toll among the Serbs, said Maloku, a former officer in the Yugoslav army. He said he believed that it wa those death the Serbs avenged with the massacre of the Delijajs. In other major attack during the conflict, the guerrilla generally found an escape hatch. In Obrinje, led by another former officer of the Yugoslav army whom Maloku declined to name, the guerrilla fought, using land mine and rocket-propelled grenade. Maloku said he knew from a report made by rebel headquarters that at least 47 Serbian soldier and police officer were killed in the fighting between here and Bajince, three mile east. We took weapon from 47 Serbs, he said. The state-controlled Serbian medium center in Kosovo's capital, Pristina, said 10 Serbian police officer were killed in the fighting, including five reservist who died when their vehicle hit an antitank mine on Sept. 25. The announcement of 10 Serbs killed in one action is unusually high. The practice of taking violent revenge is a time-honored tradition in the Balkans. From 1991 to 1995, in the war in Croatia and Bosnia, Serbs, Croats and, to a far lesser extent, the main victim, the Muslims, avenged World War II massacre and new blood feud, driven into killing by leader who exploited old conflict to carve new fief for themselves a the old, Communist Yugoslavia collapsed. In this case, it appears, Serbian vengeance wa visited upon the Delijajs. Survivors of the clan said they had feared an assault on their collection of mud and brick home lining a rocky dirt track directly opposite the village of Likovac, the Serbs' base just a mile away. The Serbs had pushed the rebel out of Likovac in August and the guerrilla had established new headquarters around Bajince, six mile east of Obrinje. As the Serbs swept down from the nearby Cicavica Mountains, and up from the road that run from Pristina to Klina, it wa clear that Obrinje would be a target. Most woman and child in the area had moved into Apple Valley, where more than 10,000 refugee had gathered outdoors, seeking safety in number. But Imer Delijaj, 38, said he decided that the ravine below his family compound would be a better hiding place. He said he believed the woman, child and elderly would be spared if the Serbs found them. As the Serbs approached on foot the Saturday morning of the massacre, the last person to flee the compound itself wa Bashkim Delijaj, 21, the youngest son of 94-year-old Fazli. Bashkim Delijaj said he had stayed behind to look after his bedridden father. The shelling started again at 7 am. on Saturday and I saw a tank convoy approaching, with infantry behind the tank, Bashkim Delijaj recalled in an interview. I wa smoking a cigarette when a grenade fell on the roof and from a hole in the gate I saw soldier coming from about 30 meter away. They were in brown army uniform, had huge knife or small ax. Many had beard. Bashkim Delijaj said he wa unable to carry his father to safety, and did not have the courage to tell him what wa happening. I told him I wa getting the animal out of the barn, he said. He said he ran, hid, ran some more, and eventually received shelter from a farmer, all the time hearing shooting and shelling. When the firing had died down Monday morning, he returned to the compound and ran into Imer, still wearing his guerrilla uniform. They went to one of the house and found Imer Delijaj's brother, Adem, 33, shot dead, his body sprawled on the ground in the rain, and the burned torso of Fazli. I looked in the window of our house and saw only the bone of my father, which looked like what we learned in biology class, he said. Together, the two men went to find out what had happened in the ravine. There they found the body. First, Ali, 65, who, Imer Delijaj said, had been cut through the neck with his own tobacco cutting knife. Then Pajazit, who had been decapitated in a makeshift tent, his brain placed between two foam mattress. Then Hava, 65, who wa sprawled near the tent. They moved on to find Jeton, Imer's 10-year-old son, and Imer's mother, Hamide, 60, not far away. Imer's sister-in-law, Luljeta, who wa seven month pregnant, had been mutilated, he said. A little further up the ravine, Imer said he saw his wife, Lumnije, 30. He opened his wife's coat and found his 6-week-old baby girl, now 3 month old and recovering at a relative's home in Likovac. He said he tried to clean the baby and then put her under his jacket and walked a few foot further to find the body of his 4-year-old daughter, Menduhije, and two other young child, Donieta, 5, and Gentiana, 7. The corps of other family member were found in the wood and two older men, Habib, 51, and Hysen, 53, were found the next morning, Imer said. On Oct. 3, the body of two missing teen-age girl, Mehane, 16, and Antigua, 13, were found in the bush at the side of a road near an abandoned Serbian police compound. Later in the month, the body of Hajriz wa found pushed down a well, close to the ravine. One uncle, Sharif, who wa in the ravine, is still missing, presumed dead. Human Rights Watch, which ha been documenting the Delijaj massacre, ha described it a the most vicious of a pattern of attack on civilian by the Serbs in the Kosovo conflict. (To a lesser extent, Albanian guerrilla also attacked Serbian civilian, forcing them from their home, and allegedly carried out at least two massacres.) The evidence strongly indicates that the Gornje Obrinje killing were followed by conscious mutilation carried out after the victim were killed, a coming report by Human Rights Watch say. Delijaj family member have told Human Rights Watch monitor and others that they saw an ethnic Albanian police officer accompanying the Serbian police officer during the fighting. They believe that the police officer, who is posted at the nearby Glogovac police station, wa used by the Serbian special police officer a a guide to the Obrinje area. This police officer, who is apparently one of a small group of ethnic Albanians officer who have remained loyal to the Serbs, could be an important witness for criminal investigator from the war-crimes tribunal in The Hague, according to human right expert. The ethnic Albanian policeman could be an important witness to identifying the police and army unit responsible for the atrocity, said Peter Boueckhart, a researcher for Human Rights Watch. It is vital that those who carried out these atrocity are prosecuted by the Hague tribunal. At the burned Delijaj compound in the last week, Imer Delijaj ha been acting a the host of a wake which, following Albanian tradition, will last several week and began after family member returned from their hiding place in the wood. Color photograph of the youngest member of the family, and of Imer's mother and grandmother, have been mounted behind glass on a table outside the gate. A 30-year-old faded black and white picture of Fazli in a double-breasted suit stand apart, a sign of ultimate respect. An outsized Albanian flag with a black double-headed eagle on a red field is draped behind the table. Imer Delijaj's face seemed tense and his word were spare a he described his family's death. He did not express direct remorse for allowing his family to use a hiding place so close to the family compound, which for all practical purpose wa an informal base for fighter. His lawyer, Bajram Krasniqi, who said he wa eager to be helpful to investigator of the Hague tribunal, said in Pristina that he believed Imer Delijaj felt guilty for a faulty decision. Whether the tribunal will closely examine the case remains unclear. Slobodan Milosevic, the Yugoslav president, ha issued only a handful of visa to investigator from the tribunal. Two investigator who were in Kosovo at the time of the massacre left six day later without visiting the site or contacting Krasniqi about the killing. Would Imer Delijaj seek revenge? As he sat on the floor of his living room with a group of male visitor, he replied: It's easy to answer. If I can see eye to eye with men I will fight them. But only with men in uniform and in a fair fight. If I see child with them, I will treat them like child all over the world. Children are child. American and allied force in Bosnia on Wednesday arrested a Bosnian Serb general who wa charged with genocide by the international war crime tribunal in a recent secret indictment. Maj. Gen. Radislav Krstic, arrested without incident in the American sector in northeast Bosnia, is the highest-ranking official to be seized so far, and the first serving military officer. He is accused of directing the attack on Srebrenica in 1995, one of the most chilling and influential event of the Bosnian war, when some 7,000 Bosnian Muslim men were marched off, presumably to their death, a UN. peacekeeper stood by. The indictment of Krstic accuses him of having committed genocide during and after the fall of Srebrenica between July 11 and Nov. 1, 1995. He is indicted both in connection with direct personal involvement in the commission of these crime a well a his command responsibility. He is also accused of murder and other crime against humanity. Krstic wa a colonel in 1995, and the deputy commander of the Drina battalion, but wa promoted to general within day of the fall of Srebrenica. He is considered a close associate of the Bosnian Serb commander, Gen. Ratko Mladic, and the former Bosnian Serb leader, Radovan Karadzic, both of whom are wanted by the tribunal. And he is considered capable, if he is willing to testify, of implicating Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic, who ha not been indicted. Louise Arbour, chief prosecutor of the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia, called Krstic a very significant military leader and said she wa delighted with the arrest. The general wa only indicted on Oct. 30, tribunal official said, but the indictment wa kept secret so there would be a better chance of a successful arrest. NATO Secretary-General Javier Solana warned that other war crime suspect still at large should realize that they, too, will be brought to justice. James Rubin, the State Department spokesman, said that the arrest serf a a standing warning to those indicted for war crime, who remain at large, that they will be held individually accountable for their action. The Bosnian Serbs reacted angrily to the arrest, with the hardline Bosnian Serb president, Nikola Poplasen, saying that his government would now reduce contact with NATO-led peacekeeping force to the necessary minimum. Poplasen, who defeated a more moderate candidate backed by Washington in September election, said the arrest of Krstic had embittered and upset the Bosnian Serbs and would harm the implementation of the Dayton agreement that ended the 1992-1995 Bosnian war. He said he would protest the arrest, and his remark were later endorsed by parliament in a majority vote. A senior official of a NATO country called the arrest very good news and said it wa a warning to Milosevic himself and others who have not been publicly indicted that the murder committed have not been forgotten. A Pentagon official said the arrest, the most important made in the American sector, wa a sign that this is a continuing process. NATO-led peacekeeping troop have now arrested nine people wanted for war crime in the former Yugoslavia, four of whom were the subject of sealed indictment. There have been numerous call for the arrest of Mladic and Karadzic, the two most infamous men indicted, but they normally are accompanied by armed guard. NATO force have never tried to arrest them, apparently fearing casualty and an angry public reaction from Bosnian Serbs. Officials say that both Mladic and Karadzic are believed to have left the Bosnian Serb Republic to live in Serbia, which is part of Yugoslavia and controlled by Milosvevic. Krstic, who wa transferred to The Hague for trial, is the 35th suspect who ha been taken there and the 26th person currently being held there. He is the commander of the Bosnian Serb 5th Corps and wa arrested while traveling on the road to Bijelina. At the outset of the war in 1992, he wa an officer of the Yugoslav Army, and like all senior Bosnian Serb officer, wa transferred to the new Bosnian Serb force. In 1994, he lost a leg in a mine explosion. One Bosnian Serb official said in a telephone interview that, at the time, Krstic had responsibility for anti-terrorist unit who were given some of the most difficult task. Srebrenica is a dark part of our history and people don't talk about it, the official said. But everyone belief it wa the anti-terrorist unit that were sent to do the killing. In Banja Luka on Wednesday, some member of the Bosnian Serb parliament protested the arrest, saying that Krstic wa simply doing his job a a soldier. Ivo Daalder, a former Bosnia expert on the National Security Council, now with the Brookings Institution, said the arrest showed a new and promising coordination between the Tribunal and NATO troop, given the rapid arrest after the Oct. 30 indictment. He also said that the arrest of a serving officer for an important war crime would send an important message. Srebrenica wa a key town in the Bosnian conflict. It wa where the United Nations first made a stand in March 1993, when the commander of UN. troop personally led a convoy of truck to the surrounded town and promised the Bosnian Muslims there that Srebrenica would be a safe area and the United Nations would protect them. But in July 1995, the United Nations did not protect Srebrenica with air strike, and peacekeeping troop watched a the Serbs marched in, separated Muslim men and woman and marched the men off. Srebrenica signaled the massive failure of the West, said Daalder. It galvanized the United States and NATO to act. At a London conference later in July, NATO agreed to defend Gorazde and remaining safe area with massive air strike if necessary. After a mortar attack on the Sarajevo marketplace in late August, NATO air strike began, signaling the last chapter of the war and leading to the American-brokered Dayton Accords. In Sarajevo Wednesday, an aide to the Bosnian Muslim member of the collective presidency, Alija Izetbegovic, praised the arrest. We welcome this action, hoping very soon that the time will come for Karadzic and Mladic to be brought to justice, said the aide, Mirza Jajric. The arrest took place a foreign minister of the member country of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe met in Oslo, Norway, to discus the international effort to keep the peace in Kosovo, the southern Serbian province. Under a deal pressed on Milosevic in October, the organization will provide up to 2,000 civilian to monitor a cease-fire in Kosovo and to promote a political settlement there to give Kosovo enhanced autonomy. Macedonia's government Wednesday formally approved the basing of 1,700 NATO troop near it border with Kosovo. Those troop will be prepared to rush to the aid of the civilian monitor if necessary. The president of the Yugoslav war crime tribunal harshly criticized Belgrade authority anew for refusing to let UN. investigator probe alleged atrocity in Kosovo. In a letter to the United Nations Security Council released Wednesday by the tribunal, presiding judge Gabrielle Kirk McDonald of the United States said the failure of Yugoslav official to grant visa to investigator is an affront. The intentional and continuous refusal by the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia to comply with it clear and incontrovertible legal obligation to the tribunal is an affront to the Security Council and all law-abiding nation, she said. The Texas judge fired off the letter last Friday following the refusal of Belgrade authority to allow tribunal Chief Prosecutor Louise Arbour of Canada and a team of investigator to visit Kosovo. McDonald asked the Security Council to impose measure which are sufficiently compelling to bring the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia into the fold of law-abiding nation. Hundreds of people, mostly ethnic Albanians, have been killed, and a many a 300,000 driven from their home since February, when Serb force began a crackdown on ethnic Albanian separatist in Kosovo. The tribunal want to look into allegation of war crime on both side of the conflict. In it first case to deal with atrocity against Serbs during Bosnia's civil war, a UN. war crime tribunal on Monday convicted three prison official and guard, but acquitted a top military commander who oversaw the facility. The Yugoslav war crime tribunal cleared Cmndr. Zejnil Delalic, of the Bosnian Muslim Army, of responsibility for war crime committed at a government-run prison camp under his overall command. Prosecutor Grant Niemann of Australia said he would appeal Delalic's acquittal. Judges freed Delalic pending the outcome of the appeal. Let me thank you for a just and fair judgment, Delalic told the court. The judgment ha even increased my trust in this institution. The tribunal convicted camp warden Zdravko Mucic, a Croat, of 11 war crime and grave breach of the Geneva Conventions because he oversaw guard who murdered nine Serbs and tortured six. Mucic, wearing dark sunglass and a cross, smiled a he heard his sentence of seven year in prison. Tribunal Deputy Prosecutor Graham Blewitt of Australia said he wa considering appealing Mucic's inadequate sentence. Mucic's conviction wa the first by an international court on the basis of command responsibility since post-World War II tribunal convicted Nazi and Japanese superior for the crime of their subordinate. Mr. Mucic wa clearly derelict in his duty and allowed those under his authority to commit the most heinous of offense, without taking any disciplinary action, said presiding Judge Adolphus Karibi-Whyte of Nigeria. Monday's verdict ended a marathon 20-month trial that focused on the brutal mistreatment of the Bosnian Serbs, themselves blamed for the vast majority of war crime committed during the 3 1/2-year Bosnian conflict. During the trial the tribunal's longest to date involving 122 witness survivor described the campaign of terror unleashed against Serbs in the area. Inmates at the Celebici prison camp were beaten to death by guard wielding baseball bat, wooden plank and rifle butt, according to testimony. Others were set on fire, raped and forced to commit sexual act with member of their own family. The 49-page indictment detailing atrocity at Celebici asserts that at least 14 prisoner were killed in 1992. One prisoner wa beaten to death and had a Muslim party badge nailed to his head, a witness claimed. Yet a few witness also praised Delalic and Mucic, for humanitarian gesture, such a getting food and clothing to some prisoner and releasing others. Hazim Delic, a Muslim who served a deputy warden of the camp, wa found guilty of two murder and of raping two woman a well a torturing other inmate. He wa sentenced to 20 year by Karibi-Whyte, who denounced rape a a despicable act which strike at the very core of human dignity and physical integrity. Delic's defense attorney said he would likely appeal. Esad Landzo, a Muslim guard, wa convicted of killing three prisoner and torturing at least three others and wa sentenced to 15 year. His attorney also are likely to appeal the conviction. All four defendant had faced up to life imprisonment, the maximum punishment at the tribunal, which ha no death penalty. A charge against Delic and Mucic of plundering property wa dismissed by the three-judge panel. Mucic also wa cleared of responsibility for four murder and three case of mistreatment or torture of prisoner. Delic wa cleared of two murder, and of command responsibility for other killing at Celebici. He wa also acquitted of three case of torture. Landzo wa cleared of one murder charge and one torture count. The tribunal, set up by the Security Council in 1993, ha convicted only one other person following a trial Bosnian Serb Dusan Tadic, who wa sentenced in May 1997 to 20 year for killing and torturing Muslims in 1992. Two other men have confessed to killing Muslims, handing the tribunal two more conviction without conduction trial. To his Muslim target, Bosnian Serb Goran Jelisic wa the face of genocide who once bragged that he had to kill 20 or 30 Muslims before his morning coffee. Opening a genocide trial Monday at the Yugoslav war crime tribunal, UN. prosecutor Terree Bowers said the 30-year-old mechanic used the nickname Adolf with a perverse pride in the genocidal symbolism it represented. Jelisic pleaded guilty in October to murdering 12 Muslims and Croats in and around the Serb-run Luka camp set up in Brcko, northern Bosnia, in May 1992. By trying him for genocide, prosecutor will be able to call evidence about the background of Jelisic's murder, including the involvement of more senior Serbs. The trial also will give survivor of his killing spree chance to tell their story in court. Bowers told a three-judge tribunal panel that Jelisic admitted in interview with investigator to far more killing than the dozen to which he ha pleaded guilty. Jelisic will be convicted of those murder and sentenced at the end of his trial, which is expected to last well into 1999. He face a maximum sentence of life imprisonment. We will never be able to fix the exact number of victim, Bowers said. But if we are to believe even a small percentage of the total which Goran Jelisic claimed, then his victim certainly number well over 100. As the trial began, judge were read excerpt of a psychological report which stated that Jelisic wa mentally fit to stand trial but suffered a borderline personality disorder. Wearing a striped sweater and black jean, Jelisic brought a laptop computer into court and took note. When he wasn't writing, Jelisic sat slightly slumped in his chair, his head still, looking impassively around the courtroom. Jelisic's campaign of murder stand out even at a tribunal set up to deal exclusively with atrocity for it cold-bloodedness. Once Goran Jelisic even declined assistance from a guard, noting that he wa still in `good form' even though he had killed over 60 people, Bowers told judge, citing statement made by witness due to testify later in the trial. To victim in Brcko, the face of genocide wa the face of Goran Jelisic, he said. Bowers told the judge that Jelisic, who held no official rank, wa released by Bosnian Serb authority from jail, where he wa serving three year for fraud, and sent to Brcko to murder Muslims. He told investigator that on his arrival in the town, which wa of strategic importance to Bosnian Serbs, he wa given a list of Muslim target and ordered to kill a many a possible.

Witness testimony will also establish that Goran Jelisic wa not a reluctant tool of the genocide who wa being compelled by Serb authority to act against his will, the US. prosecutor said. Quite to the contrary, the testimony will firmly establish that Goran Jelisic wa an efficient and enthusiastic participant in the genocide. Set up in 1993, the UN. court ha convicted two Muslims, two Bosnian Croats and a Bosnian Serb of war crime including murder, rape and torture, but it ha yet to register a genocide conviction.

53,"The radical Islamic group Hamas on Monday denounced US. President Bill Clinton's upcoming visit to the Gaza Strip but carefully avoided making any threat against him. Hamas is, 2nd graf pvs On a street newly littered with the debris of battle stone, spent tear gas canister, charred remnant of half-burned tire a sodden Palestinian flag flap in a fitful rain-laden wind outside a house in mourning. Inside, to the tinny recorded wail of Koranic verse, neighbor and relative of the dead man a 21-year-old university student felled on the roof of his own home by an Israeli soldier's rubber-coated bullet sipped tiny cup of coffee left unsweetened to symbolize the bitter occasion. Some smoked, a few spoke quietly among themselves, but most simply sat in reflective silence. Among those in attendance on this day, the first of the traditional three day of family mourning, wa Saeb Erekat, the chief peace negotiator for Yasser Arafat's Palestinian Authority. The dead youth, Nasr Erekat, wa a cousin of his. Erekat stayed for a time, sitting amid clan elder in Arab headdress and teen-age nephew in American-style athletic shoe, then slipped away for a meeting in connection with President Clinton's visit beginning this weekend. It's been very difficult, he said later, asked about carrying on his negotiating duty at such a time. I have a great sense of sorrow and sadness, a feeling of such loss. I hope God will enable me to use my grief to strengthen my determination for peace. The scene at the Erekat home, in the Arab village of Abu Dis on Jerusalem's eastern outskirt, drive home a central truth about the Israeli-Palestinian conflict: on both side of the divide, the political is also deeply personal. And that inescapability go to the heart of the quarrel's intractability. In the glare of world attention, it is easy to forget that there are fewer people living in Israel and the Palestinian land combined than there are in New York City. In the small and jostling confines of what few here choose to call the Holy Land, the conflict touch all. Everyone ha a stake in it. Israelis fret daily over soldier son on dangerous patrol in the West Bank and Gaza Strip, or shudder when they pas a sidewalk cafe once ripped by an Islamic militant's suicide bomb. Palestinian family struggle to keep alive the memory of father and brother languishing in Israeli prison, and chafe under the checkpoint and gunsight of Israeli troop. On both side, the youngest soak up fear and anger along with their ABCs. And elders' memory of half a century past still rise to trouble the collective sleep: the shadow of the Holocaust for Israelis, the trauma of exile and dispossession for the Palestinians. Against this backdrop, amid a landscape little changed since biblical time, terrible Old Testament theme lamentation and retribution, the smiting of enemy and the sharpening of sword spring to life once again in any day's headline. Now come Clinton, this most American of president, one who ha made Middle East peacemaking a kind of personal crusade, in hope of halting what ha become one of the century's most protracted blood feud. Clinton is no stranger to these particular hatred. Three year ago, in another winter season, he came here to bury Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin, gunned down by a nationalist Jew who could not abide the term of a Mideast agreement that called just a this latest accord doe for Israel to cede West Bank land in exchange for peace with the Palestinians. On the occasion of this visit first intended to celebrate the Wye River accord signed seven week ago in Washington, now meant to salvage them all three of the principal are embattled. Clinton is under an impeachment cloud; Arafat is buffeted by furious Palestinian street protest and his own failing health, and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's coalition government is hanging by a thread. The day leading up to Clinton's visit have been divisive one, contriving somehow to simultaneously tap into both sides' greatest fear. In the West Bank's worst spasm of violence in month, Israelis watched window of Israeli-plated car shatter from stone thrown by angry youth, saw TV footage of a cringing Israeli soldier now facing court martial being beaten bloody by a Palestinian mob, heard Palestinian officials' exhortation for a new intefadeh, or uprising. Palestinians, for their part, listened in anger a Netanyahu announced the suspension of an upcoming Israeli troop pullback in the West Bank and tried vainly to halt Israeli bulldozer expanding Jewish settlement on land they claim a their own. Both side to Palestinians' satisfaction, and Israel's dismay came to see the visit a an implicit acknowledgement of Palestinian statehood aspiration, despite increasingly desperate American effort to avoid casting it in that light. Clinton's foray to the Gaza Strip, which is already under Palestinian rule, will be the first by a sitting American president. Palestinians intend to play on that symbolism for all it is worth, greeting him with the strain of their once-banned national anthem. In the mourning house in Abu Dis, though, the friend and relative of Nasr Erekat had little to say about politics and statehood. They talked about Nasr instead. Amr Erekat, 27, recalled his disbelief a he cradled his dying cousin in his arm. His 14-year-old brother Taher spoke haltingly of the big brother he had looked up to. His childhood friend, Samir Abdel Salam, remembered wishing he had stuck to his study a diligently a Nasr had. Saeb Erekat, the peace negotiator, could find neither lesson nor logic to his young cousin's death. It's senseless, this rhythm of bloodshed, he said. At these difficult time, you pray for one thing, for both sides: no more of it. Armored personnel carrier were deployed Tuesday around the convention center where US. President Bill Clinton will address 1,500 Palestinian delegate next week. US. Secret Service agent have already arrived in Gaza to work with their Palestinian counterpart on how to protect Clinton during his first visit to Palestinian area. There is cooperation with the American security people. We have our own plan. The Americans have their own procedure a well, said the Palestinian police chief, Ghazi Jabali. The Islamic militant group Hamas, which hope to scuttle the accord, ha been careful not to openly threaten Clinton. However, Hamas ha carried out more than a dozen suicide bombing in Israel in an attempt to bring peace talk with Israel to a halt. On Monday, Clinton and Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat are to address member of the Palestine National Council and delegate from other group, at the Shawa Cultural Center in Gaza City. Traffic near the Shawa Center still flowed normally Tuesday, but plainclothes security a well a uniformed officer with M-17 and AK-47 assault rifle began patrolling in the vicinity. Streets around the center are to be closed day before the Clinton visit. Four armored personnel were parked at the corner of the convention center, with member of Arafat's elite bodyguard unit, known a Force 17, sitting on the vehicle. APCs were also deployed outside Arafat's guest house and near the Palestinian legislative council. Jabali said the APCs were part of a Palestinian security plan that ha been presented to the Americans. US. security agent, in turn, have given their Palestinian counterpart sophisticated explosive detection equipment. The Palestinian police are ready to protect President Clinton here in Gaza or in Bethlehem, Jabali said, referring to Clinton's expected visit next Tuesday to the Church of the Nativity in the biblical West Bank town of Bethlehem In Jerusalem, Clinton's entourage of 1,200 people will take over the Jerusalem Hilton, at a cost of half a million dollar. The hotel boast stunning view of Jerusalem's walled Old City and the slope of the Judean Desert. Israel affirmed Friday that it will not withdraw troop in the West Bank unless the top Palestinian decision-making body hold a vote to annul clause of the PLO charter calling for Israel's destruction. Just a day before US. President Bill Clinton's arrival, Israel also rejected a US. compromise on the release of Palestinian prisoner, an issue that ha sparked riot in the West Bank. The Palestinians have said they would revoke the clause only by acclamation, not by a vote, when the Palestine National Council meet on Monday in Clinton's presence. With it demand, Israel may be setting itself up for a showdown with Clinton whose visit to Israel and the Palestinian is ushering in the next stage of the Wye River land-for-security agreement he helped negotiate. Under the accord, the annulment of the offending provision by the PNC is to clear the way for an Israeli troop pullback. Clinton is unlikely to declare the PNC ha not completed it task because that would mean his high-profile visit ha been a failure. However, Israeli official said they would not drop their demand for a vote. They have to vote in the PNC, said Israeli government spokesman Moshe Fogel. Otherwise, he said, Israel will not turn over additional West Bank territory to the Palestinians because transfer of territory is irreversible. In Washington, deputy US. State Department spokesman James Foley wa evasive on whether the United States expected a vote from the PNC. The procedure need to be clear enough that nullification ha taken place, he said. A senior Palestinian official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the United States ha not asked Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat to consider holding a vote. On Thursday, the Palestinians took an interim step when a smaller leadership body, the 124-member Palestinian Central Council, declared the charter clause revoked. The 95 member present were asked whether they approved a letter in which Arafat informed Clinton that the charter clause calling for Israel's destruction were null and void. In all, 81 voted in favor, seven against and seven abstained. Asked about the decision, Arafat would only say that it wa a very important and constructive meeting. The Palestinian leader also said he hoped Clinton would exert pressure on Israel to keep it obligation under the Wye agreement. The Palestine Liberation Organization charter wa drawn up three decade ago, long before Israel and the Palestinians started their peace process in 1993. The Palestinians say they took all the required step to revoke the pertinent clause at a PNC session in Gaza in 1996. However, Netanyahu ha said the PNC never completed the job. During the Wye River talk, the Palestinians agreed in a compromise to invite PNC member and delegate from other group to Gaza to hear Clinton and Arafat speak. The Wye accord say delegate should reaffirm the Arafat letter to Clinton, but doe not specifically refer to a vote. Former Israeli Prime Minister Shimon Peres sided with the Palestinians on Friday. They did it once, they did it twice, they don't have to do it again, said Peres, who wa prime minister during the PNC vote in 1996. Israel and the Palestinians have also accused each other of violating other element of the Wye agreement. A key point of contention ha been Israel's pledge to release 750 Palestinian prisoner in three stage by the end of January. The Palestinians have said Israel broke a promise to release prisoner held for anti-Israeli activity. Israel said it never made such a pledge, and accused the Palestinian Authority of incitement over the prisoner issue. Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erekat said the United States offered a compromise, a trilateral committee to go over the list of prisoner one by one and determine who will be released. But Israeli Cabinet Secretary Danny Naveh said Friday such a proposal wa unacceptable. Israel ha not been offered such a compromise and there will not be such a compromise, Naveh said. On Friday, about 2,000 supporter of the Islamic militant Hamas movement marched through the West Bank town of Nablus to press for the release or prisoner. We want prisoner, not Clinton, the crowd chanted. At Jerusalem's Al Aqsa Mosque, Islam's third holiest site, the prayer leader, Yousef Abu Sneineh, spoke out sharply against the U.S.-brokered peace agreement. America support a peace agreement that further reinforces the Israeli occupation of the Palestinian land, he said. Less than a week before US. President Bill Clinton is to arrive for a visit meant to bolster a new Israeli-Palestinian peace accord, the two side exchanged angry accusation Sunday over Jewish settlement and street clash. Ahmed Qureia, speaker of the Palestinian parliament, warned of possible violence if Israel continues to expand settlement in the West Bank and Gaza Strip, where the Palestinians hope to establish a state. If settlement activity continues, then all mean of resistance are open, Qureia, who is also known a Abu Ala, told reporter in the West Bank town of Ramallah. Since the signing of a land-for-security accord, Jewish settler have accelerated the establishment of makeshift community on West Bank hilltop, in an explicit bid to keep the land from being turned over to the Palestinians. Meanwhile, at a meeting of the Israeli Cabinet, minister expressed dismay over an outbreak of street clash between Palestinian demonstrator and Israeli troop in the West Bank. The Palestinians have been asked to immediately stop the violence and incitement to violence, the Cabinet said in a statement. At least two Palestinians were injured Sunday in a confrontation outside the Jewish settlement of Ariel in the northern West Bank. Demonstrators threw stone at Israeli troop, who responded with rubber bullet and tear gas. A day earlier, 27 Palestinians and three Israeli soldier were injured in similar clash throughout the West Bank. And three day before that, Israelis were horrified by television footage of an Israeli soldier being dragged from a car and beaten with chunk of concrete by a Palestinian mob. Israel say Yasser Arafat's Palestinian Authority is orchestrating the street fighting. The Palestinians deny that. The past week's protest grew out of an increasingly bitter dispute over Palestinian prisoner held by Israel. Israel last month freed 250 of 750 prisoner it is to release under the Wye accord, but most were criminal. The Palestinians are demanding that so-called security prisoner those being held for anti-Israel activity be released instead. Also Sunday, another quarrel wa brewing over the scheduled meeting of the Palestinian National Council, the Palestinian parliament-in-exile, in the Gaza Strip during Clinton's visit. At the gathering, the PNC and other Palestinians in attendance are to reaffirm the nullification of clause in their national charter that call for Israel's destruction. Israel ha demanded that the Palestinians hold an actual vote at the meeting rather than simply proclaiming the charter changed, but the Palestinians on Sunday repeated their objection to that. They haven't the right to give u instruction, Arafat said Sunday a he returned to Gaza following a trip to Europe. Clinton's visit to Israel and the Palestinian land, which is to begin Saturday, is meant to provide impetus to the U.S.-brokered peace accord and encourage both side to stick to a timetable for compliance. But some commentator suggested the visit wa proving a polarizing force instead. He is coming to promote the peace process. but his visit's only actual result is a sharpening of the difference, Yosef Lapid wrote in Sunday's edition of the Maariv newspaper. In Israel, increasing concern is being voiced over Clinton's planned visit to Gaza, the first ever by a sitting US. president. At Sunday's Israeli Cabinet meeting, a shouting match broke out over the issue, according to Israel radio. Who invited President Clinton to the Gaza Strip? Silvan Shalom, the science minister, reportedly yelled at Netanyahu. Netanyahu said it had been Clinton's idea, not his. The United States ha repeatedly said the visit is not intended a an endorsement of Palestinian statehood, but the Palestinians see it a a powerful boost to their sovereignty hope. Arafat adviser Ahmed Tibi said on Israeli television that the invitation for a Clinton visit came from Israel and wa warmly welcomed by the Palestinians. Benjamin Netanyahu's refusal to move the peace process forward, which ha frustrated President Bill Clinton and angered the Palestinians, may not be enough to save his government from collapse next week. Netanyahu on Wednesday briefed his Cabinet on Clinton's three-day visit and affirmed what he told the president a day earlier that he would not withdraw troop in the West Bank on Friday, a stipulated by the Wye River peace accord. Clinton had hoped, 3rd graf pvs President Clinton will travel to Gaza next month to address Palestinian leader, the White House said Friday. He is to speak at what the Palestinians are describing a a historic meeting to formally revoke anti-Israel clause in the 1964 Palestinian charter. Israel demanded revocation of the clause at U.S.-brokered negotiation last month that led to the latest land-for-peace deal between Israel and the Palestinians. As part of that settlement, reached at Wye, Md., Clinton agreed to travel to territory controlled by the Palestinian Authority to speak at the meeting of the Palestinian National Council, the de facto parliament. According to a schedule released Friday by the White House, Clinton will visit Gaza, the West Bank and Israel during a four-day trip that will begin on Dec. 12. He is to meet with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel and Yasser Arafat, the Palestinian leader, before returning to Washington on Dec. 15. Clinton administration official said the White House had not yet decided whether Clinton would fly to the newly opened Gaza International Airport aboard Air Force One, given the symbolism of the president's jet landing on Palestinian soil with the trapping of a state visit. Officials said the White House wa fearful of upsetting Israeli leader who are worried that the president's planned visit to Gaza appears to be a step toward American recognition of a Palestinian state. The White House said the president would speak to the Israeli and Palestinian people about the importance of the Wye agreement and the need to continue to support the Middle East peace process. The meeting in Gaza on Dec. 14 is bound to be contentious, given that many prominent Palestinians have charged that the Wye agreement allows the Israeli government to backtrack on promise made to the Palestinians in their 1994 peace settlement. The Palestinians have insisted that they have already revoked clause in the 1964 charter that called for Israel's destruction. In January, Arafat wrote to the White House, listing the anti-Israel provision that he said had been annulled. But the letter did not satisfy the Israelis. And during the talk in Maryland last month, Arafat agreed to call a meeting of the national council to reaffirm the decision to revoke the clause. In order to guarantee passage of a motion to annul the provision, Arafat is being allowed under an agreement with the Israelis and the United States to pack the council meeting in Gaza with his loyalist, and to conduct the vote by a show of hand instead of a ballot. During a recent interview with Israeli television, Clinton brushed aside concern that his visit to Gaza might be seen a a step toward US. recognition of a Palestinian state. That is not what I'm doing in going there, he said. I have tried strictly to adhere to the position of the United States that we would not take a position on any final status issue. He said he wa traveling to Gaza at the recommendation of, among others, Netanyahu. The prime minister wanted me to go there and wanted u all to make this pitch, he said, adding that he would ask the Palestinian National Council to support the peace and to renounce the idea of animosity toward and opposition to the existence of the state of Israel, and instead embrace the path not only of peace but of cooperation. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Sunday accused Yasser Arafat of making a farce of the Wye River accord and said he would not agree to further troop withdrawal until a halt to anti-Israel violence. Netanyahu, in an interview with The Associated Press, said the Palestinians were emboldened to foment street riot and threaten to declare statehood because they believed they had the Clinton administration in their back pocket. The Palestinians are making a farce out of the Wye River accord. They think they have the United States in their back pocket, said the Israeli leader. As long a that is the case, they will not change their behavior. Netanyahu said he did not believe the United States wa siding with the Palestinians, but his sharply worded remark sent a strong signal that he would like President Bill Clinton to intervene and lower Palestinian expectation prior to his Dec. 12-15 trip. Palestinians claim it is Israel that ha violated the summit agreement reached in October by not freeing jailed political activist, by confiscating West Bank land for road and allowing Jewish settler to seize hilltop for expansion. Ahmed Qureia, speaker of the Palestinian Legislative Council and the head of the peace team that negotiated the Oslo accord, told reporter Sunday all mean of resistance wa justified in opposing settler activity. Netanyahu, who rejected claim of settlement expansion a bunk, wa interviewed in the Cabinet room after a meeting of his unruly coalition government, which rallied behind Netanyahu on his tough stance. But official said Science Minister Silvan Shalom attacked him for being too generous to the Palestinians by agreeing to the Clinton visit next week to Gaza and the West Bank. We are not going to give up territory when there are violation of the agreement and attempt to get thing that weren't achieved at Wye using violence, Netanyahu said. Israel ha threatened to scrap the next Israeli troop pullback, which is scheduled for Dec. 18, three day after Clinton's departure. The United States ha said it should go ahead a scheduled. Palestinians see the Clinton trip a implicit recognition of their struggle for statehood, even though Clinton ha specifically said in an interview aired on Israel's Channel 2 television that it should not be read that way. Netanyahu made clear that he would be annoyed if Air Force One landed at the newly opened Palestinian airport in Gaza, which aide said would be viewed a a strong symbol of support for Palestinian demand for sovereignty. We will be very disappointed if that is the case. We've said to the United States that we don't think that is necessary, Netanyahu said of report that Clinton's plane would land in Gaza. He said traveling by motorcade would be quicker and more politically considerate. Unless somebody want to put a thumb in our eye, I think there are better way to travel, Netanyahu said. In the interview, Netanyahu stressed that he opposed Palestinian statehood and demanded that Arafat stop threatening to declare independence on May 4, 1999, when the Palestinians maintain the Oslo accord expire. What must be is that Yasser Arafat retracts this open and incipient violation of the Oslo and Wye River accord and recommits himself to negotiating until we get white smoke, until we get a solution. That's the only way we'll get a real peace between Israel and the Palestinians, Netanyahu said. In a conciliatory speech in Sweden over the weekend, Arafat stressed that he sought a negotiated settlement and did not mention May 4 a a deadline. He also said any Palestinian state would not make alliance with state hostile to Israel one of Netanyahu's key concern. The Israeli leader is also demanding that Arafat drop claim that Netanyahu promised at Wye to release 750 Palestinians jailed for anti-Israel attack that resulted in bloodshed, rather than freeing car thief and petty criminal. Each side ha a different interpretation of the understanding regarding the prisoner. Netanyahu maintains he never agreed to free those with blood on their hand. It's high time that Yasser Arafat admits this wa agreed upon and that he's not going to make demand on Israel, including the incitement of violence,...on a trumped-up charge, he said. Israel never promised to release murder at Wye, and it won't release them. The issue ha been the focal point for a new wave of violent protest and demonstration in the West Bank and a hunger strike that began Saturday by the 1,700 Palestinian inmate. Israel is also upset by statement that the nearly 600-member Palestinian National Council will not reaffirm in a vote that anti-Israel clause in the Palestinian charter have been deleted. Netanyahu maintained that only 25 member out of hundred who live abroad had been invited so far. Netanyahu quoted Clinton a telling him that the purpose of his visit wa to personally make sure that they actually rescind this charter that call for Israel's destruction. Keeping a promise to Israel and the United States, Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat on Thursday convened senior official and legislator to revoke clause of the PLO founding charter calling for Israel's destruction. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, meanwhile, said he ha ordered the Israeli army to deal with Palestinian riot with a firm hand. He added that he would not go ahead with a West Bank troop pullback, a promised under the Wye River peace agreement, unless Arafat met a list of demand. The West Bank ha been swept by stone-throwing protest in recent day, and thousand of Palestinians marched Thursday in the funeral procession of a 17-year-old stone mason, Jihad Iyad, who wa killed by Israeli army gunfire a day earlier. The violence raised concern that US. President Bill Clinton's visit to the region, which is to start late Saturday, is fomenting more unrest rather than calming the already tense situation. Israeli hard-liners, including Cabinet minister, have said Clinton's visit is conferring statehood status on the Palestinian area. On Thursday, sign reading Clinton go home were strung along the Tel Aviv-Jerusalem highway and on wall in Jerusalem. The most problematic moment of the Clinton visit will be his address Monday to the Palestine National Council, the Palestinians' parliament-in-exile, and other Palestinian group, in Gaza City. Under the Wye agreement, the PNC is to reaffirm during this session an Arafat letter to Clinton which declares clause of the PLO founding charter calling for Israel's destruction revoked. Israel insists a vote be taken by a show of hand, while the Palestinians say only approval by acclamation is required. Netanyahu said Thursday he will not settle for anything le than a vote, even if Clinton declares the PNC session a success without it. It is Israel which determines issue connected with it future, Netanyahu said when asked by Israel radio whether he would be ready to enter a showdown with Clinton over the issue. It is unlikely the US. president would side with Israel in such a dispute because it would mean that the main purpose of his visit, to usher in the next stage of the Wye agreement, had failed. Immediately after the PNC session, Israel is to transfer five percent of the West Bank from it sole control to joint jurisdiction. Netanyahu said last week he wa freezing the pullback over what he claimed were systematic Palestinian violation of the peace accord. He reiterated Thursday that he would not change his decision unless Arafat publicly dropped plan to unilaterally declare a Palestinian state in May. The prime minister's critic have said he is seizing excuse after excuse to walk away from the agreement because he face a very real threat from hard-liners in his coalition to bring down the government in the event of another troop withdrawal. The Palestinians, meanwhile, pressed ahead with implementing the accord. On Thursday, 98 member of the 124-member Palestinian Central Council met at Arafat's seaside headquarters to hold a vote on whether to approve the Arafat letter concerning the PLO charter. The meeting is an interim step, ahead of Monday's PNC session, and is stipulated by the Wye agreement. A simple majority of 63 member is required, and a vote wa expected by Thursday evening. The council ha not met for year and wa revived specifically for Thursday's vote. It consists of PNC delegate, member of the Palestinian legislative council and the PLO Executive Committee, among others. In an atmosphere of political tension, US. President Clinton met Sunday with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in a bid to put the troubled Wye River peace accord back on track. After getting together for breakfast in Clinton's hotel suite, the two leader met at Netanyahu's office and planned to talk to reporter later. The president wa sure to be asked about the impeachment drama unfolding in Washington. At a late-night arrival ceremony for Clinton Saturday, Netanyahu said he hoped the president's visit would contribute to true peace. Again, the Israeli leader accused the Palestinians of ignoring commitment in peace accord. Clinton is to meet with Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat on Monday in the Gaza Strip. Thousands of police were deployed throughout Israel during the Clinton visit. At the hotel where Clinton is staying, 500 policeman were posted to guard the president and his 600-member delegation. Clinton's wife, Hillary, and their daughter, Chelsea, set out on their own schedule. Mrs. Clinton toured a school in a cooperative village of Jews and Palestinians, while Chelsea visited Jerusalem's Western Wall, Judaism's holiest site. Israeli Foreign Minister Ariel Sharon told reporter during a picture-taking session with Secretary of State Madeleine Albright that Israel ha not left the Wye River agreement. We will not give up on the land-for-security accord, Sharon said. But, he added, it should be based on mutual reciprocity. About two hour before Air Force One landed Saturday night, the House Judiciary Committee approved a fourth article of impeachment against Clinton. The full House will vote on the impeachment article next week. Israeli government spokesman Moshe Fogel wa asked Sunday if the success of Clinton's visit would turn on the question of revoking the Palestinian Liberation Organization's founding charter. President Clinton played a very important role in the Wye Memorandum and it success, and I think that it's going to be very, very important that this visit show u at least a readiness on the part of the Palestinian Authority to move forward in peace, Fogel said. There wa no letup in violence Sunday. Palestinian stone thrower clashed with Israeli troop and an Israeli high school student wa stabbed and wounded by a Palestinian teen-ager. In his remark at Clinton's airport arrival Saturday night, Netanyahu said the peace process is in danger. Mr. President, Netanyahu said, speaking in Hebrew, The truth ha to be told. In recent week the Palestinians again constantly, systematically and intentionally violated all their commitment. We are not entitled, not able and not prepared to forgo fulfillment of those commitment. Netanyahu, who is facing political turmoil in his hard-line coalition government, said he could not accept a phony peace on paper which is not honored in practice. Since Clinton presided over it signing in Washington in October, the land-for-security agreement ha hit one snag after another. Israel froze implementation of the accord altogether, accusing Arafat of violating the deal and inciting violent street protest. Clinton said the United States share Israel's concern about security. Peace is not simply an option among many but the only choice that can avert still more year of bloodshed, apprehension and sorrow, he said. That is why I'm here. He said both side now must face the challenge of implementing Wye. Both Clinton and Netanyahu have a shaky political future. The Israeli leader is fighting for his political survival a parliament prepares for a no-confidence vote within two week. His coalition began to weaken after he and Arafat signed the Wye River Memorandum Oct. 23 agreeing to turn over 13 percent of West Bank territory to be met by Palestinian security measure. Netanyahu ha said there would be no further troop withdrawal until West Bank rioting and violence end. Israel and the Palestinians are also in bitter disagreement over procedure for revoking passage in the Palestinian charter calling for Israel's destruction and the release of Palestinian prisoner held in Israeli jail for militant or political act against the Jewish state. On Monday, the president is to fly to the Palestinian-run Gaza Strip to be welcomed by Arafat with the trapping of a state visit. Clinton's visit to Gaza and his address to the Palestinian National Council is seen by some a a boost for dream of Palestinian statehood. It implies de facto recognition of a Palestinian state, Ziyad Abu Ziyad, a member of the Palestinian legislative council, said in an interview Sunday. ","Security high for Clinton's visit to Gaza, part of the Wye Accord, as Palestinian leaders revoke a 1964 Israeli destruction clause.Israel claims Air Force One landing in Palestinian is sovereign recognition.It won't withdraw West Bank troops unless Palestinians formally vote to revoke the clause and violence stops.Palestine says Israel violated the Accord by improper prisoner releases, roadbuilding and settlement expansion.It warns of violence and there have been stone-throwing protests.Radical Islam group Hamas denounces the visit and the Accord.Clinton has made ending the long feud a crusade.Both Clinton and Netanyahu's leadership threatened.","Clinton traveled to the mid-East in December in an effort to energize the Wye agreement signed by Israel and Palestine.Problems immediately faced this accord, intended to trade Israeli territory for security.Questions remained on which prisoners should be released and what constituted a vote to revoke a 1964 call to destroy Israel.Jewish settlers continued to take more lands.Violence and demonstrations went on.The Israeli far right was angry.Clinton was facing impeachment hearings.History and hatred were too strong for him to succeed.Netanyahu finally refused to move the peace process forward, but probably still will be voted out of office.","Clinton will visit Israel, Gaza and the West bank Dec. 12-15 as agreed in the Wye River accord.The days preceding his trip are filled with violence, unrest and divisiveness.Hamas denounces Clinton's trip, but makes no threats against him.Netanyahu says Arafat is ""making a farce"" of the Wye accord.The two sides disagree over its terms.The Israelis and Palestinians are troubled by violence, fear and loss.Clinton has impeachment troubles.Extra security is in place wherever Clinton will go.He hopes to salvage the Wye accord.However, Netanyahu continues to withdraw troops from the West Bank as stipulated in the agreement.","Despite concerns it might cause more unrest, President Clinton met in Israel separately with Prime Minister Netanyahu and Yasser Arafat to negotiate Wye Accord agreement terms.Israel is demanding revocation of anti-Israeli clauses in the 1964 Palestinian charter.Palestine is demanding Israel's release of Palestinian prisoners.Both sides are exchanging accusations over Israeli West Bank settlements and anti-Israeli violence.Hamas denounced Clinton's visit but avoided threats.US and Palestinian agents kept the Gaza area secure.In the end, Netanyahu, facing political turmoil, told President Clinton he would not remove his troops from the West Bank."
55,"Premier Romano Prodi battled Tuesday for any vote freed up from a split in a far-left party, but said he will resign if he loses a confidence vote expected later this week. We must respect the will of the voter. If we win the confidence vote, we will go ahead, otherwise we will pas the baton, Prodi told a news conference closing a two-day French-Italian summit in Florence. Prodi's center-left government, Italy's second-longest since World War II, wa threatened with collapse by the defection of it Communist ally. The premier will address Parliament Wednesday, followed perhaps by Friday by the vote of confidence that will determine whether the 2 1/2-year-old, center-left alliance stand or fall. The Communist Refoundation Party provoked the crisis by withdrawing it support over the weekend and saying it would not vote for his deficit-cutting 1999 budget. But the break with Prodi's government divided Refoundation. Armando Cossutta, leader of the moderate wing, resigned a party president Monday, saying the party's hardline stance wa wrong and dangerous. Prodi wa hoping to profit from the break. Politicians have said Prodi is now four vote short of the 316 vote needed for a majority in the Chamber of Deputies, the lower house. The government ha a majority in the Senate even without Refoundation's support. After his meeting with French leader, Prodi warned that the political difficulty threaten the progress the country is making in cleaning up it public finance. Prodi's government ha held together this long in large part because of the widely shared desire to see Italy qualify for the 1999 debut of Europe's common currency, the euro. It qualified earlier this year leaving the disparate ally without so clear a reason to stay together. As it is, Prodi ha outlasted all but Bettino Craxi, who served 3{ year in two back-to-back stint from 1983 to 1987. Prodi's is Italy's 55th government since World War II. Three day after the collapse of Premier Romano Prodi's center-left government, Italy's president began calling in political leader Monday to try to reach a consensus on a new government. Following the talk, which are expected to last several day, President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro could ask Prodi to try again with a new majority. He could also name a new premier, or appoint a government of technocrat. If Scalfaro feel no candidate is capable of mustering a majority, he could call early election. Because the president cannot dissolve Parliament during the last six week of his term, election would have to be scheduled by December. Scalfaro ha named Prodi a caretaker premier for the interim. Prodi's far-left ally, Communist Refoundation, provoked the crisis when it withdrew support for the government over the 1999 deficit-cutting budget, which it said did not do enough to stimulate job creation. Despite help from a breakaway faction of the Communists, who on Sunday formed a new party, Prodi lost Friday's vote of confidence by a single vote. Prodi ha said he won't take the job back unless his new government could stick to the policy of it old one, an unlikely scenario given the divided Parliament. An alternative to Prodi could be Massimo D'Alema, leader of the Democrats of the Left, the largest party in Prodi's coalition. In the case of a so-called technical government, the name of Treasury Minister Carlo Azeglio Ciampi and Foreign Minister Lamberto Dini have been circulated. A government of technician would get Italy through the volatile period of approving the 1999 budget and the launch of the common European currency, the euro, in January 1999. Prodi presided over cost cut that got Italy into the debut of the European Monetary Union, outlasting all but one other post-World War II Italian government in the process. By one vote, Premier Romano Prodi's center-left coalition lost a confidence vote in the Chamber of Deputies Friday, and he went to the presidential palace to resign. President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro must now decide whether to call early election or to ask Prodi or someone else to try to forge a new majority. The vote in the lower chamber of Parliament 313 against the confidence motion brought by the government to 312 in favor. I'm not bitter, Prodi said immediately after his government went down. The swing vote came from Prodi's own coalition, a defecting deputy from Foreign Minister Lamberto Dini's tiny Italian Renewal party. The Communist, 6th graf prv By one vote, a defector from it own rank, Premier Romano Prodi's center-left coalition, Italy's second-longest serving government since World War II, lost a confidence vote Friday in the Chamber of Deputies. Prodi immediately offered his resignation to President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro, who asked him to stay on a caretaker premier while the head of state decides whether to call early election or ask someone else to be premier. The vote, 3rd graf prv Italy's Communists on Sunday voted to withdraw support for Premier Romano Prodi's 2 1-2-year-old coalition, a move expected to trigger the collapse of one of the country's longest-lived postwar government. Prodi had said he would call a confidence vote if the Communists yanked support. The coalition ha a majority without the Communists in the Senate, but ha depended on them for passage of key legislation in the Chamber. MORE Italian politics have long been enlivened by baroque feud and shifting alliance. And that time-honored tradition may have won the embattled government of Prime Minister Romano Prodi a momentary reprieve. A leader of Italy's hard-line Marxist faction, known a the Communist Refounding Party, resigned Monday in protest over his party's decision to reject the government's 1999 budget and imperil Prodi's slender majority in Parliament. Prodi must realize that his majority no longer exists, said Armando Cossuta, chairman of the Communist Refounding Party, a fringe group that broke with mainstream Communists after they overhauled the party following the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991. Nevertheless we should do everything possible, until the last minute, to save this government and avoid this crisis. Cossuta wa clearly unwilling to join the most hard-line wing of his party in withdrawing support from Prodi and risk being branded a having torpedoed the first leftist Italian government in 50 year. But the leader of the Communist Refounding Party in Parliament, Fausto Bertinotti, seems to have no such compunction. On Friday, he told journalist that he wa not worried about forcing new election that could return the right to power. Sometimes you have to take one step back in order to take two step forward, he said with a shrug. Until now, however, the communist rank and file have disagreed with that view. When Bertinotti forced Prodi to offer his resignation last year over proposed budget cut, the rank and file protested, and he wa forced to backpedal. Prodi met Monday with President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro and coalition leader to devise a strategy. He is expected to go to Parliament on Wednesday to open debate on the crisis and seek enough vote for the budget. Without it, the Italian central bank is unlikely to cut it key lending rate, something Italy must do to get in line with Germany and other bigger European neighbor before the introduction Jan. 1 of the single European currency, the euro. But even if he gather enough vote to pas the budget, Prodi could still be left without a majority. After two and a half year in office, his government is the second-longest in the postwar era. But the fragile center-left coalition ha held together mostly because Italians were united for the last two year in an effort to reduce spending, inflation and government borrowing to meet the requirement for membership in the euro plan. Once that goal wa achieved last spring, dissension quickly revived. Prodi's backer are hoping that enough member of the Communist Refounding Party will break rank and follow Cossutta to save the coalition. If not, Prodi is faced with two unappetizing choice. He can resign and seek new election, which carry the risk of bringing the opposition to power. Or he could seek to form a new majority without the Communists by seeking an alliance with the small center-right party of Francesco Cossiga. Cossiga's party came to Prodi's rescue in June, when the hard-line leftist refused to back Prodi on NATO expansion. But Prodi ha repeatedly said he will govern only with the center-left majority that elected him in 1996. Cossiga also suggested to reporter Monday that he would not welcome any invitation to join a coalition led by Prodi. We wouldn't want this majority to get stained like Monica Lewinsky's dress, he said. By only one vote, the center-left prime minister of Italy, Romano Prodi, lost a confidence vote in Parliament Friday and wa toppled from power. The collapse of his government after two and a half year, the second-longest tenure since World War II, suggested that the chronic political instability that marked Italy for decade had sprung back to life. Though obliged to tender his resignation, Prodi will remain in charge a a caretaker prime minister until a new government is formed. He may get a second chance to form a new majority, but even if he doe, negotiation to that end could take day and even week, clouding decision on such urgent issue a the crisis in Kosovo. NATO military planner preparing for possible air strike against Yugoslavia had expected to use key air base in Italy. In his weakened position, Prodi will have difficulty persuading Parliament to approve NATO strike. He will have similar problem passing the 1999 budget, which is necessary before Italy can cut it lending rate, a requirement for joining the single European monetary unit, the euro, on Jan. 1. Immediately after Friday's vote of 313-312, in a tense and at time raucous session, Prodi met with President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro to submit his resignation and discus his option. In the coming day Scalfaro will consult with dozen of other leader to ascertain whether Prodi ha enough lingering support to try to form a new government. If not, the president is expected to turn to another political leader. If no compromise is found, Italy could be plunged into early election. But party of all political stripe may be reluctant to push thing that far, for opinion poll suggest that voter are no more enamored of the center-right opposition party than they are of the governing majority. Prodi, an economist, is admired by his Western ally a a down-to-earth leader who vowed to tame Italy's bloated economy and reckless government borrowing and actually lived up to his pledge. By raising tax, lowering interest rate and reducing the deficit, Italy met the requirement for membership in the euro last spring, a feat that only a year before wa considered impossible by German and French economist. Prodi wa helped by a healthy global economy and a rare consensus among industrialist, labor union and taxpayer, who feared that exclusion from the euro would condemn Italy to Third World status. But his fiscal discipline wa not followed by reform of a political system that is inherently fragile. There are more than 40 party in Italy, and the government's effort to amend the constitution to introduce a two-party system failed. Unless the Italian political system change, Italy is condemned to political instability, said Sergio Romano, a former diplomat and political science professor. The country need stability and credibility, and that will never happen a long a the government is hanging from a thread. In 1996 Prodi won with a patchwork quilt of center-left faction mostly made up of Catholic moderate and leftist. He relied on a fringe Marxist group, the Communist Refounding Party, for a majority in the lower house. And that alliance, fragile from the beginning, finally frayed to the breaking point this week. The hard-line leader of Communist Refounding, Fausto Bertinotti, said his party would vote against the 1999 budget and would also end it 28-month-old pact with the center-left coalition. That position drove the moderate wing of Communist Refounding, worried that a vote against Prodi would open the door to a center-right government, to split away. But the 20-odd deputy who defied Bertinotti were not enough to squeeze Prodi through. I am not bitter, Prodi said moment after his defeat. Even today I received a lot of support. In the end the coup de grace wa delivered by one of his own, a member of the coalition. They have won by the treachery of one single person, Sergio Mattarella, a deputy in Prodi's coalition, angrily told reporter, referring to Silvio Liotta, a member of the Italian Renewal Party. Foreign Minister Lamberto Dini, who head that party, said Liotta would be expelled. Prodi ha often said he would not govern with any other majority than the center-left one that elected him in 1996. But throughout his tenure, he wa forced to seek temporary alliance to push through major policy decision. He struggled to the last to try to keep his original majority intact. On Thursday, in an effort to woo more moderate Communists to his side, the prime minister, a staunch ally of the United States, warned that he would oppose a NATO strike aimed at stopping Serbian violence in Kosovo unless the UN. Security Council approved the attack. Washington maintains that NATO doe not need a new UN. resolution to order a strike. Premier Romano Prodi said Monday he would appeal directly to Parliament to save Italy's second-longest government since World War II, threatened with collapse by the defection of it Communist ally. The address to Parliament wa expected Wednesday, followed perhaps by Friday by the vote of confidence that will determine whether Prodi's 2 1/2-year-old, center-left alliance stand or fall. Prodi's far-left ally, the Communist Refoundation Party, provoked the crisis by withdrawing it support over the weekend and saying it would not vote for his deficit-cutting 1999 budget, which is key to Italy's participation in the European common currency. Prodi ha said he would call a confidence vote if he lost the Communists' support. I've always acted with coherence, Prodi said before a morning meeting with President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro on the crisis. I've never changed strategy and I don't want to do political gymnastics. The break with Prodi's government divided Refoundation. Armando Cossutta, leader of the moderate wing, resigned a party president Monday. He said the party's desertion of Prodi wa wrong and dangerous, but at the same time promised to follow the party line. We are in a very complicated political crisis which could lead to early election, Cossutta told reporter Monday. And with the division in the left, this would mean a victory for the right. If the crisis come to a confidence vote and Prodi loses, he would offer his resignation. Once he doe that, it is up to Scalfaro to decide what to do. He could ask Prodi or someone else to form a new government or he could call election 2 1/2 year early, something most analyst think unlikely. Working in Prodi's favor is the fact that few party think they would stand to gain by early election, including the Communist Refoundation. There wa speculation Prodi would reopen negotiation that would win back the communists' grudging support, a he ha managed to do in the past. Prodi's government ha held together this long in large part because of the widely shared desire to see Italy qualify for participation in the 1999 debut of Europe's common currency, the euro. That happened earlier this year leaving the disparate ally without so clear a reason to stay together. Prodi lead Italy's 55th government since World War II. He ha outlasted all but Bettino Craxi, who served 3{ year in two back-to-back stint from 1983 to 1987. Refoundation is not part of Prodi's center-left coalition, but the government need it 34 vote to muster a majority in the lower house. It ha been a difficult ally from the outset. It broke with Prodi over NATO expansion earlier this year and on sending troop into Albania last year. Prodi wa even forced to resign a year ago after a bitter battle over spending cut linked to the euro. The crisis wa resolved, and Prodi returned to work, after he made steep concession and promised a 35-hour work week. By one vote, Premier Romano Prodi's center-left coalition lost a confidence vote in the Chamber of Deputies Friday, and he went to the presidential palace to resign. President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro must now decide whether to call early election or to ask Prodi or someone else to try to forge a new majority. The vote in the lower chamber of Parliament 313 against the confidence motion brought by the government to 312 in favor. I'm not bitter, Prodi said immediately after his government went down. The swing vote came from Prodi's own coalition, a defecting deputy from Foreign Minister Lamberto Dini's tiny Italian Renewal party. The Communist, 6th graf prv It is autumn in Italy, the bird are going south, and so it seems could the Italian government, a the bond of compromise and political opportunism that bind a small leftist party to the government came undone Sunday. The latest threat to the government of Prime Minister Romano Prodi came after delegate to a two-day conference of the Communist Refounding Party voted to reject the government's proposed 1999 budget, imperiling the future of the center-left coalition. Officials in the prime minister's office said Sunday night that Prodi would meet on Monday with President Oskar Luigi Scalfaro to discus the political turbulence, though not to offer his resignation. If the Communist Refounding's parliamentary deputy abide by the resolution, which passed by a vote of 188-112, it will destabilize Italy's government at a time when the outcome of the recent election in Germany ha already injected a note of uncertainty into the future of European economic and fiscal policy. Mauro Zani, a spokesman for the Democratic Party of the Left, the main party in Prodi's coalition, called the decision by Communist Refounding a misfortune for the entire country. Passage of the budget, he said, is essential to avoid disaster. Prodi's coalition is a loose alliance of the former Communists, known a the Democratic Party of the Left, and Prodi's moderate Catholic-oriented follower. It is supported by Communist Refounding, a fringe group of hard-line leftist who broke with the mainstream Communists after they overhauled the party following the collapse of Communism in Eastern Europe. Despite frequent shock, the alliance ha held since 1996, glued together mainly by the desire to meet the fiscal requirement to allow Italy to adopt the single European currency. As the Jan. 1 date approach for the introduction of the new money, the euro, Italy must cut it key lending rate to bring them in line with those of bigger European neighbor, like Germany. A rate cut by the Italian central bank is generally thought to hinge on passage of the budget bill. If the bill is not passed, negative signal would be sent to global financial market that are already upset because of the financial crisis in Asia, Russia and Latin America. On Sunday, Prodi's backer were still hoping that a sufficient number of Communist Refounding deputy would break rank and back the budget when it come up for a vote in Parliament later this week. If that fails, a centrist group that rescued Prodi in June under similar circumstance and that is led by former President Francesco Cossiga announced it would support the budget, thus at least assuring parliamentary passage. Communist Refounding and it mercurial leader, Fausto Bertinotti, have pushed Prodi to the brink twice before. The party forced him to offer his resignation last year over proposed budget cut, but then backpeddled after the party's rank and file protested. In June, the hard-line leftist again refused to follow the prime minister, that time in a Parliament vote for NATO expansion, but the government muddled through with the help of Cossiga's party. But one of the leader of that centrist group, Clemente Mastella, said Sunday that it would not support the government generally, leaving the future of Prodi's coalition highly uncertain.

56,"The European Union Wednesday condemned the slaying of four foreign hostage in Chechnya and said it would raise the issue with Russia's foreign minister. In a statement, EU Foreign Affairs Commissioner Hans van den Broek condemned in the strongest term the senseless killing of the four hostage. Van den Broek said the EU wa determined to see remaining hostage in Chechnya released unharmed. He planned to discus the killing with Russian Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov, who is in Brussels for talk at NATO. The severed head of the hostage three Britons and a New Zealander were found Tuesday. The men, who were working to restore phone service in the breakaway Russian republic, had been abducted by gunman in October. Assailants have abducted Chechnya's top prosecutor, who wa investigating the killing of four kidnapped foreigner, official said Friday. Mansur Tagirov vanished Thursday evening while returning to Chechnya's capital city Grozny from a small village nearby, news report said. Officials at the prosecutor's office said unidentified attacker seized Tagirov, and authority speculated it wa the work of an armed band seeking the release of one of it member from prison. Tagirov wa investigating the death of four foreigner whose severed head were found Tuesday lined up by a roadside in the breakaway Russian republic. The victim Peter Kennedy, Darren Hickey and Rudolf Petschi of Britain and Stanley Shaw of New Zealand were abducted Oct. 3 by unidentified gunman in Grozny. It wa not clear if there wa any link between Tagirov's abduction and his investigation into the killing of the four men. Meanwhile, Chechen Deputy Prime Minister Turpal Atgeriyev said authority had arrested a man who confessed to kidnapping the four foreigner. The suspect wa identified a Apti Abitayev, the ITAR-Tass news agency said. Chechen security force were searching Friday for additional suspect a well a the body of the four foreigner. Atgeriyev said he did not place any value in a videotape that showed one of the four victim saying he wa spying for Britain. There are certain method that might force a person to confess to any crime, Atgeriyev said. The videotape, shown Thursday by Chechnya's vice president, showed hostage Peter Kennedy claiming that the four men had been sent to Chechnya to listen in on phone conversation in the breakaway republic. Chechen official refused to answer any question about the tape, including where or when it wa filmed and how the government got it. It wa not known if Kennedy spoke under duress. Britain's Embassy in Moscow wa trying to obtain the tape, spokesman Michael Haddock said Friday. Chechen President Aslan Maskhadov will allow British government agent to come to Chechnya to investigate the killing, Atgeriyev said, according to the Interfax news agency. Since Chechnya's two-year independence war with Russia ended in 1996, feuding gang have waged bloody turf war. Hundreds of people have been kidnapped, mostly for ransom. Meanwhile, a Russian soldier taken hostage during the war wa released after a year of effort to free him, ITAR-Tass said Friday. Alexei Novikov wa seized in February 1996. Only a handful of soldier kidnapped during the war are still in captivity. The report gave no detail of his release. Chechen police were searching Wednesday for the body of four kidnapped foreigner who were beheaded during a botched attempt to free them. The death and the ostentatious display of the head by killer prompted neighboring Russian region to close off road into Chechnya, and caused an outpouring of outrage and lament from Russian and foreign official. Chechen President Aslan Maskhadov said Wednesday that one alleged kidnapper had been arrested and authority gleaned enough information to launch a rescue operation for the hostage, three Britons and a New Zealander. But during the rescue attempt the kidnapper panicked and decapitated the captive, Maskhadov said, according to Russian medium report. A concrete criminal group wa identified, an organizer of the abduction wa arrested and an approximate location of the hostage wa determined, Maskhadov said in a statement. The severed head of the four men were found lined up along a highway Tuesday outside Chechnya's capital Grozny, and hundred of Chechen law enforcement officer were searching for the body Wednesday. We will take all necessary step to solve this horrible crime, said Maskhadov, who ha been unable to restore law and order in Chechnya since being elected last year. The victim Britons Peter Kennedy, Darren Hickey, and Rudolf Petschi, and New Zealand's Stanley Shaw were identified by their former bodyguard. They had been abducted by unidentified gunman Oct. 3 in Grozny. He wa just making a career for himself, Hickey's sister Deborah, 21, said Wednesday, fighting back tear. He wa fantastic with electric and all that sort of stuff. The family had expected 26-year-old Hickey to be back at his parents' pub in Thames Ditton, England, by Christmas. Everything wa going right, everyone wa very optimistic that the hostage would be rescued, she told Britain's ITV. The people that have done this to him, they deserve exactly the same back. The men, pickup 9th pvs One of four foreigner beheaded by kidnapper in Chechnya claimed in a videotape shown today that he and his fellow hostage were British spy. The tape wa played by Chechen Vice President Vakha Arsanov at a news conference in Grozny. He refused to answer question about it, including where or when it wa filmed and how or why the government had it. The four men, all wearing heavy beard, looked haggard. One, Peter Kennedy, claimed they had been sent to Chechnya by the British secret service to monitor telephone conversation. Their mission wa to gather information to stop the spread of Islamic extremism in the region, he said in Russian. It wa not known whether he wa speaking under duress. The severed head of the four hostage were found lined up Tuesday along a highway outside Chechnya's capital, Grozny. Chechen security force were still searching today for the body. The government ha said it wa trying to rescue the men at the time of their death, which have outraged Britain and Russia. But it possession of the tape wa likely to increase suspicion of a government link in the frequent kidnapping in Chechnya since it won de facto independence from Russia in a 1994-96 war. Most hostage have been released unharmed, though dozen remain in captivity. Kennedy and his three colleague Darren Hickey and Rudolf Petschi of Britain and Stanley Shaw of New Zealand were employee of Britain's Granger Telecom. They were reportedly setting up a mobile phone network in Chechnya when they were abducted by unidentified gunman Oct. 3 in Grozny. In the tape, Kennedy claimed they were using the equipment to monitor phone call. Asked about the spying allegation, British Ambassador to Russia Andrew Wood said, We don't comment on these thing in general but any reasonable analysis would show we have no wish to spy on Chechen territory. A truck blew up when it drove over a land mine in breakaway Chechnya on Friday, killing two people and injuring two others, a news agency said. In another mine explosion, a tractor driver wa killed Thursday in the republic, the Interfax news agency reported, citing Chechnya's security official. Chechnya's ambulance service said that three to five people are hospitalized every week with injury from mine explosion, Interfax reported. It did not say how many people are killed. Many of the victim are child, who dig the ground to look for ammunition left over from Chechnya's two-year independence war against Moscow. Russia withdrew it troop in 1996. Chechnya considers itself an independent state, although no country, including Russia, ha recognized it independence.

Vincent Cochetel, 37, who headed the regional office of the UN. High Commissioner for Refugees in North Ossetia, wa seized by three masked gunman in the region's capital of Vladikavkaz on Jan. 29. According to the Interfax news agency, Cochetel wa freed early Saturday in an operation conducted by the Russian Interior Ministry and the regional security force of the north Caucasus. He wa flown to Moscow and wa waiting for a special plane to take him to Geneva, Switzerland, NTV television news said. It wa unclear where Cochetel wa held, in the breakaway republic of Chechnya or in North Ossetia. He wa liberated on the border, Alexander Dzasokhov, the president of North Ossetia, told NTV. French President Jacques Chirac spoke to President Boris Yeltsin by telephone and thanked him for Russia's part in freeing Cochetel, the Kremlin press service said. His release came four day after the severed head of four foreign hostage were found in Chechnya when a government rescue attempt apparently went wrong. Chechen security force are still searching for the men's body. Chechnya's top prosecutor, who wa investigating the killing and wa apparently kidnapped Thursday, wa also released Saturday, Interfax said. Mansur Tagirov vanished Thursday evening while returning to Chechnya's capital city Grozny from a small village nearby, news report said. Tagirov wa investigating the death Britons Peter Kennedy, Darren Hickey, and Rudolf Petschi, and Stanley Shaw of New Zealand. They had been abducted by unidentified gunman Oct. 3 in Grozny. Their head were found Tuesday on a highway about 40 kilometer (25 mile) west of Grozny. Since Chechnya's two-year war of independence against Russia ended in 1996, hundred of people have been kidnapped in the breakaway republic and neighboring region by armed gang who are mostly motivated by ransom. Dozens of people are currently held captive. A Russian soldier taken hostage during the war wa released Friday after a year of effort to free him, the ITAR-Tass news agency reported. Alexei Novikov had been seized in February 1996. Only a handful of soldier kidnapped during the war are still in captivity. A French United Nations official who wa kidnapped in southern Russia more than 10 month ago wa set free Saturday and flown to UN. headquarters in Geneva.

Cochetel wa freed about two minute into the predawn operation on the border between the republic of Chechnya and Ingushetia, but a longer firefight broke out between the kidnapper and Russian security force, the Interfax news agency said. Cochetel wa unharmed, but he said three of the kidnapper had been killed. In footage of the operation broadcast by Russia's NTV television station, Cochetel wa shown lying face-down, hand-cuffed, behind a white van.

Speaking briefly, 6th graf pvs Chechen authority found the decapitated head of four kidnapped foreigner Tuesday along a highway near a remote village after a two-month search in the breakaway region in southern Russia. An Associated Press reporter saw the severed head near the village of Assinovskaya, about 40 kilometer (25 mile) west of Grozny, the Chechen capital. He did not see any sign of the body. The head were lined up on a piece of cloth along a main highway across southern Russia, NTV television reported. The head were identified a those of the four abducted foreigner by Umar Makhauri, who had been a bodyguard assigned to the four when they were abducted Oct. 3 by unidentified gunman in Grozny. He said the body had not been found. But Chechen government official at the scene said four body had been found without giving further detail. Chechen President Aslan Maskhadov said in Grozny that the body of four men had been recovered. The hostage Britons Peter Kennedy, Darren Hickey, and Rudolf Petschi, and New Zealand's Stanley Shaw were engineer. They were working for Granger Telecom, a British telephone company, installing 300,000 telephone line across Chechnya. Maskhadov said Chechen official had caught one of the captor Monday and he told police where the hostage were being held. But that information reached the other captor, who decided to kill their captive, the ITAR-Tass news agency quoted Maskhadov a saying. The chief executive of Granger Telecom, Ray Verth, said Tuesday that Chechen authority had mounted a rescue attempt Monday night that went tragically wrong. No other detail were available. He said the company had opened a dialogue with the kidnapper and received confirmation that the hostage were alive a recently a last week. Their murder is an appalling and barbaric act and our thought go out to the family to whom we offer our deepest condolence. We are a small tightly-knit company and everyone here is in a state of shock, Verth said outside company headquarters in Weybridge, south of London, where flag were flying at half-mast. Spokesmen at the British and New Zealand embassy in Moscow said they were checking on report the four men had been killed, but could not comment. The British Foreign Ministry in London said it wa investigating urgently report that body had been found. Chechen acting First Vice Premier Turpal Atgeriyev, who is heading the investigation into the killing, said authority had several suspect in the abduction, but have failed to make any progress, according to the ITAR-Tass news agency. Eamon Hickey, the father of one of the missing men, said he heard the news and wa hoping it would not be confirmed. There is so much rumor and counter-rumor coming from out there that we don't know what to think. Obviously we are hoping and praying that it doe not turn out to be true, he said at his home in England. Chechen authority had been searching for the missing men for the past two month. British official said they had not received any ransom demand for the missing men. Maskhadov said the death of the four men were a major blow to Chechnya and it effort to gain international recognition of it independence. He blamed the rash of abduction in Chechnya to unidentified outside force and their Chechen henchman. I am ready to answer before my people and the whole world for what happened, he wa quoted a saying by the Interfax news agency. Hostage-takings, usually for ransom, have become common in Chechnya since the end of the breakaway republic's two-year war for independence from Russia in 1996. But victim are rarely killed. Since the beginning of 1998, 176 people have been kidnapped in the North Caucasus region of Russia, including dozen of foreigner, and 90 of them released, official have said. Chechen police were searching Wednesday for the body of four kidnapped foreigner who were beheaded during a botched attempt to free them. The death and the ostentatious display of the head by killer prompted neighboring Russian region to close off road into Chechnya, and caused an outpouring of outrage and lament from Russian and foreign official. Chechen President Aslan Maskhadov said Wednesday that one alleged kidnapper had been arrested and authority gleaned enough information to launch a rescue operation for the hostage, three Britons and a New Zealander. But during the rescue attempt the kidnapper panicked and decapitated the captive, Maskhadov said, according to Russian medium report. A concrete criminal group wa identified, an organizer of the abduction wa arrested and an approximate location of the hostage wa determined, Maskhadov said in a statement. The severed head of the four men were found lined up along a highway Tuesday outside Chechnya's capital Grozny, and hundred of Chechen law enforcement officer were searching for the body Wednesday. We will take all necessary step to solve this horrible crime, said Maskhadov, who ha been unable to restore law and order in Chechnya since being elected last year. The victim Britons Peter Kennedy, Darren Hickey, and Rudolf Petschi, and New Zealand's Stanley Shaw were identified by their former bodyguard. They had been abducted by unidentified gunman Oct. 3 in Grozny. He wa just making a career for himself, Hickey's sister Deborah, 21, said Wednesday, fighting back tear. He wa fantastic with electric and all that sort of stuff. The family had expected 26-year-old Hickey to be back at his parents' pub in Thames Ditton, England, by Christmas. Everything wa going right, everyone wa very optimistic that the hostage would be rescued, she told Britain's ITV. The people that have done this to him, they deserve exactly the same back. The men, pickup 9th pvs A French United Nations official kidnapped in southern Russia more than 10 month ago ha been freed and wa flown to Moscow Saturday, news report reported. Vincent Cochetel, 37, who headed the regional office of the UN. High Commissioner for Refugees in North Ossetia, wa seized by three masked gunman in the region's capital of Vladikavkaz on Jan. 29. According to the Interfax news agency, Cochetel wa freed early Saturday in an operation conducted by the Russian Interior Ministry and the regional security force of the north Caucasus.

It wa unclear where Cochetel wa held, in the breakaway republic of Chechnya or in North Ossetia. He wa liberated on the border, Alexander Dzasokhov, the president of North Ossetia, told NTV. French President Jacques Chirac spoke to President Boris Yeltsin by telephone and thanked him for Russia's part in freeing Cochetel, the Kremlin press service said. His release came four day after the severed head of four foreign hostage were found in Chechnya when a government rescue attempt apparently went wrong. Chechen security force are still searching for the men's body. Chechnya's top prosecutor, who wa investigating the killing and wa apparently kidnapped Thursday, wa also released Saturday, Interfax said.

59,"A liberal lawmaker who planned to run for president in Russia's next election wa shot to death Friday in St. Petersburg, police said. Galina Starovoitova, a member of the lower house of Russia's parliament from the reformist party Democratic Russia, wa attacked the entry way of an apartment building, police said. A neighbor found the body in a pool of blood late Friday night and called an ambulance, they said. The Interfax news agency said her aide, Ruslan Linkov, wa also seriously injured. Starovoitova, 52, tried to run for president in the 1996 election but her registration wa turned down for technical reason. She had said she would run again in 2000. She served a President Boris Yeltsin's aide on ethnic issue and wa on the human right committee of the USSR's Supreme Soviet. Born in the Ural Mountains city of Chelyabinsk, Starovoitova wa trained a a psychologist and later received a doctorate in history. She wa divorced and had one son, according to Who's Who in Russia. There have been several attack on prominent figure in St. Petersburg recently. A finance official wa attacked earlier this week, a top banker wa killed last week, and an aide to Russia's parliament speaker wa shot in the head last month. A badly wounded aide to a murdered lawmaker regained consciousness Monday and wa talking to police, who later arrested several suspect in raid around the city, official said. Galina Starovoitova, 52, a leader of the liberal Russia's Democratic Choice party, wa shot dead by unidentified assailant on the stair of her apartment building in St. Petersburg on Friday night. The killing of such a prominent politician ha caused an uproar in Russia and prompted call from all side for a crackdown on the country's growing lawlessness. Scores of business leader and others have been gunned down in recent year in contract killing that are almost never solved. The lawmaker's aide, 27-year-old Ruslan Linkov, wa in a clear mind Monday, testifying to investigator, the ITAR-Tass news agency reported. Special police armed with assault rifle were standing guard at the door of his hospital room. Acting on information from the aide, police carried out raid and rounded up several suspect, official said. There were no further detail. Linkov wa critically wounded in the head during the attack and later rushed to a hospital where he underwent surgery during the weekend. Liberal leader charged without any concrete evidence that Starovoitova's Communist foe in the Duma, the lower house of parliament, were the most likely culprit. Over the weekend, Interior Minister Sergei Stepashin even had to call a news conference to say there wa no evidence that the Communist speaker of the Duma, Gennady Seleznyov, wa involved in the killing. Seleznyov responded in kind on Monday, suggesting that the extremist from democratic organization might have staged the murder in order to win local election set for Dec. 6, the Interfax news agency reported. The speaker also threatened to file a libel suit against a St. Petersburg newspaper, which Starovoitova edited. The newspaper recently accused Seleznyov of setting up an illegal fund to finance a presidential bid and other shady activity. Seleznyov, who ha said he might run for president in 2000, denied the newspaper's allegation on Friday, calling them an outright slander. Starovoitova's murder had all the trait of a contract murder, an increasingly common crime in Russia. Communist leader Gennady Zyuganov on Monday used Starovoitova's killing a an occasion to lambast the government for it inability to contain soaring crime. That's a result of the (government's) catastrophic policy aimed at the destruction of the state and the nation, he said. Starovoitova, of the reformist party Democratic Russia, tried to run for president in 1996 but her registration wa turned down for technical reason. She had said she would run again in 2000. She served a President Boris Yeltsin's aide on ethnic issue in 1991-92 the only woman in his immediate circle and later joined the Russian parliament a one of the most vocal defender of liberal reform. Yeltsin called Starovoitova a comrade and said he would personally monitor the investigation into her killing. Starovoitova remarried earlier this year and had one son and a grandson. She is scheduled to be buried on Tuesday at the Nikolskoye cemetery in St. Petersburg. A liberal lawmaker who planned to run for president in Russia's next election wa shot to death Friday in St. Petersburg, police said. Galina Starovoitova, a member of the lower house of Russia's parliament from the reformist party Democratic Russia, wa attacked the entry way of an apartment building, police said.

Born in the Ural Mountains city of Chelyabinsk, Starovoitova wa trained a a psychologist and later received a doctorate in history. She wa divorced and had one son, according to Who's Who in Russia. There have been several attack on prominent figure in St. Petersburg recently. A finance official wa attacked earlier this week, a top banker wa killed last week, and an aide to Russia's parliament speaker wa shot in the head last month. In modern Russia, the crime wa so common a to be mundane. Two thug, armed with machine pistol and silencer, stalked and killed a powerful figure, then slipped away into the night. Police vowed to catch them and politician expressed outrage. Usually, that would be the end of the story. This time, though, the figure shot wa one of the most prominent and popular woman in Russian politics, a prospective presidential candidate with friend in the highest reach of the Kremlin. As outrage mounted Sunday, it seemed clear that the killing of Galina Starovoitova wa not going to be treated a a routine crime, and some said it might turn out to be a watershed event in Russian politics. This is impossible to tolerate any longer, said Grigory Yavlinsky, the leader of Yabloko, another reform-oriented party. We must stop feeling powerless before the increasingly cheeky scum. We cannot go on living a though everything is running a usual. Starovoitova, a member of parliament and a leader of the liberal Russia's Democratic Choice party, wa walking up the stair of her apartment building in St. Petersburg with a young aide Friday evening. A team of assailant police believe it wa a man and a woman appeared behind them and opened fire. Starovoitova, shot three time in the head, collapsed and died instantly, authority said. The aide, 27-year-old Ruslan Linkov, wa critically wounded, but managed to telephone a news agency reporter before losing consciousness. Police have recovered two gun, and are hoping that Linkov can provide a description of the killer. He had regained consciousness but still could not speak Sunday. Although it wa still not clear who killed Starovoitova or why, the killing had all the earmarkings of a contract hit a remarkably common crime in post-Soviet Russia. Most of the killing involve business deal and the corruption that ha swamped the government and the economy. Until now, the most notorious of the killing wa that of popular television host Vladislav Litsyev, who wa shot outside his Moscow home in 1995. But there have been hundred of others. St. Petersburg ha been especially plagued. Last year, the city's deputy governor wa gunned down on a central St. Petersburg street. In the past two month alone, hitman have claimed the life of a legislative aide, a high-ranking city official and a prominent banker. So deeply ha the toxin infected Russian society that President Boris Yeltsin ordered an investigation last week into report that his Federal Security Service the domestic successor to the KGB had ordered the death of Boris Berezovsky, the nation's most prominent businessman and the head of the Commonwealth of Independent States. There is no indication that anyone attempted to carry out an assassination of Berezovsky. But Yeltsin's order wa the equivalent of US. President Bill Clinton ordering an investigation into whether the FBI wa plotting to kill Microsoft chairman Bill Gates. Yet, a remarkable a that news wa, it ha been vastly overshadowed by the death of Starovoitova. Television news since her death ha carried report of little else. Reaction ha poured in from virtually every important figure in the country, and from surrounding nation. Yeltsin, calling her my comrade, declared that he would personally oversee the investigation into her death. There wa, in much of the reaction to Starovoitova's death, the sense that a line had been crossed. Perhaps it wa because she wa a woman, perhaps because she elicited impassioned support, or perhaps because people are simply fed up. But, in more characteristic fashion, her death also led to a round of political finger-pointing. Colleagues of Starovoitova declared without any apparent evidence that her Communist foe in the Duma, the lower house of parliament, were the most likely culprit in her death. Historian Dmitry Likachyov, one of the nation's most revered and trusted figure, said her killing seemed to signal the outburst of a new Red Terror. By late Saturday, the name-calling had gone so far that Interior Minister Sergei Stepashin called a news conference to say there wa no evidence that the Communist speaker of the Duma, Gennady Seleznyov, wa involved in the killing. Seleznyov went on television to say he wa saddened by her death. But, he added, I would not like the deputy who sat on the same bench with Galina Starovoitova in the State Duma . to turn this into a political show. It is too early to know where the recrimination and political maneuvering will lead. For now, the only thing certain is the Starovoitova ha become the latest in a long line of Russian martyr. A liberal lawmaker who planned to run for president in Russia's next election wa killed Friday in St. Petersburg, a news report said. Galina Starovoitova, a member of the lower house of Russia's parliament from the reformist party Democratic Russia, wa attacked in an apartment building along with her aide, the Interfax news agency reported. It gave no other detail. Starovoitova tried to run for president in the 1996 election but her registration wa turned down for technical reason. She had said she would run again in 2000. There have been several attack on prominent figure in St. Petersburg in recent month. Mourners bearing flower and candle gathered Sunday outside the house on Griboyedova Canal where a Russian legislator, Galina Staravoitova, wa shot to death on Friday night. A key witness, Ruslan Linkov, 27, Mrs. Staravoitova's press aide, wa reported to be regaining consciousness in a heavily guarded hospital ward where he wa taken with gunshot wound to the head and neck. The police say the two were attacked in the stairwell of Mrs. Staravoitova's building by two assailant, one of them a young woman. The attacker reportedly fled through a back entrance to a waiting car. Two gun were found at the scene. Friends and relative say Mrs. Staravoitova, a founder of Russia's democratic movement, had received death threat, but the motive for the killing remains unclear. The choice of the target suggests a well-thought out plan, said Sergei Kozyrev, vice president of the Russian Association of Scientific Societies and a Staravoitova supporter. To kill a woman a woman in politics that ha not happened in Russia since Stalin's time. Setting aside past feud, local democratic group said Sunday that they would unite in coming election to the St. Petersburg city council, combining their force against what they say are criminal who have invaded local politics. At a gathering Sunday night in Moscow, Yegor Gaidar, a former Russian prime minister and a close ally of Mrs. Staravoitova, bitterly rejected suggestion that Russia should adopt extraordinary security measure to stem the rise in political crime. The New York Times said in an editorial on Monday, Nov. 23: The Russian reform movement ha produced few leader with an uncompromising dedication to democracy. Galina Starovoitova wa one, and her murder in St. Petersburg on Friday wa a terrible loss for Russia. In a bleak season of economic collapse and political timidity, the killing can only heighten fear that Russia is slipping into an ugly era of intolerance and political violence. Initial evidence suggests that the killing wa a political assassination. Ms. Starovoitova wa gunned down in the lobby of her apartment building, shot three time in the head, typical of Russian contract killing. She wa a member of the Russian parliament and a recently declared candidate for governor of the region around St. Petersburg. In recent week she had spoken out forcefully against political extremism, denounced the anti-Semitic statement of a Communist parliamentarian and wa campaigning aggressively against financial corruption in the St. Petersburg municipal government. Ms. Starovoitova's activity were fully in character with a career built around principle of liberty, tolerance and the rule of law. She championed democracy and human right long before they became politically acceptable in Moscow, and courageously stood by Boris Yeltsin and other reformer a Russia struggled to find a new political course when the Soviet Union disintegrated. An ethnographer by training, Ms. Starovoitova proved to be a skillful and effective politician. She first gained national attention a decade ago when she set aside her academic work about the ethnic history of Leningrad and ran successfully for a seat in the Soviet parliament from Armenia, a startling victory for a Russian. She later represented St. Petersburg in the Russian legislature. Ms. Starovoitova wa a woman of irrepressible energy and infectious enthusiasm. But her good humor and quick smile belied a steely commitment to combat the corruption and ethnic division that she correctly considered to be the enemy of Russian democracy. The least Yeltsin can do is to hunt down her killer and bring them to trial. That would be the exception in a nation where political violence is rarely prosecuted. Her countryman can honor her memory by following her example. A liberal lawmaker who planned to run for president in Russia's next election wa killed Friday in St. Petersburg, a news report said. Galina Starovoitova, a member of the lower house of Russia's parliament from the reformist party Democratic Russia, wa attacked in an apartment building along with her aide, Ruslan Linkov, the Interfax news agency reported. Linkov wa seriously injured, it said. The report gave no other detail. A police spokesman in St. Petersburg would not comment on the report. Starovoitova, 52, tried to run for president in the 1996 election but her registration wa turned down for technical reason. She had said she would run again in 2000. She served a President Boris Yeltsin's aide on ethnic issue and wa on the human right committee of the USSR's Supreme Soviet. Born in the Ural Mountains city of Chelyabinsk, Starovoitova wa trained a a psychologist and later received a doctorate in history. She wa divorced and had one son, according to Who's Who in Russia. There have been several attack on prominent figure in St. Petersburg recently. A finance official wa attacked earlier this week, a top banker wa killed last week, and an aide to Russia's parliament speaker wa shot in the head last month. Hundreds of people gathered Saturday to mourn the shooting death of one of Russia's most prominent woman, a potential presidential candidate whose killing wa widely considered to be politically motivated. President Boris Yeltsin said he would personally assume control over the investigation into the killing of Galina Starovoitova, who wa gunned down Friday night a she climbed the stair to her apartment. An aide wa also shot and critically wounded. The shooting occurred in a building along St. Petersburg's atmospheric Griboedova Canal, site of another notorious Russian crime the murder that wa the central event in Fyodor Dostoevsky's 19th century masterpiece, Crime and Punishment. Like that fictional crime, which shone a light on social ferment in the St. Petersburg of it day, the death of Starovoitova wa immediately seized upon a a seminal event in the Russia of the late 1990s. It is one of the black page in our modern history, Vladimir Putin, director of the Federal Security Service (FSB) told the Interfax news agency. It doesn't do much to improve our reputation, the reputation of the country a a whole. Starovoitova, 52, wa an outspoken deputy in the lower house of parliament who inspired strong feeling from both her friend and enemy. A leader of the liberal Russia's Democratic Choice party, she wa planning to run for president in 2000. Those close to her speculated about who might have wanted her dead, with some naming various prominent politician a potential culprit. Whose path did she cross? The answer is simple: communist and gangster, said former Deputy Prime Minister Anatoly Chubais. These are the two kind of people in whose way she wa standing. Putin, whose agency is in charge of the investigation, cautioned that there wa still no evidence that her death wa a political assassination. Interior Minister Sergei Stepashin did not speculate about the motive for the crime, but told reporter that it wa being investigated under a criminal code section that cover terrorism. Arriving at the St. Petersburg airport from Moscow, he said: I brought with me a team of experienced investigator. I think we will clear it up soon. Yeltsin sent a telegram to Gennady Seleznyov, chairman of parliament's lower house, the State Duma, promising that the contractor and executor of the murder will be found and severely punished, The president also sent a telegram to Starovoitova's family, in which he called her one of the most vivid figure in Russian politics, who consistently upheld the lofty ideal of freedom and democracy. More than 200 people gathered in St. Petersburg's Palace Square to remember Starovoitova. People hugged quietly a they listened to speech by her fellow politician and friend. The small stage wa adorned with red rose, yellow carnation and photograph of the deputy with various people, including the late Russian physicist and dissident, Andrei Sakharov. We are united today by pain, which is bigger than politics, said Viktor Krivulin, a poet and candidate for the regional legislature. Politics, a I felt during the past night, ha become the art of spitting on the soul. Others at the gathering said they were sure that Starovoitova wa killed by those who disliked her outspoken view. She had too many enemy, said Galina Markelova, an aide to the lawmaker. She said Starovoitova had received many threat in the past. It wa doubtless a political murder, added Vitaly Milonov, the chairman of the Young Christian Democrats. Police said two men followed Starovoitova and her aide, Ruslan Linkov, 27, and shot them on the stair of her building Friday evening. Linkov wa shot twice. He regained consciousness after a five-hour operation at the Military Medical Academy, but remained in critical condition in intensive care. A pistol with a silencer and and automatic rifle were found at the scene, ITAR-Tass said. A funeral is scheduled for Tuesday in the settlement of Gorelovo, near St. Petersburg. A slain Russian lawmaker wa honored Tuesday a a martyr to democratic ideal in a stately funeral service in which anger mingled freely with tear. Afterward, Galina Starovoitova wa to be buried alongside some of Russia's greatest national hero. The stirring tribute to Starovoitova, a feisty liberal whose killing remains a mystery, wa indicative of the depth of national feeling over her death. To stop u, they want to scare u. They will never succeed, former Deputy Prime Minister Anatoly Chubais said at the funeral for Starovoitova. We will fulfill the goal she sacrificed her life for. Hundreds of people, including many of the country's most prominent political figure, packed the grand Marble Hall of St. Petersburg's Ethnography Museum for the funeral. An open casket, cloaked with black ribbon and flanked by a military honor guard, stood at the head of the hall. At the end of the service, mourner passed grimly past it a classical music played. Outside, several thousand more mourner stood in the cold, waiting for the service to end so they could file in and pay their respect. Ordinary people should honor her memory, and make sure this never happens again, said one man, Vadim Olshevsky, the manager of a construction company. But, he added bitterly, There's little hope of that in our country. Among speaker at the service were former Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin and Yuri Yarov, President Boris Yeltsin's first deputy chief of staff, who represented the president at the service. Former Prime Minister Sergei Kiriyenko wa also present. Yeltsin, who ha said he will personally oversee the investigation into Starovoitova's killing, wa in a Moscow hospital, recovering from pneumonia. The shooting in St. Petersburg is a grim lesson for the whole of Russia, Yarov said. Irrespective of real motif for that murder, a crime of this magnitude is a political act, and society should know all the truth about it. One national television channel turned over it daylong programming to funeral coverage and a memorial tribute. Newspapers carried page after page of coverage of her death. Her political party, Russia's Democratic Choice, called on all Russians to turn out their light in her memory for three minute at 8 pm. Tuesday. Starovoitova wa initially going to be buried in a simple cemetery in the St. Petersburg suburb where her family life. But a outrage mounted over her killing, the government announced that she would be interred in the Alexander Nevsky Monastery in the city's center following the funeral at the Ethnography Museum. Among those buried at the Alexander Nevsky Monastery are the composer Peter Tchaikovsky and Modest Mussorgsky and the author Fyodor Dostoevsky. Starovoitova wa shot to death Friday evening a she and an aide scaled the stair to her apartment in St. Petersburg. The aide, 27-year-old Ruslan Linkov, wa seriously wounded, but ha been able to provide some description of the shooting to police. Acting on his information, investigator rounded up several suspect, official said Monday. But a detective later said that investigator had learned nothing serious from Linkov, according to the Interfax news agency, and there were no further detail about whether the suspect were still in custody. Igor Kozhevnikov, head of investigation for the Interior Ministry, told Interfax on Tuesday that he wa confident the case would be solved. It will take time, he said, but added that investigator have tip, they have something to work on. Authorities are acting on the assumption that Starovoitova's death wa a contract hit, a common event in post-Soviet Russia. Russian politician and newspaper have speculated wildly about political motif for the killing, but police have said they have no idea why someone would have wanted her dead.

1001,"The institution exploring apartheid's horror will issue a report that find the African National Congress share blame for human right violation a it struggled to overcome white rule. The 3,500-page report by the Truth and Reconciliation Commission culminates more than two year of nationwide hearing. South African medium released preliminary finding on Monday, three day before it official release on Thursday in Pretoria, the capital. The release of the document is a milestone in South Africa's transformation from white minority rule to democracy. The commission, which ha the power to grant amnesty, wa tasked with promoting reconciliation by laying bare the what and why of apartheid-era atrocity. With the ANC now in power and facing an election in mid-1999, a condemnation by the commission could prove damaging both to it electoral chance and moral standing. There ha been no doubt that the report's overwhelming blame would be laid on white government and their security force during the year under scrutiny, 1960-1994. Indeed, news report Monday said the Truth Commission would declare apartheid a crime against humanity and acknowledge that the ANC and the more radical Pan Africanist Congress were conducting a legitimate struggle against the former apartheid state. But in preliminary finding sent to the party last month, the commission also said the two movement were morally and politically accountable for gross right violation, South African Press Association and South African Broadcasting Corp. said. The preliminary finding said that despite ANC policy against killing civilian, the line between military and civilian target had been blurred, SAPA said. It condemned the planting of landmines in rural area, the execution of enemy agent, torture and mistreatment of ANC member in it exile camp and for killing political opponent. It said the party must accept responsibility for the activity of ANC Women's League president Winnie Madikizela-Mandela, Nelson Mandela's former wife, and her Mandela United Football Club, accused of killing, torture and kidnapping. The commission also said the PAC wa guilty of the death of civilian in it strategy in 1993 to drive white farmer off their land so it could be reclaimed by black. Justice Minister Dullah Omar, meeting journalist in Pretoria, would not comment on the news report about condemnation of the ANC. I do expect various response (to the report). I do not expect everyone to agree. It will lead to healthy debate, he said. He said that if the commissioner recommends prosecution against anyone for abuse, it will be up to the national director of prosecution to decide whether to proceed. The director is appointed by the government. The commission's work is designed to help u establish the rule of law in South Africa, and to establish the principle of accountability, Omar said. The ANC already ha prepared the ground for a negative finding, saying week ago that the commission had warned that harsh judgment were in the offing. The ANC wa nervous enough about the report to request a meeting with commissioner earlier this month. The panel refused, to avoid appearing biased. On Monday, it rejected with contempt suggestion ANC official themselves had leaked the finding. Constand Viljoen, leader of the tiny right-wing Freedom Front, said the ANC had done so to give the commission credibility by making it more even-handed. Publicly, the party ha long defended it action a those committed during a just war. FW. de Klerk, the last apartheid-era president, meanwhile, planned to ask a court to prevent the Truth Commission report from implicating him in covering up state-sponsored terror. Obviously we will comply with the ruling of a court, Omar said, but added he would regret any court-ordered delay. Facing a court challenge, the Truth and Reconciliation Commission said Wednesday that it would withhold, at least temporarily, the part of it final report that implicate South Africa's last apartheid-era president, FW. de Klerk, in illegal act. De Klerk, 62, who helped negotiate the end of South Africa's white supremacist government and shared the 1993 Nobel Peace Prize with President Nelson Mandela for that work, had objected to a finding by the commission that he wa an accessory after the fact in the bombing of the headquarters of a church group and of a labor federation in the 1980s. The chairman of the 17-member panel, Archbishop Desmond Tutu, said that although he took such action with great reluctance, the commission needed time to prepare to fight the legal challenge. He said it would take de Klerk's name out of 3,500-page report to avoid delaying it release Thursday. It upset me deeply, he said in a statement. We have been scrupulously fair to de Klerk, and we reject the contention that we have been engaged in a vendetta against him. De Klerk's challenge wa only part of the storm of criticism prompted by leak about the report in the last few day. Within hour of the commission decision to withdraw it finding on de Klerk, it wa facing the possibility of a new suit this time from the ruling African National Congress. The ANC also want to block the commission finding about it conduct during the liberation struggle. A spokesman for the party, Thabo Masebe, said the party would seek an injunction in the morning before the report is officially handed over to Mandela. While the commission's report is expected to lay overwhelming blame on the former white government for atrocity, it ha also found the ANC responsible for human-rights violation, including the torture and killing of spying suspect, bombing in civilian area and the killing of political enemy, including member of the rival Zulu-based Inkhata Freedom Party. The decision on de Klerk seems certain to damage the commission's credibility. The panel, created a a way of putting South Africa's brutal past to rest without the expense and political divisiveness of trial, ha caused controversy from the start. It ha held more than 160 hearing throughout the country, listening to both victim and to perpetrator seeking amnesty. But many white say the commission is on a witch hunt aiming to humiliate former government official and Afrikaners in general. De Klerk ha once before forced the commission official to court and won an apology from them for calling him a liar. Some political analyst said Wednesday's event would only further the belief that the panel lack impartiality. The withdrawal of the finding can't help but be seen a a lack of certainty on their side, said Sampie Terreblanche, an economist and political analyst at the University of Stellenbosch, who ha supported the commission. Whether we like it or not, the whole report get a knock from this. De Klerk's spokesman, David Steward, said the former president wa very confident that he would win when the case go to trial in March. He is very happy to be in the court now rather than dealing with the Truth Commission, Steward said. The fact that they agreed to withdraw creates the definite impression that they specifically concocted a case to involve Mr. de Klerk in a negative finding. The ANC ha accused the commission of trying to criminalize the liberation struggle. Whatever the effort to besmirch our struggle by denouncing it a a gross violation of human right, the congress said in a statement. The ANC and the million of people who were part of this struggle will always be proud of what they did to insure that, in the process of the destruction of a vile system, they did not themselves resort to vile method of struggle on the basis that the mean justified the end. There are probably few subject that get South Africans more excited than the issue of the Truth Commission and whether it is a worthy cause or a waste of money. The event of the last few day have only added to the debate. For some, like Pal Martins, 34, a former member of the ANC's armed wing, the fact all side of the political spectrum are in an uproar is a good thing. The mere fact that everyone is complaining mean that the Truth Commission ha done it work, he said. But others say that too many question are being raised about the panel's competence. The whole affair is beyond the pale, a mockery of justice, said Roboy Vonholdt, a 56-year-old sheep and ostrich farmer who belief that the commission ha been a theatrical act. We should all turn our back on the past and move forward. We need them and they need u. Let's all make money and let good economic condition prevail. The commission's report is supposed to be a broad and detailed summary of South Africa's human right history, from 1960 to 1994, when election open to all race ended white minority rule. It will parcel out moral condemnation and recommend individual prosecution. While de Klerk wa alone in court Wednesday challenging the commission, Tutu said Wednesday that other threatened legal challenge had led to fewer individual being named a right violator than originally planned. Tutu said that more than 400 people had been notified that they would be implicated to give them a chance to respond. Some 15 successfully argued themselves out of the report or could not be reached and were therefore deleted from the report, he said. The commission is required by law to give advance notification to anyone it intends to implicate in it report. The commission had been expected to say that although de Klerk did not order the bombing, he subsequently came to know that former Law and Order Minister Adriaan Vlok and Police Commissioner Johan van der Merwe had been involved, but failed to report his knowledge to the police. This could open him up to a criminal prosecution. De Klerk ha not applied for amnesty in this matter or any other. de Klerk ha said that when he learned about the bombing, Vlok and Van der Merwe were already in the process of applying for amnesty, and he did not think it wa necessary to report the matter. A panel investigating apartheid-era atrocity said Wednesday it will not implicate the last apartheid president, FW. de Klerk, in human right abuse after he threatened a court challenge. De Klerk said he would sue to block the long-awaited final report of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission, which wa due for release Thursday. The man who helped negotiate the end of apartheid objected to a finding by the commission that he wa an accessory after the fact to bombing in the 1980s of the headquarters of a church group and of a labor federation. Former Archbishop Desmond Tutu, the truth panel's chairman, said the commission needed time to prepare to fight the legal challenge, and would excise de Klerk's name from the report to avoid delaying it release. It upset me deeply, Tutu said. We have been scrupulously fair to Mr. de Klerk and we reject the contention that we have been engaged in a vendetta against him. But we must and will respect the court and his right under the constitution. We fought hard for those right and we can be proud in South Africa that Mr. de Klerk now share in them, he said in a statement. All we are doing is postponing dealing with the matter, Tutu later told The Associated Press. The name will eventually appear after all the hoo-ha ha died down. De Klerk, reached in London, said he could not comment before speaking with his lawyer because the matter wa in the court. The commission wa charged with promoting reconciliation by laying bare apartheid's horror. It ha held hearing around the country for more than two year, listening to victim and perpetrator seeking amnesty. The release of the 3,500-page report represents a milestone for South Africa's transformation from white minority rule to democracy. De Klerk's challenge wa only part of the storm of criticism prompted by leak of the report. The African National Congress, the liberation movement that helped defeat apartheid and now run the country, on Tuesday angrily rejected a finding that it too wa guilty of human right violation in it armed struggle. The report will be a broad and detailed summary of South Africa's human right history, from 1960 to 1994, when all-race election ended white minority rule. It will parcel out moral condemnation and recommend individual prosecution. Other threatened legal challenge have led to fewer individual being named a right violator than planned, The Star of Johannesburg reported Wednesday. In commenting on the newspaper report, Tutu said that more than 400 people had been notified they would be implicated to give them a chance to respond. Only 15 successfully argued themselves out of the report, he said. Criminal prosecution for atrocity committed during the war against white rule could drag on for at least six year, a top prosecutor said Monday. Key figure implicated in human right abuse by the Truth and Reconciliation Commission already are under investigation, the official, Jan d'Oliveira, told reporter. They include two unnamed general in the apartheid state's security apparatus, President Nelson Mandela's ex-wife Winnie Madikizela-Mandela and official of the African National Congress, he said. The remark by d'Oliveira, who recently wa appointed a deputy national director of prosecution, were the clearest signal yet that criminal case would be brought against figure accused by the commission of gross human right violation. The commission released it report Oct. 30. It chronicle the human right abuse committed by apartheid government and their operative a well a by the African National Congress and others fighting the racist system. The issue of continuing prosecution is significant. Many feel that dragging on criminal reckoning of the horror of the apartheid era will only prolong bitterness and delay reconciliation. But supporter of prosecution feel that denying justice to the victim is a worse evil. On a practical level, highly public prosecution of ANC figure could have an impact on national election next year, when the party will seek to consolidate it hold on power. The panel's chairman, Archbishop Desmond Tutu, ha called for a two-year time limit on prosecutions; d'Oliveira called the period wholly impractical. The prosecutor did not name the other target. We have always worked on the principle of that we will prosecute the highest rank, he said. The commission ha the ability to grant amnesty to those who admit their misdeed and are found to have acted with political motif. The report said individual who have not sought amnesty should be prosecuted. Madikizela-Mandela ha not sought amnesty. The commission found her accountable for human right violation committed by her bodyguard, who the report said killed and tortured suspected opponent. Madikizela-Mandela wa convicted in 1991 of kidnapping and being an accessory to an assault on four young men. She wa sentenced to six year in jail, but paid a dlrs 3,200 fine on appeal. The ANC official wa among the most prominent anti-apartheid activist. The two general were implicated during Truth Commission testimony. Prosecutors are ready to move forward pending the amnesty application of one. Torturers and bomber who carried out atrocity defending or fighting apartheid need counseling to ensure they do not repeat their crime, an expert for South Africa's reconciliation body said Thursday. Addressing local and international expert, Charles Villa-Vicencio, research head of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission, said ignoring the psychological need of those who carried out human right abuse could alienate a potentially dangerous sector of society. We must give attention to the healing of perpetrator, not just for the sake of perpetrator, but for the sake of the nation a a whole, he said. The conference, organized by the Medical Research Council, is examining mental health issue raised by the Truth Commission, which is charged with probing crime committed by all side in the anti-apartheid struggle. As the commission prepares to hand over it final report at the end of the month, South Africans are examining it painful and traumatic exploration of their bloody past. With the power to grant amnesty to many who tortured, bombed or maimed innocent civilian, the process ha at some stage angered people in nearly all walk of life. Many white see the panel a favoring the black liberation movement, while many black accuse it of being too soft on former state official, especially top ranking minister. However, Villa-Vicencio appealed for tolerance in dealing with all those who have committed crime, saying that the potential for wrongdoing existed in everyone. We all, the entire human race, carry with u the capacity for evil, he said. Many of Thursday's speaker touched on the figure of police death squad leader Eugene de Kock, who wa given jail term totaling more than 200 year after a killing spree that cost dozen of life. De Kock ha applied for amnesty for his crime. Dan Stein, a specialist in neurobiology and stress disorder, said de Kock typified many killer from all side in the conflict by his sheer banality of evil. Many people have found him in interview to be an ordinary, even likeable person, he said about the man whom subordinate dubbed Prime Evil. Ginn Fourie, a physiotherapist whose student daughter wa gunned down by black activist in a 1993 attack on a Cape Town bar, said it wa necessary to help those whose circumstance compelled them to do wrong. Struggling to control her tear, Fourie told delegate she had attended the amnesty hearing of her daughter's killer and supported their successful bid to be freed from long jail sentence. After describing how she hugged the three member of the black nationalist Pan-Africanist Congress and urged them to seek counseling together with their victim, Fourie earned a standing ovation from the 50-strong audience. We must take the initiative in understanding others and start the process of reconciliation and healing our broken land, she said, her voice shaking with emotion. The New York Times said in an editorial on Sunday, Nov. 1: The 3,500-page report of the South African Truth and Reconciliation Commission, released on Thursday, is the most comprehensive and unsparing examination of a nation's ugly past that any such commission ha yet produced. Drawing from the commission's own investigation and the testimony of hundred of applicant for amnesty and 20,000 victim, the report is a detailed look at the crime of the apartheid era, and blame successive white government for the vast majority. It ha fulfilled it mandate of telling the fullest truth possible, which is one reason that every political party in South Africa ha denounced it. Besides accusing the government of assassination and bombing, the report criticizes the Inkatha Freedom Party for it massacre and collaboration with security force, and blame the African National Congress for the murder of civilian and other crime. It single out former President PW. Botha, Chief Mangosuthu Buthelezi, the Inkatha leader, and Winnie Mandela, among others, for detailed treatment of their role in political crime. One major flaw in the report is the absence of a section accusing FW. de Klerk, the last apartheid president, of knowing about several bombing after the fact and keeping silent. It wa excised because de Klerk is suing the commission. The ANC also sued, unsuccessfully, to stop publication. The lawsuit are a disappointing sign that South Africa's political party are not interested in an honest look at their past, nor in the free flow of information. The controversy ha added to widespread complaint that the commission ha not helped the process of reconciliation. This is wrong. True reconciliation which occurs when a society is no longer paralyzed by the past and people can work and live together cannot be based on silence. No society can be restored to health by papering over a much pain a South Africans have suffered. A noisy and informed debate about complicity in the crime of the apartheid era is necessary, if uncomfortable. The report is only part of the Truth Commission's contribution to the healing process. The hearing themselves, which allowed victim of human right violation to tell their story in public, helped the country heal and opened the eye of many white to the unpleasant truth about apartheid. The amnesty process, while permitting many important criminal to escape justice, is allowing family to know exactly what happened to their loved one in dozen of case that would likely have never gone to trial in South Africa's fragile judicial system. The process of helping the victim with scholarship and other necessary aid go on, although it will not be enough. No commission can transform a society a twisted a South Africa's wa. But the Truth Commission is the best effort the world ha seen, and South Africa is the better for it. The deal that South Africa's Truth and Reconciliation Commission offered wa simple enough: Confess your crime, apply for amnesty and you will go free. If you don't come forward, you will be prosecuted. After more than two year of hearing into apartheid-era atrocity, the commission last week unveiled a 3,500-page report naming dozen of people it belief were up to their elbow in the gore but never applied for amnesty. So the prosecution should begin soon, right? Not so fast. The study wa barely in the hand of President Nelson Mandela before talk of new amnesty deal had begun. It seems that nearly all of South Africa's political party including the ruling African National Congress have key official who could end up in the dock because of the report. Suddenly, there is lot of talk about how the country can't withstand a round of politically divisive trial, and many political analyst here are betting that an agreement of mutual benefit is in the offing. Already, three major political party are calling for some kind of new amnesty, and the ANC isn't closing the door. ANC spokesman Thabo Masebe said it wa premature to talk of a general amnesty, but he acknowledged that the party wa discussing an amnesty specifically tailored to violence by black South Africans against other black that littered the KwaZulu/Natal province with body during the late '80s and into the '90s. In choosing a truth commission rather than a Nuremberg-style trial with which to close out it brutal past, South Africa hoped for an idealistic reconciliation. People would come clean and receive true forgiveness. Society would then be able to move on, it wound cleansed and healed. It wa a model watched closely around the world by other society wondering how to disentangle themselves from the grudge of a brutal past. But given the chance, hundred of South Africa's perpetrator did not come forward. Commission official themselves say they were frustrated by the lack of cooperation, however exhaustive their report may seem. It is perhaps too late, however, to press for more. Today's South Africa ha urgent new problem to deal with unemployment, crime, white flight, too few school and hospital. So it may wind up settling for a more pragmatic reconciliation one that give amnesty to the unrepentant simply because it's more practical for all concerned to move on. In recent year, truth commission have gained popularity in many place, notably Chile, Argentina and El Salvador. But South Africa's the biggest and most powerful, able to grant amnesty and to subpoena witness wa supposed to be the real test. Certainly the commission forced the nation to see the gruesome detail of it past, a sobbing survivor and stone-faced torturer told of smashed genitals and near suffocation. And the commission's work added much to the knowledge about what happened in South Africa between 1960 and 1994. But it will be year before the effect of the commission can truly be judged. Has anyone really forgiven anyone else? Will vendetta persist? No one can answer. One thing seems clear, however: Four year after South Africa held it first non-racial election, a growing number of South Africans want to be done with the past. Raymond Louw, the publisher of a respected weekly newsletter, Southern Africa Report, say a new amnesty proposal could come up during the February session of Parliament, in time to remove the issue from next year's election campaign. You simply can't have this country torn apart by prosecution, he say. Everybody is going to be howling for an amnesty. They already are. Even a Archbishop Desmond Tutu, the commission's chairman, delivered the report, he seemed to be anticipating a push for a new amnesty and arguing against it. He said such a move would be highly unfair to those who came forward. He suggested instead that there be a two-year time limit, after which anyone not indicted would in effect get amnesty. To be sure, there will be opposition to any proposal to limit prosecution. More than a dozen human right and victim advocacy group have already banded together to condemn such proposal a unconscionable. The idea for a Truth Commission emerged a a compromise from the long negotiation that brought about South Africa's peaceful transition from a white supremacist state to a non-racial democracy. During the talk, the white National Party government pushed for a blanket amnesty, and the ANC refused. In the end, only about 250 former police officer came forward, most of them foot soldier. And only two high National Party official, former Law and Order Minister Adriaan Vlok and Police Commissioner Johan van der Merwe, confessed to role in ordering bombing. In it report, the commission called the apartheid state the primary perpetrator of gross human right violation and held such high ranking former official a former President PW. Botha, his former army chief, Georg Meiring, and the former intelligence chief, Niel Barnard, responsible. These men, and others of lower rank, have not applied for amnesty For the ANC, the most embarrassing prospect is the possible prosecution of Mandela's former wife, Winnie Madikizela-Mandela, who is accused in the report of taking part in a number of assault and abduction. Lesser-known official could face charge too. The ANC is held responsible for at least 76 death in KwaZulu/Natal. The ANC's problem are further complicated by it effort to make peace with the largely Zulu-based Inkatha Freedom Party. Virtually no one from that party came forward to ask for amnesty. Yet the report found that Inkatha, working with the white government, wa responsible for widespread slaughter in KwaZulu/Natal and in the township around Johannesburg. Inkatha's leader, Chief Mangosuthu Buthelezi, and many key party official stand accused of fomenting a wide range of abuse. But prosecuting Chief Buthelezi could lead to new warfare in KwaZulu. Part of the reluctance to go forward with prosecution may be the result of still another factor: The judicial system is already overwhelmed with rising crime and the evidence from the apartheid era is old. So why spend the time and the money? At the moment, only one political party is opposed to any form of new amnesty the tiny but influential Democratic Party, a liberal group that wa not involved in the violence. Its head, Tony Leon, say a new amnesty would only prove that the more thuglike your behavior, the more you get away with. But he concedes that his is a lonely voice. At this point, he say, there is little enthusiasm for anything but closing the book on the past. A panel probing apartheid-era abuse ha accused the African National Congress of human right violation, including torture and bomb attack, the state broadcaster said Monday. The ANC, which led the struggle against white rule and now is in power, previously ha acknowledged it wa told to expect implication in right violation. The Truth and Reconciliation Commission will release it final report on 2 1-2 year of investigation on Thursday. The report wa expected to place overwhelming blame for the era's abuse on white government and their brutal security service. President Nelson Mandela's office received an advance copy on Monday ahead of the handover ceremony, when retired Archbishop Desmond Tutu, who chaired the comission, will present Mandela with the report. South African Broadcasting Corp. radio said it had been leaked a preliminary document which condemns the ANC a politically and morally responsible for gross human right violation during and after the fall of apartheid. An ANC spokesman, Thabo Masebe, said he believed the news report referred to a commission letter sent in advance informing u of it intention to implicate the ANC in gross human right violation. Commission official could not immediately be reached for comment. Justice Minister Dullah Omar told journalist in Pretoria he had heard the news report, but would not comment. Former President FW. de Klerk, meanwhile, plan to ask a court to prevent the Truth Commission report from implicating him in covering up state-sponsored terror. Obviously we will comply with the ruling of a court, Omar said, but added he would regret any court-ordered delay. The ANC wa nervous enough about the report to request a meeting with commissioner earlier this month. The panel refused, to avoid appearing embarrassed. The party say the accusation against it likely would center on the planting of land mine on border farm, abuse at it military camp in Angola and bombing. Omar said he expected the report's conclusion to set off debate but added it would lay the basis for reconciliation. President Nelson Mandela acknowledged Saturday the African National Congress violated human right during apartheid, setting him at odds with his deputy president over a report that ha divided much of South Africa. The disagreement stem from Thursday's release of the report by the Truth and Reconciliation Commission on horror committed during apartheid. Rather than act a a salve and an aid to reconciliation, the report ha caused divisiveness, even among former comrades-in-arms who fought apartheid. As expected, the report called apartheid a crime against humanity. But it also blamed the ANC for gross human right violation during it anti-apartheid struggle, saying the group tortured suspected spy and dissident and killed innocent civilian with land mine and bomb. Some suspected traitor were killed in the ANC's camp abroad. Mbeki who became ANC president last year and will likely be elected South Africa's next president in 1999 when Mandela retires took a hard line Saturday against the report, and indicated all ANC member must do the same. No member, 5th graf, 1st Ld-Writethru Following are excerpt from the final report issued by South Africa's Truth and Reconciliation Commission on Thursday: PRIMARY FINDING On the basis of the evidence available to it, the primary finding of the Commission is that: The predominant portion of gross violation of human right wa committed by the former state through it security and law-enforcement agency. Moreover, the South African state in the period from the late 1970's to early 1990's became involved in activity of a criminal nature when, amongst other thing, it knowingly planned, undertook, condoned and covered up the commission of unlawful act, including the extrajudicial killing of political opponent and others, inside and outside South Africa. In pursuit of these unlawful activity, the state acted in collusion with certain other political grouping, most notably the Inkatha Freedom Party (IFP). . . . Certain member of the State Security Council (the state President, Minister of Defense, Minister of Law and Order, and head of security force) did foresee that the use of word such a take out, wipe out, eradicate, and eliminate would result in the killing of political opponent. They are therefore responsible for deliberate planning which caused gross violation of human right. PW. BOTHA During the period that he presided a head of state (1978-1989) according to submission made to and finding made by the Commission, gross violation of human right and other unlawful act were perpetrated on a wide scale by member of the South African Defense Force, including: The deliberate unlawful killing and attempted killing of person opposed to the policy of the Government, within and outside South Africa. The widespread use of torture and other form of severe ill treatment against such person. The forcible abduction of such person where were resident in neighboring country. Covert logistical and financial assistance to organization opposed to the ideology of the ANC. and other liberation movement. . . . INKATHA The Commission find that in 1986, the South African Defense Forces (S.A.D.F.) conspired with Inkatha to provide the latter with a covert, offensive paramilitary unit (or hit squad) to be deployed illegally against person and organization perceived to be opposed to both the South African Government and Inkatha. The SADF. provided training, financial and logistical management and behind the scene supervision of the trainee, who were trained by the Special Forces unit of the SADF. in the Caprivi Strip. The Commission find furthermore that the deployment of the paramilitary unit in KwaZulu led to gross violation of human right, including killing, attempted killing and severe ill treatment. The Commission find the following people, among others, accountable for such violations: Mr. P. W. Botha, Gen. Magnus Malan, Chief Mangosuthu Buthelezi. . . . The ANC. While it wa ANC. policy that the loss of civilian life should be avoided, there were instance where member of it security force perpetrated gross violation of human right in that the distinction between military and civilian target wa blurred in certain armed action, such a the 1983 Church Street bombing of the South African Air Force headquarters. . . . In the course of the armed struggle, the A.N.C., through it security force, undertook military operation which, though intended for military or security force target, sometimes went awry for a variety of reason, including poor intelligence and reconnaissance. The consequence in these case, such a the Magoo's Bar and Durban Esplanade bombing, were gross violation of human right in respect of the injury to and loss of life of civilian. Individuals who defected to the state and became informer and/or member who became state witness in political trial . . . were often labeled by the ANC. a collaborator and regarded a legitimate target to be killed. The commission doe not condone the legitimization of such individual a military target and find that the extrajudicial killing of such individual constituted gross violation of human right. The commission find that, in the 1980's in particular, a number of gross violation were perpetrated not by direct member of the ANC. or those operating under it formal command, but by civilian who saw themselves a ANC. supporter. In this regard, the Commission find that the ANC. is morally and politically accountable for creating a climate in which such supporter believed their action to be legitimate and carried out within the broad parameter of a people's war a enunciated by the ANC. ANC. CAMPS The Commission find that suspected agent were routinely subjected to torture and other form of severe ill treatment and that there were case of such individual being charged and convicted by tribunal without proper regard to due process, sentenced to death and executed. WINNIE MADIKIZELA-MANDELA The Commission find that Ms. Madikizela-Mandela wa central to the establishment and formation of the Mandela United Football Club, which later developed into a private vigilante unit. It is the Commission's view that Ms. Madikizela-Mandela wa aware of the criminal activity and the disquiet it caused in the community, but chose deliberately not to address the problem emanating from the football club. The Commission find that those who opposed Ms. Madikizela-Mandela and the Mandela United Football Club, or dissented from them, were branded a informer and killed. The Commission find that Ms. Madikizela-Mandela . . . is accountable, politically and morally for the gross violation of human right committed by the Mandela United Football Club. The Commission find further that Mrs. Madikizela-Mandela herself wa responsible for committing such gross violation of human right. . . . BUSINESS Business wa central to the economy that sustained the South African state during the apartheid year. Certain business, especially the mining industry, were involved in helping design and implement apartheid policy. The white agriculture industry benefited from it privileged access to land. ","South Africa's Truth and Reconciliation Commission, appointed to reconcile the sides involved in the crimes of the apartheid era, is releasing its final 2.5- year report.Its purpose is to identify those who committed gross violations of human rights.The report is to lay most of the blame for the violations on the State, but the ANC also shares blame.The program offers amnesty to the accused if they confess but execution if they refuse.The process has angered many people of all walks of life.De Klerk, Apartheid's last president, is not being implicated but he is suing to stop publication.Criminal cases are nonetheless expected to go on for six years.","South Africa's Truth and Reconciliation Commission headed by Desmond Tutu proposes amnesty to heal the wounds of the apartheid era.If those accused of atrocities confess, they will be given amnesty, if not, they will be prosecuted.The Commission's report said most human rights violations were by the former state through security and law enforcement agencies.The African National Congress, Inkatha Freedom Party, and Winnie Mandela's United Football Club also shared guilt.Former president de Klerk, who shared the Nobel Peace Prize with Nelson Mandela, was not named as an accessory after the fact, since his threatened lawsuit would delay the report.","South Africa Truth and Reconciliation Commission's 3,500-page report on apartheid-era atrocities was issued on Oct 30.This report was intended to clear the air, grant amnesty to those who confessed, and begin the healing process.Those named for prosecution were warned before the release.Ex-prime minister de Klerk's name was removed.The ruling African National Congress remained.While the white government bore the brunt of the blame, several black movements were included.After the release many talked of a new amnesty period or a limited time to prosecute.Prosecutions could take 6 years; diverting judges, threatening elections, and slowing recovery.","The Truth and Reconciliation Commission, which was established to look into the human rights violations committed during the long struggle against white rule, released its final report.In what has been described as one of the most complete reports of its kind, the commission blames most of the atrocities on the former South African government.The ANC also came under fire for committing some atrocities during the struggle.Nelson Mandella's ex-wife, Winnie could be prosecuted for the part she played in such violations.Missing from the report was De Klerk, who threatened to sue if he was mentioned in connection with the atrocities."
1008,"As a gay college student lay hospitalized in critical condition after a severe beating here, this small city, which bill itself a Wyoming's hometown, wrestled with it attitude towards gay men. On Saturday, at the University of Wyoming's annual homecoming parade, Pistol Pete and his uniformed brass band were overshadowed by a larger group of marcher 450 people, many wearing yellow armband and carrying sign in support of the 21-year-old student, Matthew Shepard, who suffered severe head injury in the attack last week. Hate is not a Small Town Value No to Violence and Evil, read one sign, a watcher applauded. With passersby spontaneously joining the protest group, two woman held another sign that read, No Hate Crimes in Wyoming. Two candlelight vigil were held Sunday night at church near the campus. At the Poudre Valley Hospital in Fort Collins, Colo., where Shepard's health continued to deteriorate, the hospital ha received so many flower that nurse have started to distribute bouquet to other patient. A vigil at the hospital on Saturday evening drew about 500 people. We live in the Equality State, Shannon Rexroat wrote Friday in a special edition of the Branding Iron, the campus newspaper. Referring to Wyoming's pioneer heritage a the first state to grant woman the right to vote, Ms. Rexroat, the campus newspaper's editor added: That mean nothing to me anymore. We live in a state where a young man wa brutally beaten because he is gay. But others recalled another side of Wyoming's hometown,which ha a population of more than 26,000. Jamie Lewis, another editor, said that on Friday he wa handing out copy of the special edition when a passerby backed away from him and used an anti-gay epithet. Last week's brutal assault bubbled out of an ongoing climate of hostility toward gay men and lesbian, leader of the local Unitarian church said in a letter published Sunday in the city's newspaper, The Laramie Daily Boomerang. This incident wa atypical in it brutality, but not in it underlying motive, wrote Jeffrey Lockwood and Stephen Johnson. Gay people in Laramie, they wrote, are frequently assaulted with derision, intolerance, insult and hostility if not gun and rope. Ric Turley, who dropped out of college here after one year in the 1970s, recalled driving here to see his family for Christmas in 1993 and seeing a vandalized billboard on the main highway. Under a brace of pistol, an advertising appeal for a state history museum had been changed, he said, from Shoot a Day or Two, to Shoot a Gay or Two. Turley, who is gay and said he only came out after he had left Wyoming, said that he immediately complained to the museum. But returning a month later, he found the message had not been erased. After complaining to the museum for a second time, he said he took a can of black spray paint and blotted out the word gay. It wa this kind of complacency and apathy that allowed this to happen, he said of the beating in which two local men have been charged, Russell Henderson and Aaron McKinney. According to the local police and prosecutor, the two men lured Shepard out of a bar by saying they were gay. Then, the Laramie police say, the pair kidnapped Shepard, pistol-whipped him with a .357 Magnum and left him tied to a ranch fence for 18 hour until a passing bicyclist spotted Shepard, who wa unconscious. On Sunday, the Laramie police said that McKinney had been arrested on Thursday at the same hospital in Fort Collins where Shepard wa being treated. McKinney wa being treated for a minor skull fracture unrelated to the fracas with Shepard, said Ben Fritzen, a Laramie police detective. President Clinton ha condemned the attack, saying on Saturday, I wa deeply grieved by the act of violence perpetrated against Matthew Shepard. Clinton urged Congress to pas the federal Hate Crimes Prevention Act, saying, There is nothing more important to the future of this country than our standing together against intolerance, prejudice and violent bigotry. Wyoming is one of 10 state that doe not have a hate crime law. The latest attempt died in the state Legislature in Cheyenne in February. On Saturday, Wyoming's governor, Jim Geringer, said he wa outraged and sickened by the attack. Here in Laramie, McKinney's father, Bill, also condemned the attack. His pickup truck wa apparently used in the kidnapping. But he also complained about the massive attention by the national medium. The national press blew it totally out of proportion because it involved a homosexual, McKinney told The Denver Post. `Had this been a heterosexual these two boy decided to take out and rob, this never would have made the national news. Shepard grew up in Casper until his sophomore year in high school, when his father, an oil rig safety engineer, wa transferred to Saudi Arabia. The young man completed high school at a boarding school in Lugano, Switzerland, where he learned Italian and German. On Saturday, his parent, Dennis and Judy Shepard, released a statement from Fort Collins thanking the American public for their kind thought about Matthew. He is a trusting person who take everybody at face value and he doe not see the bad side of anyone, the Shepards wrote. He ha always strongly felt that all people are the same, regardless of their sexual preference, race or religion. Noting that their son wa born prematurely and that his life ha often been a struggle, they added, He is physically short in stature, but we believe he is a giant when it come to respecting the worth of others. Last Saturday morning, while Matthew Shepard lay comatose from a beating, a college homecoming parade passed a few block from his hospital bed in Fort Collins. Propped on a fraternity float wa a straw-haired scarecrow, labeled in black spray paint: I'm Gay. Few people missed the message. Three day earlier, Shepard, a gay University of Wyoming freshman, wa savagely beaten and tied to a ranch fence in such a position that a passerby first mistook him for a scarecrow. Tuesday, official at Colorado State University reacted with outrage to the fraternity float, opening an investigation and disciplinary procedure against the fraternity, Pi Kappa Alpha. The fraternity chapter immediately suspended seven member and said they had acted independently. But in a week when candlelight vigil for Shepard were being held on campus across the nation, the scarecrow incident highlighted how hostility toward gay people often flourish in high school and university, gay leader said Tuesday. People would like to think that what happened to Matthew wa an exception to the rule but, it wa an extreme version of what happens in our school on a daily basis, said Kevin Jennings, executive director of the Gay, Lesbian and Straight Education Network, a New York group dedicated to ending anti-gay bias in the school. Shepard, a slightly built 21-year-old, died on Monday morning from the injury suffered in the beating. He never regained consciousness after being discovered on the evening of Oct. 7, 18 hour after he wa lashed to the fence. Two men, Russell Henderson, 21, and Aaron McKinney, 22, were arraigned late Monday night on first-degree murder charge. Their girlfriend, Chasity Pasley, 20, and Kristen Price, 18, have been arraigned a accessory after the fact. In response to the killing, about 50 candelight vigil were scheduled this week, from Texas to Vermont, from Wayne, Neb., to New York City. At the Poudre Valley Hospital in Fort Collins where Shepard wa in intensive care for five day, his parent, Dennis and Judy Shepard, received about 6,000 electronic message of condolence. Tuesday, when funeral arrangement were announced for Friday in Casper, Wyo., the hospital Web site received 30,000 hit an hour. Friends at the University of Wyoming in Laramie, Wyo., have set up The Matthew Shepard Memorial Fund to raise money to pressure the state legislature to pas anti-hate crime legislation. I see his name going down in gay history a a catalyst for renewed activism, said Matt Foreman, a former Wyomingite who directs Empire State Pride Agenda, a gay political organization in New York. From around the nation Tuesday, gay leader stressed that campus homophobia is not restricted to college town in the Rocky Mountain West. Last year, in a survey of almost 4,000 Massachusetts high school student, 22 percent of gay respondent said they skipped school in the past month because they felt unsafe at school, and 31 percent said they had been threatened or injured at school in the past year. These percentage were about five time greater than the percentage of heterosexual respondent. The survey wa conducted at 58 high school by the Massachusetts Department of Education. In a separate study of nearly 500 community college student in the San Francisco area, 32 percent of male respondent said they had verbally threatened gay people and 18 percent said they had physically threatened or assaulted gay people. The study wa conducted this year by Karen Franklin, a forensic psychologist who is a researcher at the University of Washington. Surveys of gay college student conducted in the late 1980s at Yale University, Oberlin College, Rutgers University and Penn State found that 16 percent to 26 percent had been threatened with violence, and that 40 percent to 76 percent had been verbally harassed, said the National Gay and Lesbian Task Force, a lobbying group based in Washington. Last year, a student group in Des Moines, Iowa, called Concerned Students, recorded hallway and classroom conversation at five high school on 10 homophobia recording day. They estimated that the average Des Moines high school student hears about 25 anti-gay remark every day. Nine out of 10 `teaching tolerance' course weed out gay, Foreman said. There are a lot of people preaching anti-racism and anti-semitism. But it is still very much OK to make anti-gay joke, to express anti-gay sentiment. In a survey of the nation's 42 largest school district, 76 percent do not train teacher on issue facing gay student, and 42 percent do not have policy to protect student from discrimination based on sexual orientation, said the Gay, Lesbian and Straight Education Network, which conducted the survey last month. In Fort Collins, while hospital official struggled with an electronic avalanche of condolence, city police detective were investigating a different kind of e-mail. On Monday, hour after Shepard's death, two gay organization, the Rainbow Chorus and the Lambda Community Center, received identical message applauding Shepard's murder. The message closed with the words: I hope it happens more often. Matthew Shepard, the gay college student who wa kidnapped and severely beaten, died here Monday, five day after he wa found unconscious on a Wyoming ranch where he had been left tied to a fence for 18 hour in near-freezing temperature. His death, announced at Poudre Valley Hospital here, fanned the outrage that followed word of last week's attack, spawning nationwide vigil, producing a call for federal hate-crimes legislation from President Clinton and fueling debate over such law in a host of Western state, including Wyoming, that have resisted them. From Denver to the University of Maryland, people turned out to honor the The slight, soft-spoken 21-year-old Shepard, a freshman at the University of Wyoming, who became an overnight symbol of anti-gay violence after he wa found dangling from the fence by a passerby. Two men and two woman have been charged in the case. The men were charged with attempted murder and are expected to face first-degree murder charge that could bring the death penalty. There is incredible symbolism about being tied to a fence, said Rebecca Isaacs, political director of the National Gay and Lesbian Task Force in Washington. People have likened it to a scarecrow. But it sounded more like a crucifixion. Gay leader hope and Christian conservative fear that Shepard's death will galvanize Congress and state legislature to pas hate-crime legislation or broaden existing law. Conservatives generally oppose such law because they favor one group's right over another. In the last two decade, 21 state and the District of Columbia have passed law that increase penalty for crime that are committed because of a person's race, religion, color, national origin, and sexual orientation. Another 19 state, including Colorado, do not include sexual orientation in their hate-crime law. Ten state, including Wyoming, have no hate-crime law at all. In Washington, Clinton responded to news of Shepard's death by urging Congress to pas the federal Hate Crimes Protection Act, which would make federal offense of crime based on sex, disability and sexual orientation. Wyoming ha been one of the nation's holdout, rejecting three hate crime bill since 1994, most recently in February. But Monday, after Shepard's death, Gov. Jim Geringer appealed to lawmaker to reconsider their opposition. I ask for a collective suggestion for anti-bias, anti-hate legislation that can be presented to the Wyoming Legislature for their consideration in January, Geringer said. The governor met Monday morning with Dennis Shepard, the slain student's father, and said that the elder Shepard did not want his son's death to become a medium circus and that we should not use Matt to further an agenda. Geringer said that Shepard's father also said: Don't rush into just passing all kind of new hate-crimes law. Be very careful of any change and be sure you're not taking away right of others in the process to race to this. Leaders of gay right group interviewed Monday said they would respect the family's privacy by not attending the burial in Casper, Wyo., on Saturday. But they added that they hoped the death would have an impact on legislator around the nation. Matthew's death, I hope, will bring about a better and deeper understanding of hate crime law, said Elizabeth Birch, executive director of the Human Rights Campaign, a lesbian and gay right group that ha 250,000 member. Matthew's death may lead to an awakening in Wyoming and in the United States Congress a the need for this legislation. In 1996, 21 men and woman were killed in the United States because of their sexual orientation, according to the Southern Poverty Law Center, an Alabama group that track violence against minority. According to the FBI, sexual orientation wa a factor in 11.6 percent of the 8,759 hate crime recorded in 1996. But Christian conservative warn that gay leader want to use Shepard's death to expand hate right law and to curtail freedom of speech. Hate crime law have nothing to do with perpetrator of violent crime and everything to do with silencing political opposition, said Steven Schwalm, an analyst with the Family Research Council, a Washington group dedicated to defending faith, family and freedom. It would criminalize pro-family belief, Schwalm said. This basically sends a message that you can't disagree with the political message of homosexual activist. Agreement came from John Paulk, who wa featured this summer in a series of advertisement about how he and his wife, Anne, overcame homosexuality through religious conversion. We have every right to speak out against an agenda that is contrary to Biblical norm, said Paulk, who describes himself a a homosexuality specialist for Focus on the Family, a Christian group in Colorado Springs, Colo. Because we are standing up and opposing the homosexual agenda, we are being looked upon a advocating violence against homosexual, when we categorically reject violence against homosexual. Last Thursday, the Family Research Council unveiled a series of television advertisement that preach the healing of homosexuality through religious conversion. Gay leader charge that these advertisement help create a hostile climate for homosexual, a climate that can lead to violence. Hate crime law that are on the book in 40 state have not impinged on freedom of speech, said Brian Levin, a criminal justice professor who directs the Center on Hate and Extremism at Stockton College, in Pomona, NJ. Instead, he said, hate crime law send a clear message that society doe not tolerate attack on minority. We want to deter the broken window and simple assault before they escalate, he said. Referring to murder of homosexual, he added: These crime are preventable. Offenders get emboldened if they are not punished the first time. Levin said that his research indicated that homosexual suffered higher rate of violent crime than the population at large. He also said that roughly half of the people who attack homosexual are male, aged 22 or younger. The two men charged in the killing of Shephard are both white, Russell Henderson, 21, and Aaron McKinney, 22. With other crime, violence is a mean to an end. With hate crime, the violence becomes an unstoppable goal, Levin said. Shepard suffered a dozen cut around the head, face and neck, a well a a massive blow to the back of his skull. Because their social stature in society, gay are often viewed a appropriate target, Levin added. Citing the need for hate crime law to send a clear message to gay bashers, Levin said: The discourse in society leaf many of these people to believe that what they are doing is socially acceptable. While some gay leader saw crucifixion imagery in Shepard's death, others saw a different symbolism: the Old West practice of nailing a dead coyote to a ranch fence a a warning to future intruder. This University of Wyoming student wa beaten and left to die, tied to a fence like an animal because he wa honest and open about being gay, Beatrice Dorhn, legal director of the Lambda Legal Defense and Education Fund, said Monday, Matthew Shepard's horrible suffering and death cannot be dismissed simply a the fault of deranged, isolated individual. His attacker are among million of Americans who constantly hear the message that gay people are not worthy of the most basic equal treatment, Ms. Dorhn said. On the same day Americans learned last week that Matthew Shepard, a 5-foot-2, 105-pound gay college student, had been tortured, strung up like an animal and left to die on a fence outside Laramie, Wyo., the Family Research Council wa co-hosting a press conference in Washington. It wa the latest salvo in a six-month campaign by the religious right, with the tacit, even explicit, approval of Republican leader, to demonize gay people for political gain in this election year. This particular press conference wa to announce a new barrage of ad a TV follow-up to a summer print campaign in which alleged former homosexual who have changed implore others to do likewise through the power of Jesus Christ. The commercial, gooey in style, end with a slogan: It's not about hate . It's about hope. But it's really about stirring up the fear that produce hate. If these ad were truly aimed at gay people, they wouldn't be broadcast at extravagant cost to the wide general audience reached by TV, and they wouldn't be trumpeted in Washington, insuring free national exposure, three week before Election Day. The ad themselves, despite the sugar-coating of hope, ooze malice. In one of them, homosexuality is linked to drug addiction and certain death by AIDS; all of them implicitly posit that homosexuality is itself a disease in need of a cure. Matthew Shepard ha now been cured, that's for sure. As his uncle, RW. Eaton, told The Denver Post, the 21-year-old Matt, who aspired to a career in diplomacy and human right, wa a small person with a big heart, mind and soul that someone tried to beat out of him. Of his nephew's shattered body Eaton said, It's like something you might see in war. And a war it is. Go to the Family Research Council's Web site and you will find a proud description of it readiness to wage the war against the homosexual agenda and fight to maintain the traditional meaning of `family.' The head of the Family Research Council is Gary Bauer, a GOP power broker and putative presidential candidate, who disingenuously go on talk show to say that his organization hate no one and deplores violence. But if you wage a well-financed medium air war in which people with an innate difference in sexual orientation are ceaselessly branded a sinful and diseased and un-American seeker of special right, ground war will follow. It's a story a old a history. Once any group is successfully scapegoated a a subhuman threat to normal value by a propaganda machine, emboldened thug take over. Two week after James Byrd wa savagely dragged to his death from a pickup truck in Texas in June, I wrote a column about an ugly incident outside the GOP state convention in Fort Worth, where a mob threatened a group of gay Log Cabin Republicans who were protesting discriminatory treatment by their own party. The gay-bashers had been directly preceded by steady saber-rattling from Republican politicians: Sen. James Inhofe of Oklahoma had likened James Hormel, a gay nominee to an ambassadorship, to David Duke; Pat Robertson had wondered on TV if God might wreak havoc on Disney World for it Gay Days; the Texas GOP spokesman had likened Log Cabin to the Ku Klux Klan. Just two day after this near-brush with violence in Fort Worth, Trent Lott wa on TV seconding the religious right's condemnation of gay people a sinful and sick. A frightened gay Texas Republican who had been at the convention melee asked when I interviewed him then: Do you have to have someone hurt and beat up and dragged from a truck to stop this? Months later not even the murder in Laramie ha moved Lott to apologize for his word, and still no major GOP leader dare take on it religious wing and it crusade against people like Matthew Shepard. In one of the new ad in that supposedly hate-free crusade, an ostensibly loving mother condemns her son for the bad choice of being gay. Is it that mother who speaks for American value, or is it Matthew's? Go home, give your kid a hug, Judy Shepard said in a message read by a tearful hospital spokesman who announced her child's death early Monday morning, and don't let a day go by without telling them you love them. At first, the passing bicyclist thought the crumpled form lashed to a ranch fence wa a scarecrow. But when he stopped, he found the burned, battered and nearly lifeless body of Matthew Shepard, an openly gay college student who had been tied to the fence 18 hour earlier. On Friday, the 22-year-old University of Wyoming student wa in a coma in critical condition. At Albany County courthouse here, Russell Henderson, 21, and Aaron McKinney, 22, were arraigned on charge of kidnapping, aggravated robbery and attempted first-degree murder. Two woman described a friend of the men, Kristen Leann Price, 18, and Chastity Vera Pasley, 20, have been charged a accessory after the fact to attempted first-degree murder. Shepard's friend said that he did not know his alleged tormentor. Laramie police say the primary motive wa robbery, although court paper filed Friday indicate Shepard's homosexuality may also have been a factor. Shepard's friend call the attack a hate crime. He wa very open about his sexuality, Tina LaBrie, an anthropology student here, said of her friend. I admired him for that because it is very courageous to be yourself even when others disagree. A few hour before he wa beaten, Shepard, a slight 5-foot, 2-inch man who wore brace on his teeth, had attended a meeting of the Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgendered Association, said Walter Boulden, a friend of Shepard's. He wa sitting at the bar, having a beer, when two men came up and talked to him, Boulden, a 46-year-old university lecturer of social work here, said today between tear. He indicated he wa gay, and they said they were gay, too. Now, he is in a coma, continued Boulden, who visited his friend at a hospital in Fort Collins, Colo., on Thursday. I don't think anybody expects him to pull through. Shepard, who spoke Arabic and German, studied at a boarding school in Switzerland before moving back to the United States to attend the University of Wyoming, the alma mater of his father, an oil rig safety inspector in Saudi Arabia. Matthew Shepard wa born in Casper, the capital of Wyoming's oil belt, and spent much of his youth there. But six week after returning to Wyoming and enrolling a a freshman here, Shepard fell into a depression, said Ms. Labrie and her husband, Phillip. Accustomed to life in Europe and Denver, this foreign language student who wanted to become a diplomat found himself living in this isolated city of 27,000 people. Set in a treeless landscape defined by barbed wire fence, grazing cattle and a busy freight railroad line, Laramie is a town where pickup truck outnumber sport utility vehicle, where fall entertainment revolves around this Saturday's homecoming football game and the start of the hunting season in the nearby Medicine Bow mountain. Although Wyoming often bill itself a the equality state, in reference to it being the first state to give woman the vote, the state legislature ha repeatedly voted down hate crime legislation on the ground that it would give homosexual special right. Wyoming is not really gay friendly, Marv Johnson, executive director of the Wyoming chapter of the American Civil Liberties Union, said from Cheyenne. The best way to characterize that is by a comment a legislator made a few year back, when he likened homosexual to gay bull a worthless and should be sent to the packing plant. Shepard joined the campus gay association at the university within day. One of his favorite haunt wa the Fireside Bar, which drew a mixed crowd of college student and rodeo cowboy, gay and straight. He definitely wasn't drunk when he came in, recalled the bartender, Matt Galloway. He wasn't drunk when he went out. Calvin Rerucha, the county attorney, charged in court document today that McKinney and Henderson posed a homosexual and lured Shepard out to McKinney's pickup truck. Beating him inside the truck, the pair drove him one mile southeast to an isolated part of a new rural subdivision, the County Attorney's report charged. There, it said, the men tied their captive to a post-and-rail fence and pistol-whipped him with a .357 magnum while he begged for his life. Relatives said that Shepard also suffered burn on his body. After nearly beating the young man to death, Laramie Police Commander David O'Malley said, the assailant stole his wallet and shoe and left him tied to the fence. The police commander said that when his officer arrested the two men on Thursday, they found in McKinney's pickup truck a .357 magnum pistol covered with blood and Shepard's shoe and credit card. He said they found Shepard's wallet at McKinney's home. The police commander said that the two woman helped the two men dump their bloody clothing, and that they reported hearing the men make anti-gay remark. Ms. Pasley, a freshman art student at the university, lived with Henderson. Ms. Price lived with McKinney. The police did not say what the other three did for a living. On Friday, friend and Laramie resident struggled to understand the incident. Shepard, some said, may have felt a false sense of confidence because the local Gay Association completed plan on Tuesday night for Gay Awareness Week 1998. The weeklong series of event start here Sunday with a local observance of National Coming Out Day and a lecture on Monday by Leslea Newman, the author of Heather Has Two Mommies, a book about lesbian family. If I were a homosexual in Laramie, I would hang low, very low, said Carla Brown, manager of the Fireside. Openly gay behavior is not only discouraged, it's dangerous. Matthew Wayne Shepard, the gay student who wa beaten in the dead of night, tied to a fence and left to die alone, wa mourned at his funeral Friday by 1,000 people, including many who had never met him. Matt believed that if he had made one person's life better, he had succeeded, his cousin, the Rev. Anne Kitch, said in a homily that wa carried beyond the packed pew of St. Mark's Episcopal Church, through a filled parish hall, across the street to a packed Presbyterian church and across Casper on an AM radio station. Judging from the world's response, she said, Matt will have made a difference in the life of thousand. As the first snowstorm of the fall blanketed Casper, fresh flower filled the red brick church here where Shepard had been baptized a a teen-ager and where he once wore the white robe of an Episcopal acolyte. There is an image that come to mind when I reflect on Matt on that wooden cross rail fence, said the Rev. Royce Brown, the pastor of St. Mark's, in a eulogy. I replace that image with that of another man hung upon a cross. When I concentrate on that man, I can release the bitterness inside. Shepard, a 21-year-old freshman at the University of Wyoming, had dreamed of working one day for human right. In death, he ha become a national catalyst for a new drive to guarantee for gay people the right to physical safety. His death hit a nerve in the nation this week, eliciting dozen of candlelight vigil and rally for tolerance, several statement of sadness from President Clinton, and a congressional resolution. Thursday, the House of Representatives passed by voice vote a resolution that condemned Shepard's killing a outrageous and that urged each member of Congress and every US. citizen to denounce this outrageous murder of another human being. In one of the largest rally, about 1,000 people, including member of Congress of both party, gathered on the step of the Capitol in Washington to condemn Shepherd's killing and to urge passage of a federal bill that would add extra penalty to crime motivated by a victim's sexual orientation, gender or disability. House Minority Leader Dick Gephardt urged passage of the bill, leading the crowd in a chant of Now! Now! Now. We will never forget the love that the world ha shared with this kind, loving son, said Shepherd's father, Dennis, his father, outside Casper City Hall, a his mother, Judy, stood by, weeping. He said the family wa touched beyond measure by the thousand of e-mail comment, Web-site message, phone call and card offering help, consolation, sympathy and support. Before the funeral, about a dozen protester, largely from Kansas and Texas, waved sign with anti-homosexual message. But mourner stood in front of them, singing Amazing Grace and holding umbrella to block the sight of the spectacle from friend and family member entering the church. On hearing of the protest, Laramie's City Council held an emergency meeting Thursday night and unanimously passed an ordinance banning protest during funeral. Wyoming Gov. Jim Geringer had warned in advance that anti-gay protester were just flat not welcome. The governor, a Republican, added, What we don't need is a bunch of wingnuts coming in. Shepard wa born in Casper and attended elementary school, junior high and several year of high school and college here. With flag at Casper's public school flying at half-staff Friday, many mourner were his old classmate. Others traveled here, one driving from a far away a New Jersey, out of a sense of solidarity. I've had a pit in my heart and my stomach since I heard this, said Steve Pietrangelo, who drove 300 mile to wait three hour in cold rain and snow to attend the funeral of a man he never met. I just wanted to pay my respect to him and his family. Touching people of all walk of life, Shepard's murder ha elicited call for tolerance of homosexual from unexpected quarter. At the University of Wyoming this fall, football player will wear yellow and green sticker on their helmet in memory of Shepard. Organizers said that yellow signifies tolerance and green symbolizes peace. In Casper, a conservative city of 51000, located in the heart of Wyoming's oil belt, tolerance ha become the watchword. Prejudice against homosexual is just a redneck a anti-black bias,'` The Casper Star-Tribune, Wyoming's largest newspaper, wrote in it main editorial on Sunday. Violence against our homosexual friend and neighbor ha created a most un-American climate of fear in Wyoming and the rest of the nation. Monday, Jason Marsden, the newspaper's political reporter, wrote lovingly that, Matthew Shepard is still my friend, and not just because we are both member of the loose-knit community of gay people striving to make our way in this sometimes hostile place called Wyoming. Matt wa very short and hard to hug, Marsden recalled of the young man who had grown up in Casper. But it wa worth trying, because he'd hug you with everything in his little, fragile frame. In a week of spiritual reflection, Aaron Kreifels, the University of Wyoming freshman who found his battered classmate Oct. 7, attributed the chance discovery to God's plan. On that afternoon, Kreifels, an 18-year-old architectural engineering student, had nearly completed a rigorous six-mile ride on a mountain bike up and down Cactus Canyon, in public land east of Laramie. Kreifels recalled in an interview Thursday that his only mishap of the ride, I hit this big limestone rock and did one over the handlebar. Dusting himself off and looking around in the fading light of the day, Kreifels recalled, I noticed something out of my eye that looked like a scarecrow. I walked around the fence, and a I got closer, I noticed the hair. Shepard, his hand bound behind his back with a nylon cord and tied to a fence post, wa lying on the ground, face up, unconscious. Sometimes I wonder why I found him alive, if he wa going to die, Kreifels reflected, before traveling to spend this weekend at home with his parent in Grand Island, Neb. But I guess God wanted his parent to be with him. Matthew Wayne Shepard, the gay student who wa beaten in the dead of night, tied to a fence and left to die alone, wa mourned at his funeral Friday by 1,000 people, including many who had never met him. Matt believed that if he had made one person's life better, he had succeeded, his cousin, the Rev. Anne Kitch, said in a homily that wa carried beyond the packed pew of St. Mark's Episcopal Church, through a filled parish hall, across the street to a packed Presbyterian church and across Casper on an AM radio station. Judging from the world's response, she said, Matt will have made a difference in the life of thousand. As the first snowstorm of the fall blanketed Casper, fresh flower filled the red brick church here where Shepard had been baptized a a teen-ager and where he once wore the white robe of an Episcopal acolyte. There is an image that come to mind when I reflect on Matt on that wooden cross rail fence, said the Rev. Royce Brown, the pastor of St. Mark's, in a eulogy. I replace that image with that of another man hung upon a cross. When I concentrate on that man, I can release the bitterness inside. Shepard, a 21-year-old freshman at the University of Wyoming, had dreamed of working one day for human right. In death, he ha become a national catalyst for a new drive to guarantee for gay people the right to physical safety. His death hit a nerve in the nation this week, eliciting dozen of candlelight vigil and rally for tolerance, several statement of sadness from President Clinton, and a congressional resolution. Thursday, the House of Representatives passed by voice vote a resolution that condemned Shepard's killing a outrageous and that urged each member of Congress and every US. citizen to denounce this outrageous murder of another human being. In one of the largest rally, about 1,000 people, including member of Congress of both party, gathered on the step of the Capitol in Washington to condemn Shepherd's killing and to urge passage of a federal bill that would add extra penalty to crime motivated by a victim's sexual orientation, gender or disability. House Minority Leader Dick Gephardt urged passage of the bill, leading the crowd in a chant of Now! Now! Now. We will never forget the love that the world ha shared with this kind, loving son, said Shepherd's father, Dennis, his father, outside Casper City Hall, a his mother, Judy, stood by, weeping. He said the family wa touched beyond measure by the thousand of e-mail comment, Web-site message, phone call and card offering help, consolation, sympathy and support. Before the funeral, about a dozen protester, largely from Kansas and Texas, waved sign with anti-homosexual message. But mourner stood in front of them, singing Amazing Grace and holding umbrella to block the sight of the spectacle from friend and family member entering the church. On hearing of the protest, the Casper City Council held an emergency meeting Thursday night and unanimously passed an ordinance banning protest during funeral. Wyoming Gov. Jim Geringer had warned in advance that anti-gay protester were just flat not welcome. The governor, a Republican, added, What we don't need is a bunch of wingnuts coming in. Shepard wa born in Casper and attended elementary school, junior high and several year of high school and college here. With flag at Casper's public school flying at half-staff Friday, many mourner were his old classmate. Others traveled here, one driving from a far away a New Jersey, out of a sense of solidarity. I've had a pit in my heart and my stomach since I heard this, said Steve Pietrangelo, who drove 300 mile to wait three hour in cold rain and snow to attend the funeral of a man he never met. I just wanted to pay my respect to him and his family. Touching people of all walk of life, Shepard's murder ha elicited call for tolerance of homosexual from unexpected quarter. At the University of Wyoming this fall, football player will wear yellow and green sticker on their helmet in memory of Shepard. Organizers said that yellow signifies tolerance and green symbolizes peace. In Casper, a conservative city of 51000, located in the heart of Wyoming's oil belt, tolerance ha become the watchword. Prejudice against homosexual is just a redneck a anti-black bias,'` The Casper Star-Tribune, Wyoming's largest newspaper, wrote in it main editorial on Sunday. Violence against our homosexual friend and neighbor ha created a most un-American climate of fear in Wyoming and the rest of the nation. Monday, Jason Marsden, the newspaper's political reporter, wrote lovingly that, Matthew Shepard is still my friend, and not just because we are both member of the loose-knit community of gay people striving to make our way in this sometimes hostile place called Wyoming. Matt wa very short and hard to hug, Marsden recalled of the young man who had grown up in Casper. But it wa worth trying, because he'd hug you with everything in his little, fragile frame. In a week of spiritual reflection, Aaron Kreifels, the University of Wyoming freshman who found his battered classmate Oct. 7, attributed the chance discovery to God's plan. On that afternoon, Kreifels, an 18-year-old architectural engineering student, had nearly completed a rigorous six-mile ride on a mountain bike up and down Cactus Canyon, in public land east of Laramie. Kreifels recalled in an interview Thursday his only mishap of the ride, I hit this big limestone rock and did one over the handlebar. Dusting himself off and looking around in the fading light of the day, Kreifels recalled, I noticed something out of my eye that looked like a scarecrow. I walked around the fence, and a I got closer, I noticed the hair. Shepard, his hand bound behind his back with a nylon cord and tied to a fence post, wa lying on the ground, face up, unconscious. Sometimes I wonder why I found him alive, if he wa going to die, Kreifels reflected, before traveling to spend this weekend at home with his parent in Grand Island, Neb. But I guess God wanted his parent to be with him. At first, the passing bicyclist thought the crumpled form lashed to a ranch fence wa a scarecrow. But when he stopped, he found the burned, battered and nearly lifeless body of Matthew Shepard, an openly gay college student who had been tied to the fence 18 hour earlier. On Friday, the 22-year-old University of Wyoming student wa in a coma in critical condition. At Albany County courthouse here, Russell Henderson, 21, and Aaron McKinney, 22, were arraigned on charge of kidnapping, aggravated robbery and attempted first-degree murder. Two woman described a friend of the men, Kristen Leann Price, 18, and Chastity Vera Pasley, 20, have been charged a accessory after the fact to attempted first-degree murder. Shepard's friend said that he did not know his alleged tormentor. Laramie police say the primary motive wa robbery, although court paper filed Friday indicate Shepard's homosexuality may also have been a factor. Shepard's friend call the attack a hate crime. He wa very open about his sexuality, Tina LaBrie, an anthropology student here, said of her friend. I admired him for that because it is very courageous to be yourself even when others disagree. A few hour before he wa beaten, Shepard, a slight 5-foot, 2-inch man who wore brace on his teeth, had attended a meeting of the Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgendered Association, said Walter Boulden, a friend of Shepard's. He wa sitting at the bar, having a beer, when two men came up and talked to him, Boulden, a 46-year-old university lecturer of social work here, said today between tear. He indicated he wa gay, and they said they were gay, too. Now, he is in a coma, continued Boulden, who visited his friend at a hospital in Fort Collins, Colo., on Thursday. I don't think anybody expects him to pull through. Shepard, who spoke Arabic and German, studied at a boarding school in Switzerland before moving back to the United States to attend the University of Wyoming, the alma mater of his father, an oil rig safety inspector in Saudi Arabia. Matthew Shepard wa born in Casper, the capital of Wyoming's oil belt, and spent much of his youth there. But six week after returning to Wyoming and enrolling a a freshman here, Shepard fell into a depression, said Ms. Labrie and her husband, Phillip. Accustomed to life in Europe and Denver, this foreign language student who wanted to become a diplomat found himself living in this isolated city of 27,000 people. Set in a treeless landscape defined by barbed wire fence, grazing cattle and a busy freight railroad line, Laramie is a town where pickup truck outnumber sport utility vehicle, where fall entertainment revolves around this Saturday's homecoming football game and the start of the hunting season in the nearby Medicine Bow mountain. Although Wyoming often bill itself a the equality state, in reference to it being the first state to give woman the vote, the state legislature ha repeatedly voted down hate crime legislation on the ground that it would give homosexual special right. Wyoming is not really gay friendly, Marv Johnson, executive director of the Wyoming chapter of the American Civil Liberties Union, said from Cheyenne. The best way to characterize that is by a comment a legislator made a few year back, when he likened homosexual to gay bull a worthless and should be sent to the packing plant. Shepard joined the campus gay association at the university within day. One of his favorite haunt wa the Fireside Bar, which drew a mixed crowd of college student and rodeo cowboy, gay and straight. He definitely wasn't drunk when he came in, recalled the bartender, Matt Galloway. He wasn't drunk when he went out. Calvin Rerucha, the county attorney, charged in court document today that McKinney and Henderson posed a homosexual and lured Shepard out to McKinney's pickup truck just after midnight early Wednesday. Beating him inside the truck, the pair drove him one mile southeast to an isolated part of a new rural subdivision, the County Attorney's report charged. There, it said, the men tied their captive to a post-and-rail fence and pistol-whipped him with a .357 magnum while he begged for his life. Relatives said that Shepard also suffered burn on his body. After nearly beating the young man to death, Laramie Police Commander David O'Malley said, the assailant stole his wallet and shoe and left him tied to the fence. The police commander said that when his officer arrested the two men on Thursday, they found in McKinney's pickup truck a .357 magnum pistol covered with blood and Shepard's shoe and credit card. He said they found Shepard's wallet at McKinney's home. The police commander said that the two woman helped the two men dump their bloody clothing, and that they reported hearing the men make anti-gay remark. Ms. Pasley, a freshman art student at the university, lived with Henderson. Ms. Price lived with McKinney. The police did not say what the other three did for a living. On Friday, friend and Laramie resident struggled to understand the incident. Shepard, some said, may have felt a false sense of confidence because the local Gay Association completed plan on Tuesday night for Gay Awareness Week 1998. The weeklong series of event start here Sunday with a local observance of National Coming Out Day and a lecture on Monday by Leslea Newman, the author of Heather Has Two Mommies, a book about lesbian family. If I were a homosexual in Laramie, I would hang low, very low, said Carla Brown, manager of the Fireside. Openly gay behavior is not only discouraged, it's dangerous. Matthew Shepard, the gay college student who wa kidnapped and severely beaten, died here Monday, five day after he wa found unconscious on a Wyoming ranch where he had been left tied to a fence for 18 hour in near-freezing temperature. His death, announced at Poudre Valley Hospital here, fanned the outrage that followed word of last week's attack, spawning nationwide vigil, producing a call for federal hate-crimes legislation from President Clinton and fueling debate over such law in a host of Western state, including Wyoming, that have resisted them. From Denver to the University of Maryland, people turned out to honor the The slight, soft-spoken 21-year-old Shepard, a freshman at the University of Wyoming, who became an overnight symbol of anti-gay violence after he wa found dangling from the fence by a passerby. Russell Anderson, 21, and Aaron McKinney, 21, were charged with attempted murder and are expected to face first-degree murder charge that could bring the death penalty. Their girlfriend, Chastity Pasley, 21, and Kristen Price, 18, were charged a accessory. In Denver, mourner wrote message on a graffiti wall a part of national Gay Awareness Week. In San Francisco, a giant rainbow flag that symbolizes the gay right movement wa lowered to half-staff in the Castro district. There is incredible symbolism about being tied to a fence, said Rebecca Isaacs, political director of the National Gay and Lesbian Task Force in Washington. People have likened it to a scarecrow. But it sounded more like a crucifixion. Police in Laramie, Wyo., where the beating took place, have said they believed robbery wa the primary motive for the attack against Shepard, which occurred outside a bar in the town of 27,000. But investigator also said Shepard's sexuality may have been a factor. Police said Henderson and McKinney lured Shepard from the bar by saying they too were gay and one of their girlfriend said Shepard had embarassed one of the men by making a pas at him. Monday, police said that after leaving Shepard tied to the fence, the men returned to Laramie and picked a fight on a street corner with two Hispanic men, Emiliano Morales, 19, and Jeremy Herrera, 18. McKinney and Morales suffered head injury in the brawl; McKinney wa arrested when he sought treatment at the same hospital where Shepard died. Gay leader hope and Christian conservative fear that Shepard's death will galvanize Congress and state legislature to pas hate-crime legislation or broaden existing law. Conservatives generally oppose such law because they favor one group's right over another. In the last two decade, 21 state and the District of Columbia have passed law that increase penalty for crime that are committed because of a person's race, religion, color, national origin, and sexual orientation. Another 19 state, including Colorado, do not include sexual orientation in their hate-crime law. Ten state, including Wyoming, have no hate-crime law at all. In Washington, Clinton responded to news of Shepard's death by urging Congress to pas the federal Hate Crimes Protection Act, which would make federal offense of crime based on sex, disability and sexual orientation. Wyoming ha been one of the nation's holdout, rejecting three hate crime bill since 1994, most recently in February. But Monday, after Shepard's death, Gov. Jim Geringer appealed to lawmaker to reconsider their opposition. I ask for a collective suggestion for anti-bias, anti-hate legislation that can be presented to the Wyoming Legislature for their consideration in January, Geringer said. The governor met Monday morning with Dennis Shepard, the slain student's father, and said that the elder Shepard did not want his son's death to become a medium circus and that we should not use Matt to further an agenda. Geringer said that Shepard's father also said: Don't rush into just passing all kind of new hate-crimes law. Be very careful of any change and be sure you're not taking away right of others in the process to race to this. Leaders of gay right group interviewed Monday said they would respect the family's privacy by not attending the burial in Casper, Wyo., on Saturday. But they added that they hoped the death would have an impact on legislator around the nation. Matthew's death, I hope, will bring about a better and deeper understanding of hate crime law, said Elizabeth Birch, executive director of the Human Rights Campaign, a lesbian and gay right group that ha 250,000 member. Matthew's death may lead to an awakening in Wyoming and in the United States Congress a the need for this legislation. In 1996, 21 men and woman were killed in the United States because of their sexual orientation, according to the Southern Poverty Law Center, an Alabama group that track violence against minority. According to the FBI, sexual orientation wa a factor in 11.6 percent of the 8,759 hate crime recorded in 1996. But Christian conservative warn that gay leader want to use Shepard's death to expand hate right law and to curtail freedom of speech. Hate crime law have nothing to do with perpetrator of violent crime and everything to do with silencing political opposition, said Steven Schwalm, an analyst with the Family Research Council, a Washington group dedicated to defending faith, family and freedom. It would criminalize pro-family belief, Schwalm said. This basically sends a message that you can't disagree with the political message of homosexual activist. Agreement came from John Paulk, who wa featured this summer in a series of advertisement about how he and his wife, Anne, overcame homosexuality through religious conversion. We have every right to speak out against an agenda that is contrary to Biblical norm, said Paulk, who describes himself a a homosexuality specialist for Focus on the Family, a Christian group in Colorado Springs, Colo. Because we are standing up and opposing the homosexual agenda, we are being looked upon a advocating violence against homosexual, when we categorically reject violence against homosexual. Last Thursday, the Family Research Council unveiled a series of television advertisement that preach the healing of homosexuality through religious conversion. Gay leader charge that these advertisement help create a hostile climate for homosexual, a climate that can lead to violence. Hate crime law that are on the book in 40 state have not impinged on freedom of speech, said Brian Levin, a criminal justice professor who directs the Center on Hate and Extremism at Stockton College, in Pomona, NJ. Instead, he said, hate crime law send a clear message that society doe not tolerate attack on minority. We want to deter the broken window and simple assault before they escalate, he said. Referring to murder of homosexual, he added: These crime are preventable. Offenders get emboldened if they are not punished the first time. Levin said that his research indicated that homosexual suffered higher rate of violent crime than the population at large. He also said that roughly half of the people who attack homosexual are male, aged 22 or younger. With other crime, violence is a mean to an end. With hate crime, the violence becomes an unstoppable goal, Levin said. Shepard suffered a dozen cut around the head, face and neck, a well a a massive blow to the back of his skull. Because their social stature in society, gay are often viewed a appropriate target, Levin added. Citing the need for hate crime law to send a clear message to gay bashers, Levin said: The discourse in society leaf many of these people to believe that what they are doing is socially acceptable. While some gay leader saw crucifixion imagery in Shepard's death, others saw a different symbolism: the Old West practice of nailing a dead coyote to a ranch fence a a warning to future intruder. This University of Wyoming student wa beaten and left to die, tied to a fence like an animal because he wa honest and open about being gay, Beatrice Dorhn, legal director of the Lambda Legal Defense and Education Fund, said Monday, Matthew Shepard's horrible suffering and death cannot be dismissed simply a the fault of deranged, isolated individual. His attacker are among million of Americans who constantly hear the message that gay people are not worthy of the most basic equal treatment, Ms. Dorhn said. Matthew Wayne Shepard, the gay student who wa beaten in the dead of night, tied to a fence and left to die alone, wa mourned at his funeral Friday by 1,000 people, including many who had never met him. Matt believed that if he had made one person's life better, he had succeeded, his cousin, the Rev.

1009,"Parliament convened Thursday to vote on whether to move toward a no-confidence motion that could bring down the government over an organized crime scandal. Thursday's vote to put the motion on the agenda will be an indication of the government's chance of survival, which are said to be extremely slim. If approved, the legislature will debate the motion on Monday and hold the no-confidence vote Wednesday. The opposition accuses Prime Minister Mesut Yilmaz of having tie to organized crime and tampering with the privatization of a state bank. He denies the charge. Ousting the government from power will open the way for the struggle against gang, said Lutfu Esengun, a deputy from the Islamic Virtue Party, which presented one of the three no-confidence motion to Parliament. On Wednesday, 6th graf pvs After failing to bring together political rival in a coalition, Premier-designate Bulent Ecevit announced Saturday that he wa returning his mandate to the Turkish president. In a statement reported by the Anatolia news agency, Ecevit said he would see President Suleyman Demirel Monday morning. Ecevit, a veteran leftist, wa called on to form a cabinet over two week ago after Mesut Yilmaz' coalition government collapsed in a no-confidence vote in Parliament. Deputies accused Yilmaz, who ha since been serving a acting premier, of entertaining tie with the mob and tampering with the sale of a state bank. Refusing any alliance with the pro-Islamic Virtue Party, Turkey's largest party in Parliament, Ecevit wa unable to create a political alliance strong enough to survive a confidence vote in the deeply divided legislature. Ecevit tried in vain to form a coalition government with two rival center-right wing party -- one led by Yilmaz, the other by former Prime Minister Tansu Ciller. Ecevut's alternate effort to make a minority coalition with outside backing for his Democratic Left Party from Parliament also failed. Demirel will now have to either ask someone else to try to form a government or wait until Jan. 10, when the constitution allows him to appoint a caretaker cabinet to lead the country to parliamentary election, now scheduled for April. Such a cabinet would not have to face a confidence vote. Or Demirel could choose to leave the current caretaker government, headed by Yilmaz, in power until the election. Bulent Ecevit, who wa asked to form a new government Wednesday, is a former prime minister best remembered for ordering an invasion of Cyprus in 1974 that made him an overnight hero at home. The invasion, after a short-lived coup by supporter of union with Greece, ha led to the division of the island. Throughout the year, Ecevit, 73, ha remained a strong defender of the cause of the Turkish Cypriots As long a Turkey life, we won't allow the oppression and subordination of Turkish Cypriots at the hand of Greek Cypriots, he said in July 1997 during the 23rd anniversary celebration of the invasion. Ecevit, who wa prime minister three time since 1974, ha over the year shed some of the socialist idealism he wa known for in the 70. During his tenure a deputy prime minister in a 17-month government that wa toppled last week over a corruption scandal, he gave his backing to the liberal policy of the center-right-led coalition. He often said he wa carrying out a duty to bring a stable government and spare Turkey from crisis - a reference to tension between a previous Islamic-led government and the secular military. Though never a Marxist, Ecevit wa in his early year viewed with suspicion by big business for espousing socialism based on heavy government social benefit and a strong role for the state sector in the economy. Recently, however, he ha helped the government keep on good term with the IMF, which ordered a strict curb on public spending, and approved a number of state sell-offs. Under his leadership in the 70's, tie with the United States were tense. He ha also expressed concern over a U.S.-led multinational force based in Turkey that monitor a no-fly zone over Kurdish-controlled northern Iraq. He argues it it is helping create a Kurdish state. His frequent visit to Iraq to meet with President Saddam Hussein have in turn raised suspicion in Washington. Despite a short alliance with an Islamic party in 1974, he is a staunch defender of Turkey's secular tradition and pushed for a crackdown on Islamic radicalism. Ecevit wa born in Istanbul in 1925, to an intellectual family and studied literature at a prestigious American-run high school. He ha taken some course at Harvard University. A former journalist, he entered politics in 1957, rising to the leadership of the Republican People's Party in 1972, becoming prime minister in 1974, briefly in 1977 and again in 1978-79. He wa barred from politics in the year that followed a 1980 military coup. He wa imprisoned three time for carrying on with political activity despite the ban, mainly through his wife of 51 year, Rahsan, who formed the Democratic Left Party in 1985 and led it until a democratic reform in 1987 allowed Ecevit back into politics. In corruption-tainted Turkish politics, he remains known a the leader with the cleanest slate. Not even his alliance with Yilmaz who wa ousted for alleged tie to the mob and rigging the privatization of a bank, tarnished his image. The chance for a new, strictly secular government in Turkey faded Wednesday when a potential coalition partner insisted on giving the Islamic party a share of power. The military, self-appointed guardian of Turkey's secular system, is adamantly opposed to the inclusion of Islamic Virtue, the largest party in parliament. Premier-designate Bulent Ecevit need Turkey's two-center right party to hammer together a secular coalition, but Tansu Ciller, the ex-premier who command 99 vote in parliament, rebuffed him Wednesday. Ecevit already ha the support of her arch-rival, outgoing Premier Mesut Yilmaz, head of the other center-right party. But Mrs. Ciller said Wednesday she would not join force with Yilmaz, whose government collapsed Nov. 25 over a mafia scandal. Instead, she reiterated her demand for a government that would include Virtue. We do not oppose Mr. Ecevit's premiership. We will support him, but only if all party represented in Parliament are included, Mrs. Ciller said. It wa not clear what Ecevit's next move would be. He might try to form a fragile minority coalition. He might also admit defeat and return the task of forming the government to President Suleyman Demirel. Demirel could then choose any member of parliament to head the government until election in April. ANKARA, Turkey (AP) - Prime Minister Mesut Yilmaz on Wednesday faced intense pressure to step down after allegation that he interfered in a privatization contract and helped a businessman linked to a mobster secure loan. Deniz Baykal, leader of the center-left Republican party whose backing in parliament help Yilmaz's minority government, said he would withdraw his support unless the premier resigned immediately. Two opposition party threatened to press for a motion to censure the government. The allegation were made by businessman Korkmaz Yigit, who claimed that Yilmaz and Gunes Taner, the economy minister, had encouraged him to buy the state-run bank Turkbank, offering him loan from other state bank to ensure that his offer wa the highest bid. Yigit's allegation were carried Tuesday night on two of his TV channel which showed a videotape he had made to explain his version of the story before his detention Monday evening for questioning about the bidding. Yigit bought the bank at a public auction in August for dlrs 600 million. The government suspended the privatization last month after a lawmaker released an audio tape of a conversation supposedly between Yigit and mobster Alaattin Cakici. On that earlier tape, Cakici wa heard assuring Yigit that he will fend off rival bidder. It wa not clear who made the tape, which got into the hand of an opposition deputy. Yigit claimed Yilmaz and Taner were aware of Cakici's involvement in the bidding for the bank but urged him nevertheless to go ahead with the bidding. Yilmaz ha said that an intelligence report revealing Yigit's tie with Cakici only reached him after Yigit won the tender. Yigit said the premier had also encouraged him to buy mass-circulation national newspaper Milliyet, apparently to ensure the paper's backing to his center-right Motherland party in election next year. Milliyet's sale to Yigit wa canceled after the scandal. Cakici wa arrested in France in August. Turkey ha requested his extradition. Last month State Minister Eyup Asik resigned after allegation he had been in close contact with Cakici. Turkey's latest premier-designate got the backing of two key secular party Monday in his effort to form a broad-based, coalition government, on condition that his government stick to Turkey's secular principle. The Islamic-oriented Virtue Party, however, withheld immediate support for Yalim Erez. News report said Virtue wa holding out for a number of Cabinet seat that reflected it standing a the largest party in parliament. We are neither saying `yes' nor saying `no' at this point, Virtue leader Recai Kutan said. Erez denied that the two had discussed Cabinet post. Erez, an independent lawmaker, is trying to form a coalition government that would include Cabinet member from several party, including Virtue. The coalition would run the country only until parliamentary election set for April. Erez took over effort to form a government last week after veteran leftist Bulent Ecevit gave up, unable to convince Turkey's bickering center-left and center-right party to join him in a coalition that excluded the Islamic-oriented party. Erez opened talk with various party leader on Monday. He got support from center-right leader Mesut Yilmaz, who said his party supported Erez a long a he had Ecevit's backing. As long a our sensitivity toward the secular, democratic regime is taken into account, we will do our best to help form the new government and ensure it get a vote of confidence, Ecevit said after his own talk with Erez. Turkey's strongly secular military is opposed to any deal that would bring Virtue to power. It pressured Virtue's predecessor, the Welfare Party, out of power last year. Erez is supposed to talk Tuesday to center-right Tansu Ciller and to Deniz Baykal, who lead a center-left party. I am more and more optimistic after every meeting, Erez told reporter after meeting with the party leader. Turkey ha been trying to form a new government since a coalition government led by Yilmaz collapsed last month over allegation that he rigged the sale of a bank. Yilmaz is now acting premier. A week after the Turkish government fell in a corruption scandal, President Suleyman Demirel on Wednesday asked a veteran left-wing politician known for his personal honesty, Bulent Ecevit, to form a new government. Ecevit, who served a prime minister three time in the 1970s, said he would immediately begin working to fashion a government that could command a majority in the faction-ridden Parliament. He also suggested that although Parliament ha set April 18 a the date for a new election, he might seek to remain in power for a longer period. It is wrong to see this government a simply an election government, he said. There are problem that will not wait until an election. Military commander, who hold ultimate power in Turkey, have quietly told senior political figure, including Demirel, that they do not want a quick election. They fear it will produce a Parliament just a divided a the present one, perhaps with the Islamic-oriented Virtue Party a the largest bloc. The commander are also hoping to exclude two of the country's leading politician, outgoing Prime Minister Mesut Yilmaz and former Prime Minister Tansu Ciller, neither of whom they trust, from post in the new government. Ecevit must now try to build a government that includes their center-right party but not them a individual. In a meeting this week the country's senior policy-making body, the National Security Council, in which military officer have a strong say, set three priority for the coming month. It said that whatever government emerges from forthcoming negotiation should dedicate itself to fighting religious fundamentalism, Kurdish nationalism and criminal gang that have infiltrated the state apparatus. Among Ecevit's immediate challenge will be to resolve a political crisis with Italy that broke out last month when the Kurdish rebel leader Abdullah Ocalan wa arrested in Rome and then asked for political asylum there. Turkey want Ocalan sent here for trial, but Italy say it cannot extradite him a long a Turkey retains the death penalty. Ecevit (pronounced EH-che-vit) is among the few senior Turkish politician who favor the abolition of capital punishment. Together with Demirel, Ecevit is often cited by Turks who complain about the continued dominance of a geriatric political elite here. He is 73 and ha been in politics for most of his adult life. Early in his career Ecevit emerged a a spokesman for Turkey's downtrodden mass. Perhaps more than any other figure, he legitimized social democratic ideology in a climate where leftist sympathy were often considered subversive. At the same time, however, he ha shown himself to be a fierce nationalist. He wa prime minister when Turkey sent troop to occupy northern Cyprus in 1974 and is still considered a hard-liner on Cyprus. He is also uncompromising in his opposition to Kurdish nationalism. During his term a prime minister in the 1970s, Ecevit successfully undermined effort to move Turkey toward membership in the European Union, then called the European Economic Community. He considered it an instrument of capitalist exploitation. Ecevit ha also disturbed the United States by flirting with anti-Western ideology. In the early 1990s, during an interval when he worked a a journalist, he traveled to Iraq and wrote a series of article favorable to Saddam Hussein. He recently called for better relation between Turkey and Iraq, and maintains some of the anti-imperialist position and suspicion of capitalism that he developed in the 1960s. The Democratic Socialist Party, which Ecevit head, is a closely held family fiefdom. He and his wife carefully screen applicant for membership and veto those whose personal loyalty to Ecevit is suspect. During his term a prime minister in the '70s, Ecevit did not appear to be a consensus builder, said Ilter Turan, a professor of political science at Bilgi University in Istanbul. It seems that nowadays he is more accommodating, so from that perspective he may not be bad choice. On many issue that Turkish society is encountering now, he represents an orientation which doe not seem to be totally in tune with the time, Turan said. That would include his position on issue like privatization, integrating Turkey more fully into the international system, and the devolution of central authority. He ha failed to grasp where the world is heading. He look at and analyzes the world in category that are no longer useful or appropriate. Almost alone among Turkish politician, Ecevit life modestly and ha avoided any hint of personal or financial scandal. He speaks fluent English, and his reading taste run to poetry and intellectual journal such a The New York Review of Books. He ha translated the work of TS. Eliot into Turkish and published several volume of his own poem. Opposition party lodged no-confidence motion Wednesday against Prime Minister Mesut Yilmaz after allegation he interfered in the privatization of a bank and helped a businessman linked to a mobster. Yilmaz' minority government could go down if the the small, center-left Republican Party, which usually give him the majority he need in parliament, vote against him. The leader of the Republicans, Deniz Baykal, urged Yilmaz to resign. But the premier vowed Wednesday to stay on, saying he wa the victim of a conspiracy. This is a plot and it can't be a reason for a resignation, Yilmaz said, adding that he intended to continue the struggle against organized crime. Afterward, Baykal said the Republicans would support a no-confidence motion. The leader of the Democratic Turkey Party, Husamettin Cindoruk, said his party might withdraw from the governing coalition. He said the party would announce it decision Thursday. The political turmoil sent the Istanbul stock market plunging 14.9 percent. Premier-designate Bulent Ecevit said Thursday he would persist in the difficult task of convincing a key party leader to join force in a secular coalition. Ecevit, who wa asked to form a new government Wednesday, desperately need the support of the 99 deputy of ex-premier Tansu Ciller's center-right party. Ecevit, a veteran leftist, already ha the support of another center-right party led by Mesut Yilmaz, whose government collapsed last week under the weight of a mafia scandal. Mrs. Ciller ha not said if she would back an Ecevit-led government and her long-standing rivalry with Yilmaz make Ecevit's job of coalition-building difficult. I don't give up that easily, neither do I lose hope that easily, Ecevit told his parliamentary group Thursday. Mrs. Ciller could lose grassroot support if she stand in the way of a new government, political columnist Ertugrul Ozkok wrote Thursday in daily Hurriyet. This could put her at odds with her classic support base. Ecevit wa expected to meet with Yilmaz on Thursday, and other party leader Friday. Turkey's secular party are under pressure to join force to keep the Islamic Virtue Party out of power. Virtue is the largest party in Parliament, but the all-powerful military is fiercely opposed to an Islamic-led government. President Suleyman Demirel appeared likely to turn to some widely trusted lawmaker to form Turkey's next government, after a veteran politician abandoned effort Monday to persuade bickering political leader to support him in a pro-secular coalition. Bulent Ecevit of the Democratic Left Party failed in a 3-week-old attempt to form a government that could command a majority of vote in Parliament. It is now clear that no party leader can form a government that can win a vote of confidence, former Premier Mesut Yilmaz said after talk with Demirel. We have told the president that we will not hamper the appointment of a deputy of Parliament. With party leader unable to overcome difference, the new premier-designate would most probably be affiliated to a party but be trusted enough by other party to follow an independent line. Parliament Speaker Hikmet Cetin ha been suggested a a likely candidate. The new appointment would be made within day, Yilmaz told reporter. Demirel consulted Turkey's party leader immediately after Ecevit gave up. Most declared themselves in favor of a government led by a lawmaker. Only center-right leader Tansu Ciller said she wanted a government led by a party leader, and made clear she wa willing to take on the task. Turkey's parliament is split by longstanding animosity between it center-left and center-right party. Yilmaz led the last government, which collapsed in November amid allegation he had tie to organized crime and interfered with the sale of a state bank. By tradition, Demirel should then have asked the leader of Parliament's largest party to form a new government. But Demirel broke with custom to keep the Islamic-oriented Virtue Party from power. Turkey's staunchly secular military opposes the return of an Islamic-led government. Modern Turkey ha had only one Islamic-led government, formed after 1995 election, and the military pressured it from power for failing to stick to the country's secular tradition. Ecevit refused even to consult with the leader of the Virtue Party during his effort to form a government. ","Turkish PM Yilmaz was forced to step down due to mob ties and claims of state bank privatization tampering.President Demirel asked highly respected 3-time former PM Bulent Ecevit to form a new majority government.A split between parliament's center left and right is longstanding.Ecevit distrusted Yilmaz and Ciller but brought in Yilmaz's party and wooed Ciller's.She wouldn't join unless Islamic Virtue were included, which the secular parties resisted.After a 3-week effort, Ecevit gave up rather than include Virtue.Yalim Erez tried next and won the backing of 2 key secular parties.He will talk to Ciller and run Turkey until the April 18 election.","Following charges that he interfered in a privatization contract and helped a businessman with mob ties, Turkish Prime Minister Mesut Yilmaz was forced to resign.President Demeril asked Bulent Ecevit, former three-time prime minister from the 1970s and champion of Turkish Cypriot rights, to form a new government.After three weeks, Ecevit was unable to secure the support of the Center-Right Party.At issue was the participation of the Islamic Virtue Part in the secular government, Ecevit returned his mandate and Demeril named Valim Erez as prime minister designate.Erez was in talks with the Virtue Party over possible cabinet seats.","Turkey's Prime Minister Yilmaz was ousted by a no-confidence vote in Parliament over allegations of interfering in a bank privatization and having mob ties.Ecevit, a former prime minister, was asked to form a new government.He was unable to win the support of Ciller for a secular coalition.Refusing any alliance with the Islamic Virtue Party, Ecevit turned to President Demirel to find another solution.Demirel was expected to turn to a widely trusted lawmaker to form Turkey's next government.New premier-designate Erez got backing from 2 key secular parties as he tried to form a broad-based secular coalition that would include some from the Virtue Party.","For more than a month, Turkish politicians have been trying to form a new government.The last prime minister was voted out after charges of corruption and mob ties.Longtime politician and three-time prime minister, Ecevit, tried for two weeks to form a coalition, which would satisfy the staunchly secular military.He failed when he could not get the support of both center-right parties.The president then asked a member of Parliament to form an interim coalition government to serve until the April election.Erez attained center-right support if he sticks to secular principles, but he may be forced to give some Cabinet seats to the Islamic Virtue Party."
1013,"James Kopp, the man the FBI is seeking a a material witness in the sniper slaying of Dr. Barnett Slepian, is known to abortion right leader a an aggressive anti-abortion protester, and law enforcement official say he ha been arrested several time in demonstration at abortion clinic. The portrait that emerges of Kopp, 44, from police record, study by researcher on right-wing movement, newspaper account of protest, and abortion right advocate, is that of an itinerant protester, moving about the country in a series of increasingly abrasive protest at abortion clinic. Federal law enforcement official say he is not currently a suspect in the Slepian shooting, and there wa no indication Wednesday that he had been arrested for any violent act. At several abortion protest, he wa charged with trespassing or resisting arrest, according to news account. One of his arrest wa in Atlanta during Operation Rescue's huge anti-abortion protest there in 1988. While he wa in an Atlanta jail, Kopp wa given the nickname Atomic Dog, which investigator contend link him to the violent fringe of the anti-abortion movement, responsible for a series of bombing and arson and seven murder of abortion provider like Slepian over the last five year. Responsibility for some of the violence like the bombing of an abortion clinic in Birmingham, Ala., earlier this year, in which an off-duty policeman wa killed ha been claimed in note signed by a shadowy Army of God. An underground manual issued in the name of the Army of God, which describes method for attacking abortion clinic, including how to make homemade C-4 plastic explosive, begin with a tribute, by nickname, of a clandestine band pledged to stop abortion. The first name under this Special Thanks section is Atomic Dog. The Atlanta police, after searching the hundred of arrest record of the protester from the summer of 1988, confirmed Wednesday night that the date of birth and Social Security number of the James Kopp arrested then matched those given out Wednesday by the FBI task force in Buffalo investigating the murder of Slepian, who wa gunned down through the window if his home in suburban Amherst on Oct. 23. At the nondescript frame house in St. Albans, Vt., that the FBI gave a Kopp's last known address, the current resident, who gave his name only a E. Kenny, 20, a shipping clerk, remembered Kopp well. He lived there for part of 1990 a the guest of Kenny's parent, who were active in the anti-abortion movement, among a group of protester who tried to shut down two abortion clinic in Burlington in stubborn demonstration that year. Kenny remembered Kopp a a really nice guy, who did chore around the place but paid no rent to the parent. He sometimes made wooden toy or played video game with Kenny, then a child. But the focus of his life wa the anti-abortion movement, Kenny recalled. He wa known among these people a Atomic Dog. It wasn't like a name that he had to go to the store or something. But if you knew anything about him, that's what you called him. Roughly 95 people were arrested during the protest, according to newspaper account at the time. There were many, many arrest, recalled Allie Stickney, the president of Planned Parenthood of Northern New England. It wa very big for Vermont. There were Kryptonite lock and leaflet from the Army of God and the Lambs of Christ. It wa clearly a highly organized blockade. According to newspaper account, Kopp wa arrested outside a clinic in Levittown, Long Island, in 1991. The protest in Atlanta in 1998 appeared to be a turning point for a hard-core group of protester. The Atlanta police cracked down hard and carted hundred of demonstrator off to an isolated prison dormitory the called the farm. Operation Rescue had mounted a series of blockade to close down abortion clinic in New York and Philadelphia that spring. Atlanta wa their high point, but in the face of the tough arrest policy, the movement faltered, split apart and stalled. It wa a traumatic, life-changing experience, said Frederick Clarkson, author of Eternal Hostility, a book on the anti-abortion movement, adding that by 1993 with the shooting of Dr. David Gunn, an abortion provider in Florida, some of those in the Atlanta jail became the nucleus of a group signing a justifiable homicide statement that declared that the use of force wa warranted to defend the life of an unborn child. On the eve of a holiday that ha been linked to antiabortion violence, the authority on Tuesday were investigating whether a picture of an aborted fetus sent to a Canadian newspaper wa connected to last month's fatal shooting of a Buffalo, NY. doctor who provided abortion or four similar attack in western New York and Canada since 1994. The newspaper, the Hamilton (Ontario) Spectator, ha received five similar package in the last year, some containing veiled threat and several delivered by a man who employee said resembled James Charles Kopp, who is wanted for questioning a a witness about the Oct. 23 slaying of Dr. Barnett Slepian. Five day after the shooting, the Spectator received a package containing an antiabortion flier with biographical information about Slepian, including a photograph of him that had been crossed out. It certainly cause u to be more interested than ever in speaking to Kopp, said Inspector Keith McKaskill of the Winnipeg Police Department, a spokesman for the Canada-United States task force investigating the five shooting. Even a they searched for Kopp, federal official were also looking into three letter that were received Monday by Catholic and antiabortion organization in Buffalo, Indianapolis and Chicago. Those letter, saying they contained the deadly anthrax bacteria, came 10 day after eight similar threat to clinic that provide abortion. All the letter appear to be hoax, and it remains unclear whether they were connected to any of the five shooting. Kopp is not a suspect in the shooting. An itinerant antiabortion activist whose last known address is in Vermont, he is the subject of warrant on both side of the border. In Canada, he is suspected of administrative violation of immigration law; in the United States, he is wanted a a material witness in the Slepian case. Federal authority investigating the murder of a Buffalo-area obstetrician who performed abortion have identified a Vermont man a a material witness to the sniper attack last month and issued a warrant for his arrest Wednesday to bring him in for questioning. The man wa identified a James Charles Kopp, 44, whose last known address wa in St. Albans, Vt. His whereabouts are not known, investigator said. Investigators said Kopp's car wa seen near the Amherst, N.Y., home of Dr. Barnett Slepian in the week before the doctor, whose work at an abortion clinic had long made him a target of harassment, wa killed. Kopp, according to police record and abortion right group, ha often moved about the country in a series of protest at abortion clinic, and ha been linked to an underground manual that describes method of killing or maiming doctor who perform abortion. Denise O'Donnell, the US. attorney for the western district of New York, said Kopp wa not considered a suspect at this time but wa believed to have information material to the case. She declined to give detail on what evidence wa being sought from Kopp, describing it only a information that is contained in a sealed affidavit whose disclosure would compromise the ongoing investigation. Ms. O'Donnell said that federal law allowed for an arrest warrant for a material witness when a person ha information that is important to a case. If Kopp is found, he would be arrested, brought to Buffalo and ordered to provide the required evidence, Ms. O'Donnell said. Then, most likely, the individual would be released. Slepian, 52, wa shot by a sniper firing from outside his home on Oct. 23, shortly after returning from an evening service at his synagogue. He wa standing in his kitchen with his wife and one of his four son when the bullet crashed through a back window. He died two hour later. Law enforcement official said Wednesday's announcement of the material witness warrant wa in part an attempt to underscore the potential danger of anti-abortion violence in advance of Remembrance Day, a Canadian holiday that fall on Nov. 11 and that the authority have associated with some anti-abortion crime. At the same time, the Justice Department and the FBI were trying to find way to step up the federal response to violence at abortion clinic in the aftermath of the Slepian killing. The official said that Attorney General Janet Reno would soon announce that the Justice Department, aiming to heighten the visibility of the federal role in case that cross state and local jurisdictional boundary, would revive a national investigative effort focused on abortion clinic violence. Ms. Reno and senior FBI official, including Robert Bryant, the deputy FBI director, have met with physician and abortion right group in recent day to discus way to enhance federal investigative effort and coordination with local agency. Federal authority first organized an abortion clinic task force in 1995 after the killing of a Florida doctor. The unit, which wa charged with investigating whether a national conspiracy existed, spent nearly two year studying abortion clinic violence. The unit disbanded without uncovering a national conspiracy. Law enforcement official said that the unit's operation did help reduce violence at abortion clinic and that, in part, the decision to re-establish it wa prompted by Ms. Reno's desire to send a renewed message to anti-abortion extremist that the government would aggressively investigate these crime. Slepian's murder fit the pattern of four earlier sniper attack on abortion doctor in Canada and western New York, dating from 1994. None of the attack have been solved. Bernard Tolbert, special agent in charge of the FBI in Buffalo, said at a news conference here Wednesday that investigator had not determined whether there is a link between the five killing. There's a possibility they could be linked, but certainly no information, he said. Tolbert gave little information about the subject of the material-witness warrant, except to say that Kopp's black 1987 Chevrolet Cavalier, with the Vermont license plate BPE216, wa seen near Slepian's home beginning several week before the murder. We don't have any idea of where he is, Tolbert said of Kopp. We are looking for him every place we can, every place he might be. A photograph of Kopp taken in January 1997 ha been distributed to law enforcement agency around the United States and Canada. The National Abortion Federation ha sent out an advisory to clinic around the country about the search for Kopp, said Melinda DuBois, assistant director of Womenservices, the clinic where Slepian worked. She said naming Kopp a material witness in the case had not brought relief to the nurse and other worker at the clinic. I don't think it make me or anyone else at the clinic feel differently, she said. I don't want anybody to relax and say, `Oh God, they got the guy.' That's easy to happen. I still want people to be very vigilant. The clinic is the last in the Buffalo area that is performing abortion. Slepian wa one of only a handful of doctor in Buffalo who were still willing to perform the procedure in the face of picket, protester and threat. Since his death, doctor from outside Buffalo have come to the clinic to continue providing abortion service. Rosina Lotempio wa standing outside abortion clinic here before Operation Rescue stormed into town in 1992 for the rowdy Spring of Life rally, in which hundred were arrested. She wa there before Lambs of Christ demonstrator came to town in 1993. She wa on the sidewalk outside Buffalo GYN Womenservices the morning of Oct. 23, about 12 hour before Barnett Slepian, the clinic doctor, wa fatally shot in his home. And she wa there Friday, brown rosary bead in her hand, a small gold cross on a chain around her neck, quietly praying for abortion to stop. I'm heartbroken when I have to come here, Mrs. Lotempio, 58, said a she stood in the cold, wearing small black earmuff and a white turtleneck adorned with a tiny silver pin of baby foot. It's very difficult out here; I depend on God, she said, after praying for several moment to decide whether to talk to a reporter. The bombing, the fiery rhetoric of abortion opponent and the poster of bloody fetus may capture the attention of the news medium, but people like Mrs. Lotempio are the foot soldier in the abortion battle. They call themselves street counselor and come to the clinic whenever they believe abortion are being performed. They pray and they talk to woman, hoping to change their mind. Some scream profanity. Others, like Mrs. Lotempio, denounce not only the violence against doctor and clinic, but also the blocking of door and the shouting of ugly epithet at clinic worker and patient. For the approximately 80 abortion opponent here, their protest is more like a job than a political activity. There is a schedule. People count on them to show up. Mrs. Lotempio, a mother of three and grandmother of six, connects her involvement to a conversation in the 1970s in which she helped a friend decide to abort an unwanted pregnancy. Two decade later, she wa haunted by her own question: whether the fetus wa male or female. I just felt horrible and I felt guilty, she said, tear in her eye. I thought that if I wa at the clinic doing something, I could make up for that baby's life. During Mrs. Lotempio's 8 a.m.-to-10 am. shift Friday, about a dozen people circled the area in front of the Buffalo clinic, saying the Hail Mary. Others take her spot on Tuesdays and Wednesdays. She return on Saturdays, when up to 40 people crowd the sidewalk. Similar band of protester march in front of abortion clinic throughout the United States, and local protester are often joined by band of people who roam the country. At the clinic on Main Street, north of downtown Buffalo, there is an odd sense of community. Local protester greet Dick, the security guard, by name. They sometimes see the enemy abortion-rights volunteer who escort patient in and out of the clinic in the supermarket or on the soccer field. Robert Behn, one of the protest leader, even spent two hour talking about abortion over breakfast last year with Slepian. And several said they cried when they heard of Slepian's death. Most of the protester, including Mrs. Lotempio, were among the thousand of people arrested here in 1992, the height of anti-abortion activity in Buffalo. But if Operation Rescue return, a planned, for a Spring of Life reunion in April, Mrs. Lotempio said, she will not be there. Instead, she plan to stay in church and pray, to avoid the militancy she say she find uncomfortable. Glenn Murray, a lawyer for Womenservices clinic, said: When people from out of town show up, that is when we feel the most danger. The local people are a known quantity. We know most of the local people by name. Buffalo ha been among a handful of hot spot for abortion protester for the last decade. It is a heavily Catholic city where thousand of protester from around the country demonstrated for two week in 1992. They failed to close abortion clinic, but 500 people were arrested in rally that snarled traffic and drew national headline. Those rally, a well a earlier protest and continuing sidewalk vigil, have had an impact, people on both side of the abortion issue say. The number of clinic performing abortion in the Buffalo area ha dropped to one from three. And after Slepian's death and the retirement this week of another doctor, there are only two doctor in the area for whom abortion form a significant part of their practice. The daily demonstrator count this a progress. But their perch outside the clinic mean they witness far more of what they believe are murder than what they call rescue. About 30 woman a day might go into the clinic. After eight year, Mrs. Lotempio can count eight woman who changed their mind and did not get abortion while she wa at the clinic. Inside the clinic, the protest just make a hard job harder, many clinic worker say. While some demonstrator simply repeat the rosary, other protester call out to patient a they drive into the parking lot behind the building, or walk up to the fortresslike front. They ask question like Do you know what your baby look like? or Is it a boy or a girl? Sometimes they accuse people of murder and torture and sin, or threaten them with damnation. Federal law bar protester from coming within 15 foot of the clinic entrance, and from leaning sign against it wall. Some push the limit, frustrating clinic worker and guard. The rule protect people from physical harassment, but because of the distance, they turn what could be quiet conversation into catcall and taunt. When a patient go into the clinic, the protester take on a different persona, said Melinda DuBois, director of the Buffalo clinic. They scream and yell and call u name. They lie. Some day we're immune to it, but other day it's just too much. Linda Palm, 51, marching at the clinic on Friday, said she identified with the clinic patient. When she wa 23, she said, she struggled with the difficulty of being unmarried and pregnant herself, but decided to have her child, and married the father. She began protesting in 1990, after attending an abortion protest march in Albany. While veteran and civic leader devote Wednesday's national holiday to honoring fallen soldier, Remembrance Day ha become a chilling vigil for Canadians in the front line of the abortion-rights movement. There is immediate fear, because an anti-abortion gunman is believed to be at large. And there is long-term anxiety, because even in this country where abortion are legal and publicly funded, woman may find access diminishing. There is speculation the sniper's timing is linked to Remembrance Day because some anti-abortion activist use the day to commemorate aborted fetus. Three time since 1994, a sniper ha used this time of year to fire into the home of a Canadian doctor who performs abortion, each time wounding the target. The attack were spread across Canada Ontario, Manitoba and British Columbia. US. and Canadian investigator now believe those attack were linked to two shooting of abortion-providing doctor in upstate New York, including the Oct. 23 slaying of Dr. Barnett Slepian at his home near Buffalo. An American anti-abortion activist, James Kopp, is wanted for questioning about the shooting. Police say they don't know which side of the border he is on, fueling uneasiness at clinic and hospital throughout Canada. You must realize Canada ha the largest undefended border in the world, said Keith McCaskill, a police inspector in Winnipeg, Manitoba, and spokesman for the investigation. Many women's clinic have tightened security, and doctor who provide abortion have been urged to take precaution. I would suggest they be extremely aware of their day-to-day going on, whether during their business day or after hour, said Toronto Detective Rick Stubbings. Across Canada, there have been report of obstetrician-gynecologists modifying their practice or deciding to stop performing abortion. Some wear bulletproof vest and hang sheet over window of their home. Abortion-rights group say most doctor are not backing down. There's a great deal of sadness, said Susan Fox, director of a clinic in Edmonton, Alberta, that provides abortion. But there's also a feeling of determination that we won't be deterred or scared by these action. Marilyn Wilson, executive director of the Canadian Abortion Rights Action League, see a long-term threat because fear of violence may intimidate young doctor from entering the field. There are almost no doctor who have stopped performing these procedure, even under the current reign of terror, she said. But young doctor with family wouldn't necessarily want to do this. They may not be willing to put their life at risk. The abortion debate is only one of several factor contributing to a shortage of obstetrician-gynecologists in Canada. The national society that oversees the speciality say there are about 1,400 doctor in the field, a shortfall of 600, and most are in their 50 or 60. The society say long hour and limit on fee paid by the public health-care system are causing burnout and deterring medical school graduate a they choose a specialty. Another problem is that few Canadian medical school offer training in abortion. Women in Canada's big city generally have adequate access to abortion. Those in rural area often face long journey, and the province of Prince Edward Island prohibits abortion at it six hospital, forcing woman there to travel to New Brunswick or Nova Scotia. Abortion-rights group say the situation would improve if the RU-486 abortion pill were available in Canada. No drug company ha applied for permission to market the pill, either fearing boycott or doubting it profitability. The government ha been urged to make a public appeal to drug company, but the health department say this can't be done. It would be a conflict of interest, said Bonnie Fox-McIntyre, a department spokeswoman. As a regulator we have to stay at arm's length, so we can judge an application impartially. Abortion wa illegal in Canada until 1988. Now there is no abortion law of any sort, about 100,000 abortion are performed annually, and poll indicate roughly three-quarters of Canadians favor pro-choice policy. Yet public support doesn't spare doctor from fear. Dr. Henry Morgentaler, who led effort to overturn the old abortion law and whose Toronto clinic wa bombed in 1993, say he and his colleague are sacrificing personal freedom a they reluctantly increase security measure. Unfortunately, doctor who are committed to providing these service will have to accept a certain diminishment of their enjoyment of life, he said. In the aftermath of last month's deadly sniper attack on an obstetrician in upstate New York, Attorney General Janet Reno announced last week that she wa setting up a new investigative unit to examine the possibility that the doctor wa the victim of a broader anti-abortion plot. The unit, the National Clinic Violence Task Force, will include a dozen Justice Department lawyer and involve several law-enforcement agency. But the main work of looking into the shooting of Dr. Barnett Slepian in his suburban Buffalo home and how it fit a larger pattern of organized violence will be done by the FBI, which ha jurisdiction over domestic terrorism. For many in the FBI, that's a problem. In contrast to the old image of gung-ho FBI agent turning their surveillance machinery on political group, a number of senior FBI agent privately expressed misgiving about the attorney general's latest task force, the second she ha ordered to begin a broad investigation into a conspiracy involving anti-abortion violence. FBI official fear that expanding the investigation could drive the agency over the ill-defined boundary that separate inquiry into criminal activity from those into political cause and unpopular idea. Today's agent are eager to disassociate themselves from the old J. Edgar Hoover day of trampling the civil right of political dissident in the guise of serious investigation. They do not want the agency drawn into the middle of the bitter ideological war between anti-abortion group and abortion right advocate, who have long asserted the existence of an organized campaign against clinic and doctor. Many of those calling for government help were once themselves subject of FBI interest a anti-war and civil right activist. Senior agency official, including Director Louis Freeh, were starting their career in the early 1970s and watched in dismay a the FBI wa shaken by revelation about Cointelpro, the counterintelligence program that allowed agent to spy on, burgle, wiretap and infiltrate anti-war and civil right group like Students for a Democratic Society and the Student Nonviolence Coordinating Committee. Some official are dubious that a conspiracy exists to kill doctor who perform abortion. They came up empty handed when Reno ordered the first federal inquiry in 1994 after the killing of a Florida doctor and his bodyguard. The Justice Department conducted a two-year grand jury investigation; agent pursued some anti-abortion activist using surveillance team. But investigator never found a specific plot against abortion clinic and staff member. Violence at abortion clinic is only part of the problem. The FBI ha in recent year found itself thrown into a minefield of politically tinged case involving the volatile world of anti-government militia, environmental and Christian extremist, white separatist, animal right activist and Islamic fundamentalist. The FBI is very quick to jump from investigating crime to investigating political association, said David Cole, a law professor at Georgetown University. When you move from investigating crime to investigating group, that all-important nexus to criminal conduct get lost, the focus get broader and broader and you start sweeping in all kind of lawful political activity. In response to terrorist attack like the bombing of the World Trade Center in 1993, the Oklahoma City federal building in 1995 and the Olympic park in Atlanta in 1996, the agency ha increased effort to deter such incident in a major prevention program. In such case, the Justice Department, the FBI and other law enforcement agency said they operate under domestic security guideline that require investigator to find a reasonable indication that a group is planning to break the law before they can open an inquiry into an organization. Before the authority can use such intrusive tactic a wiretapping or property search, they must have specific evidence. Yet FBI agent throughout the country have quietly evaluated the threat posed by a variety of extremist group through it link to local authority and informal interview with the leader of some group. Their conclusion is that most of these group pose little real danger. Much more difficult to investigate are lone terrorist inflamed by the oratory of extremist ideology but who belong to no group, drifting along society's frayed margin, off the grid, a some agent describe it, without the usual tie to family, friend or work. The profile fit Eric Robert Rudolph, the fugitive wanted for bombing at the Atlanta Olympics, a gay nightclub and two abortion clinic. He ha kept his belief mostly to himself, although acquaintance hint that he wa familiar with religious extremism and hate group. In contrast, James Charles Kopp, who is being sought a a material witness in the killing of Slepian, left a trail of clue about his motif. He wa an early follower of Randall Terry, a leader of Operation Rescue. Later, Kopp wa associated with the Lambs of Christ, an another militant anti-abortion group. One law-enforcement official said that the government should do what it doe best. We should investigate violation, he said. We shouldn't investigate group. Everyone who knew Dr. Barnett Slepian knew that the slight, graying physician endured a measure of stress that would exhaust, even break, most people. There were the stranger who pawed through the garbage can at his home and growled murderer a they passed him in the grocery store aisle. Demonstrators assailed his pregnant patient a they arrived at his office for their checkup, calling him a baby killer. Outside the clinic where he performed abortion two day a week, picket shouted epithet like pig to his face. Slepian, an obstetrician and gynecologist by training and an abortion doctor by principle, rarely acknowledged the strain. He might crack an occasional joke at the expense of the protester who shadowed him at work and on weekend. Then he would do something unexpected, like invite an anti-abortion leader to breakfast or stop and chat with a familiar demonstrator outside the clinic. So when he wa killed Oct. 23 by a sniper's bullet fired through the kitchen window of his home in the Buffalo, N.Y., suburb, a furtive execution that fit a pattern of four earlier attack on abortion provider in western New York state and Canada, friend and relative wondered not so much that Slepian's work could arouse such murderous violence. He had predicted a much himself. Instead, they wondered, once again, that he persisted in that work, long after other Buffalo doctor had surrendered to the pressure of abortion opponent. He wa an incredibly fatalistic person who thought that if your number's up, it's up, and there is nothing you can do about it, said H. Amanda Robb, the doctor's 32-year-old niece. And he wa incredibly stubborn. He said that woman had a right to comprehensive health care and since he wa a women's doctor, he wa going to provide it for them. Slepian is the third doctor to be killed in the last five year in bombing and shooting that have killed 7 people and wounded 17 at abortion clinic around the nation. To his tormentor, he wa simply an abortion doctor. To member of the abortion right movement, he wa a martyr for their cause. But Slepian wa far from either. In interview with friend and family member, he emerges a more than a one-dimensional abstract a conservative who advocated old-fashioned value like self-reliance, a shy man who had rare flash of anger, a doctor who performed abortion but had no more patience for woman who had multiple abortion than for woman who had multiple child they did not want or could not support. He wa killed because he performed a medical procedure that ha become emotional and politicized. Yet there is nothing in his life to suggest he wa a crusader in either politics or medicine. Rather, he wa an obstinate, unassuming man who did a remarkable thing. Out of contrariness and out of conscience, say those who knew him, he refused to allow anyone to dictate what kind of doctor he should be, and for that, he paid with his life. The clue to Slepian's flinty brand of commitment lie, in part, in his upbringing. His wa a family that took success for granted even a it teetered on the edge of poverty. To earn money for medical school, he shoveled muck at a ranch and drove a taxi. He made few friend, but those he had were friend for life. When their wife were sick, he called repeatedly. When they were lonely, he flew to their side. Slepian, who wa known a Bart, used to tell people that he chose obstetrics because it is a specialty that expose a doctor to the least suffering, and that he performed abortion because it wa legal and the alternative were so much worse. Slepian often expressed exasperation over woman who came to him for abortion after abortion. Don't they get it? his clinic staff recall him saying more than once. He had the same impatience for woman like those he remembered from his residency in inner-city Buffalo, who had child after child and no mean of support. He had the contempt for that of somebody who had pulled himself up by his bootstrap and made it in the world, Ms. Robb said. He believed that to ban abortion or, just a shameful in his view, to stop teaching young doctor how to perform them, would not correct the human imperfection that he found so irritating. There are 1.5 million abortion performed in this country, his niece said, and he just felt we're not equipped to handle 1.5 million unwanted child. When he wa killed, at the age of 52, Bart Slepian owned an imposing red brick home in the quiet suburb of Amherst, complete with a swimming pool with piped-in music and an assortment of the time-saving gadget he adored. Slepian's trajectory to that comfortable doctor's life had been unconventional. His grandfather, a Russian Jewish immigrant who started out selling shoelace from a pushcart in Boston, propelled all five of his son into Harvard at a time when few Jews met the university's blue-blood standard. His father, in turn, decreed that his own three son would be doctor or earn PhD's. We grew up in a home where there wa tremendous, tremendous, tremendous respect for education, said Serena Robb, Slepian's sister, who is four year older than him. If you got an A, it wa OK If you got a B, you got yelled at. The family's mean did not match it expectation. Slepian's father, Philip, had joined his own father's business manufacturing leather sol for shoe. Soon after Bart wa born in 1946 in Boston, the company failed, so to save money, the father moved his family of six to his in-laws' apartment in McKeesport, Pa., and then to Rochester, NY. Once settled, Slepian's father set himself up a a freelance writer, crisscrossing the country in his old Studebaker, researching the origin of prominent citizen at the Library of Congress and writing their story for small-town newspaper. He sold article by the hundred, and wa still writing until his death nine year ago at the age of 93. The success that wa expected of Bart Slepian did not come easily. As a child, he wa so shy that he cried when anyone looked at him, his sister recalled. An unexceptional student, he went to a local community college before transferring to the University of Denver, where he majored in zoology. Rejected by medical school in the United States the fate of two out of three applicant in the late 1960s he studied one year in Belgium and then enrolled at the Autonomous University for Medicine in Guadalajara, Mexico. His friend remember him a funny and obstinate, a thin young man with glass and a receding hairline who beat all comer at arm-wrestling and pool. Bart had certain belief, strongly held, said Richard Schwarz, an old classmate who is an internist on Long Island. He always said you shouldn't sit around whining about thing, Schwarz said. He would say, `Go after what's yours and what's right.' Bart Slepian's determination surfaced in quirky way. He once insisted on going to the top of the World Trade Center, despite a crippling fear of height. To get to the window, he crawled, inch by inch. I said, `You don't have to do this,' recalled Schwarz, who wa with him at the time. And he said, `I want to do it.' Bart made it count. He felt alive. Forced to drop out of school every few semester to work, he lived in Reno with his sister Serena, a widow who wa struggling to take care of two young daughter. She worked a a waitress and a blackjack dealer, sharing her tip with him while he drove a cab, cleaned barn at a ranch and worked a a laboratory assistant at the local Veterans Administration hospital. After graduation, he moved to Buffalo for his medical residency. There he married Lynne Breitbart, a registered nurse 10 year his junior, and scraped together the money to buy an obstetrics practice from a doctor who wa about to retire. He had a soothing, unhurried manner. When a patient of his, Patti Durlak, wa diagnosed with diabetes, Slepian referred her to a specialist but called every few day for month to help her overcome a fear of the needle she had to use for her insulin injection. The other doctor said, `Just deal with it,' Mrs. Durlak recalled. Not Dr. Slepian. In most way, he wa a typical suburban family man, working six day a week and spending his free time at Little League game and county fair with his four son. But by the late 1980s, he and other abortion doctor in Buffalo were under siege. In one notorious 1991 incident recorded on videotape, the Rev. Paul Schenck, one of the fieriest of Buffalo's anti-abortion leader, threw himself in front of the doctor's car a he pulled into the clinic driveway. Slepian parked on the street. As he pushed his way through the crowd of chanting demonstrator, Schenck cupped his hand around his mouth and lunged, shouting, Slepian, you pig! Slepian's attempt to separate the abortion conflict from his private life were futile. The protest followed him home and the man who had been so bashful a a boy found himself, uncomfortably, at the center of controversy and attention. Once, he showed his anger. In 1988, when demonstrator jeered at him from the sidewalk in front of his home a he opened Hanukkah present with his child, the doctor came out brandishing a baseball bat. He denied he hurt anyone, but a town judge ordered him to repair one protester's smashed van window and pay a portion of another's medical bill. The outburst surprised his family and friend. It wa not Slepian's style to make a public fuss, much le acknowledge the stress of being taunted by protester. Stress? his oldest brother Paul responded gruffly when asked about the doctor's mood. I never heard the word used in my family, except a an engineering term. He said it wa a nuisance. Mrs. Slepian did not respond to request for an interview. She expressed rage to The Buffalo News shortly after the shooting. She said that whoever had killed her husband deserved the death penalty and that she would be happy to administer the lethal injection herself. She also spoke out after Schenck's brother, Robert, another anti-abortion leader who frequently confronted Slepian, sent a bouquet of flower. Mrs. Slepian denounced him a a hypocrite. After the confrontation in 1988, Slepian turned to civil harassment lawsuit, letter and levity to deal with the protester. In 1993, when a man active in the anti-abortion effort wa arrested for rifling through the doctor's garbage can at home, Slepian tried to treat the incident lightly. They hopefully got the bag full of dirty diaper, he joked. He tried to engage his critic through the local newspaper. He told The Buffalo News that abortion protester should turn their energy to helping woman avoid unwanted pregnancy through birth control and counseling. In a letter to the editor he warned that by repeatedly calling him a murderer, his critic were inciting violence. Slepian accepted that opponent of abortion acted out of moral conviction, his friend said, but resented the personal attack. He thought it tended to demonize and dehumanize him and increased the danger, said his lawyer, Glenn Edward Murray. So Slepian took a step that few of the nation's beleaguered abortion clinic doctor dared. He insisted that if he tried hard enough, he might cut through the venom. To the dismay of the staff member who feared for his safety, Slepian began about a year ago to stop and chat with protester he recognized outside the Womenservices abortion clinic in Buffalo, where he worked two day a week. He surprised a gathering of protester who were preparing for what they euphemistically called a house call, or demonstration at the doctor's home, and invited the protest's organizer, the Rev. Robert Behn, to breakfast. Their hourlong conversation the next morning wa inconclusive, Behn said, dismissing Slepian's gesture a an attempt to get people to like him. He asked Slepian how performing abortion affected him spiritually. In response, he recalled, the doctor said, I'm fine spiritually. Slepian, meanwhile, focused more on time away from home with his family. He planned to take a cruise next spring. He bought a time-share apartment near Disney World in Florida. He had so many plan, said Ellen Fink, a close friend of the couple for 15 year. He wasn't done. He wasn't done living yet. Still, sometimes during the most casual conversation, a shadow would appear. When his wife gave him a gray African parrot for a birthday gift, Slepian joked that the bird would probably outlive him so he would teach it his eulogy. He would talk about the funeral he wanted, Mrs. Fink said. He said he didn't have a lot of friend and wanted all of them to come in separate car, one in each car, so he'd have a long procession. In the week before his death, Slepian had reason to be preoccupied with thought of mortality. A medical checkup had revealed a blockage of his heart, Mrs. Fink said, recounting a conversation with Mrs. Slepian the day of the slaying. A blockage is a sign of probable coronary artery disease. He wa to have more test the following week. I said, `Lynne, just relax, it's going to be OK,' Mrs. Fink recalled. That same day, the National Abortion Federation sent a fax to the Womenservices clinic warning of a pattern of sniper attack on abortion doctor that occurred in early November. Marilynne Buckham, the clinic director, sent it to Slepian. He definitely took it seriously, she recalled. Typically, the doctor did not share any concern he might have felt. It wa a normal day, said Tammi Latini, his office assistant. We were horsing around.' That evening, the Slepians went to synagogue to mark the ninth anniversary of the death of Slepian's father. Shortly after they returned home, a sniper's bullet smashed through the kitchen window, killing Slepian a he chatted with his wife and son. The protester returned to the clinic five day later, the first day it reopened. Mrs. Buckham, the director, said Slepian would not have been surprised. They have their routine. So did he. He never wanted a day to end on a bad note, she said. At the end of the day, I would always say, `Thank you for coming.' And he would always turn with a stupid grin and say, `Thanks for having me.' The slaying of Dr. Barnett Slepian in his home last week eliminated the mainstay of the only abortion clinic here, but it ha not eliminated women's access to abortion. That is because the availability of abortion in the Buffalo area, a in much of the United States, is a complex reality, one affected by class and education, medical training and the personal conviction of individual doctor. Knowledgeable middle-class and affluent woman here who find themselves with an unwanted pregnancy can usually obtain an abortion from their private gynecologist, or if a gynecologist ha a personal objection to the procedure, through a referral to a colleague. Women who are poor, young or uneducated and have no such regular relationship with doctor have to rely on specialized clinic like the one Slepian worked in, or on hospital. It is this group for whom unplanned pregnancy are far more common than for prosperous woman that face a shrinking universe of possibility a a result of the fear set off by Slepian's killing and the slaying of five other doctor and clinic worker since 1993, medical expert said. If you're well off and well connected, you can get your abortion, said Dr. Stephen Wear, co-director of the center for clinical ethic at the University of Buffalo, which train doctor for the Buffalo area's hospital. For everybody else, it's le and le available. The number of abortion in the United States ha been declining steadily since the first year after the Supreme Court's Roe v. Wade decision legalized abortion in 1973, according to the Alan Guttmacher Institute, which study reproductive issue. They now number roughly 1.5 million a year, according to report by Guttmacher, or 1.4 million, according to the National Right to Life Committee, the nation's largest anti-abortion group, which calculates it estimate partly from the Guttmacher figure. The number of provider who identify themselves a performing abortion a part of their practice is diminishing a well. A 1994 Guttmacher study, the last one published, found that the number had decreased 18 percent between 1982 and 1992, to 2,380 from 2,908. Moreover, the study said, only 12 percent of the nation's residency program routinely offer training in abortion during the first trimester, though many do offer elective course. Laura Echevarria, director of medium relation for the National Right to Life Committee, contends, however, that most teaching hospital do train gynecologist in procedure for treating miscarriage that are similar to those used for performing abortion. Only in cosmopolitan and comparatively liberal city like New York doe the availability of abortion continue at a steady level, expert say, though even in these locale there is concern about the decreasing number of young doctor who emerge from residency fully trained in performing abortion. The Guttmacher Institute, which keep the nation's most precise statistic, said that in 1992, the last year for which it ha figure, there were 142,410 abortion in New York that were done by just 151 provider, including 61 hospital and 44 clinic. Still, that provider figure greatly understates the number of private doctor who perform them in their office, medical expert say. Many obstetrician and gynecologist in Manhattan provide abortion a part of their palette of service, and have for many year, said Dr. Richard Hausknecht, the medical director of Planned Parenthood. Rich and middle-class woman have always had access to abortion, and they always will. The major threat to availability in the city is le a result of anti-abortion violence than of medical training. The bottom line is that we're facing an impending shortage of physician who are adequately trained and willing to do the procedure, said Dr. John Choate, chairman of the New York State division of the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists. But the lack of training program is also a result of political pressure on hospital and university by antagonist of abortion and the same climate of fear. Physicians tend to lie low, Choate said. They don't publicize the fact that they do them. If they do them, they do it quietly out of fear for their practice and for their life. One development on the horizon that is expected to change the outlook for abortion substantially is final federal approval, expected next year, of the RU-486 pill, the drug that end an early pregnancy without the need for surgery. When the pill wa introduced in France and in Edinburgh, Scotland, Hausknecht said, the number of surgical abortion plummeted. In July 1988, when Randall Terry drove through the night from his home in Binghamton, N.Y., to Atlanta to start the series of anti-abortion protest that would finally put his new hard-line group, Operation Rescue, onto America's front page, James Charles Kopp wa in the van riding alongside him, according to former leader of Operation Rescue who spoke on the condition of anonymity. And, those people say, when Terry wa arrested on the first day of Operation Rescue's Siege of Atlanta, Kopp followed him into jail. Along with more than one hundred other Operation Rescue member, according to some people who were there, Kopp remained in jail for 40 day and adhered to Terry's order not to give a real name to the police or court. After his release, Kopp returned to Operation Rescue's Binghamton headquarters, and wa there working alongside Terry a the group's power and influence in the anti-abortion movement surged in late 1988 and 1989, according to the former leader of Operation Rescue. Now, Kopp is being sought by federal and local law enforcement authority for questioning a a material witness in the murder of an obstetrician who performed abortion in the Buffalo region. The authority also say he may have information that will help solve four other sniper attack on doctor who performed abortion in Canada and upstate New York. Some abortion-rights group are seizing on Kopp's role in Operation Rescue to raise new question about the connection between the recent anti-abortion violence and the hard-line anti-abortion protest group that burst onto the national scene in the late 1980s. For year, the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Justice Department have looked in vain for evidence to determine whether a national conspiracy might be behind a series of clinic bombing and shooting of doctor and other clinic staff member that began in the early 1990s. A federal grand jury in Alexandria, Va., that looked into conspiracy allegation wa ultimately disbanded without finding a national underground. But some federal law enforcement official say they hope that Kopp may help provide such a link. In fact, the announcement that law enforcement official are looking for him ha been made a Attorney General Janet Reno ha prepared to revive an interagency task force to look once again for possible conspiracy behind anti-abortion crime. Federal law enforcement official and the authority say Kopp is not now a suspect in the sniper attack on Oct. 23 that killed Dr. Barnett A. Slepian near Buffalo. But they say Kopp's car wa seen near Slepian's home in Amherst, NY. in the week before the doctor wa shot. One day after issuing a warrant for Kopp's arrest a a material witness, law enforcement official from at least 10 agency spanning the United States and Canadian border still had not located Kopp Thursday. But law enforcement official said they were pursuing many tip, including about 400 that have poured into the FBI's information line: (800) 281-1184. The police have gone through photograph of abortion protester and clinic worker in Buffalo and around the country, and they are also reviewing hundred of hour of videotape of demonstration in search of Kopp's face. At this point, official consider the shooting of Slepian to be connected to three attack in Canada and one in Rochester on doctor who provide abortion. The five attack, all since 1994, occurred in the week leading up to Nov. 11, Veterans Day called Remembrance Day in Canada a holiday that ha become important to anti-abortion activist. But the attack were spread over four year and 3,000 mile, from Vancouver, British Columbia, to Buffalo. As is the case with many early veteran of Operation Rescue, Kopp wa transformed into a hard-core anti-abortion militant in jail in Atlanta in 1988, according to many people who were in jail with him who insisted on anonymity. By outward appearance, Dorothy Hayes' life seems ordinary. She and her family live in a rambling old home on the shore of Lake Ontario, and every morning, she give her husband, John, a peck on the cheek before he go to work. She run errand, like other suburban mom, and spends much of her day taking care of her child. But one thing set Mrs. Hayes apart from her neighbor. As a devoted opponent of abortion, the 43-year-old mother of nine regularly play host to a series of traveling speaker, priest and protester many of whom have come to Rochester intent upon spreading the word against abortion and shutting down clinic that provide it. She is one of thousand of people across the country loosely associated with anti-abortion group like the Lambs of Christ who have opened their home to the Lambs' founder, the Rev. Norman Weslin, and other itinerant demonstrator. While many including Mrs. Hayes disavow violent tactic, supporter of abortion right say that people like her bear some responsibility when the protester they help blockade clinic or threaten doctor. These people who provide Father Weslin with food and shelter when he come into town to close the clinic are not innocent, said Ann Glazier, the director of clinic defense for the Planned Parenthood Federation. It's just not credible to say they aren't part of the extremist activity that is taking place at these clinic. They are still guilty of interfering with women's access. But Mary Quinn, a local organizer for the Lambs of Christ who also offer her home to protester, see matter in a differing light. Taking people in like this is an act of Christian charity, Mrs. Quinn said. `People who travel around the country doing this work are taken in by those of u that who don't want to lose their stupid house. We take in these people because they are willing to make the sacrifice. Members of the Lambs of Christ have been persistent figure in protest at the Buffalo women's clinic where Dr. Barnett Slepian worked before he wa shot to death last month. Although no suspect ha been identified in the shooting or in several similar attack in New York and Canada over the past several year, official are looking to question a Vermont man whose car wa seen near Dr. Slepian's home. That man, James Charles Kopp, ha participated in abortion protest for more than a decade, and often wa a house guest of other member of the Lambs of Christ. While Mrs. Hayes say she would never so much a obstruct a clinic's door, some of those to whom she ha given refuge have no qualm about doing so. Weslin, the leader of the Lambs of Christ, is one of those who ha benefited from Mrs. Hayes' hospitality, a modern version of the generosity that Christ and the Apostles knew well. He pride himself on being arrested more than 60 time during protest in front of medical clinic. And throughout the 1980s and early '90s, he wa active in clinic rescue, in which protester tried physically to restrain patient trying to enter clinic. Weslin stayed at Mrs. Hayes' home only once, beginning in May 1996 when he first came to speak at local church about the anti-abortion movement. But during a stay that lasted several month, he wa arrested on Federal charge of blocking access to a Rochester health clinic where abortion were performed. He wa later convicted and served two and a half month in prison. During the protest outside the clinic, he and several other protester locked themselves in a homemade contraption called the oven, made of cement and iron. It took police officer several hour to lug the device to a horse trailer that carted it off. At the same protest, one man glued his head to a lock on a gate surrounding the clinic, a move some protester later said wa an accident. Abortion opponent like Mrs. Hayes and Mrs. Quinn speak of attending peaceful observance at abortion clinic and offering prayer for the unborn. They talk about counseling woman about alternative to abortion at Roman Catholic pregnancy center, and their support of anti-abortion candidate. But they also say they saw nothing wrong with Weslin trying to block access to clinic. They describe the activity a peaceful resistance meant to stop what they see a murder. Weslin and the other house guest of Mrs. Hayes and Mrs. Quinn come recommended from friend and member of local Catholic church, they said, adding that most are speaker at local church or anti-abortion event. And although they say they would never take into their home a stranger wanted by the FBI, like Kopp, they concede that they sometimes know little about their guest. But Mrs. Hayes and Mrs. Quinn say they know a lot about Weslin. An Army veteran, he ha been a leader of the anti-abortion movement for more than 25 year, they say, and founded a home for unwed mother. Mrs. Hayes said that when she met him, it wa obvious he wa a man of peace who had a tremendous devotion to the Blessed Mother and basically recognized that we are helpless lamb. Barbara Fredericks, another local abortion opponent who developed tie to the Lambs after Weslin came to town, added that the priest epitomized a man of God. I just knew when I looked at his holy shoe and his simple coat that had been mended 50 time, she said. He wa humble, a man who wa doing this for a higher purpose, trying to save people through sacrifice and prayer. opp also ha robust defender among the people who housed him a he rode about the country from protest to protest. E. Kenny, 20, said that his parent housed Kopp in their St. Albans, Vt., home for two year after he spoke at their local church in 1988. During Kopp's stay, he wa a pleasure, Kenny said, always helping around the house. He wa a nice guy, kind of like an uncle to u, Kenny said. He'd sit around and play video game with u and make u model plane out of wood. Like Weslin, Kopp wa consumed by a need to fight abortion and often talked about it evil, Kenny said, adding that Kopp wa a gentle man who wanted to become a Catholic priest. He wa always in a good mood, Kenny said. He never did anything violent at all. Both Kopp and Weslin have been arrested repeatedly during abortion protest. The men have moved in the same circle and at time found themselves arrested at the same event. Mrs. Quinn said that Weslin told her in a recent telephone conversation that he knew Kopp. Weslin could not be reached for comment, but it is clear that the two men have encountered each other. Both faced misdemeanor charge after blocking a Burlington, Vt., health clinic in 1990 that Kopp called the mill. And they spent time in the same jail in Atlanta in 1988 after a clinic protest. Slepian's death ha abortion opponent like Mrs. Hayes and Mrs. Quinn worried, both about how the killing is being portrayed in the medium and what it will do to membership in group like the Lambs of Christ. For a long time, you felt like the voice in the desert that wasn't being heard, Mrs. Hayes said. And then there wa this horrible tragedy of this doctor's death becoming the face of the movement. We're about saving life, she said. The FBI ha not talked to Mrs. Hayes, but Kenny said that agent have spoken to him. The Justice Department say that a Federal task force set up this week to investigate the killing of Slepian is looking for evidence connecting anti-abortion violence at various clinic. It's fair to say that when investigating these event, we will look at any connection between individual engaged in criminal conduct, Myron Marlin, a spokesman for the department, said. Many local Catholics associated with the Lambs of Christ have tried to distance themselves from the killing of Slepian. They are mailing literature saying that the killer doe not represent their movement. In addition, some people associated with the Lambs are offering other possible explanation for the killing. Some say they believe that the killer might have been someone overcome by grief after a personal experience with abortion. Others wondered whether the shooter had tried to wound the doctor to scare him or prevent him from performing more abortion. The Lambs also wonder whether abortionist opponent are being blamed for a shooting committed by a disgruntled patient. One idea gaining currency among the Lambs, and prominently displayed on their Web site, suggests that the killing wa the result of a plot by abortion supporter to discredit abortion opponent just before last week's election. Mrs. Hayes say she doesn't know the truth. There are wacko who travel around and they may be in front of the clinic because we are drawn to the same place, she said. But you don't know everyone who show up and you don't turn to the person next to you and tell them they don't belong there. Mrs. Fredericks said that anyone who would shoot a doctor who provides abortion wa someone who had snapped, perhaps because of the importance of the situation. Members of the Lambs of Christ and other opponent of abortion in Rochester wonder whether the killing of Slepian will hinder their effort. When Weslin first arrived two year ago, he brought new focus to a group that often had done little more than counsel pregnant woman and set up booth on college campus, they said. In many city, they have a priest for life coordinating and leading rosary march against abortion, Mrs. Quinn said. But with Father Weslin coming here, we could finally come together and feel like we were doing something sacrificial a a group. Mrs. Hayes said that she felt the first pull of the movement in the early 1980s, when she heard woman speak about choice in regard to abortion. Then she saw Silent Scream, a well-known anti-abortion film that purport to show the footage of an abortion. What I saw wa the end of life, she said. She began to volunteer at a Catholic pregnancy center where she encouraged woman not to kill their child. She also began to house unwed mother and went to stand vigil outside local clinic where abortion were performed. Mrs. Hayes looked at her 3-month-old daughter, Bernadette, then pointed to the prenatal image of the infant, a sonogram taken at 13 week that she keep on her refrigerator door. She described what could have been her baby's fate, had she been someone else's child. Two pound and two inch ago, she could have been a partial-birth abortion, Mrs. Hayes said, referring to a controversial late-term abortion procedure. They have the hardest time getting the shoulder out, so they can get to the head and puncture it. It's brutal, but what do you expect when the purpose is a dead baby? There's no question that these doctor are trying to murder a child. ","Dr. Barnett Slepian, the mainstay of Buffalo's only abortion clinic, was slain as he stood at his kitchen window.Slepian has been described as a fatalist who stubbornly adhered to doing what he thought right.The FBI is looking for James Kopp for questioning as a material witness in the slaying.Kopp has long been identified as a major voice in the anti-abortion movement.Attorney General Reno will investigate if the slaying is part of a nation-wide plot.In Canada, authorities are worried that new violence could erupt as Remembrance Day approaches.Anti-abortion pamphlets have been delivered to a Canadian newspaper, possibly by Kopp.","On Oct. 23, 1998, a sniper killed Dr. Barnet Slepian, a mainstay in the last abortion clinic in the Buffalo area and one of only a few doctors performing the procedure in the face of protesters and threats.Many of the protesters are itinerants like Rev. Norman Weslin, founder of the anti-abortion group Lambs of Christ, who travel about spreading their message and shutting down clinics.Another itinerant demonstrator, James Charles Kopp, is wanted by the FBI as a material witness in the Slepian murder.In addition to anti-abortion violence, a shortage of doctors who are trained and willing to do the procedures imperil their widespread availability.","The primary doctor at the last abortion clinic in Buffalo, NY, was shot and killed.Dr. Slepian, a stubborn man, dedicated to women's care, and an unlikely martyr.It's the 7th such death, and the 4th similar attack.James Kopp is sought as a material witness.The anti-abortion movement has local and itinerate members.Their activities go from prayers and talking to confrontations, threats and violence.After this killing, the FBI resumed a search for an anti-abortion conspiracy.Since the first few years after Roe v Wade, the number of abortions has declined, as has the number of clinics and doctors providing the procedure, especially for poorer women.","Abortion clinics continue to be targeted by anti-abortion groups such as Operation Rescue, Lambs of Christ, and Army of God.Opposition ranges from silent vigils to vocal and physical intimidation, and even murder.Dr. Bart Shepian of Buffalo's only abortion clinic was murdered in his home.Police in the US and Canada are looking for James Kopp, a known abortion opponent, as a material witness in that murder.The clinics serve poor, young, and uneducated women since the well-to-do use their established providers.AG Janet Reno has named a task force to find out if the Slepian murder, the third in five years, is part of an organized campaign of violence."

A panicky telephone call in poor Swedish wa the first word that authority got of a fire racing through a dance hall crowded with immigrant teen-agers, delaying fire squads' response to the blaze that killed 60 and injured 162, official said Saturday. Per-Olof Ortarsen of Goteborg's emergency service line said the call wa so hard to understand that it took three minute for worker to figure out what wa going on and where to send fire truck. The first fire truck and rescue squad were on the scene six minute after the call wa received, Ortarsen said at a news conference. He and other official declined to comment on whether a quicker response could have saved any of the mostly immigrant victim. The minute of delay felt endless to those caught in the terror of the fire and survivor have spoken angrily of what they saw a a slow and even obstructive response. No help. No police. No fireman, 17-year-old Zuhir Hersi, one of the disc jockey at the bash, said Friday, hour after the blaze exploded. Just kid helping kid. And once the squad arrived, the kid were blocked from helping, they say. We could have saved more young people if only police hadn't stopped u, Mohanned Hussein wa quoted a saying by the newspaper Expressen. On Saturday, hundred of people stood quietly outside the gutted building amid flower and candle a they attempted to come to grip with catastrophe. In the parking lot that a day before had been a tumult of ambulance and scream, mourner had laid a 30-meter-long (100-foot-long) pile of bouquet, candle and card of remembrance. The cards' inscription were brief I will see you in heaven, We miss you and the people who stood reading them also had few word. I just wanted to show my sympathy. I think about them. There's nothing else we can do, said Caroline Ericsson, who didn't know any of the victim. For Lasse Gustavsson, having the right word wasn't a important a showing his face, severely disfigured in a fire. The former Goteborg firefighter lost his ear, his eyelid and most of his nose in a gas explosion. By showing up, he said, he wanted to show the victims' relative and friend that spirit can help them pull through despair. I can't give them hope. Consolation is enough, he said, a people nearby cast uneasy glance at his scar. Many of those injured in the blaze may have to endure similar shocked look the rest of their life. Authorities say the explosive fire quickly raised the temperature in the overcrowded hall to 600 degree (1,100 F). The cause of the fire that broke out just before midnight Thursday remains under investigation. Witness account have varied widely, with some reporting smoke coming from the cellar and others saying the fire appeared to start in the ceiling of the dance hall on the building's second floor. The fire's quick spread ha prompted speculation that it could have been set, but official also say the explosive spread could have been because the fire had been burning undetected for some time. What's known is that the hall wa packed far beyond it capacity. Licensed to hold a maximum of 150, the hall held at least 250 and perhaps a many a 400 when the fire hit. The crowd wa mostly teen-agers and mostly immigrant or child of immigrant parent. They had come for a dance organized by eight party-arrangers whom police have not identified; the hall wa rented by the organizer from the local Macedonian immigrant association. Officials said the dead and injured were of 19 nationality, including Somalis, Ethiopians, Iraqis, Iranians and Swedes, a well a people from the current and former Yugoslavia and unspecified Latin American country. Identifying the dead wa a wrackingly slow process, forcing relative and friend already exhausted with dread to wait for hour at hospital. Only 18 of the dead had been identified by midday Saturday. The identification is hard because they have no driver's license or other document they were so young, said Kerstin Einarsson of Sahlgrenska Hospital, the largest in the city of 435,000 resident about 300 mile (500 kilometer) west of Stockholm. The worst previous Swedish fire disaster in modern history wa in 1978 in Boraas, when 20 people died in a hotel fire. Forensic expert examining heavily burned body were able Saturday to identify more of the 60 young people who died in a dance hall fire, but the catastrophe's most tormenting question wa still unanswered. How could it happen; what caused the flame that raced through a hall packed far beyond capacity, blocking one of the exit and forcing panicked teen-agers to flee down the one remaining staircase and leap out of second-story window? As long a the technician haven't established the cause of the fire, we don't know if it's arson or not, Goteborg chief prosecutor Ulf Noren said Saturday evening. Earlier in the day, Noren had said it wa a 50-50 chance that the fire wa arson, prompting wide speculation that authority had tracked down new clue. But Noren later retracted the remark, saying he'd meant only that no possibility were being excluded. As investigator worked to find the cause, examiner identified another 22 of the body, bringing the total to 40, and official said 49 people were released from hospital. Of the 162 people who suffered non-fatal injury in the Thursday night fire, 76 remain hospitalized. Most of the victim were immigrant or of immigrant parentage, from country including Iraq, Iran, Somalia, Ethiopia and current and former Yugoslavia. The first call alerting authority to the fire wa made in heavily accented Swedish and that, combined with noise and the caller's distress, delayed the fire squads' response by several minute. Per-Olof Ortarsen of Goteborg's emergency service line said the call wa so hard to understand that it took three minute for worker to figure out what wa going on and where to send fire truck.

The crowd in the second story of the building contained mostly 13 to 18 year old celebrating Halloween and a holiday weekend. A night full of expectation, happiness over extra leave from school and high spirit in anticipation of a weekend wa brutally and suddenly changed into a tragedy of incomprehensible dimension, the Goteborg city council said in a statement. Goteborg is today a city in shock. Prime Minister Goeran Persson visited the fire site at midday and King Carl XVI Gustav made a statement of condolence. Jamal Fawz, 15, told TT that he wa out on the dance floor when the blaze started with about 400 people inside. It looked like it started in the ceiling, and lamp and loudspeaker fell to the floor, he wa quoted a saying. It wa chaos. Everybody wa trying to get out and people trampled on each other on the way to the exit. . Others kicked out the window and jumped out. Ambulances were called in from several nearby community. The Goteborg rescue service also brought city bus into service to help transport the injured. Anna-Lisa Saar, a social worker at Oestra Hospital, where many of the victim were taken, said identifying many of them wa difficult. Maybe you have teen-agers yourself and know how they are . They maybe don't have their own identification, but have that of a friend who is a year older. Girls don't carry their identification on them, but in a bag and maybe that wasn't lying with the body, she said, according to TT. Goteborg ha about 435,000 people. Hundreds of teen-agers jammed into an upstairs hall planning to dance the night away, but by the time the sun rose Friday they were dead, clinging to life in hospital or weeping in disbelief at a fire that killed 67 of them. Police said another 173 people were injured, 20 of them severely, in the explosive fire that engulfed the plain brick two-story building just before midnight Thursday and turned a boisterous disco dance into a screaming terror in a matter of moment. Bent metal bar on some of the hall's window showed the panic-fueled strength that the teen-agers, many of them immigrant, exerted a they sought way out of the hall, which with some 400 people inside wa crowded to more than twice it legal capacity. Below the second-floor window lay stray shoe, broken glass and bloody blanket used to wrap those who may or may not have lived. I've been cry all day. I haven't been able to sleep. I'm alive, so why should I sleep when my friend are dead, 17-year-old Alina Turk said a she stood outside the ruined building Friday afternoon. She said she had been at the dance and two male friend of hers died. Zuhir Hersi, the 17-year-old disc jockey at the bash, told of his ordeal in telegraphic burst. Panic. No help. No police. No fireman. Only kid helping each other, he said from his bed in a Goteborg hospital. Although Hersi, like many of the youth at the dance, belief the police and fireman were slow, authority said the first fire truck were on the scene within five minute of getting the alarm. But the fire spread so fast that even an instant response would likely have been too slow. The cause of the fire had not been determined a of Friday evening. Fire Brigade Engineer Bo Wahlstroem said the flames' quick, raging spread could indicate arson, or that the fire had burned undetected for a time before exploding. The fire destroyed the building, whose second floor, where the dance took place, wa rented by the local Macedonian immigrant association in Sweden's second-largest city. The association had hired out the hall for the night to eight party arranger, police said but declined to identify the arranger. The crowd wa mostly aged 13 to 18, witness said, and consisted mostly of immigrant or child of immigrant parent. Officials said the dead and injured were of 19 nationality, including Somalis, Ethiopians, Iraqis, Iranians and Swedes, a well a people from the current and former Yugoslavia and unspecified Latin American country. Identifying the dead wa a wrackingly slow process, forcing relative and friend exhausted with dread to wait for hour at hospital. Some were able to make the wait in room off-limits to journalist, but many had to wait in corridor, cry and teen-agers hurry in and out of room a they looked for their pal. Only 14 body had been indentified by Friday evening. The identification is hard not only because of the burn but also because they have no driver's license or other document they were so young, said Kerstin Einarsson of Sahlgrenska Hospital, the largest in the city of 435,000 some 500 kilometer (300 mile) west of Stockholm. The blaze, the worst fire disaster in Sweden's modern history, shocked a country renowned for it smooth calmness. King Carl XVI Gustaf, on a trip out of the country, sent a statement reassuring victims' relative that all of u in Sweden feel great sympathy. Prime Minister Goeran Persson travelled from Stockholm to the fire site, first laying flower outside and walking into the gutted wreck. The floor wa full of shoe and boot, the same kind of boot my own child wear, he said. On Friday evening, about 1,500 mostly young people, came to the Goteborg Cathedral to try to assuage their grief and bewilderment at a memorial service. The youth were dressed in the same sort of hip-hop garb that the dance-goers had worn, but listened to delicate hymn instead of pounding disco. They wept, they embraced, and some looked around nervously, apparently not knowing how to behave in a church. I don't go to church. I'm a Muslim, but I don't go to prayer, said a young man who gave his name only a Sami. I'm accompanying my Christian friend. We lost someone. We're mourning that's all. ","A fire at an overcrowded dance hall in Goteborg, Sweden killed 60 and injured 180.Most victims were 13-18, immigrants covering 19 nationalities.The 2-story brick building was rated for 150 but held 400.Owned by the Macedonian Association, it had been rented out to 8 party arrangers for a Halloween dance, held on the 2nd floor.One of two exit stairways was blocked by fire.A panicky phone call in poor Swedish to authorities took 3 minutes to understand.Fire trucks were on the scene 6 minutes later.The explosive, fast-spreading fire reached 600C.It may have burned undetected for some time.Arson was a possibility but the cause remains undetermined.","Sweden's deadliest fire occurred on Halloween when a dance hall in Goteborg, filled with teenagers, burst into flames.The cause is not known, but the hall, approved for 150, contained as many as 400 and one of the two exits was blocked.Sixty were killed and between 150 and 173 injured.Most were immigrants or their children and represented 19 nationalities.Many felt the rescue was late.Rescuers said they had trouble understanding the first call, but were there in 6 minutes.Condolences came from Swedish authorities.A memorial service was held and a memory wall was growing.Although identifications are difficult, 40 of the dead have been identified.","At least 60 teenagers were killed and another 160 were injured in a dance hall fire in Goteborg, Sweden, Sweden's second largest city.The fire was the worst in Sweden's modern history.At least 400 teenagers, attending a Halloween dance, were crammed into a facility meant to hold 150.The dance attendees were mostly immigrant children from representing 19 nationalities, including Somalia, Ethiopia, Iraq, Iran and former Yugoslavia.The cause of the fire, which quickly engulfed the two-story brick building is unknown as investigators continue to probe the ruins.Emergency help was delayed by about three minutes because of language difficulties.","A fire rapidly destroyed a Goteborg, Sweden dance hall as some 400 teenaged Halloween revelers jammed up while trying to evacuate.At least 60 died, mostly from smoke inhalation, and about 150 were injured.The actual capacity of the 2nd floor dance hall was 150.Forensic experts are having success identifying the burned bodies but the question of how the fire began is still unanswered.The blaze gutted the entire building owned by the Macedonian Association.Mostly immigrants attended the dance.The fire squads say they lost about six minutes while trying to respond to a call in poor Swedish.It is doubtful a quicker response would have made a difference."
1026,"Hours after Darryl Strawberry wa released from Columbia Presbyterian Medical Center Friday, he spoke happily about being able to play with his two young child, joked about eating a small amount of chicken and potato and sounded relieved to be at home in Fort Lee, N.J., instead of in a hospital. I'm really feeling good, said Strawberry, in a telephone interview. It's nice to be home with the kid and to just kick back. That's all that I'm going to do. This feel good. Strawberry, who underwent surgery to remove a cancer from his colon on Oct. 3, said he will remain in New Jersey for another 10 or 12 day before returning home to Rancho Mirage, Calif. The 36-year old outfielder, who lost a significant amount of weight from his 215-pound frame, said he doe not have enough strength to attend any of the World Series game and is content watching his teammate play the Padres on television. My heart is with them, said Strawberry, who spoke to several Yankees after they won the American League championship. I'm just going to relax at home and watch the game. I'm looking forward to it. I may not be there, but it'll feel like I am. Paul O'Neill echoed the sentiment of many Yankees by saying, Everything we're going through is game. This is his life. Any time we get some good news about Darryl it's uplifting. We're all praying for him. Since cancerous cell were found in one of the 36 lymph node removed from his abdomen during the operation, Strawberry said doctor told him he will need six month of chemotherapy treatment once he return to California. The 36-year-old outfielder said doctor told him he will need one treatment of at least one hour a week. I wa never scared, said Strawberry. I wa more emotional than anything. At the time of it, I had played for a while with this. I wanted to keep playing because I knew we were going to get into the World Series. At that point, Strawberry stopped and laughed, probably because the Yankees had made it to the World Series a he expected. I wanted to be there because that's what you play for, said Strawberry. I don't think that I wa ever scared. It's something that I wanted to deal with head on. I talked to Eric Davis about the chemo. He said it's not a bad a some people say. Although the discovery of cancer in one lymph node proved that the cancer had spread, Strawberry remained optimistic about his future and said, It didn't worry me. I got all the information from the doctor. One out of 36 is good. It wasn't spreading. It didn't run off and get crazy like cancer can. When Strawberry wa released from the hospital in a wheelchair Friday, a few hundred fan who had congregated chanted, Darryl, Darryl. Strawberry, who struggled not to cry, hugged a few nurse, thanked everyone for supporting him, then rose from the wheelchair and carefully entered a car. Wow, I never thought this day would come, Strawberry said. But it ha. Unlike David Wells, Saturday night's starter in the World Series who predicted the Yankees would throttle the Padres in five game, Strawberry refused to make a prediction about whether he will soon be getting his third World Series ring. But Strawberry, who is still hopeful about returning to play in 1999, sounded very confident in the 1998 Yankees, who are wearing his number 39 on the back of their cap a inspiration. They look really good, said Strawberry. It's not going to be easy, but I think they're ready. The best thing about making it to the World Series is you know you don't have to go anywhere else after that. You've made it to that point and then you go do the best you can do. That's what it's all about. As Bernie Williams start what could be his final series with the Yankees in Game 1 of the World Series at Yankee Stadium Saturday night, he want to do it with a free mind. Free of worrying about his extremely uncertain future and an undisclosed personal matter that ha made this post-season a perplexing a it ha been pleasing. But it is not easy to keep the mind uncluttered. Williams doe not know if he will sign with the Yankees and return to center field next season, because he want to test free agency. There is a good chance the Yankees will not offer him the most lavish contract, so Williams might be forced to decide between the fattest paycheck and a new situation in the baseball city of his choice or a pretty fat paycheck and a familiar situation in the Bronx. Scott Boras, Williams' agent, compared his client with player in the $10 million-a-year bracket last season, so that price tag ha surely escalated after Williams won the American League batting title with a .339 average while drilling 26 homer and knocking in 97 run. Williams wa asked if he agreed with the theory that other team will outbid the Yankees. I do not know, said Williams, who ha been aloof during this post-season, but ha declined to discus why. And I'm thinking about this a little more than I would like to. I would like to keep my focus on the series. It is not an issue Williams or the Yankees want to study Saturday or in the coming day, because the team is four victory away from a championship. Still, it is an issue that hovers over the Yankees a ominously a the owner George Steinbrenner hovers over general manager Brian Cashman. It's a tough thing, Cashman said about balancing the excitement of being in the World Series with the reality of trying to re-sign Williams. You know the ugliness of the future is right in front of you. Although Williams ha been adamant about not discussing the future, he relented slightly Friday. When a reporter asked him what the reason would be for staying with the Yankees, Williams' answer included an escape clause. Just the fact that I've been here my whole career, Williams said. That ha a lot to do with it. The relationship that I've come to know during the year, I think it would be very hard, but not impossible, to start from scratch somewhere else. Williams continued: But I think the reality of the game in this day and age is thing happen. You can't really write thing in stone that they're going to happen. People get traded. People become free agent and go to other team. I have to make a decision really thinking about all the people I'm accountable for. When Williams wa asked what better situation could a player have than being the center fielder for the Yankees, winning a batting crown and being in the World Series, the 30-year-old wa stumped. Wow, that's pretty good right there, Williams said. It's funny you mention that, because I really haven't thought about any of that. I think, at some point in the off season, I wa going to sit down and think, wow, it wasn't a bad year at all. While Cashman would not discus financial matter, another Yankee official said the team will not offer Williams a much a $12 million a year unless Steinbrenner get generous after a possible championship. It is more likely that the Yanks would offer Williams in the $10 million-a-year range. I'd hate to have to speculate on something at this point, Cashman said. We'll give it our best effort to sign him at a level that we're comfortable with. Hopefully, that will be enough. Then we'll have a marriage. If not, we'll have a divorce. While Williams ha earned the right to become a free agent and pursue the contract he want in the city he want, he ha interesting choice to make. When a reporter asked Williams how he would respond to someone who suggested that he accept le from the Yankees to remain in a city where he is popular, where he like his teammate and manager, and where the team ha been in the post-season for four straight year, he did not hesitate to answer. My response to that would be it's not the time right now to start thinking about that, Williams said. If I start thinking about that, it'll distract me to what I need to do in the World Series. Williams then talked about how the Yankees are at the end of a remarkable season and how he did not want his situation to disrupt that. But, with Williams' status uncertain, he wa asked if the next four to seven game would be bittersweet, since he could be ending a 13-year association with the Yankees. I don't want to talk about that, Williams said. I'm going to have a lot of fun out there. I'm going to go all out. Then Williams walked away from the interview. The New York Times said in an editorial on Saturday, Oct. 17: It is fitting that this most memorable of baseball season should conclude with a World Series that open Saturday night in Yankee Stadium, the aging but still grand cathedral of the sport. Bedecked in bunting and banner, the revered ballpark always elevates the game with it aura of history and accomplishment. That make it the perfect venue for part of a championship series that will determine whether the 1998 Yankees are one of the greatest team of the modern era, or just a talented squad that owned the regular season but folded in the World Series. New Yorkers are a boisterous, boastful bunch, and the patter of the city this week ha been loud and arrogant, or so it must seem to anyone venturing here from San Diego to root for the Padres. The word on the sidewalk and in the subway is that the Padres don't measure up against the Yankees. Sure, they have lethal starting pitcher in Kevin Brown and Andy Ashby, and one of the game's best closer in Trevor Hoffman, not to mention prolific hitter like Tony Gwynn and Greg Vaughn, who is hobbling but still dangerous. But how is that a match for the Yankees' World Series starting rotation of David Wells, Orlando Hernandez, David Cone and Andy Pettitte, bullpen flamethrower Mariano Rivera, plus the deepest batting order in baseball? Yet the truth is that Yankees fan are terrified the team will crumple. Baseball fan, even Yankee fan, can spend a lifetime waiting to see a home team of historic caliber, and this Yankee team will not reach that sanctified status unless it end it record-setting season by winning the World Series. The doubt keep creeping up. The team wa pitiful at the plate through most of the playoff. Tino Martinez, the top run producer, ha been in a numbing slump. Bernie Williams, the American League batting champ, hit well in the pennant series against the Cleveland Indians, but ha seemed distracted by personal matter. Shane Spencer, the rookie slugging sensation of September, hasn't turned out to be the new Mr. October. Pettitte ha been struggling since August. The curious thing about this team, which won more game during the regular season than any team in American League history, is how quiet and unobtrusive it can be. It sport no dominant superstar, no swaggering clubhouse leader, no one who seems to belong in New York. So when the Yankees start to drift on the field, fan tend to fear the team might simply fade away. Until the Indians surged temporarily ahead in the playoff, the Yankees had faced no serious test of resiliency all season. New Yorkers can already taste that ticker-tape parade up Broadway. But behind every mighty cheer at the stadium Saturday night will lurk the fear that when the curtain fall on the season, an unheralded and unlegendary team from San Diego will be the one that is remembered. The last time they were seen on the field at Yankee Stadium, they were inadvertently influencing the outcome of the game that sent the Cleveland Indians home and the Yankees to the World Series. That's not to say the umpire will mess up in the World Series, but they have shown they are eminently capable of interfering with the natural progression of postseason game. All right, so Ted Hendry won't be in the World Series; the umpires' collective bargaining agreement with the league doe not allow an umpire to work both a league championship series and the World Series. Joe Brinkman won't be here either, even though the agreement doe allow for an umpire to work both a division series and the World Series. The three American League umpire who are on the six-man World Series crew did work in the first round of the playoff. One of them, Richie Garcia, will be the crew chief and behind the plate in Saturday night's opener at Yankee Stadium. Gene Budig, the AL president, Friday called Garcia, a 24-year veteran, one of the league's most respected umpire. But after Saturday night, Garcia will move to right field Sunday night for Game 2. Now why doe that combination sound familiar, Richie Garcia and right field? Ah yes, the last time Garcia worked a post-season series at Yankee Stadium, he wa the umpire in Game 1 of the league championship series two year ago when a young fan from New Jersey no name, please; he ha been over-glorified enough reached over the fence and caught Derek Jeter's fly ball just a Tony Tarasco, Baltimore's right fielder, prepared to catch it. Garcia ruled no interference, that it wa a home run, then said oops after watching a television replay clearly showing interference. Too late. The call helped the Yankees win the first game and set the tone for the series. Even though he made a mistake, you know you have the best out there, a baseball official, speaking on the condition of anonymity, said. That knowledge come a small consolation to the Orioles. Budig, too, acknowledged that umpire, like player and manager, aren't perfect. Major league umpire are skilled at what they do, but they are human, he said in a telephone interview. Day in and day out they do a very good job for Major League Baseball. Rounds one and two have been difficult, but that happens from time to time. The umpire were so human in the American League playoff that it happened from time to time to time to time. The Cleveland Indians suffered the brunt of the fallibility of the umpire. We had a highlight reel of umpire getting knocked down by baseball, general manager John Hart said after the Indians' final game against the Yankees. The umpire didn't lose the game for u, but we had our share of controversy in two playoff series with umpire. In the division series against Boston, Brinkman, the plate umpire, wa so bad with his call on pitch and play at the plate that he immediately provoked dispute that led to his ejecting of Mike Hargrove, the Indians' manager, three pitch into Game 2, and Dwight Gooden, their starting pitcher, 19 pitch later. Hendry wa right or wrong, depending on one's point of view, for his noncall of interference on Travis Fryman in the 12th inning of Game 2 of the ALCS. That ruling went in favor of the Indians. Little else did. In Game 4, Jeter wa stealing second in the fifth inning when the on-target throw from Sandy Alomar Jr. hit Jim McKean, who jumped to try to get out of the way but instead kicked the ball into right field. A batted ball, Omar Vizquel's line drive, struck Hendry in Game 6. But the worst call of Game 6 wa Hendry's on a force play at second base. Hendry called Bernie Williams safe, ruling that Vizquel's foot came off the base before he caught the ball. Members of the Yankees indicated Friday that they, too, thought the call wa wrong. I don't know, Williams said when asked what he thought, but I'll take it. It wa a big play. But did he think he wa out? I'd rather not comment about that, he said. It will stir a lot of controversy. I don't want to get into that. When a player belief he wa safe, he say so and doesn't worry about any subsequent controversy. If Williams wa implying that he thought he wa out, another member of the Yankees said he had no doubt that Williams wa out. I wasn't sure at first, this uniformed member of the team said, but when I saw it wa Hendry, I said uh-oh. I also thought Omar is so smooth you'd think he wouldn't come off the bag. Then I saw the replay. He wa out. The game today is faster than it used to be, this observer said. The umpire have to be sharper. Maybe Garcia, Dale Scott and Tim Tschida from the American League, and Jerry Crawford, Dana DeMuth and Mark Hirschbeck from the National League, will be a sharp a an 18th century French guillotine in these four to seven game. Leonard Coleman, the NL president, said he thought his umpire were first-rate in the division and league series and added that he ha three splendid umpire working the World Series. Budig said: The World Series crew is proven and first-rate. We have total confidence in them. The umpire should let the player make the error and the manager the bad decision. Then everyone will talk about the player and manager and not the umpire. A strong sign that this city is going bonkers for the Padres came Friday morning when 680 fan agreed to shave their head for a radio promotion raffle in return for a 1-in-680 chance at skybox ticket for post-season play. This wa more a show of support for the team than it wa for the one ticket, said Tommy Sablan, producer of the Jeff and Jer show. It wa symbolic of the effort of the bald Padres Tony Gwynn, Wally Joyner, Greg Vaughn, Jim Leyritz. About a thousand people showed up men, woman and child. We had 10 barber and 20 hairdresser and it took six hour for the line to either get buzzed or straight-razored. We were shocked at the turnout. But this is a bandwagon town. `Buy the ticket on the day of the concert' type public. You'll see an even bigger bandwagon on Monday when they've won and then hopefully we play the Yankees and it's a real World Series. After the Padres beat the Braves, 3-0, in Game 2 of the National League Championship Series on Thursday night in Atlanta to take a two-game lead in the four-of-seven-game series, San Diego fan began gearing up for a shot at the World Series in more traditional way. It would be the team's first World Series appearance since 1984, and in the downtown business district Friday, marquee and banner read Go Padres and a lunch-hour rally wa attended by several hundred fan. The Padres set an attendance record of 2,555,901 this season, up a half-million from last year and nearly a million and a half from three year ago. It stemmed in part from an effort by John Moores, the Padres owner, and Larry Lucchino, the team's president, to put family entertainment in the park after they bought the team in December 1994. This is a more diversified group of fan than I saw in Atlanta, Lucchino said. Their crowd seemed yuppified. We're proud of our three generation of family who come to the game. Donna McMahon, a 63-year-old homemaker from La Jolla, ha been a fan since she wa 10 and the Pacific Coast League Padres played at Lane Field near the harbor. She would take a streetcar after school to meet her father, and he would buy bleacher seat. Later, she brought her four child to Jack Murphy Stadium for the National League Padres when 2,500 people wa a crowd. Now, she brings her grandchild to a sold-out Qualcomm Stadium. There are different group in the stand, she said, the upper class, the middle class, the business person, the beer-drinking fan, the child, all of the Mexican fan from across the border. We are true fan all of u. San Diego Mayor Susan Golding agrees, while also giving credit to the balmy weather. Padre fan are a cross-section from all over the county, she said. Downtown, suburban, rural, east, north, rancher and farmer to high-tech engineer, yuppie to the new kid the X generation. A lot from across the border. The Padres are extremely popular in Tijuana. We do have the perfect weather for a long baseball season. Playing in the World Series in October ha got to be better than in New York. Carlos Carrion, who wa born in San Diego and ha been a baseball fan for 25 year, brings his 10- and 8-year-old son to the stadium. This is a great chance to let my child see the player work, Carrion said. They can look up to these guy and understand their character and their work ethic. The Padres ticket office estimate that on average, more than 15,000 fan in the 65,000-seat stadium are Latin Americans from San Diego, Baja California or the state of Sonora. The Padres have the first major league baseball souvenir store in Tijuana. A new shipment of bat arrived for Tino Martinez on Friday, and he massaged the handle to make sure they were thin enough, knocked on the barrel and listened for a certain sound and swung them slowly again and again. Martinez wa so excited about the fresh bat, he reacted like a Little Leaguer who wa wielding an aluminum bat for the first time. You were saving the World Series tree until now, right? Martinez said to the representative from the bat company. These are from World Series tree, aren't they? Martinez could joke about the bat being specially designed for the World Series because the Yankees began their quest for a second title in the past three year when they play host to the San Diego Padres in Game 1 at Yankee Stadium Saturday night. Major leaguer player who were watching on television could not imitate David Letterman and joke about World Series wood. Even though Martinez ha struggled with numerous bat during the post-season, he could joke because the Yankees are still alive for the title. Martinez is still alive. For now, Martinez, the power hitter who ha mostly been missing in action, could joke around. For now. You always get a fresh start in the post-season because it's game to game, said Martinez. If you win, you've got another game the next day so you forget about the bad at-bat. It's easier to do that in post-season because your next at-bat could be the biggest at-bat of the season. Normally, having Martinez at the plate for the biggest at-bat of the season would be a pleasing sight to the Yankees. But not when the calendar flip to October. Martinez ha experienced another frustrating post-season. He is 5 for 30 with 10 strikeout, no homer and only 1 run batted in for a hitting-starved team that ha batted .229 while still winning 7 of 9 post-season game because of superior pitching. Can the Yankees continue to win if Martinez, their most valuable run producer, is a sometime single hitter? We've just gotten through two good series, said Paul O'Neill. The Yankees won those series. You don't focus on one guy. You focus on winning. The whole team won. As much a Joe Torre talked about Martinez needing one line-drive hit to get him in a groove, the 30-year-old first baseman is in a career drought in the post-season. Since joining the Yankees, Martinez is 20 for 107 (.187) with one homer and 4 RBI in 29 post-season game. Those are puny statistic, especially for a player who ha driven in 381 run in 455 regular season game over the last three year. I would guess that Tino would have a great series, O'Neill said. Baseball ha a way of evening thing out. You have a bad series, you come back and have a great series. In the season, that's easier to do. In the post-season, it get tougher. It cannot get much tougher for Martinez, who wa dropped from fifth to sixth in the order during the American League Championship Series against the Cleveland Indians and will remain in that spot until further notice. Martinez ha blamed his paucity of production on impatience and on trying to do too much. He ha sometimes flailed at poor pitch during hitter's count of 3-1 and 2-0, instead of working the count, and he ha admitted that his previous failure in the post-season have caused him to pursue the obviously unattainable five-run homer. Actually, Martinez ha already made some alteration, and he ha reached base 7 time in his last 10 plate appearance on a double, a single, a hit-by-pitch and 4 walk. It is not enough to pacify George Steinbrenner, but it is something for him to cling to. Until last night, anyway, when Martinez had to face Kevin Brown, a nasty right-hander who had retired him in 30 of 34 career at-bat. If I wa getting good pitch and missing them, then I'd say I have a bad swing working, said Martinez. But I've been swinging at bad pitch. Right now, I've just got to be patient and wait. The Yankees will wait with him. They have to. In the 1996 World Series, Torre started Cecil Fielder over Martinez at first in Games 3, 4 and 5. It wa a difficult decision because Martinez had paced the team in RBI while Fielder did not join the Yankees until July 31. But the Yankees grabbed all three game so it worked. Torre doe not have such an attractive replacement this season in Luis Sojo. So the Yankees will stay with Martinez, for better or worse, while he try to stay positive and finally produce. It's the World Series, said Martinez. You got to go out there and have fun with it. Big game are all big game. You want to go out there and enjoy that game and try to do your best to win that game. You don't think that you might lose that day. Chuck Knoblauch and Tino Martinez were a popular a squeegee men a week ago, the speculation rampant that one or the other or both might be exiled if the Yankees' historic year crumbled in the post-season. Two big hit in the midst of a big inning changed all that Saturday night in Game 1 of the World Series. The Yankees trailed San Diego, 5-2, in the seventh inning, but Knoblauch hit a three-run home run to tie the score, and five batter later, Martinez smashed a grand slam. The seven-run explosion rocketed the Yankees to a 9-6 victory in the opener of the four-of-seven-game series, before 56,712 at Yankee Stadium. Orlando Hernandez will pitch against Andy Ashby in Game 2 Sunday night at the Stadium. Beyond seizing the advantage in the series, the Yankees were able to neutralize the Padres' ace, Kevin Brown, driving him from the mound in the seventh. Brown, seen by many a San Diego's best hope for a World Series upset, will not pitch again until Game 4, at the earliest. Brown wa pitching with a three-run lead after the top of the fifth, when Tony Gwynn and Greg Vaughn banged back-to-back homer. One out into the seventh, however, Jorge Posada hit a single, and Brown walked Ricky Ledee. Brown, who had thrown a whopping 64 pitch in the first three inning, went out, and the reliever Donne Wall came in to face Knoblauch. This is what the Yankees have done all season, force a starter from the game in the middle inning, before exploiting a middle reliever. Knoblauch, of course, had earned notoriety for his gaffe in the Game 2 of the American League Championship Series against Cleveland, standing and waiting for an interference call a the ball rolled to a stop behind him and the decisive run scored. The Yankees came back to win the series, however; Knoblauch got a reprieve and talked about how much the experience had helped him. Facing Wall with a one-ball, no-strike count, Knoblauch had to duck under a runaway fastball. Two ball, no strike. Wall had to throw a strike, Knoblauch swung hard and lifted a high fly down the left-field line. Off the bat, it did not look like much. But it kept carrying, Vaughn drifting back in left and looking up, to see the ball disappear into the stand. Tie game. Yankee Stadium shook. Knoblauch rounded the base, crossed home plate and thrust both arm into the air, yelling to the crowd, like a hyped Olympic weightlifter who had just successfully hoisted a half-ton. He stomped around the dugout, his helmet on, teammate banging on him happily. When Derek Jeter singled, nobody really noticed. Wall left the game, and Mark Langston took over. Paul O'Neill flied out, and after Jeter advanced on a wild pitch, Bernie Williams wa intentionally walked. Chili Davis drew a walk. Bases loaded, once more, with Martinez coming to the plate, with exactly one run batted in in his first 76 career at-bat in league championship and World Series game. With the count two ball and two strike, Langston threw a pitch near the outside corner that he thought should have been a strike. Instead, Garcia called it a ball. Langston glared, snapping at the return throw. Langston and Martinez and everyone on the field now understood that with the base loaded and a 3-2 count, Langston would have to throw what player refer to a a cookie a tasty pitch over the middle. Martinez ate up this cookie. The ball soared into the upper deck in right field, lifting three year of post-season misery off the back of the Yankees' first baseman, a grand slam. The crowd called out Martinez from the dugout again. Like Knoblauch, Martinez pumped both arm, and later the crowd would chant his name, and Martinez would wave his cap. San Diego's lead wa long gone. The Yankees had taken a 2-0 lead over Brown in the second inning, forcing him to throw 32 pitch in the second. They loaded the base with a single and two walk, and Ledee, the rookie left fielder who is playing because none of Torre's left fielder have been hitting, pulled a sinking fastball down the right field line with two out. The fan along the foul line stood, some waving to push the ball fair with the body English, and the ball landed on the line, skipping off the wall a two runner scored. The Yankees had the early edge, they had jumped on Brown, and they had their best pitcher on the mound. San Diego's Chris Gomez led off the second inning with a blooper over shortstop, the ball falling in for a single. Quilvio Veras flied to right, Gwynn grounded out and Gomez took second, bringing Vaughn to the plate. David Wells got ahead in the count, no ball and two strike, with a change-up and a fastball, before trying to run a fastball inside on Vaughn, who hit 50 home run during the regular season. Vaughn attacked the pitch: a line drive that landed in the second deck, foul all the way, but a frightening mistake. Jorge Posada, the Yankees' catcher, jogged to the mound to re-think the strategy, perhaps to remind Wells of the conventional wisdom: you must pitch Vaughn on the outer edge of the plate. Posada returned to the plate, called for an outside fastball, Wells threw. Vaughn's swing wa short and quick, the ball making a click sound off the bat, like a well-struck golf ball, before carrying over the wall in right-center field. Tie game. Wells retired the first two batter in the fifth inning, before jamming Veras with an inside fastball. Veras' bat snapped on contact, but it wa enough to send a looper into short center field, a single. Gwynn stepped in, having hit a single in his first two at-bat, and looked for a sign from the third base coach Tim Flannery. With a runner on first, he like to try to pull a ball through the right side of the infield. Wells fired a fastball, Gwynn turned on the pitch and ripped it, a line drive that crashed off the facing of the upper deck in right field. The Padres jumped from the dugout, celebrating, a Wells turned away, disgusted, asking for a new baseball. He got one, delivered another fastball, and Vaughn slugged this deep into the left field stand. Two pitch, two home run, the first back-to-back home run allowed by Wells since April 30. San Diego led, 5-2, and Yankee Stadium wa silent. It would not stay that way. The moment of truth for Chuck Knoblauch came in the bottom of the first inning when his name wa announced at Yankee Stadium for the first time since he neglected to chase down that memorable loose ball last Wednesday. There were no boo. It wa a very warm ovation. They liked him. They really liked him. Knoblauch exhaled. Knoblauch had emphasized before the game that he wa concerned about winning and rumbling into the World Series, not about the fan. But it surely made Knoblauch feel at home when he realized that the fan had forgiven him. Victories, more than time, had healed the malice toward Knoblauch and he could play second base without earplug. When the Yankees defeated the Indians, 9-5, in Game 6 on Tuesday night to advance to their second World Series in three year, Knoblauch wa easily the most relieved player on the field. The awful mistake that he had made in Game 2 would be forgotten. The Yankees had won the pennant, and Knoblauch wa celebrating a much a anyone. To have them act like that toward me wa tremendous, said Knoblauch, about the response that he received. It wa a great feeling, and it really helped me out. Knoblauch wa wearing a cap that declared the Yankees champion of the American League in 1998; Champagne dripped off the brim a he spoke. He did not look up, but continued to talk about how he had learned a lot by being vilified after making a mistake that Little Leaguers are expected not to make. Just to face thing and take it like a man and answer all the question, although they're tough, Knoblauch said. You see what you're made of when you have to bounce back from something like that. That's basically what I learned. If the Yankees had lost the ALCS, even some of Knoblauch's teammate had said that he would be branded a the villain for failing to pursue the ball that glanced off Travis Fryman's back while he wa running outside the baseline. Knoblauch had argued with the umpire while the go ahead run scored from first and the Indians won, 4-1. Now Knoblauch can watch television and read the newspaper again without getting queasy. That's huge for him, David Cone said. That's huge for me. I let them back into the game, and that would have been a tough one if they would have come back and beat u. And Knobbie, I'm sure he's feeling a lot better now. Knoblauch, who had two hit in five at-bat, wa working on his second bottle of Champagne five minute after reporter were allowed into the clubhouse. He flashed the sort of smile that he had not shown too much recently and, now that the Yankees are in the World Series, Knoblauch should expect to be teased often about his mistake. Maybe if we go all the way, we'll do that, Derek Jeter said. I don't know what I'll say, but I'll think of something good. YANKEES Pitching The starting pitching enabled the Yankees to advance past Cleveland in the American League Championship Series. David Wells is 7-1 in his career in the postseason and he should have an additional edge against a Padres' lineup that is generally le effective against left-handed pitching. Orlando Hernandez ha four terrific pitch, pitched seven shutout inning in the pivotal Game 4 of the ALCS and earned the start in Game 2 of this series. David Cone should benefit from six days' worth of rest when he start Game 3, a well a being able to pitch in warm Southern California. Mariano Rivera's stuff might be a good a it ha been all year, and Mike Stanton continues to be a dominant postseason pitcher. Reasons for concern: the erratic Andy Pettitte, who need a home-plate umpire to call strike on pitch low and away, and Jeff Nelson, who lost his command in his last brief outing. Offense There were sign in the ALCS that the offense is coming out of it collective slump Chuck Knoblauch is getting on base consistently, Derek Jeter is back to driving the ball to right field and through the middle, Bernie Williams had three hit in Game 6, and Scott Brosius ha been a consistent force at the bottom of the lineup. But the Yankees do have holes: Chili Davis will be hard-pressed to catch up to the fastball of Kevin Brown and Andy Ashby, and Tino Martinez's postseason funk is a problem. The Yankees could use a contribution from Jorge Posada, who will start in Games 1 and 2 and may get a chance to drive pitch low in the strike zone, where he can hit with power. Defense The Yankees have the best defense in baseball, excellent up the middle with Jeter and Knoblauch, and at third with Brosius. Nobody's really taken advantage of the fact that Williams ha a poor arm in center field, but rest assured that Ken Caminiti, Steve Finley and Greg Vaughn will try. The Indians did expose the fact that the Yankees' pitcher have trouble preventing baserunners from stealing from second to third base. Baserunning The Yankees run well a they take extra base, particularly Paul O'Neill, Brosius, Jeter and Knoblauch going first-to-third; Williams can make mistake. The Yankees probably won't be able to steal against Kevin Brown, who ha an effective slide step, but they could be aggressive against Andy Ashby, or the combination of Sterling Hitchcock and Jim Leyritz. PADRES Hitting Except for Jim Leyritz, no one in the San Diego lineup is particularly hot or particularly frightening at the moment. Tony Gwynn hasn't been a consistent a he usually is, Ken Caminiti and Greg Vaughn have been streaky. But the Padres are a veteran team capable of putting the ball in play, getting runner on base and then moving them along, and so long a they are getting exceptional pitching, that's all they really need. Quilvio Veras, the leadoff hitter, is adept at drawing walk and Steve Finley, who ha become more pull conscious in the last two year, could try to take aim at the right field stand in Yankee Stadium. Vaughn's power could be a factor if the Yankees' pitcher don't jam him enough to keep him from leaning over the plate. Pitching Kevin Brown is the best pitcher in this series, capable of winning three game if necessary, should Padres manager Bruce Bochy choose to start him in Games 1, 4 and 7. But at some point, San Diego will need a big outing from either Andy Ashby or Sterling Hitchcock. When Ashby's right, he's hitting the corner with his sinking fastball and his slider, and when his command is suspect, he get pounded. Hitchcock used his split-fingered fastball to great effectiveness against right-handed batter in the first two round of the playoff, but the Yankees' left-handed hitter may cause him some concern. San Diego's middle relief is the weakest aspect of the team, with Randy Myers and Mark Langston from the left side (the stuff of each ha waned). But if a lead can be delivered into the hand of closer Trevor Hoffman, he'll keep it. Defense They mostly catch the ball and avoid mistake, though they are unspectacular. Shortstop Chris Gomez and the second baseman Veras are adept at turning double play, and Caminiti won a Gold Glove at third base last year; Wally Joyner ha good hand at first; the center fielder Steve Finley is extremely quick in tracking down base hit and returning the ball to the infield. Tony Gwynn's range is better toward the right field line, not nearly a good on ball hit in the gap. The Yankees will be able to run on the arm of Vaughn in left field. Baserunning Veras can steal base (24) this year, and Finley can in a tight spot, a well. In general, however, the Padres are a slow, plodding team, though Caminiti and Vaughn are good at going first-to-third, and Gwynn won't make mistake on the base. PITCHING TO THE PADRES Quilvio Veras: A switch-hitter who ha more power right-handed; should try to pitch him down-and-in with breaking ball when he's hitting right-handed, jam him with fastball when he's batting left-handed. Steve Finley: A left-handed hitter who like to pull the ball. Left-handers like David Wells can beat him with breaking ball low and outside. Tony Gwynn: When he's hot, he's impossible. When he's not hitting well, he can be anxious early in the count, and he should be fed breaking ball out of the strike zone. Greg Vaughn: Big-time power on anything high and over the plate. Because he like to pull the ball, you must pitch him on the outer edge, occasionally jamming him to keep him honest. Ken Caminiti: More power right-handed, a better hitter left-handed. These day, he's a good lowball hitter and can be beat by fastball up in the zone. Wally Joyner: With runner on base, he'll try to jump on a fastball early in the count. Is not a strong hitter and can be jammed. Chris Gomez: Like Derek Jeter, like to hit pitch inside out, to right field and through the middle. He can hit with power if you make a mistake with a breaking ball. Ruben Rivera: An impatient hitter who will chase pitch out of the strike zone. Carlos Hernandez: Looks for the first-pitch fastball in the upper half of the strike zone. Can struggle against breaking ball. Jim Leyritz: No apparent hole right now, can hit fastball in and away. Best bet is to get ahead in the count and try to get him to chase breaking ball. PITCHING TO THE YANKEES Chuck Knoblauch: Hard thrower like to jam him with fastball because he stand on top of the plate, which is why he get hit so often. Derek Jeter: Sometimes he ha a tendency to chase pitch at his foot, but if you don't get the ball in far enough, he can hammer the ball over the wall in right. Paul O'Neill: The Yankees' best pure hitter, he sometimes will chase fastball up and away, particularly after there is one strike. Bernie Williams: A switch-hitter who ha trouble resisting chest-high fastball. When he lay off them, he is a much better hitter, and he did this in the last game of the Cleveland series. Chili Davis: Has a great eye and will work a pitcher deep into a count, but he can be overpowered with fastball above his belt. Cheats some now to get his bat started, making him vulnerable to off-speed pitch. Tino Martinez: Nothing seems right at the moment. Is anxious and chase pitch out of the strike zone when he fall behind in the count, and isn't taking advantage of mistake when they're made. Scott Brosius: A great breaking ball hitter, but he can also drive a fastball a long way when he anticipates, a Cleveland's Charles Nagy now know. Jorge Posada: When batting left-handed, he fare very poorly against splitter, curveballs and slider. Ricky Ledee: Like all young hitter, he ha a tendency to expand the strike zone and chase pitch out of the strike zone after falling behind in the count. Kevin Brown likely will attack him aggressively. SATURDAY'S PITCHERS Kevin Brown: Best sinking fastball in the game (91-93) mph, a four-seam fastball of 95-97 mph to throw high in the strike zone, a slider that break down and away from right-handed batter, and a forkball that dive at 88-89 mph. Holds runner well. David Wells: Aggressive, aggressive, aggressive, challenging hitter with fastball. His curveball can be exceptional, and his changeup ha improved. Throw strikes: Allowed a many home run (29) a walk (29), but ha not allowed a three-run homer or a grand slam all year. Talk about high expectation. It's not just the man from Tampa who ha them anymore. Knowing their baseball a well a they do, everybody in the Joe Torre family passed up ticket for the divisional series and the league championship series a just so much parsley on the plate of life. The pressure wa on to get to the World Series, so I can see all those people, Torre, the Yankees' manager, wa saying before New York went out to play the here-we-are, let's-go-for-it San Diego Padres in the Stadium Saturday night. Now that the Yankees are in the Series, their Florida-based owner and their fan and they themselves can see nothing more appropriate than four more victory. Anything le than 125 would feel like emptiness. But why should the Yankees be any different from the six team that already fell off the bus to this World Series? The gloom and doom in the six other city will not compare to the letdown that would grip New York and the owner's insatiable little heart should the Yanks come up short. The three-tiered playoff system ha practically turned baseball into football, where the survival-of-the-fittest mentality produce one exalted Super Bowl champion and a league full of chump and loser, condemned to a nether world of Parcells-like demon kicking them in their sore spot for eternity. The World Series used to be a short and sweet reward for excellence, but that wa when there were eight team per league, and the winner met in daylight in early October. Even if the Yankees clubbed my poor Brooklyn Dodgers into submission once again, well, there wa always next year. But in 1969, baseball began league championship series, and in 1995 it began a two-layered playoff system. The World Series is still different, which is why we should all resist the babble of post-season record flung at u by the hyperactive computer and the hyperactive broadcaster from the dozen of different network that carry baseball. The World Series is still a competition between one league that encourages pitcher to be athlete and another league relatively devoid of strategy. Somehow the playoff leave just about everybody feeling inadequate. Think about it. The Houston Astros are going around feeling they cannot perform in the post-season. The Texas Rangers are sulking because they had the best hitting in the league and could hardly touch Yankee pitching when it counted. In Chicago, the glory of winning a special playoff for the wild-card spot and Sammy Sosa's 66 home run ha been pre-empted. The very city that beat the Cubs for the 1969 eastern title held a parade for Sosa Saturday in the canyon where Lindbergh and John Glenn and the 1969 Mets were once hailed. Speaking of indignity, there are the Red Sox, whose occasional qualification for the playoff is merely a signal that nothing good can come of it. In Atlanta, the team of the '90s ha won exactly one World Series, and now it is up to management to keep repeating that: The main goal is to get to the Series. This is a recorded announcement. This is a recorded announcement. This is a recorded announcement. In Cleveland, the fan had to live with the phrase Nineteen forty-eight! being chanted at the Indians in the Bronx a the Yankees put the Indians out of misery. That leaf the Padres a the only team with virtually nothing to lose. This can be good, or it can be bad. Bruce Bochy, the manager, a reserve on the 1984 San Diego World Series team, ha said: A lot of the player on that team said, looking back, we wish we would have had a little different attitude instead of just saying, `Hey, we are in the World Series.' And this year, I think you will see the player out there playing to win. Torre recalled being the underdog in 1996, but he said his Yankees felt they could beat the Braves. I am sure that is the way the Padres feel right now, that maybe other people aren't predicting a lot for them, but I am sure they are for themselves, Torre said. I think getting here is where the pressure is, Torre added. You want to win, but getting to the World Series is so tough after playing 162 game and getting into post-season and then having to fight, bite and scratch and everything else to get here. Torre continued: You don't think about in spring training that we want to go and win the World Series. You want to get to the World Series. Then you get there, well, you have played well enough and won enough game, then of course, we want to win. As far a legitimizing our season I hate to even think in negative term, but if San Diego happens to win the World Series, sure it take a little bit of the luster off what we have accomplished by getting here, but I think that wa our goal, initially. The key word in that sentence is initially. The Yankees built an insatiable demand for more victory and World Series ticket in the Torre family. While they're at it, the Yankees had better win the whole thing. They are a victim of their own excellence.

1031,"Top-level budget negotiator for congressional Republicans and the White House concluded yet another bargaining session late Sunday afternoon with plan to resume talk on Monday morning and probably extend their midnight Monday deadline for another day or two. Both side were amiable a they emerged from a two-hour session, but they had little to report and indicated that their relatively early departure, compared with the last three night, should not be interpreted a a sign of crisis or of imminent peace in the budget talk. Sunday's discussion focused on education and President Clinton's request for $1.1 billion to hire 100,000 teacher, but aide said the bargainer did not delve into much detail and nothing wa resolved. I think we made some real progress today, but we still have a significant difference in the area of education, said Erskine Bowles, Clinton's chief of staff and top negotiator, after Sunday's meeting. We're going to try to plow through that over the next two day. Asked how far apart the two side were on education, Rep. Dick Armey of Texas, the Republican majority leader, replied: I don't know. We're not together. He said the two side had made some progress, but not enough. The talk came during another day of escalated political confrontation a congressional Democrats and Republicans, painfully aware that they have three week until Election Day, tried to take advantage of the static budget situation. Congress ha passed only six of the 13 required spending bill and are negotiating now with the White House on a final omnibus package that will contain the remaining seven bill and major issue including how to conduct the census in the year 2000, how much money to provide the International Monetary Fund and under what condition it should be provided, and how much emergency money to provide for item like increased security at US. embassy around the world and for American farmer. Also to be resolved are a host of issue that have little to do with financing and more to do with ideology, including environmental matter, contraception and national student testing. Republicans said the president had been disengaged from the process, and they were irked at what they said wa his swooping in at the 11th hour and pushing his education agenda in an apparently successful portrayal of himself a the guardian of that popular topic. Democrats countered that the Republican-led Congress had done nothing all year, and cast the Republicans a extremist for blocking the president's plea for more money to hire teacher and modernize school. In fact, Republican bargainer said Saturday night that they would provide the money if local government, not Washington, could decide how the money would be used. Armey wa one of many who castigated the president for apparent disengagement, an indirect reminder that Clinton ha been steeped in a sex scandal and is facing an impeachment inquiry in the House. The scant number of congressional Republicans who did not leave town for the weekend used the House floor to press this same message. What about the president? asked Rep. Tom DeLay of Texas, the majority whip. Maybe in Martha's Vineyard? Aspen? Camp David? Where is the president? I bet the American people don't know that he spent 152 day out of the 283 day this year fund raising, traveling and on vacation. Republicans said that Clinton had participated in 98 fund-raising event so far this year and that two event on Monday in New York, supporting the Senate campaign of Rep. Charles Schumer, would bring him to 100. Clinton said at the White House that he wa prepared to do whatever it take to reach a resolution over the spending bill, and dispatched his aide to Capitol Hill. He also said he would postpone from Monday morning until Monday afternoon his departure for his fund-raising tour in New York, and he canceled a fund-raising appearance in Florida. But a the high-level budget bargaining concluded Sunday afternoon, both side agreed they would need to extend their deadline beyond midnight Monday, when temporary financing for the government expires for the third time since the Oct. 1 start of the fiscal year. Congressional Democrats struck back at the Republicans, saying they have held a slack schedule themselves. Rep. George Miller, D-Calif., said Congress had been in session only 108 day so far this year, an unusually abbreviated period and one consumed for more than a month by the drive to hold impeachment hearing on the president. Most Americans, Miller said, had worked more than 225 day. They say, `Where is the president?' Miller said. The president ha been waiting for the budget. This is the first Congress since 1974 that ha no budget, he said, referring to the broad blueprint that is supposed to guide spending. This is a Congress that can't pas seven of it appropriation bill, he said, largely because of divisive split among conservative and moderate Republicans. Struggling to meet their fourth deadline over the federal budget, congressional Republicans and White House official wrestled Tuesday with their difference over education, the most politically high-stakes element of the budget battle. Negotiators ended a late-night session without resolving disagreement over not just education, but the census and contraceptive. These were among the biggest issue that still separated the two side a each tried to formulate a message to take home to voter for the Nov. 3 election. On education, the issue that President Clinton ha propelled to the forefront and on which Republicans do not want to appear recalcitrant, both side have agreed to spend more than $1 billion but not on how to spend it. The president insists that the money be spent to hire 100,000 teacher across the country so that the average class can be reduced to 18 student. Republicans, railing against Beltway bureaucrat, say that local school district should decide how the money is spent, whether it be for teacher or computer. As the two side broke Tuesday night, White House chief of staff Erskine Bowles, the president's top negotiator, emerged from the session saying: We don't have a deal. We made some good progress. The biggest issue, still, is the 100,000 teacher. He added: There are still some open issue upon which no agreement ha been reached, but he sounded optimistic about a session scheduled for Wednesday morning. I think we've got a chance of wrapping up tomorrow, he said. The two side remained apart on several ideological matter, including whether to allow federal health plan to cover contraceptive and whether to allow those few plan with religious affiliation to refuse to cover contraceptive not only on religious ground but on moral ground a well. They were also split on how to conduct the census in 2000, which is one of the thorniest issue. It is not one that move voter, but it is vital to both party because it help determine their relative strength in Congress. House Speaker Newt Gingrich and Bowles met for much of the day in the speaker's office, shuttling in and out of ante-rooms with their lieutenant but giving few clue about the nitty-gritty detail of their talk. They have given themselves another deadline of midnight Wednesday to wrap up about $500 billion worth of spending item, but they could easily extend that deadline another day or two. They missed having spending bill in place for the Oct. 1 start of the fiscal year, providing temporary financing for the federal government through Oct. 9, then Oct. 12, then Wednesday. Some of the other central issue, like financing for the International Monetary Fund, were all but nailed down, but neither side wa ready to declare a final deal until all the other element of the budget package were in place. We're down to splitting infinitive, House Majority Leader Dick Armey said of approving money for the IMF. As they worked through several issue, Republican leader appeared to be calculating the difference in their own party that might sour a final deal when it arrives on the House floor more of a concern than the Senate floor because the Senate ha fewer difference among it Republicans and with the White House. Some conservative Republicans said they were concerned over the emerging shape of the final package, particularly element dealing with family planning and emergency spending. They say the president's proposal for emergency spending, on such item a the peacekeeping mission in Bosnia, fixing the year 2000 computer bug and providing relief to American farmer, will break the limit in last year's balanced-budget agreement. The administration said such money would come from corresponding cut elsewhere in the budget, but conservative say it come from raiding the surplus. If Republican leader cannot count on their conservative, they will need support from Democrats to pas the final package. And Democrats on Tuesday expressed concern over some White House position, on issue like the census and an apparent compromise with Republicans on aid for farmer. Rep. David McIntosh, R-Ind., a leader of House conservative, said he believed Republican leader were ceding too quickly to the White House. He said that the president appeared to be getting his way on some issue but that what he really seemed to be winning wa the war of public relation. The president is getting what he wants; he's controlling the situation, McIntosh lamented. When Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott appears on television, McIntosh said, it's in reaction to the president. Nonetheless, McIntosh suggested that he could vote for a final accord. Most conservative are holding out for a better deal than we're hearing, he said, but we'll probably give them the vote because we don't see a much better alternative happening if it go down. Others were distressed, particularly about two contraceptive issue. One would require federal health plan to cover contraceptive. The other would bar overseas family-planning organization from lobbying to change abortion law in other country. Rep. Tom Coburn, R-Okla., said he wanted to see the final language on the health plan measure. As it passed both the House and the Senate, it allowed for health plan with religious affiliation to decline to offer contraceptive coverage; Coburn want plan to be able to refuse such coverage on moral ground a well. The plan cover five specific type of contraception. Coburn said he wanted two of those Depo-Provera and intrauterine device to be eliminated from coverage because he said they interfered with fertilization and were therefore considered to cause abortion. Democrats like Rep. Nita Lowey, D-N.Y., who introduced the contraceptive plan in the House, said she strongly objected to Coburn's position. She said that health plan based their decision on what to offer on profit, not moral. The question is whether the White House will insist on keeping the contraceptive coverage in the final package and will oppose the moral exception. If the administration allows the moral exception, it could alienate some House Democrats. House Democrats are also worried about the direction the talk are taking on the census. This ha always loomed a one of the biggest issue separating Democrats and Republicans. The result of a census help determine the future power of the two political party. But the fact that the two side are finally talking about it now indicates that they are covering the full range of budget matter that need to be resolved. The White House ha proposed buying time on the matter by financing the Commerce, State and Justice department only for five month. The Commerce Department contains the Census Bureau. White House official said this would put off the nettlesome issue while allowing a resolution of the entire spending package, but House Democrats worry it would be a prelude to giving in to Republicans down the road. Republican leader like the idea of postponing a decision but say that financing should be restricted only for the Census Bureau. On several touchy environmental issue that have prompted repeated veto threat from the White House, the two side appeared to be opting for compromise over confrontation, with several dispute resolved. But a few particularly difficult issue remained under negotiation. A compromise wa struck between the White House and Alaskan lawmaker on logging in the Tongass National Forest. But compromise still eluded them on the question of building a road through a wilderness refuge to connect two community in Alaska. A sticking point for White House and congressional budget negotiator ha been the issue of how the 2000 census will be conducted, and the White House is finding itself negotiating on the issue a much with House Democrats a it is with the House Republican leader. On Monday, White House negotiator, led by chief of staff Erskine Bowles, tried to determine whether Democrats would accept a deal to finance for six month the department of State, Justice and Commerce, which oversees the Census Bureau. The deal would put off until next March the contentious issue of whether the next census would use statistical sampling to supplement traditional method of counting people. Bowles told the group of Democrats that the House Republicans were willing to give on a number of outstanding issue that were stalling final agreement on the budget, but that they were digging in their heel when it came to financing the census for six month. The Democrats met in the office of Minority Leader Dick Gephardt. The rationale for the half-year financing is that by next March the Supreme Court is expected to rule on whether using sampling is legal or constitutional. The Supreme Court ha already agreed to review two lower court ruling that said sampling would violate federal law. Oral argument on the case are set for November. But House Democrats balked at the idea of six months' financing for the census, arguing that even if the Supreme Court allowed sampling, the Republicans would be under no obligation to approve money for a census that included sampling. The general feeling among many Democrats wa that even if we won the case, there would be a lot le leverage in March, especially if it wa the only issue left to be debated, said a House Democratic official who insisted on anonymity. Democrats contend that now is the time to press the Republicans, while they want to complete work on the budget and go home to campaign. Rep. Lucille Roybal-Allard, D-Calif., who attended the meeting Monday, said, It wa, sort of, this is where we are. We've been able to accomplish great thing, what do you think? We made it very clear that unless the census wa included, along with some other issue, like school construction, the deal wouldn't be acceptable. Statistical sampling would allow the Census Bureau to estimate population that are difficult to count, and would have the largest effect on the counting of African-Americans in city and black and Hispanics in rural area, group that are traditionally undercounted by the standard mean. Republicans fear, and Democrats hope, that the method would raise the count of people living in traditionally Democratic area, giving the party an advantage when new boundary for election district are drawn following the 2000 census. At Monday's meeting, the Democrats reminded administration official that Clinton had promised that he would veto any legislation that restricted the Census Bureau's ability to conduct an accurate census. I can't think of any way that restricts the census more than not to fully fund it, said Rep. Carolyn Maloney, D-NY. The willingness of House Democrats, including Gephardt, to press the president on the issue represents a realization of their leverage with Clinton, who will need all of their support in the coming impeachment inquiry. Gephardt is a major player now, and the irony is we helped make him that, said Rep. Christopher Shays, R-Conn., who support the use of sampling in the census. The Democrats' position also indicates how little trust many have in the White House on this issue. The proposal to finance the department of Commerce, Justice and State for six month is similar to one reached last November between Bowles and House Speaker Newt Gingrich. The idea then wa that holding all three department hostage in the census fight would place maximum pressure on all side to work out their difference over sampling. But House Democrats were not consulted before that agreement wa struck and later grumbled about it. At a meeting of the Democratic caucus Tuesday, Ms. Maloney briefed lawmaker on dealing with the White House and declared that Clinton had promised that he would hold firm on the census and that she believed him, a participant said. The statement wa greeted with laughter. There is a certain level of suspicion because there have been time when we have been cut out,said the House Democratic official. But I have to say, there hasn't been much evidence of that, this time. Struggling to meet their fourth deadline over the federal budget, congressional Republicans and White House official wrestled Tuesday with their difference over education, the most politically high-stakes element of the budget battle. Negotiators ended a late-night session without resolving disagreement over not just education, but the census and contraceptive. These were among the biggest issue that still separated the two side a each tried to formulate a message to take home to voter for the Nov. 3 election. On education, the issue that President Clinton ha propelled to the forefront and on which Republicans do not want to appear recalcitrant, both side have agreed to spend more than $1 billion but not on how to spend it. The president insists that the money be spent to hire 100,000 teacher across the country so that the average class can be reduced to 18 student. Republicans, railing against Beltway bureaucrat, say that local school district should decide how the money is spent, whether it be for teacher or computer. As the two side broke Tuesday night, White House chief of staff Erskine Bowles, the president's top negotiator, emerged from the session saying: We don't have a deal. We made some good progress. The biggest issue, still, is the 100,000 teacher. He added: There are still some open issue upon which no agreement ha been reached, but he sounded optimistic about a session scheduled for Wednesday morning. I think we've got a chance of wrapping up tomorrow, he said. The two side remained apart on several ideological matter, including whether to allow federal health plan to cover contraceptive and whether to allow those few plan with religious affiliation to refuse to cover contraceptive not only on religious ground but on moral ground a well. They were also split on how to conduct the census in 2000, which is one of the thorniest issue. It is not one that move voter, but it is vital to both party because it help determine their relative strength in Congress. House Speaker Newt Gingrich and Bowles met for much of the day in the speaker's office, shuttling in and out of ante-rooms with their lieutenant but giving few clue about the nitty-gritty detail of their talk. They have given themselves another deadline of midnight Wednesday to wrap up about $500 billion worth of spending item, but they could easily extend that deadline another day or two. They missed having spending bill in place for the Oct. 1 start of the fiscal year, providing temporary financing for the federal government through Oct. 9, then Oct. 12, then Wednesday. Some of the other central issue, like financing for the International Monetary Fund, were all but nailed down, but neither side wa ready to declare a final deal until all the other element of the budget package were in place. We're down to splitting infinitive, House Majority Leader Dick Armey said of approving money for the IMF. As they worked through several issue, Republican leader appeared to be calculating the difference in their own party that might sour a final deal when it arrives on the House floor more of a concern than the Senate floor because the Senate ha fewer difference among it Republicans and with the White House. Some conservative Republicans said they were concerned over the emerging shape of the final package, particularly element dealing with family planning and emergency spending. They say the president's proposal for emergency spending, on such item a the peacekeeping mission in Bosnia, fixing the year 2000 computer bug and providing relief to American farmer, will break the limit in last year's balanced-budget agreement. The administration said such money would come from corresponding cut elsewhere in the budget, but conservative say it come from raiding the surplus. If Republican leader cannot count on their conservative, they will need support from Democrats to pas the final package. And Democrats on Tuesday expressed concern over some White House position, on issue like the census and an apparent compromise with Republicans on aid for farmer. Rep. David McIntosh, R-Ind., a leader of House conservative, said he believed Republican leader were ceding too quickly to the White House. He said that the president appeared to be getting his way on some issue but that what he really seemed to be winning wa the war of public relation. The president is getting what he wants; he's controlling the situation, McIntosh lamented. When Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott appears on television, McIntosh said, it's in reaction to the president. Nonetheless, McIntosh suggested that he could vote for a final accord. Most conservative are holding out for a better deal than we're hearing, he said, but we'll probably give them the vote because we don't see a much better alternative happening if it go down. Others were distressed, particularly about two contraceptive issue. One would require federal health plan to cover contraceptive. The other would bar overseas family-planning organization from lobbying to change abortion law in other country. Rep. Tom Coburn, R-Okla., said he wanted to see the final language on the health plan measure. As it passed both the House and the Senate, it allowed for health plan with religious affiliation to decline to offer contraceptive coverage; Coburn want plan to be able to refuse such coverage on moral ground a well. The plan cover five specific type of contraception. Coburn said he wanted two of those Depo-Provera and intrauterine device to be eliminated from coverage because he said they interfered with fertilization and were therefore considered to cause abortion. Democrats like Rep. Nita Lowey, D-N.Y., who introduced the contraceptive plan in the House, said she strongly objected to Coburn's position. She said that health plan based their decision on what to offer on profit, not moral. The question is whether the White House will insist on keeping the contraceptive coverage in the final package and will oppose the moral exception. If the administration allows the moral exception, it could alienate some House Democrats. House Democrats are also worried about the direction the talk are taking on the census. This ha always loomed a one of the biggest issue separating Democrats and Republicans. The result of a census help determine the future power of the two political party. But the fact that the two side are finally talking about it now indicates that they are covering the full range of budget matter that need to be resolved. The White House ha proposed buying time on the matter by financing the Commerce, State and Justice department only for five month. The Commerce Department contains the Census Bureau. White House official said this would put off the nettlesome issue while allowing a resolution of the entire spending package, but House Democrats worry it would be a prelude to giving in to Republicans down the road. Republican leader like the idea of postponing a decision but say that financing should be restricted only for the Census Bureau. On several touchy environmental issue that have prompted repeated veto threat from the White House, the two side appeared to be opting for compromise over confrontation, with several dispute resolved. But a few particularly difficult issue remained under negotiation. A compromise wa struck between the White House and Alaskan lawmaker on logging in the Tongass National Forest. But compromise still eluded them on the question of building a road through a wilderness refuge to connect two community in Alaska. House and Senate negotiator agreed Thursday to require most federal health plan to cover prescription contraceptive for woman, giving an unusual victory on Capitol Hill to advocate of abortion right. But the future of the measure wa in doubt because it wa attached to a spending bill that includes a controversial provision regarding the Federal Election Commission. That provision could scuttle the spending bill, which would finance the Treasury Department and the Postal Service and which still must be approved by the House and Senate. The contraceptive measure would require the federal health plan, which affect 1.2 million female federal employee who are of child-bearing age, to cover the five method of contraception that have been approved by the Food and Drug Administration for use in this country birth control pill, diaphragm, inter-uterine device, Norplant and Depo-Provera. Currently, only 19 percent of federal health plan cover those method. The House and Senate approved the contraceptive measure earlier this year. But the opponent of abortion were furious about the approval and persuaded Republican leader to have negotiator reopen discussion on the matter. The cost of contraceptive ha driven up the out-of-pocket cost of health care for woman. And many male member of Congress seemed persuaded to support coverage of contraceptive for woman, since almost all of the 285 federal health plan cover Viagra, the male impotency drug. Thursday, with pressure building to resolve the spending bill before Oct. 9, when temporary financing of the government expires, the negotiator agreed to include the contraceptive measure in their conference report on the $13.4 billion bill for the Treasury Department and Postal service. Rep. Nita Lowey, D-N.Y., who pushed the contraceptive measure through the House, hailed Thursday's agreement a the first major accomplishment by abortion right advocate since the Republicans took control of Congress in 1994. She said the negotiator had agreed to include the measure because in an election year they did not want to be perceived a opposing contraception or be seen a rejecting a measure that had passed both the House and Senate. But many Democrats said the were upset that the bill contains a provision that is seen a interfering with the independence of the Federal Election Commission. That provision would require a four-vote majority among the seven federal election commissioner every four year to retain the general counsel and staff director. The provision is aimed at getting rid of Lawrence Noble, the current general counsel, who ha investigated the campaign finance practice of group like the Christian Coalition. The contraceptive measure is one of four related matter that have helped stall four spending bill. The three other bill that are stalled in part because of abortion-related matter include the agriculture bill, in which there is a dispute over whether the federal Food and Drug Administration should use taxpayer money to approve drug like RU-486, which induce abortion. The foreign operation bill is also stalled over whether to finance international family planning program that may also promote abortion, while the labor and health bill is delayed because of a provision that would block access of minor to contraception. Addressing the measure on insurance coverage for contraceptive, Helen Alvarez, a spokeswoman for the National Conference of Catholic Bishops, said that the bill wa bad policy. She said contraception had failed to stem the number of abortion, teen-age pregnancy or out-of-wedlock birth. Public-relations-wise, it's a good tactic for them, she conceded, but in term of social policy, this is a failure. For the first time in decade, Congress and the White House negotiated tax and spending legislation this year with the budget in surplus. The result wa chaos. The lawmaker were never able to agree on a budget resolution the framework into which all the tax and spending bill are supposed to fit. This had not happened since congressional budget procedure were established in 1974. Then, without the discipline of such an overall plan, the Senate and the House could not pas eight of the 13 spending bill needed to keep the government running. So the lawmaker had to stay in session more than a week longer than they had hoped. Finally, they lumped all eight bill together this week and announced an agreement. But the only way they could get this far wa to resort to gimmick. One wa to designate $20 billion a emergency expenditure so that program did not have to be cut elsewhere to offset the new spending. This will use up more than one-quarter of the anticipated budget surplus in the current fiscal year. Another gimmick extended the tax break for Individual Retirement Accounts to couple with income from $100,000 to $150,000. This will actually raise a small amount of revenue in the next five year the period covered by budget accounting but it will make the picture considerably worse in later year. As hard a it wa to negotiate a budget in the bad old day of budget deficit, say the politician involved, it wa exponentially more difficult this year. At least in year past, there wa a common goal. As much a they disagreed on policy and principle, they were all aiming at a reduction in the deficit. This year, some member of Congress wanted to use the surplus for a big tax cut. Others wanted to pay off the national debt. Others wanted to spend part of it on medical research, school and weapon for the Pentagon. Others wanted to spend large sum on highway. Still others wanted to continue cutting government spending. And that wa just among the Republicans. The Democrats had their own idea about the budget, and President Clinton laid down his marker about saving the surplus until a way wa found to shore up the Social Security system. In budget term, said Robert Reischauer, a former director of the congressional budget office, this is like the end of the Cold War. There are other difference a well in the way thing were negotiated with the budget in a surplus. In 1990, 1993 and 1995, when politician staked their career on striking a budget deal to lower the deficit, the fundamental question wa how to divide up the bitter medicine of more tax and le spending. Republicans, for the most part, opposed tax increase and favored cutting spending on social program. Democrats wanted to raise tax, especially on the rich, and protect social spending. In the end, balance were carefully drawn. But plenty of politician President George Bush, to name one lost their job in the process. This year, with Democrats and Republicans alike claiming victory, the burning issue wa how to parcel out the candy. Democrats got more money for education and farm assistance. Republicans got more money for the military and an extension of popular tax break for business. Some of the $20 billion that will eat into the surplus really will go for emergency, like relief for victim of Hurricane Georges. But much of the money, like the $90 million that will pay for six new helicopter for the national police in Colombia to use in drug interdiction, wa designated emergency spending simply because there wa no other way to get it into the budget. For the politician, the new way is more fun. It is hard to imagine that anyone will be voted out of office because of this year's budget. But that did not make it easier to reach an agreement. The other big difference is that the principal fight this year were not over money at all. They involved delicate policy issue like needle exchange, contraception, global warming, immigration and the census. In Congress, there is no consensus on these matter. So the only way policy could be set wa to wrap them into the giant spending bill. It may be more pleasant to debate policy than money. But it is probably harder to find a way to split the difference. As long a the surplus last, the lack of discipline that characterized the budget-writing this year is likely to continue. This is distressing to those devoted to controlling government spending. The temptation, said L. Ari Fleischer, spokesman for the House Ways and Means Committee, is to grab the loot and spend it. Some conservative sounded note of discord Friday over the federal spending agreement, but they also said they would probably vote for the $500 billion package because it boosted defense spending and provided aid to farmer. However, no one can vote on the package just yet, because it is not finished. The deal that President Clinton and Republican leader hailed Thursday wa a broad outline of area of agreement on the final portion of the $1.7 trillion budget, not a written document. That is now being crafted by the chairman of the spending committee and their aide, who said Friday that there were still dispute that needed to be resolved and that the final document could run to more than 3,000 page. For example, still unresolved is a dispute over whether airline can create a peanut-free zone to protect passenger who are allergic to peanut. House Speaker Newt Gingrich and other member from Georgia, a major peanut-producing state, are fighting the proposal, which would force airline to ban peanut within three row of someone with an allergy. Congress gave itself until midnight Tuesday to vote on the final bill, agreeing with President Clinton to a fifth extension of temporary financing to keep the government open. The budget wa due Oct. 1, the start of the new fiscal year. The vote wa initially expected Friday, but the bill is nowhere near to being written. Only a handful of top-level bargainer including Gingrich, Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott and White House chief of staff Erskine Bowles were in the room for the final deal. Excluded were the committee chairman and the head of the appropriation committee, who now must write the language that will put the deal into law. Almost everyone on Capitol Hill expects the budget to pas eventually, with the biggest defection coming from conservative who object to the $20 billion taken from the surplus to address so-called emergency and for the package's failure to offer voter a serious tax cut. The lag time before the bill is officially closed is making some conservative nervous that more member will try to add provision that will further expand a bill they already consider overly bloated. And some worry that once the hometown pork that is stuffed into the bill is publicly revealed, voter could put pressure on member not to support it. The election are Nov. 3. But several conservative said that despite these problem, they expected to support the bill anyway. Rep. Mark Souder, R-Ind., said: `Most of my friend, who are predominantly activist conservative, are split about 50-50. If tax cut were your primary thing, then you're unhappy, but many conservative have a mixed agenda. My position is, hold the nose and vote yes. We have no tax cut and far too much spending that I oppose, but that's the nature of compromise. Every member ha a little different focus. Souder said he liked the extra money for defense spending, and he liked the price support for farmer. Hog farmer in his district, whose biggest customer were Japan and China, had been hit hard by the collapse of Asian market. Several Republicans said that the bill seemed skewed in favor of the Democrats. They cited two reasons: Clinton needed to curry favor with Democrats to shore up support if the House vote to impeach him, and Republican leader feared that if they had stood up to Clinton, they might have forced a government shutdown and Republicans would be blamed. Clinton wa buying vote, said Rep. David Hobson, R-Ohio. He wa sucking up to the liberal Democrats so they would support him in impeachment. Rep. WJ. (Billy) Tauzin, R-La., said the leader seemed motivated by a desire to avoid the political damage they incurred from the partial government shutdown of 1995 and 1996. He also cited the president's need to placate the left by adding costly domestic program. The combination of the lesson learned three year ago and the scandal on the president's side yielded the inevitable result, a budget that lean way to the left, Tauzin said. Still, he said he would probably support the bill. It won't be enthusiastically, he said. It won't be holding my nose either. I would have preferred to spend more of this money on a tax cut. I think we would have gotten a tax cut, but for the scandal. If the president had not been caught up with the scandal, he probably would have followed the Dick Morris strategy and moved towards the center. Gingrich said he recognized that some conservative were wary of the agreement. But he sought to reassure them that the package served their interest. He cited a $9 billion increase in defense spending. And he noted that the Republicans had blocked several item, including needle-exchange program in the District of Columbia, national education testing and US. contribution to a United Nations program that pay for family planning in China, which many in Congress object to because China ha a policy of coercing abortion and forcing sterilization. Gingrich said the agreement wa the best that could be achieved when you have a conservative Republican Congress and a liberal Democratic president. Some conservative who had been especially critical were more understanding Thursday. Rep. David McIntosh, R-Ind., a leader of conservative in the House, had denounced the bill earlier a a Great Society type of big-spending program. Friday, after a meeting of Republicans, he said, Our leadership found themselves in a bad situation and did a good job. A few remained outright hostile to the bill, a much for the hasty way in which it wa cobbled together a for what it contained. Rep. Joe Barton, R-Texas, said: `I'm voting `no' unless something revolutionary happens between now and Tuesday. I think it's the process that give the president the ability to stonewall until the very end and then hold u for ransom. The Republican leadership in the House and Senate did a good job of limiting the highway robbery, but it's still gone too far beyond the spending cap. Also angry at the rushed endgame wa Rep. Gene Taylor, D-Miss., who took to the House floor and said he could not support the final bill. I'm going to urge my colleague to vote `no,' Taylor said. We have stayed here this long. We can stay a little bit longer. And I am going to encourage my colleague to continue to vote no until we are given adequate time to study the measure that is brought before u. Voting mainly on party line on a question that ha become a touchstone in the debate over development and preservation of wilderness, the Senate on Thursday approved a gravel road through remote wildlife habitat in Alaska. The road, barely 30 mile long, would slice across the edge of a wildlife refuge and wilderness area on the Aleutian Peninsula, where it would connect an isolated village called King Cove to a long-range air strip in the town of Cold Bay. Without the road, it backer say, about 700 resident of King Cove must continue to use unreliable air and boat service in emergency, often risking dangerous wind and sea a they seek medical evacuation to Anchorage. Opponents of the road call the project an unjustifiable precedent that threatens the seasonal breeding ground of protected migratory bird, and they say that improved air or sea service would be a better alternative. The vote Thursday, 59-38, wa a victory for the state's congressional delegation. But with President Clinton likely to veto the measure, the final outcome may depend on whether it sponsor can insert the road proposal into a huge spending bill that is likely to emerge just before Congress head home for the Nov. 3 election. Three Republicans voted against the bill, and six Democrats voted for it. The Clinton administration ha repeatedly warned that it will veto a big spending bill if it contains an array of anti-environmental provision that are under consideration. Indeed, the White House seems to be itching for a partisan fight over environmental priority. But while many Republicans in Congress still appear reluctant to engage in that broad fight, they were willing Thursday to cast their lot with the Senate's two powerful Alaskans, Ted Stevens and Frank Murkowski, both Republicans. A companion bill in the House, sponsored by Rep. Don Young of Alaska, also a Republican, ha not come to the floor. Even Sen. John Chafee of Rhode Island, a leader of Republican environmentalist, voted for the road. Last February Chafee's staff had assembled a score of environmental lobbyist in his office to plan strategy for opposing the road, environmental advocate said Thursday. They speculated that the senator had changed his position out of deference to the power of Stevens, who a chairman of the Appropriations Committee exerts tremendous influence at a time when a dozen spending bill are in their final stage. A Chafee aide said Chafee voted reluctantly for the road after Alaska's senator convinced him of it merit. Stevens said in angry tone Thursday that two-thirds of Alaska's land wa off limit to development and that vital health service were being denied to his state's resident. We can't use it without permission from some bureaucrat who is compelled by extreme environmentalist, he said. They are so extreme that they say this 330,000-acre Izembek refuge, the smallest wilderness in Alaska, is so sacrosanct that it can't move it border 60 foot. But Sen. Dale Bumpers, D-Ark., called the road project a dangerous precedent. Building a road through a wilderness in Alaska, no matter how short or how long, would be the first time in the nation we have voted deliberately to authorize a road through a wilderness area, Bumpers said. And once you go down that road, nobody know where it is going to end. Struggling to meet their fourth deadline over the federal budget, congressional Republicans and White House official wrestled Tuesday with their difference over education, staging event to demonstrate support for what ha become the most public and politically high-stakes element of the budget battle. Negotiators met into the night to hash out their disagreement over aid for school, the census and contraceptive. These were among the biggest issue that still separated the two side a each tried to formulate a message to take home to voter for the Nov. 3 election.

It is not one that move voter, but it is vital to both party because it help determine their relative strength in Congress.

","Whether to use the 1st surplus in decades for a tax cut, to pay off the national debt, or for new initiatives made the 1998 federal budget negotiations chaotic.The Oct 1 start of the fiscal year was extended 5 times.Major issues were census statistical sampling, federal health plan coverage of contraceptives regardless of religious affiliation, and school aid decisions by the federal gov't or local jurisdictions.Other issues included a Federal Election Commission provision, a road through an Alaskan wildlife refuge, and an airline peanut ban.Committees crafted the budget document after broad agreement was reached when 8 bills were lumped together.","In 1998, for the first time in decades, the US budget negotiators faced a surplus.Both sides said this was harder than a deficit situation, but they finally spent $1.7 trillion.The last seven spending bills were the most difficult and finally were merged into one package.Controversial issues included health insurance paying for contraception, control of new education allocations, an Alaskan wilderness road, whether the 2000 census would include statistical sampling, and establishing an emergency fund.Conservatives felt the results favored the liberals, but both sides were satisfied and glad to finish before Election Day and avoid a government shutdown.","Budget negotiations between the White House and House Republicans were delayed on several issues.At issue were provisions that included requiring Federal Health Insurance providers to provide contraceptives to women as Well as a provision to build a road across a wildlife preserve in Alaska.The contraceptive issue faced an uncertain future while Clinton likely will veto the road.There is disagreement also on how to spend the funding on education.This year's budget discussions also have been hampered because it is the first time since budget procedures were established in 1974 that there has been a surplus, preventing agreement on a budget resolution.","After several deadline extensions, Congressional leaders and the White House agreed on an omnibus spending package, the final portion of the $1.7 trillion budget.It includes more money for education and defense, business tax breaks, and farm aid, as well as funds for Colombia to use in drug interdiction.To offset the new spending, the surplus will be tapped for $20 billion, to the ire of conservatives.This year, without the common goal of reducing the deficit, reaching agreement was very difficult.Policy provisions involving the 2000 census, contraception, and the Alaskan wilderness were also tied to the spending package and were hotly debated."
1032,"President Boris Yeltsin, on his first trip out of Russia since this spring, canceled a welcoming ceremony in Uzbekistan on Sunday because he wasn't feeling well, his spokesman said. Yeltsin appeared stiff and stumbled during another public ceremony after he arrived in Tashkent, the capital of this Central Asian nation, and had to be supported by Uzbek President Islam Karimov. But the two later held a one-on-one summit a scheduled. The trip is Yeltsin's first high-profile foray since an economic crisis swamped his country in August. The 67-year-old president, whose health ha often sidelined him during his seven year in power, ha spent most of the last two month out of the limelight and out of the Kremlin, holding meeting in his country home outside Moscow. His last foreign trip wa to Britain in May, when he attended a summit of the Group of Seven leading industrial nation. During his visit to Uzbekistan and Kazakstan this week, Yeltsin is expected to discus improving Russia's relation with the two former Soviet republic, whose economy have suffered residual effect of the crisis that hit Russia after it devalued it currency in August and defaulted on some of it debt. On Sunday, Yeltsin had been scheduled to lay wreath at a monument to Alisher Naboi, an 16th century Uzbek poet, and salute an Uzbek honor guard, but both ceremony were canceled. This week wa extremely tense. (Yeltsin) wa affected by a difficult flight and the end of a difficult week, Yeltsin's chief spokesman, Dmitry Yakushkin, told a news conference. He ha a cold. He wa coughing when we spoke. It wa sunny and about 14 degree C (57 degree F) in Tashkent on Sunday. Yakushkin said Yeltsin's schedule Monday may also change depending on how he feel. Yeltsin and Karimov later met at a government residence outside Tashkent and signed several agreement on fighting smuggling and other crime and expanding cultural tie. The two side are expected to sign economic agreement Monday. Later Monday, Yeltsin is to go to Kazakstan, where he and Kazak President Nursultan Nazarbayev are expected to sign agreement on economic, science and technical cooperation and on combating drug trafficking. Last week, Yeltsin said he also planned to discus the situation in Afghanistan with his Uzbek and Kazak counterpart. Russia and the two republic fear an influx of refugee and weapon from Afghanistan, and possibly a spillover of fighting that ha wracked the country. Yeltsin wa accompanied by Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov, Defense Minister Igor Sergeyev, Finance Minister Mikhail Zadornov, official from the Federal Border Guard Service, the State Customs Committee, the Defense Ministry, and the Russian Academy of Sciences. Weakened by a cold yet animated, President Boris Yeltsin defied doctors' order and quashed rumor he is seriously ill by showing up unexpectedly at the Kremlin on Wednesday. Still, his appearance didn't silence the growing number of call for his resignation. Hours after he returned to work, the generally pro-Yeltsin upper house of parliament fell just 11 vote short of passing a motion urging him to step down over his social welfare policy. Yeltsin, 67, ha a respiratory infection that forced him to cut short his first foreign visit in month on Monday. Whenever Yeltsin fall ill, speculation arises about his ability to govern. This time, however, the prospect of him leaving office ha aroused le panic, since he ha largely faded from the limelight in recent month and left his government to grapple with Russia's economic crisis. There will be no turmoil if Yeltsin leaf the political arena. The government is already in charge, (Prime Minister Yevgeny) Primakov is strong enough and ha the support of the security service, said Yevgeny Volk, director of the Moscow office of the U.S.-based Heritage Foundation. Everyone know Yeltsin is ailing and is politically weakened, he said. Yeltsin ha a history of health problem, and underwent heart bypass surgery in 1996. Still, he insists he ha no major illness and plan to serve out the remaining two year of his term. I can't even sneeze without someone making a fuss about it, he joked with Primakov during a meeting Wednesday. In the Kremlin, Yeltsin discussed development in Kosovo with Primakov, Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov and Defense Minister Igor Sergeyev, Russian news agency said. Yeltsin looked wan and tired and walked stiffly, but he wa smiling, gesturing animatedly and joking with his minister. The start of the meeting wa shown on Russian television. Primakov said afterward that Yeltsin waved his hand dismissively when we reminded him that he should stay in bed during his illness and said of his doctors: Don't listen to them. The upper house of parliament wa busy voting on a motion saying he should resign. The vote in the Federation Council, which is made up of regional leader, wa 79 to 18 in favor, Russian news agency reported. It did not pas because it required a simple majority of 90 vote. The motion carry no legal weight, but it reflects growing anti-Yeltsin sentiment in a chamber that ha generally supported him. The prime minister reiterated Wednesday that Yeltsin ha no plan to resign or call early election. There is no reason for rocking the boat and demanding anyone's resignation, Primakov said, according to the Interfax news agency. What happens to the anti-crisis step if election are held now? Yeltsin's resignation is highly unlikely. If he were to step down or die, Primakov would take power and election would have to be held within three month. Many Russians view Yeltsin with increasing pity. I feel for him. He's clearly not a healthy person, film director Vladimir Khotinenko wa quoted a saying by the daily Kommersant. It's time for him to step aside. Doctors ordered the president to stay in bed Tuesday and his spokesman, Dmitry Yakushkin, had said Yeltsin would not be in the office all week. Yeltsin stumbled and had to be supported during his visit to Central Asia on Sunday and Monday. He canceled most of his public engagement, except for a state dinner at which he made rambling remark and a news conference that he abruptly cut short. Doctors ordered Russian President Boris Yeltsin to cut short his Central Asian trip because of a respiratory infection and he agreed to return home Monday, a day earlier than planned, official said. Yeltsin wa suffering from tracheobronchitis, had a fever of 37.4 Celsius (99.3 Fahrenheit) and wa being treated with antibiotic, the president's doctor told the Interfax news agency. Yeltsin wa to fly back to Moscow late Monday, rather than on Tuesday a scheduled, but wa going ahead with talk, including a meeting with Kazak President Nursultan Nazarbayev. He planned to move up all his scheduled meeting before returning home, aide said. The 67-year-old, 3rd graf pvs President Boris Yeltsin stayed home Tuesday, nursing a respiratory infection that forced him to cut short a foreign trip and revived concern about his ability to govern. Yeltsin wa spending the day at his Gorky-9 country residence just outside Moscow, and will probably not go into the office all week, his spokesman, Dmitry Yakushkin, told reporter. However, Yeltsin's condition wa stable, Yakushkin said. Doctors insisted Monday that Yeltsin fly home from Central Asia a day ahead of schedule because he wa suffering from an upper respiratory infection and had a mild fever of 37.4 Celsius (99.3 F). They said Yeltsin wa being treated with antibiotic and there were no plan to hospitalize him. Yeltsin, 67, ha a history of health problem, including quintuple heart bypass surgery two year ago, so whenever he get sick there is a flurry of speculation about his ability to function. Yeltsin insists he ha no major illness and plan to serve out the remaining two year of his term. Yakushkin, his spokesman, reiterated Tuesday there wa no talk about an early resignation. It's not being discussed, he said. I am personally against such a resignation because I think it would only bring peril to the nation. Yakushkin and other aide sought to play down the seriousness of Yeltsin's illness. Don't panic, Dad is OK, Yeltsin's daughter Tatiana Dyachenko, who is his official image adviser, told the Kommersant business newspaper. Yakushkin said Yeltsin's personal doctor, Sergei Mironov, confirmed that the president wa suffering from a respiratory infection known a tracheal bronchitis and that his condition is stable. He must stay in bed like any other person, Yakushkin said. However, knowing the president's character, he is certain to start working with document and making phone call to Russian politician a well a foreign leader in view of the current situation in Kosovo. But the Nezavisimaya Gazeta newspaper said in a front-page editorial Tuesday that Yeltsin's condition suggests he is suffering from something worse than a cold. It said his absence from the Kremlin during the current economic crisis amount to a state catastrophe and called on Yeltsin to immediately surrender most of his power to Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov. A Communist lawmaker also called for an urgent medical check . on the Russian president's health to determine whether he is fit to remain in office, the Interfax news agency said. Yeltsin's obvious inability to perform his function is damaging Russian state authority, a power is being misused by the clique close to the president, said Viktor Ilyukhin, chairman of parliament's security committee. The health of the president, who is also commander-in-chief of the Russian military, is a direct threat to the country's national security and a factor of serious concern regarding Russia's nuclear weapon, he said. Other newspaper gave a detailed description of Yeltsin's weakness and his erratic behavior on the trip to the former Soviet republic of Uzbekistan and Kazakstan his first foray abroad since a visit to Britain in May. The president appeared stiff and stumbled when he arrived Sunday in Uzbekistan's capital of Tashkent. He had to be supported by Uzbek President Islam Karimov and canceled his other public event. At a state dinner on Sunday, Yeltsin made rambling remark, expressing his satisfaction with local facility and store he never inspected, the daily Kommersant reported. On Monday, the president didn't seem to understand that he wasn't in Moscow, Kommersant said, saying he called aide and spoke a though they were late for work at the Kremlin. He turned up more than an hour late for talk with Uzbek official, making some incoherent remark interrupted by a bad cough and abruptly cutting short a scheduled news conference. President Boris Yeltsin ha suffered minor burn on his right hand, his press office said Thursday. Asked about small bandage that were visible on Yeltsin's hand during an award ceremony, the press office said the president had sustained small burn. It did not say what had caused them. Russia's Constitutional Court opened hearing Thursday on whether Boris Yeltsin can seek a third term. The issue wa controversial earlier this year when Yeltsin refused to spell out his intention and his aide insisted he had the legal right to seek re-election. It ha lost some of it urgency, a Yeltsin ha grown physically and politically weaker and ha said he will not run again. The court will take at least a week to consider the issue, the Interfax news agency reported. The Russian Constitution ha a two-term limit for president. But Yeltsin's aide say his first term, from 1991 to 1996, doe not count because it began six month before the Soviet Union collapsed and before the current constitution took effect. Communists and other Yeltsin opponent in parliament's lower house, the State Duma, disagreed and appealed to the Constitutional Court in February. While the case ha been waiting to be heard, event have overtaken it. Yeltsin ha flatly said he will not seek another term, and the opposition ha concentrated it effort on demanding an early resignation, riding a wave of popular discontent over the economic crisis. The call for Yeltsin to step down wa backed by many participant in a nationwide labor action earlier this month that attracted about 1 million people. Yeltsin's growing health problem would also seem to rule out another election campaign. A respiratory infection forced him to cut short a trip to Central Asia earlier this week. On Wednesday, parliament's upper chamber, the Federation Council, voted on a resolution calling on Yeltsin to resign, but it failed narrowly. Even if had passed, the move would have had no legal consequence, but it highlighted growing anti-Yeltsin sentiment in the chamber made up of powerful regional leader, most of whom have been loyal to the president. Mikhail Mityukov, the presidential representative on the Constitutional Court, said Thursday that Yeltsin would ignore call for an early resignation. The president is a strong person, and he ha been through far more difficult political situation, Mityukov said, according to Interfax. Russian President Boris Yeltsin, who is still recuperating from his latest illness, ha canceled a trip to an Asian summit next month, his office said Friday. Government source said the president ha also called off a visit to Austria later this month, but the Kremlin said those plan were still going forward. Yeltsin ha decided to send Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov to the November summit of the Asia-Pacific Economic Forum in Kuala Lumpur because it deal mostly with financial issue, Yeltsin's office said. But source in Primakov's office said the cancellation wa due to concern about how the long flight might effect the president's health. The president ha been suffering from bronchitis and a cold this week, which forced him to cut short a visit to Central Asia on Monday. He wa spending Friday at a country home outside Moscow after defying the order of his doctor and working in the Kremlin for the past two day. Aides said the president's condition wa satisfactory. Yeltsin is still planning to go to Vienna for an Oct. 27-28 summit of European nation, the president's office said. In another development, Moscow Mayor Yuri Luzhkov, considered a potential presidential candidate, said Thursday that he wouldn't exclude the possibility of Yeltsin's resignation for health reason. In an interview with the British Broadcasting Corp., he stopped short of calling on Yeltsin to step down. But Luzhkov ha always been supportive of Yeltsin and had never before questioned the president's health or ability to govern. According to our constitution, the president himself ha to say he is not able to work, Luzhkov said in an interview with the BBC in Moscow. And because of (Yeltsin's) poor health, he is no longer able to give the country a much time a it demand. Luzhkov's spokesman Mikhail Solomentsev refused to elaborate on the statement. Yeltsin ha a long history of health problem, including a heart bypass surgery two year ago. Each new ailment rekindles speculation about his fitness to govern. The president and his doctor say Yeltsin ha no serious health problem and will serve out the final two year of his term. President Boris Yeltsin's doctor have pronounced his health more or le normal, his wife Naina said in an interview published Wednesday. Mrs. Yeltsin told the Argumenty i Fakty weekly that she hesitated even to touch on her husband's health when there is so much conjecture on this topic. Still, she noted that he had regular medical check-ups. The doctor say now: Everything is more or le normal, Mrs. Yeltsin declared. The 67-year-old Yeltsin's health ha long been a concern, and the worry ha been amplified by the secrecy surrounding his condition. Yeltsin suffered from heart disease during the 1996 presidential election and had a heart attack, followed by multiple bypass surgery, in the month after his victory. Mrs. Yeltsin expressed understanding for Russians who took part Wednesday in protest for unpaid wage. She also said that criticism of the president wa normal, though it wa offensive when it focused on anything other than his professional performance, such a his age. It seems to me . that people expected a miracle from him, Mrs. Yeltsin said. But surely you can't curse a person for not being a magician. Mrs. Yeltsin refuted rumor that her family would leave Russia after Yeltsin leaf office in 2000 a absolute nonsense. I think we'll live like all normal people. At least it will be calmer than it is now. Russian President Boris Yeltsin cut short a trip to Central Asia on Monday due to a respiratory infection that revived question about his overall health and ability to lead Russia through a sustained economic crisis. Yeltsin's premature return to Moscow also prompted doubt about his capacity to respond decisively in the Kosovo crisis, in which Russia ha been leading a campaign to forestall airstrikes. Moscow's NTV station said it wa a crucial time for Russia, when presidential decision are needed. There wa no indication that Yeltsin's illness would sideline him for any length of time, and aide said the president would maintain his schedule for the rest of the week. But after a series of health problem in recent year, including heart bypass surgery in 1996, every new ailment unleashes a flurry of speculation about the president's ability to function. The president insists he ha no major health problem and will serve out the remaining two year of his term. Yeltsin's aide said the president wa taking antibiotic to ward off a bout of bronchitis and a mild fever of 37.4 Celsius (99.3 Fahrenheit). There were no plan to hospitalize Yeltsin, who arrived in Moscow late Monday night from Almaty, Kazakstan, a day earlier than planned.

1033,"Microsoft Corp. ha said that material in an unpublished book by two business school professor will be a crucial part of it defense in the antitrust trial scheduled to begin next week. But judging from an advance copy of the manuscript, the Justice Department and 20 state that are suing the software giant will find support for their argument in the book a well. To cite one example, Microsoft contends that it industry-standard Windows operating system and it Internet Explorer browser are a single integrated product. In it suit, the government asserts that they are two separate product that Microsoft bundled together to get an unfair edge over it rival, Netscape Communications Corp., in the market for software used to browse the Internet's World Wide Web. In Competing on Internet Time: Lessons from Netscape and Its Battle with Microsoft, the author, Michael A. Cusumano of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology's Sloan School of Management and David B. Yoffie of the Harvard business school, quote a Microsoft executive a saying that only with the third version of Microsoft's browser wa it integrated with Windows. Microsoft hurried it first browser offering into the market, the book say, in it race to catch up with Netscape, then took a more ambitious approach with Internet Explorer 3.0, which wa introduced in August 1996. In that version it changed it software design to use programming module, or component, that could be put together and rearragned like building block. In the book, Ben Slivka, a Microsoft general manager, is quoted a saying, IE 3.0 wa the key thing because we did the componentized browser, He added, We really made Internet Explorer part of the Windows platform. The timing could be legally significant because in it suit the government cite a evidence request before August 1996 by personal computer maker that wanted to load Netscape's browser on their machine instead of Microsoft's browser. Microsoft denied the request, insisting it browers and Windows were a single, integrated product. Microsoft's legal team obtained an early manuscript of the new book last month, by issuing a subpoena to a Netscape executive who wa given a confidential copy by the author to review. Microsoft ha also sought the transcript of 44 current and former Netscape employee interviewed by the author. A federal judge in Boston last week denied Microsoft access to that research material, but the company may appeal the ruling. The new book, published by the Free Press imprint of Simon &AMP; Schuster, is being hurried into print so it can be shipped within day of the start of the Microsoft trial on Oct. 19. But already, a few quote from Netscape executive have leaked out. The author decided to send the complete manuscript to The New York Times and three other news organization Monday, so that the material could be read in context. Microsoft intends to use material from the book a evidence that Netscape's trouble resulted largely from it own misstep rather than from any alleged predatory practice by Microsoft. The book doe detail where Netscape stumbled, shifting it strategy too often and running into obstacle in it software development effort. In private antitrust suit, the argument that the competitor wa his own worst enemy is an established defense. But legal expert say that defense may well be far le effective in a federal case in which the government is seeking court-mandated change in Microsoft's business practice rather than the monetary damage that are the goal of plaintiff in private case. It seems to me that this debate over Netscape's mistake is a total sideshow, said Robert Litan, a former senior official in the Justice Department's antitrust division, who is now at the Brookings Institution. But Microsoft ha a big legal team, and it seems they are working on every defense they can find. The book quote a former Netscape executive, Ram Shriram, a saying the company bungled a chance to win a sizable share of the browser business from America Online Inc. But that wa a second-chance to do a deal with America Online, the leading online service. The government's case focus on an earlier deal in March 1996, when America Online chose Internet Explorer a it preferred browser; in that bargain Microsoft agreed to place a startup icon for the online service on the main Windows desktop screen the prime real estate in computing. For a book entitled Competing on Internet Time, it is intriguing that one of it central theme is that Netcape got too wedded to the notion that the Internet revolution would change everything quickly. Microsoft, by contrast, stuck to it three-year planning horizon that enabled the company, the author write, to mesh it short-run tactical plan with a broader strategic view of how to win the war. The book quote Steve Ballmer, Microsoft's president, a saying, The fact of the matter is that customer can't take cataclysmic change every three month. The organization also can't. You can ship product quickly. But you can't say, `Oh, we have a radically new strategy' every three month. The government's antitrust scrutiny of Microsoft, the world's largest independent software company, ha spanned Republican and Democratic administration and involved hundred of government lawyer and investigator. But it ha by no mean been an example of consistent, coordinated public policy. Nor, by all account, of politics. Instead, like the software industry itself, the government's pursuit of Microsoft ha taken leap, hit dead end and evolved in way no one could have controlled or predicted back when it started in 1989. It wa in November of that year, on a hot afternoon at a computer-industry convention in Las Vegas, Nev., that Bill Gates, Microsoft's chairman, looked like he'd been dragged to the news conference with a senior executive from IBM which at the time dominated Microsoft and the entire computer industry. The two company IBM, then the leading maker of personal computer and Microsoft, the leader in PC operating system software were collaborating on the design and marketing of a new operating system called OS/2. But Microsoft wa also beginning to sell a competing product, Windows. The industry trade press wa full of worried articles: which system wa going to become the new standard? With Gates standing uncomfortably at his side, James Cannavino, an IBM divisional president, said that the two company wanted to clear the air. OS/2 wa the future, he said. As for Windows, he added, it would remain a niche product for under-equipped computer. Windows, he asserted, would never receive all the advanced feature of OS/2. Gates certainly did not look happy. But he did not disagree. The news conference got little attention, just a few article deep inside newspaper and trade publication. But a few week later, Norris Washington, a senior antitrust lawyer with the Federal Trade Commission, happened to read one of those article, in Byte magazine. IBM and Microsoft have now defined their unified vision of graphical operating environment, the article said, and it look sort of like a US. economic model, divided into lower-, middle- and upper-class product. As Washington saw it, IBM and Microsoft were colluding to divide the operating-system market a potential violation of antitrust law. Soon the FTC staff opened an investigation of Microsoft and IBM And since that small first step, Microsoft ha been under unrelenting scrutiny from federal antitrust investigator for a constantly evolving series of allegation and charge, month after month, year after year, for the last nine year. Now come the antitrust trial scheduled to begin on Monday, with a multiplicity of charge woven of thread drawn from more than a dozen different investigative inquiry during that nine-year span. Microsoft, today the most feared company in the software business and carrying a stock-market value of nearly $234 billion, present a huge and highly visible antitrust target. Yet, while the company's ally ask, What is the Clinton administration's political agenda in going after Microsoft? the answer seems to be there is none. In interview, more than a dozen current and former senior antitrust official whether friend of the government or of Microsoft all say the Justice Department's antitrust suit is a natural outgrowth of the previous investigation. As for politics, all the official agreed that the antitrust division operates independent of the administration's political consideration. Charles Rule wa the assistant attorney general who headed the antitrust division during the Bush administration, and he is now a Washington lawyer who serf a an adviser and advocate for Microsoft. When I wa there, Rule said of his Justice day, the White House wa punctilious in term of never getting involved in whatever we decided to do. There wa no communication between antitrust and other branch of government. Asked if he believed that policy had changed under the Clinton administration, he said: Not really. I've seen nothing to suggest it. Joel Klein head the antitrust division now, and in an interview dealing with his division's role in the Clinton administration's technology policy, not specifically relating to the Microsoft case, he said: There is no statutory restriction, but a a practical matter, civil and criminal prosecution are invariably carried out without any political contact. Klein said, by way of example, that he might discus merger case involving military or aviation industry with the Defense Department or Transportation Department. But never the White House, he said. For a significant case, we might call the White House and say `An hour from now we are going to hold a press conference.' The last time there wa any interference, he added, wa the Dita Beard-ITT case. Mrs. Beard, a lobbyist for ITT Corp., wa accused in 1972 of having written a memo saying that a $400,000 donation to the Republican National Convention had gone a long way toward settling antitrust suit brought against the company by the Nixon administration's Justice Department. The authenticity of the memo wa never proved, and Mrs. Beard always denied writing it. In any case, Klein say, since Watergate, it's been immaculate. In the case of Microsoft, neither President Clinton nor Vice President Al Gore ha ever volunteered a comment. In answer to a question during a news conference in May, just before the suit wa filed, Clinton said: I have taken the view that I should not comment on matter within the Justice Department. At this time, I do not think I should depart from that policy on this case, even though it obviously will have a big impact on an important sector of our economy. But I have to say, based on what I know to date, I have confidence in the way the antitrust division in the Justice Department ha handled the matter. Since then, Clinton ha said nothing else about the case, publicly at least. And Gore, who generally represents the administration on technology issue, ha never commented at all. In Rule's opinion, the administration would be foolish to involve itself, even if it were politically acceptable to do so. It would be a little odd for the administration to push the Justice Department in this suit, he said. It would be a policy mistake and a political mistake. I would be hard pressed to explain why they would do that. Taking side in the highly charged technology world is dangerous, particularly since the Democrats rely on Silicon Valley company for political donation and support. In fact, the present and former government official all said the suit wa simply a natural extension of the inquiry conducted during the last nine year. They began at the FTC. Soon after Washington read that article in Byte, the FTC staff opened an investigation of the Windows-OS/2 question. But a ha happened so often in the following year, turn in the market made the initial inquiry irrelevant. Microsoft abandoned it agreement with IBM, and Windows quickly grew to be the industry standard, while OS/2 remained a cipher. But a that issue faded, once government investigator began looking at Microsoft they found other thing that troubled them. In 1991 Washington, who still work for the FTC, informed Microsoft that the investigation wa being expanded. The agency, his letter said, wa now trying to determine whether Microsoft wa using it dominant position in operating-systems software to stifle competition in other area. That general idea lie at the heart of the present suit. One former senior FTC official said the commission staff had confidence in the case but realized that the Reagan-era commissioner, who had to approve any suit, might have a different view. We knew the commission might have difficulty with a monopolization case, the former official said. They hadn't brought a case in year. And in fact, in 1993 the commission voted 2-2 on the question of whether to file formal charge. The deadlock served a a dismissal. Then, a few month later, the Justice Department decided to pick up the case. It wa farther along than most case we got, recalled Robert Litan, a former senior official in the Justice Department's antitrust division who is now at the Brookings Institution. Usually a case would be two or three people complaining and a few document, he said. But this wa a fully researched record. They gave u the file and briefed u on what they had done. The Justice Department lawyer picked up the same thread. The general idea behind our inquiry, Litan said, wa that they should not be allowed to use their monopoly in operating system to cement a monopoly in other area. In 1995, Microsoft and the government reached a consent agreement in which the company promised to stop forcing PC maker to buy one copy of a Microsoft operating system for every computer sold instead of one for every computer on which the operating system, MS-DOS or Windows, wa installed. The company also agreed to stop tying the sale of one software product to the sale of another. The charge in the present suit are similar in many way. Even with the agreement, the government investigation continued. That same year, Justice Department investigator showed up at the office of Netscape Communications Corp. for the first time to ask question about their next line of inquiry. America Online had been complaining, a senior Netscape executive recalled, because Microsoft wa bundling the Microsoft Network, a competing online service, with Windows. Once more, market force overtook the investigation. The Microsoft Network never grew particularly popular while America Online prospered and grew. But, not surprisingly, new complaint filled the void. In May 1995, Anne Bingaman, the assistant attorney general who headed the antitrust division, remarked: We get complaint about Microsoft all the time. We have become a kind of Microsoft complaint center. And we take them very seriously. In 1996, Netscape's first complaint arrived. In a letter to the Justice Department, Netscape said that Microsoft wa using it dominance in personal-computer operating system to force or persuade computer maker to favor Microsoft's browser, used to explore the World Wide Web, over the one marketed by Netscape. The next year the Justice Department formally charged Microsoft with violating the consent agreement by tying sale of Windows to installation of the company's Web browser on new computer. It seemed like a slam-dunk violation of the consent decree, a natural extension of that case, recalled Litan, who had left the department by then. A Federal District Court judge agreed, but an Appeals Court panel overturned that ruling this summer. In the meantime, last May the Justice Department and 20 state attorney general filed their new suit against Microsoft, which is scheduled for trial on Monday. It contends that Microsoft ha engaged in bundling, tying and other predatory behavior similar in many way to the numerous previous allegation and investigation of the last nine year. A good part of this case is just Round II of the case we dealt with in Round I, in the early in the 1990s, Litan said. Or, a the former senior FTC official put it, there's certainly a common thread that run all the way through here. But through the year that thread ha been twisted, pulled and spun by hundred of different hand. The case of United States v. Microsoft Corp., the government's most aggressive move against a monopolist in almost 25 year, is playing out against a century of antitrust law so broadly worded and court ruling so ambiguous that both side are citing the same ruling to support their opposing argument. Whatever the outcome of the trial, scheduled to begin Monday in US. District Court in Washington, an almost certain appeal will leave to the Supreme Court the task of bringing legal order to 100 year of clashing antitrust doctrine. The case focus on Microsoft's Windows, the operating system that control about 90 percent of all personal computer sold today. The government say it objective is to curb illegal monopolistic business practice that threaten to render large part of the economy vulnerable to the vicissitude of a single company. Microsoft asserts that the case is intended to give the government control over which feature can be added to Windows. However grand the economic stake, the legal dispute is narrow. The government say that Microsoft's contract with computer manufacturer and with company that provide access to the Internet illegally stifle competition. The contract prohibit manufacturer from substituting Netscape Communications Corp.'s Navigator browser for Microsoft's Internet Explorer. They also prohibit them from removing from the Windows main screen, or desktop, link to site on the World Wide Web run by Microsoft or it partner. Microsoft's contract with company that connect people to the Internet and with business that sell good and service on the Web require favored treatment for Internet Explorer over Navigator in exchange for link on the Windows desktop. In the wake of the lawsuit, Microsoft ha voluntarily dropped some of these requirement, though it could reinstate them at will. Microsoft say that it contract are legal because they produce tangible benefit for customer, including easier Internet access. The Justice Department say that the bundling of Explorer with Windows 95 and the inclusion of the browser a part of Windows 98 amount to tying, an illegal practice that force customer of one product to purchase another. The contract with manufacturer and Internet service are illegal, the government say, because they are intended not only to create a monopoly in the browser market but to protect Microsoft's existing monopoly in operating system. The latter threat is key, according to the Justice Department. Browsers have the potential, like an operating system, to act a a software platform on which other program run. So contract intended to drive browser out of the market would also insulate the Windows monopoly. Many antitrust expert say the problem facing the Justice Department is that the court have provided no clear definition of tying and no clear guideline for determining when contract are illegally exclusionary. Professor Lawrence White of New York University, who wa chief economist of the Justice Department's antitrust division in the early 1980s, say that the court treat tying a an unusual practice when in fact it is ubiquitous. No one, he said, would challenge the right of manufacturer to tie eraser to the tip of pencil, tire to an automobile or button to shirt. His point, shared widely among economist, is that some tying benefit consumer if, for example, it result in product that are easier to use or enables a company to recover development cost. But tying can be bad if it lock in monopoly power. The court, White say, have not offered enough guidance for distinguishing good tying from bad, which is the nub of the legal dispute. Microsoft say it need only to show that bundling Windows and Explorer pass what might be called a gross consumer benefit test that it offer an immediate benefit, whether or not it cause long-term damage to competition and, therefore, ultimately to consumer. The Justice Department say that Microsoft's practice must clear a higher hurdle: yielding net consumer benefit that are immediate and large enough to balance possible long-term harm to competition. So which test of consumer benefit satisfies antitrust law? The simple answer is that no one know for sure, which is why both side can reasonably cite the same case without fear of embarrassment. Consider a 1985 case, Aspen Skiing Co. v. Aspen Highlands Skiing Corp., and a 1951 case, Lorain Journal Co. v. United States. In the first, Aspen Skiing, the owner of three major ski run in Aspen, Colo. the monopolist had for year sold a ticket in cooperation with Aspen Highlands, a competitor, that gave skier access to both companies' run. When Aspen Skiing unilaterally canceled the agreement, it rival's revenue shriveled and the rival sued. The Supreme Court ruled that Aspen Skiing had violated antitrust law because there wa no evidence it action helped consumer. In the Lorain Journal case, the only local newspaper in Lorain, Ohio, refused to sell advertising to company that advertised on a new radio station. Here, too, the Supreme Court ruled that the exclusionary practice did nothing to benefit consumer. Indeed, in Aspen Skiing, the court even forced the monopolist to do business with it rival, a precedent that augur well for the Justice Department, which seek to force Microsoft to install Netscape's browser alongside it own. But Charles Rule, a legal consultant to Microsoft, say that in both case the court threw out exclusionary practice only because they offered no consumer benefit. The court, he argues, never pounced on practice that resulted in lower price or better product or service. Nor did the court in either case call for balancing immediate benefit against hypothetical long-term harm. Rule argues that Microsoft's practice produce demonstrable consumer benefit. Besides, he say, unlike the action taken by The Lorain Journal or Aspen Skiing, Microsoft's contract do not prevent consumer from installing Netscape's browser or from using the Web site of Microsoft's rival. In truth, though, neither case answered what consumer benefit test should apply to product design. In Jefferson Parish Hospital District No. 2 et al. v. Hyde, another case cited by both side, the Supreme Court in 1984 recognized that surgeon and anesthesiologist provide an integrated service. Yet, the court said, a hospital with monopoly power would still not be allowed to force surgical patient to use it panel of anesthesiologist if consumer wanted to purchase the two service separately. That principle could undercut Microsoft's defense that the functional interdependence of Windows and Explorer requires bundling. But Microsoft will point to a strong concurring opinion that called for a tougher standard for the government to meet when it alleges tying. Microsoft will also draw support from several court ruling that allowed IBM to change the design of it computer in way that made it hard for vendor to attach peripheral equipment. But perhaps Microsoft's best argument is that nowhere ha the government identified a single case in which the court explicitly called for throwing out a tied product on the basis of a balancing test. The court, Microsoft will emphasize, steer clear of redesigning technically sophisticated product. The Justice Department's rejoinder is to note that the sole purpose of antitrust law is to protect consumer, so it make no sense to bless practice that provide a dollar's worth of benefit today but, by stamping out competition, drive price up by $1,000 tomorrow. The Justice Department will ask the court to at least insist that monopolist use the least exclusionary mean possible to achieve whatever service they provide customer. Experts agree that the court will subject Microsoft's restrictive contract with Internet company to a balancing test. But exactly how the court will decide whether consumer are helped or hurt is up for grab. A balancing test would have the court weigh the immediate benefit to consumer of one-click access to Internet site and of feature of a bundled Windows-Explorer package versus the harm over time of diminished competition in the market for browser and operating system. But a test that make good sense in theory can prove fiendishly difficult to use in practice. Balancing test are impossibly difficult and arbitrary, said Rep. Thomas Campbell, R-Calif., who is a former law professor at Stanford University. The practical effect of balancing is to hand defendant like Microsoft almost certain victory. Microsoft argues and many antitrust expert agree that the court have in fact gravitated away from a balancing test toward a simpler predation test for exclusionary contract. Under this standard, a contract is illegal only if it is intended to drive out competition and thus to pave the way for a monopolist to raise price later. Microsoft will have an easier time defending itself against a charge of predation, which amount to victimizing it customer, than it would defending itself against a charge that it bundled product doe consumer slightly more harm than good. The antitrust record, say William Baxter, who headed the antitrust division under President Reagan, is littered with contradictory, ambiguous and sometimes nonsensical verdict. He and other legal expert agree that if nothing else, that record leaf plenty of legal leeway for the Supreme Court, should it hear the Microsoft case, to stiffen the spine of the antitrust law. The legal tool that the government is using in it assault on Microsoft Corp. the Sherman Antitrust Act of 1890 is brief, vague and malleable. The combination ha meant that this bedrock statute of antitrust policy ha been at turn toothless and powerful over the year, depending on the politics and economics of the day a interpreted by the court. Sponsored by Sen. John Sherman, an Ohio Republican who wa the younger brother of the Civil War general William Tecumseh Sherman, the act wa passed a a nod to a popular backlash against the rise of the industrial trust in oil, steel and railroad. Farmers, laborer and small-business owner sizable voting group resented the trust a vehicle of concentrated power. But the trust, large national holding corporation, were viewed by many others a engine of modernization and industrialization. Economists at the time opposed the Sherman Act, and the law that Congress passed wa a vaguely worded compromise. No one knew what impact it would have, but one senator, quoted in Matthew Josephson's The Robber Barons, explained that nearly everyone agreed that something must be flung out to appease the restive mass. The act's two key provision, Sections 1 and 2, mention conspiracy, restraint of trade and attempt to monopolize. Yet while the Sherman Act is now interpreted a the Magna Carta of competition, it never us the term. After it wa passed, critic of the trust derided the impenetrable language of the Sherman Act and called it the Swiss Cheese Act. But by the early 1900s, the political climate had changed. The growing antagonism for the trust, especially a income gap widened, wa tapped by an avowed trustbuster, Theodore Roosevelt, who became president in 1901. The Sherman Act ha always been an elastic piece of social legislation, used to attack perceived exploitation and the aggregation of power, said Eleanor Fox, a professor at the New York University Law School. The model trust and the principal target of the trustbuster wa Standard Oil. Shrewdly, Roosevelt made a distinction between good trust, which thrived because of their superior efficiency, and bad trust, which grew not a the result of inevitable economic force but because of unfair business practice. Throughout the 1880s and '90s, Standard Oil's rival had complained about the company and the business practice of it founder, John D. Rockefeller. But during those year, the price of kerosene burned to light the nation's home declined steadily. So Standard Oil, it could could reasonably be argued, wa an enterprising monopoly. In the early 1900s, though, Standard Oil raised price in the United States to prop up it profit at a time it wa engaged in a price war against Royal Dutch/Shell in Europe, where Standard Oil did face genuine competition. When consumer were hurt by the Standard Oil monopoly, popular support for antitrust action against the company swelled, encouraged by Roosevelt and his successor, William Howard Taft. The federal suit against Standard Oil wa filed in 1906, and the Supreme Court approved the breakup of the company in 1911. Standard Oil and the Microsoft case, historian observe, have some common theme. Both were dominant company of their day, and Bill Gates, the Microsoft chairman, ha been called a modern Rockefeller. But there is no presidential involvement and there is no real consumer dissatisfaction in the Microsoft case, said Ron Chernow, author of Titan, a best-selling biography of Rockefeller. And Rockefeller, Chernow added, never went through the kind of honeymoon period of widespread public adulation and favorable press coverage a Bill Gates ha had. In the summer of 1995, a whiff of revolution wa in the air in Silicon Valley. The Internet offered a new deal in computing, a fresh opportunity for entrepreneur to try to break Microsoft Corp.'s firm grip on the personal computer software business. Leading the challenge wa Netscape Communications Corp., whose software for browsing the World Wide Web had ignited the Internet boom. Netscape chairman James Clark spoke boldly of attacking Microsoft head-on. He borrowed imagery from the movie Star Wars, referring to Microsoft a the Death Star and Netscape a the leader of a rebel alliance. Microsoft answered with a vengeance. It dispatched hundred of programmer to work on a competing browser and poured many million of dollar into marketing it. It prodded computer maker and others to distribute it browser, folded the browser into it industry-dominant Windows operating system and gave the browser away free a campaign intended to cut off their air supply, a a senior Microsoft executive described it. But not only competitor like Netscape have encountered Microsoft's force. Microsoft's partner, it corporate customer and professional investor who finance new venture have all collided with it. A close look at Microsoft's no-holds-barred push into the Internet software business offer a window into the way the company us it market muscle to influence the behavior of virtually every player in the industry. Some of the case recounted here figure prominently in the suit brought by the Justice Department and 20 state, scheduled to go to trial this month, charging that Microsoft at time went too far and violated antitrust law. Regardless of the legal outcome, previously unreported detail about incident in the suit and the other example provide a more complete picture of Microsoft in action. When Compaq Computer Corp. considered loading Netscape's browser instead of Microsoft's on it personal computer, Microsoft threatened to stop selling it Windows operating system to Compaq. The company quickly changed it mind. After Spyglass Inc. began supplying Microsoft with it early browser technology, Microsoft announced that it would give away it browser free. The timing came a a rude surprise to it partner Spyglass. The company lost most of it revenue almost overnight, a the technology, which it had also been licensing to company besides Microsoft, suddenly became available free. When America Online Inc., which competes fiercely with Microsoft's online service and electronic commerce division, went shopping for browser technology, Microsoft made an offer that wa too good to pas up: If America Online used Microsoft's browser a the main one for it million of subscriber, Microsoft would give America Online prime placement on the desktop screen of all personal computer using Windows. When Intel Corp. began developing it own Internet software, Microsoft complained. Intel, the leading maker of the microprocessor that serve a the electronic brain on most personal computer running Windows, pulled back. The chip maker decided that it lucrative hand-in-glove partnership with Microsoft took priority. Microsoft's reach in computing ha become so pervasive that nearly every year now, Silicon Valley's top venture capitalist meet privately with a team of top Microsoft executive to learn about the company's plan. The goal, one venture investor observed, wa to stay out of the way of the steamroller. Microsoft adamantly denies that it ha broken any law in these or similar situation. The company play the game of business hard, and it executive acknowledge that without apology. Yes, Microsoft say, rival may suffer and partner may be irritated occasionally. But the company insists it action are guided by it main corporate goal of bringing new technology inexpensively and conveniently to the million of people who use it software. Most people in the computer industry say that living in Microsoft's world mean routinely making accommodation to it. Microsoft's power emanates from it near-monopoly on the market for personal computer operating system, the master control program that run computer. Because it owns the operating system, Microsoft is the essential utility of the information age, said James Moore, president of Geopartners Research Inc., a technology consulting firm. It act a a kind of gatekeeper to the pipeline of computing innovation, sitting there and deciding whether to help some innovation or slow it down. For month, Microsoft and Netscape had talked on and off, circling each other warily. But the event that would define them a unflinching rival wa a meeting on June 21, 1995, in a second-floor conference room at Netscape's headquarters in Mountain View, Calif. That meeting, according to the Justice Department and 20 state suing Microsoft, wa the high-tech equivalent of the storied gathering in smoke-filled railroad car that inspired passage of the nation's antitrust law a century ago. On that day, they say, Microsoft made Netscape an illegal offer to divvy up the market for Internet browsing software, a collusion pact that Netscape rejected. Microsoft reply that the prosecutor are misinterpreting a routine meeting in the software business and that the company ha never tried to divide the browser market. Bill Gates, Microsoft's chairman and principal strategist, did not attend the Mountain View gathering, but he consulted by telephone with the Microsoft team. Two people who did attend that June meeting have been named a witness in the trial scheduled to begin next week: Netscape president James Barksdale and Daniel Rosen, Microsoft's general manager of new technology. In the trial, the government will contend that Microsoft presented Netscape with an all-or-nothing offer, according to people who have been questioned in the federal investigation. Relying heavily on note taken in the meeting by Netscape executive vice president Marc Andreessen and on the testimony of Barksdale, prosecutor are expected to assert that the Microsoft proposal had several element, both incentive and requirement. Microsoft, according to the people questioned by the government, would invest in Netscape, taking a 15 to 20 percent stake, give Netscape technical information and fine-tune Microsoft's operating system so that Netscape's software would run better on Windows. In return, the people say, Netscape would give Microsoft a seat on it board, license it technology to Microsoft, give Microsoft advance knowledge of it product-development effort and not make a browser for the next generation of the Microsoft operating system, Windows 95, which wa shipped two month after the June 1995 meeting. And Microsoft, the people added, did what it ha always denied it doe used access to it technology a a powerful lever in business negotiation, by offering Netscape preferential access to the Windows application program interface, or APIs, the link that enable other companies' program to run smoothly on the Windows operating system. By turning down the deal, Netscape, they say, would not have that preferred access to Microsoft technology a threat that Microsoft fiercely denies making. Barksdale, Netscape's 55-year-old chief executive, told a colleague that the encounter with Microsoft in June 1995 wa the damnedest meeting I've ever attended in 35 year in business. Had Netscape accepted Microsoft's offer, it would have had Microsoft's money and it endorsement. Netscape would have also been free to sell it browser for use in earlier version of Windows and for use on other operating system like Apple's Macintosh and Unix, a powerful system used mainly in corporation and research lab. But if we had licensed our technology to Microsoft and stepped aside, the best we could have hoped for wa becoming a company with sale of $100 million or so and hoping to be bought out by Microsoft, said Clark, a former computer scientist at Stanford University who founded Silicon Graphics Inc., a computer graphic pioneer, before starting Netscape. We didn't start Netscape for that. For any company, a meeting with Microsoft is often a charged affair. Every computing device from keyboard to disk drive, and every software program from game to browser, must mesh smoothly with Microsoft's Windows operating system. This is necessary to make computer reliable and easier to use, but it also give Microsoft it role a the industry's gatekeeper. And since Microsoft itself make all manner of software product beyond the operating system, other company are put in the uneasy position of requiring Microsoft's cooperation to be able to compete against it. And in the software industry, where every program is rendered in the digital code of 1's and 0's, the line that divide competition and cooperation are often blurred. The talk about that line at the Microsoft-Netscape meeting focused on the division between the operating system the platform, in computer term and the application program, sometimes called solution, that run on top of the operating system. The government suit state that in sworn testimony, Chris Jones, a Microsoft manager who attended the meeting, admitted that Microsoft `absolutely' intended to persuade Netscape not to compete. Microsoft read Jones' testimony very differently, a evidence mainly of the company's clarifying it position. If Netscape stayed on the application or solution side of the operating system, the two company could be partner, Microsoft said. But if Netscape tried to become a player in the platform space, they would compete. Microsoft released portion of the Jones deposition in September a evidence that the government had quoted the Microsoft manager out of context. Q. Do you recall any discussion about a desire of anybody on the part of Microsoft who wa participating to be able to persuade or influence Netscape not to compete? A. Absolutely. But again, persuade in the sense of force or persuade in the sense of, hey, we think we can have a great business relationship together. Later in the deposition, a Justice Department lawyer asked Jones whether any of the Microsoft executive intended to suggest that there would be any consequence to Netscape or it business if Netscape chose to go in the platform direction you've described earlier a opposed to the solution direction. Jones replied: The conversation wa something like the following: `We're in the platform business. We're going to invest heavily in this part of the platform because we feel it's critical to our technology. That's a done deal.' And we're asking them: `What is your business? Is your business platform or solution? If it's platform, we're in the platform business. We're competing.' Microsoft portrays such comment a innocuous statement of fact. But to Netscape, the same remark could be taken a a warning, if not a threat. This is because Internet browsing software had the potential to become an alternative platform to the Windows operating system. The browser, sitting on top of the operating system, could supplant Windows a the main desktop screen on users' machine and the main layer of programming for starting other software application. In addition, Netscape's browser could serve a a powerful platform for distributing and running Java, an Internet programming language developed by Sun Microsystems Inc., a Microsoft rival. In technical term, Netscape's upstart platform could replace Microsoft's APIs a the essential utility of computing. Indeed, Andreessen had boasted in public of Netscape's ambition to relegate Microsoft's Windows to so much software plumbing underneath the browser. By the June meeting, Microsoft certainly viewed Netscape a a serious potential challenger to Windows, the corporate crown jewel. On May 26, 1995, in an internal memo, The Internet Tidal Wave, Gates wrote: A new competitor `born' on the Internet is Netscape. Their browser is dominant with 70 percent usage share, allowing them to determine which network extension will catch on. Netscape's strategy, Gates wrote, wa to move the key API into the browser to commoditize the underlying operating system. THE BROADER INQUIRY: GOVERNMENT SEES ARM-TWISTING The federal government and the state have recently broadened their allegation against Microsoft by adding evidence that it tried to bully Intel, Apple Computer Inc. and other company to squelch competition. They say that like the Netscape meeting the new evidence fit a pattern of behavior by Microsoft, which ha repeatedly tried to limit competition by strong-arming competitor and partner. One episode that fit the pattern, the prosecutor contend, wa an effort by Microsoft to pressure Intel to shelve the development of multimedia and Internet software and to limit it cooperation with Netscape. Intel's main business is making the microprocessor chip that act a the electronic brain of most of the computer that run the Windows operating system. Indeed, the fortune of Intel and Microsoft are so closely aligned that the two company are sometimes referred to a a single, powerful entity, Wintel. But Intel also employ hundred of software engineer, mainly at it Intel Architecture Labs in Hillsboro, Ore. And while Intel and Microsoft are partner, they have also had their conflict, typically over the direction and pace at which certain innovation should be introduced into the personal computer industry, which they dominate together. Federal and state investigator have focused on Microsoft's strong reaction to work being done by Intel's software engineer a sentiment expressed in no uncertain term during a meeting at Intel's Santa Clara, Calif., headquarters on Aug. 2, 1995. The contentious session wa attended by several executive from Intel and Microsoft, including Gates and Intel chairman Andrew Grove. An internal Intel memo stated that Gates made vague threat about supporting Intel's competitor and that he wa livid about Intel's investment in the Internet and wanted them stopped. Later, Intel did pull back from it multimedia and Internet software development. Steven McGeady, an Intel vice president who attended the August 1995 meeting, is scheduled to appear a a witness for the government. Microsoft reply that the government's account of meeting like those with Netscape and Intel are fanciful distortion, created by using a biased selection of document and witness. The government's case, Microsoft asserts, betrays an utter failure to accept the computer-industry reality that Microsoft routinely meet with company to make sure their software and equipment will work well with Windows. Sometimes the talk, Microsoft say, go on to include further level of cooperation like licensing technology or a Microsoft investment, a the company discussed with Netscape. In the trial, Microsoft is expected to argue it advance in the browser market wa the result of it own business acumen and Netscape's misstep. To document Netscape's error, Microsoft issued a subpoena last month and obtained the unpublished manuscript of a new book, Competing on Internet Time: Lessons From Netscape and Its Battle With Microsoft, which is based on hundred of interview with current and former Netscape executive. The book doe chronicle the mistake made by Netscape. But it author, Michael Cusumano of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology's Sloan School of Management and David Yoffie of the Harvard Business School, think Microsoft is hardly blameless. Microsoft's take-no-prisoners strategy backfired, all but inviting retaliation from competitor, the government and even customer, Yoffie said. Emphasizing that he wa offering no legal judgment, Yoffie added, I think Microsoft could have achieved 90 percent of what it did without crossing the line a much a it did. THE SPYGLASS LINK: REWARDS AND PERILS OF A PARTNERSHIP On April 6, 1994, Gates and 20 Microsoft executive gathered for a daylong retreat not far from the company's headquarters in Redmond, Wash. The subject wa the Internet and how it might revolutionize the computer software business. Few concrete plan were made that day, but Microsoft executive insist that a direction wa set. Our vision from the outset wa to unite the two world of the Windows desktop and the Internet, said Steven Sinofsky, a Microsoft executive who attended the meeting. Yet Microsoft badly trailed Netscape in the browser field. To hasten it entry, Microsoft licensed it early browsing software from Spyglass Inc. of Naperville, Ill. The first meeting between the two company wa initiated by Spyglass in April 1994. At the time, it wa a tiny company and eager to do a deal with Microsoft. Spyglass wa selected a the commercial licensee for browser technology developed by the National Center for Supercomputing at the University of Illinois. In the summer of 1994, Douglas Colbeth, president of Spyglass, met with Clark of Netscape at O'Hare International Airport in Chicago. The two men talked in the United Airlines Red Carpet Room, reserved for business-class passenger, and Colbeth recalled Clark telling him, We're going to take Microsoft head-on. At the time, Colbeth recalled thinking to himself, Great, now Microsoft will really want to license from me. Today, he noted: Remember, we were a company with a couple dozen people and almost no money in the bank. Netscape had Jim Clark, with his money and reputation, and big-time venture capital backing from Silicon Valley. Netscape had a very different agenda. By July 1994, Microsoft had become quite interested in the Spyglass technology, Colbeth say, and the two company signed their first licensing agreement the following December. Microsoft, Colbeth recall, always told him that it would eventually fold browser technology into it operating system, but it timing wa accelerated by Netscape's rapid rise. Microsoft wa initially hoping to charge for the browser, Colbeth said. But on Dec. 7, 1995, Gates declared that Microsoft would not only deeply integrate it browser into Windows but would give it away. The announcement caught the industry, even Colbeth, by surprise. At the time, Spyglass had licensed it technology to 82 other company, including IBM and Digital Equipment, for use in their software product a licensing revenue stream of about $20 million a year. As a result of Microsoft's move, Spyglass saw those revenue vanish within a year, a smaller Internet software company went out of business and big customer shifted to Microsoft's free browser. Spyglass slashed it payroll and scrambled into new niche of the software industry to replace it lost sale, which it succeeded in doing eventually. Whenever you license technology to Microsoft, you have to understand it can someday build it itself, drop it into the operating system and put you out of that business, Colbeth said. THE NONOPTION COMPAQ: SUDDENLY SEES THE LIGHT Well into 1996, Netscape's share of the browser market continued to rise, while Microsoft made little headway, even though it browser wa free. Industry analyst and trade magazine agreed that Netscape's browser wa the clear technical leader. In April 1996, Netscape's Navigator wa used by 87 percent of people browsing the Web, compared with 4 percent using Microsoft's Internet Explorer, according to Zona Research. So the biggest personal computer maker, Compaq, thought it made sense to give customer Netscape's browser instead of Microsoft's. But Microsoft would not stand for that and Compaq had no choice but to give in. In June 1996, Compaq wanted not only to load the more popular Netscape browser on it machine but also to remove the icon for Microsoft's Internet Explorer, which wa delivered to the computer maker with Windows 95. Microsoft informed Compaq that if it removed Internet Explorer, the computer maker would lose it license for Windows, said Stephen Decker, Compaq's director of software procurement, in testimony to federal investigator. The ultimatum from Microsoft wa delivered bluntly in a letter headed, Notice of Intent to Terminate License Agreement. Faced with being denied the essential operating system, Compaq quickly reversed course and kept the Internet Explorer icon. Microsoft asserts that Windows and Internet Explorer are a single product and that Microsoft alone defines what is in the product. Nothing in it contract, Microsoft add, prohibits computer maker from including competing technology. While the cutoff letter Microsoft sent to Compaq seems an unnecessarily hardball tactic when dealing with it largest corporate customer, Microsoft chief operating officer Bob Herbold insists that to take one letter here or one snippet of e-mail there to try to portray Microsoft a an arrogant company is unfair. Noting that a Compaq executive is a witness for Microsoft, Herbold said, We are totally dependent on tremendous relationship with key company like Compaq. At Netscape, however, the Compaq episode wa a watershed. That wa the singular act that got me going to the Justice Department, Barksdale recalled. Barksdale said he regarded Microsoft's tactic of forcing Compaq to buy it browser a a condition of obtaining an essential product, the Windows operating system, a an illegal act and absolute proof that Microsoft wa a monopolist. After investigating the incident, the Justice Department and the state agreed with Barksdale that Microsoft wa illegally tying the sale of one product to another. Microsoft reply that it ha a long history of adding new feature to it operating system. And from the outset, Microsoft say, it intended that Windows and it Internet Explorer browser would be seamlessly integrated, a they are now in Windows 98. Thus, Microsoft insists, there is no product-tying violation of antitrust law. In a separate case, a federal appeal court sided with Microsoft, upholding the principle that the company could put whatever it wanted to in it operating system and declare it a single product. But in June 1996, when Compaq wanted to offer the Netscape product instead of Microsoft's browser, most industry expert viewed the browser and operating system a two different software program. It took a long time for the integration strategy to play out, said a former senior Microsoft researcher. Back then, integration wa basically bolting a browser onto Windows. THE `BALANCING ACT': AMERICA ONLINE TOSSES IN TOWEL America Online chairman Stephen Case refers to dealing with Microsoft a a delicate balancing act. That balance swung sharply from the fall of 1995 to the spring of 1996, when Microsoft used the lure of giving America Online a featured place on the Windows desktop a the ultimate bargaining chip. To gain access to computing's most coveted real estate, America Online agreed to make Microsoft's Internet Explorer the main browser for it online subscriber, who now number more than 13 million. Yet throughout 1995, a Microsoft prepared to introduce Windows 95, the most significant improvement ever in it operating system, Case wa knocking on the door of the Justice Department. His complaint wa that Microsoft wa going to place it new online service, Microsoft Network, a direct competitor to America Online, prominently on the desktop screen of Windows 95, which wa introduced in August. This bundling tactic of using the industry-dominant operating system to market Microsoft Network, or MSN, Case argued, gave Microsoft an unfair advantage in the young but fast-growing online business. The Justice Department listened and investigated. But ultimately, the government decided against taking any action. At America Online's headquarters in Vienna, Va., Microsoft wa both feared and loathed at the time. America Online had a designated Microsoft watcher, a young MBA. who tracked it adversary's every move. Above the desk in his small, windowless office wa a picture of Gates. Beneath the picture, in large block letter, were the word THE ENEMY. Though America Online wa the clear leader in the online service business, it had ample reason to worry about an all-out assault by a rival a rich and aggressive a Microsoft. When he had visited the Microsoft headquarters a couple of year earlier, Case recalled, Gates had bluntly assessed Microsoft's option by saying he could buy 20 percent of America Online, all of it or enter the online business on his own and bury you. A threat or merely a statement of the fact? A bit of both, Case said recently. But he wa mainly articulating what everybody at that meeting kind of intuitively understood. Yet by 1996, Microsoft and America Online found they had reason to cooperate. With the exploding popularity of the Internet's World Wide Web, the conventional online company, like America Online and Compuserve, had to provide their customer Internet access a well a their own service. America Online had it own browser, but to keep pace with the rapidly advancing technology it made sense to do a deal with Netscape or Microsoft. For both software company, a deal with America Online, which had 5 million subscriber at the time, could mean a big surge in browser use and market share. Netscape seemed the natural partner for America Online, since both company were Microsoft rival. On March 11, America Online did announce that it would buy Netscape technology, but it wa a standard licensing deal based on a payment-for-use formula. The next day, America Online announced a more significant deal with Microsoft making it browser the default technology the browser America Online subscriber would use unless they specifically asked for Netscape's Navigator. To win the deal, Microsoft offered to give America Online a start-up icon on the Windows desktop precisely the kind of equal treatment on the main Windows screen that Case had asked the Justice Department to require of Microsoft. After we agreed to it Internet Explorer browser, Microsoft allowed u to be bundled on the Windows desktop, Case said. It wa an example of Microsoft's pragmatic side. The pragmatic decision wa that the paramount corporate goal wa to increase browser market share to protect the mainstay software business. As a result, it new online service, MSN, would have to sacrifice an important marketing advantage over it main rival, America Online. It wa Bill's decision, said former MSN general manager Russell Siegelman, referring to Gates. He sent me e-mail on it. He said he didn't think it would hurt MSN that much. I disagreed with him. To other Microsoft executive, Gates expressed a different view of the likely impact on MSN. He told senior vice president Brad Silverberg that putting America Online on the Windows desktop would amount to putting a bullet through MSN's head, according to a deposition taken by the Justice Department. In the antitrust suit, the government asserts that the America Online deal show how Microsoft used the power of it Windows monopoly to give it an edge in the browser war against Netscape. David Colburn, a senior vice president of America Online who took part in the browser negotiation with Microsoft, is a witness for the government. Today, Microsoft ha overhauled it Internet strategy to focus mainly on building popular special-interest Web site in field like travel, personal finance, automobile retailing and news. And it is putting these site, along with e-mail and search feature, in an all-in-one site that us the name MSNcom. I still regard Microsoft a a primary threat, Case observed. Microsoft ha a history of getting it right in the long run, and there's no reason to think it won't in this business a well. We will always be in Microsoft's cross hair. THE LESSON: DON'T CONFRONT A STEAMROLLER At Netscape's headquarters in Silicon Valley, the strategy today is one of avoiding head-to-head competition with Microsoft whenever possible. Don't do something that is in Microsoft's path that's the lesson learned, observed Clark, the Netscape chairman. Silicon Valley's venture capitalist, the investor who finance so many of the nation's high-tech startup, generally follow the Netscape formula these day. Yet that still leaf ample room to prosper. For while competing directly with Microsoft is dangerous, the software industry a a whole is an engine of wealth creation, job generation and technical innovation. And there is an ambivalent side to the venture community's relationship with Microsoft. For if a start-up cannot steer clear of Microsoft entirely, the favored option is to be bought out by Microsoft, which ha scooped up many fledgling company a a way of acquiring promising technology and people. Microsoft understands start-up innovation and how to co-opt start-up innovation better than any other high-tech company, said James Breyer, managing partner of Accel Partners, a venture capital firm. As Microsoft ha grown, it ha come to be seen not merely a a competitor but a a force of nature that shape the business environment, like a weather front. Microsoft is incredibly pervasive, said Stewart Alsop, a partner with New Enterprise Associates, a venture capital firm in Menlo Park, Calif. At the board meeting of the company in which his firm ha invested, two issue always come up, he said: One is the price of the company's stock, and the other is what Microsoft is going to do. In the last few year, Microsoft ha offered it guidance during almost yearly meeting between senior Microsoft executive and leading venture capitalist. The meeting are part of Microsoft's effort to improve it sometimes prickly relation with Silicon Valley. We work hard to provide clarity about where we're going and where we're not going, said Greg Maffei, Microsoft's chief financial officer. Last year's conference took place in October at the Quadrus office building on Sand Hill Road in Menlo Park, the Wall Street of high-tech venture investing. Maffei led a team of five Microsoft executive who appeared before a group of 40 venture capitalist, one of whom stood and asked the question that seemed to be on the mind of many of his peers: How do I invest in a company that stay out of the way of the steamroller? Maffei, recalled one person who attended the meeting, stood up and delivered a brief lecture on business that Microsoft wa likely to avoid. His list included specialized software for manufacturing, human resource management, computer-aided design and others. But, this person noted, broad swath of the industry appeared to be designated a off limit including new software platform that might compete with Microsoft's personal computer operating system. At one point, Ruthann Quindlen, a partner with Institutional Venture Partners, leaned over to Vinod Khosla, a co-founder of Sun Microsystems and a partner at the venture capital firm Kleiner Perkins Caufield &AMP; Byers, and said quietly, I guess that leaf u washing machine and toaster. Following is the text of the first two section of the Sherman Act, a passed by Congress in 1890. As the foundation on which federal antitrust law ha been built, the act ha been amended several time elevating the crime to a felony, increasing the fine and prison term for individual and setting fine for corporation convicted of violating it. In the case of Microsoft, the government ha invoked the Sherman Act to file a civil suit that seek to change the company's business practice, not a criminal suit that seek financial penalty. An Act to Protect Trade And Commerce Against Unlawful Restraints and Monopolies: Section 1. Every contract, combination in the form of trust or otherwise, or conspiracy, in restraint of trade or commerce among the several States, or with foreign nation, is hereby declared to be illegal. Every person who shall make any such contract or engage in any such combination or conspiracy, shall be deemed guilty of a misdemeanor, and, on conviction thereof, shall be punished by fine not exceeding five thousand dollar, or by imprisonment not exceeding one year, or by both said punishment, in the discretion of the court. Section 2. Every person who shall monopolize, or attempt to monopolize, or combine or conspire with any other person or person, to monopolize any part of the trade of commerce among the several States, or with foreign nation, shall be deemed guilty of a misdemeanor, and, on conviction thereof, shall be punished by fine not exceeding five thousand dollar, or by imprisonment not exceeding one year, or by both said punishment, in the discretion of the court. Will it matter to consumer that Bill Gates isn't a nice guy? Until last week, most Americans thought of Gates, the chairman of the Microsoft Corp., a a genius and innovator. A nerd perhaps but also a self-styled visionary who almost single-handedly unlocked the power of the personal computer. Monday, however, in a Washington courtroom, the Justice Department began painting a different, darker portrait of Gates. In an antitrust suit brought by the department and 20 state, the man whose company command a 97 percent share of the market for personal computer operating system is being depicted a a Nixonian schemer who will go to almost any length to crush his competition. Product innovation, the suit argues, is not a sufficient weapon for Gates. Flashing back and forth between snippet of Gates' videotaped deposition and e-mail message he had sent that contradicted his testimony, the government sought to establish a pattern of threat and offer of payment by the Microsoft chairman. It also sought to cast Gates a an obsessed man who feared the tiny Netscape Communications Corp. and it potential threat to his domination of the market for Internet browser, the software used to navigate the World Wide Web. Gates wa portrayed by Justice Department litigator David Boies a a schoolyard bully who ride roughshod over the computer industry with a crudeness that is in stark contrast to his popular image a a benevolent dictator and high-technology guru. According to a document presented by Boies, for example, Gates asked America Online executive in 1996: How much do we need to pay you to damage Netscape? This is your lucky day. The implication, Boies said, wa that the amount wa irrelevant, and that Microsoft, with it deep pocket and market dominance, make a many offer you can't refuse a needed to achieve it goal. Microsoft official are closely watching market survey for any hint that the new image of a bare-knuckled Gates might be detracting from the company's world-famous brand name, but they insist that the public will continue to draw a distinction between allegation of anticompetitive business tactic and the company's software. Despite what you're reading in the press, people judge u by our product, said Mich Matthews, head of Microsoft's corporate public-relations office. Our experience is that people vote with their pocketbook. So far, consumer are casting positive vote. Last week Microsoft reported quarterly profit of $1.52 billion, a stunning 58 percent increase over the level a year earlier. Despite the record profit, some marketing expert say that if the public come to view Gates a a Rockefeller-style robber baron, his company and it brand name may suffer. When you have a company with such a visible chief executive, the CEO is really the driver of the brand, said David Aaker, a brand marketing expert at the Haas School of Business at the University of California at Berkeley. There is no question this is going to affect Microsoft's brand recognition. Already there are early warning signal, a political cartoon in newspaper across the country bashed Gates last week. One showed him holding a globe and saying, If you don't play my way, I'll take my ball and go home; another portrayed the Microsoft chairman standing next to a henchman dangling someone from a window while a Microsoft secretary say to a caller, I'm sorry, but Mr. Gates is busy teaching a competitor about Windows. But some industry analyst believe the new view of a Bill Gates who know how to play hardball may not be such a bad thing for his company. The he-said, she-said round of e-mail message being dragged out in court case both in Washington and in Silicon Valley, where Microsoft is locked in a legal battle with it archrival, Sun Microsystems Inc., is viewed by some a little different from the exaggerated trash talking that go on in professional sport. It's like taking what Charles Barkley and Michael Jordan say to each other on the ball court and turning it into something more sinister than it really is, said Paul Andrews, co-author with Stephen Manes of Gates (Doubleday, 1993). Indeed, there is evidence that the darker view of Gates and his company ha so far taken root only in the District of Columbia and in Silicon Valley, where the computer industry ha long felt the impact of Gates' tactic, and where bitterness and distrust of Microsoft are deep. In the rest of the country, Gates continues to enjoy great popularity. Two week ago, while speaking before a crowd of almost 7,000 student at Indiana University, a questioner who asked about the Justice Department's suit wa roundly booed. BILL GATES, WHIPPING BOY c.1998 NY. Times News Service Is Bill Gates a high-tech Machiavelli, Public Enemy No. 1 or a threat to the known universe? All three, judging from the numerous political cartoon that popped up in newspaper across the country last week. From Chattanooga to Boston, cartoonist took delight in demonizing Gates, who is facing an unexpected public relation challenge a Microsoft's antitrust trial unfolds in Washington. Other cartoon ran the gamut from the predictable (a worker, pointing to an aquarium in which a large fish is gobbling up smaller one, saying to some visitor, Welcome to Microsoft's research and development department) to the weird (a dweebish man hunched in front of a computer screen staring at the words: Our beloved leader, Mr. Gates, is under attack. Leave your possession. Go to the desert. Await the spaceship). And that wa just Week One of the trial. Stay tuned. A federal judge Friday pushed back the starting date of the antitrust trial against Microsoft Corp. by four day, to Oct. 19, while also ordering the company to comply with the Justice Department's request to examine Microsoft's financial record. Microsoft argued that allowing an army of government attorney to come in and make demand will make it very difficult for u to remain in business. But after winning assurance from government lawyer that they would make only narrow, targeted search of the record, Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson of the US. District Court for the District of Columbia ordered Microsoft to open the database for perusal. Microsoft had asked that the trial be delayed several more month to prepare a defense against what it said wa a last minute broadening of the case by the Justice Department, which had added new evidence. Last month, the government said that in the process of preparing for the trial it had discovered that Microsoft tried to persuade Apple Computer not to market it Quicktime multimedia software to Windows customer. On Thursday, the Justice Department and 20 state added two new people to their witness list to testify about Microsoft dealing with Apple and with Sun Microsystems. Avi Tevanian, a former Apple executive, wa added to the witness list in part to describe Microsoft's proposal, which Microsoft denies ever having made. The other new witness wa James Gosling, a Sun executive who led the development of Java, an Internet programming language that Microsoft see a a potential threat to the company's dominance of the software market. The government is charging that Microsoft took illegal step to prevent Java from gaining wide acceptance. To counter that, Microsoft named two new witness Friday, Robert Muglia, a senior Microsoft executive who ha worked with Sun, and Chris Engstrom, an executive who handled some of Microsoft's dealing with Apple. At the same time, John Warden, Microsoft's lawyer, argued that the new allegation had no place in the case. The Justice Department, Warden told the judge, wa trying to turn this into something approximating a plenary monopoly case like the IBM case. It becomes clearer and clearer and clearer with each new filing that they are trying to turn this into a broader case, he said. You can't have this bait-and-switch in which they file a complaint alleging A, B, C, and then talk about the whole alphabet three time over. As a result, Warden said, Microsoft wanted, at a minimum, another two-week delay, even though a more normal schedule would have the trial start next year. The judge did not respond. Instead he entered an order setting the Oct. 19 trial date. Late Friday, Microsoft entered a formal motion asking for another two-week delay. A response is expected next week. The case of United States v. Microsoft Corp., the government's most aggressive move against a monopolist in almost 25 year, is playing out against a century of antitrust law so broadly worded and court ruling so ambiguous that both side are citing the same ruling to support their opposing argument. Whatever the outcome of the trial, scheduled to begin Monday in US. District Court in Washington, an almost certain appeal will leave to the Supreme Court the task of bringing legal order to 100 year of clashing antitrust doctrine. The case focus on Microsoft's Windows, the operating system that control about 90 percent of all personal computer sold today. The government say it objective is to curb illegal monopolistic business practice that threaten to render large part of the economy vulnerable to the vicissitude of a single company. Microsoft asserts that the case is intended to give the government control over which feature can be added to Windows. However grand the economic stake, the legal dispute is narrow. The government say that Microsoft's contract with computer manufacturer and with company that provide access to the Internet illegally stifle competition. The contract prohibit manufacturer from substituting Netscape Communications Corp.'s Navigator browser for Microsoft's Internet Explorer. They also prohibit them from removing from the Windows main screen, or desktop, link to site on the World Wide Web run by Microsoft or it partner. Microsoft's contract with company that connect people to the Internet and with business that sell good and service on the Web require favored treatment for Internet Explorer over Navigator in exchange for link on the Windows desktop. In the wake of the lawsuit, Microsoft ha voluntarily dropped some of these requirement, though it could reinstate them at will. Microsoft say that it contract are legal because they produce tangible benefit for customer, including easier Internet access. The Justice Department say that the bundling of Explorer with Windows 95 and the inclusion of the browser a part of Windows 98 amount to tying, an illegal practice that force customer of one product to purchase another. The contract with manufacturer and Internet service are illegal, the government say, because they are intended not only to create a monopoly in the browser market but to protect Microsoft's existing monopoly in operating system. The latter threat is key, according to the Justice Department. Browsers have the potential, like an operating system, to act a a software platform on which other program run. So contract intended to drive browser out of the market would also insulate the Windows monopoly. Many antitrust expert say the problem facing the Justice Department is that the court have provided no clear definition of tying and no clear guideline for determining when contract are illegally exclusionary. Professor Lawrence White of New York University, who wa chief economist of the Justice Department's antitrust division in the early 1980s, say that the court treat tying a an unusual practice when in fact it is ubiquitous. No one, he said, would challenge the right of manufacturer to tie eraser to the tip of pencil, tire to an automobile or button to shirt. His point, shared widely among economist, is that some tying benefit consumer if, for example, it result in product that are easier to use or enables a company to recover development cost. But tying can be bad if it lock in monopoly power. The court, White say, have not offered enough guidance for distinguishing good tying from bad, which is the nub of the legal dispute. Microsoft say it need only to show that bundling Windows and Explorer pass what might be called a gross consumer benefit test that it offer an immediate benefit, whether or not it cause long-term damage to competition and, therefore, ultimately to consumer. The Justice Department say that Microsoft's practice must clear a higher hurdle: yielding net consumer benefit that are immediate and large enough to balance possible long-term harm to competition. So which test of consumer benefit satisfies antitrust law? The simple answer is that no one know for sure, which is why both side can reasonably cite the same case without fear of embarrassment. Consider a 1985 case, Aspen Skiing Co. v. Aspen Highlands Skiing Corp., and a 1951 case, Lorain Journal Co. v. United States. In the first, Aspen Skiing, the owner of three major ski run in Aspen, Colo. the monopolist had for year sold a ticket in cooperation with Aspen Highlands, a competitor, that gave skier access to both companies' run. When Aspen Skiing unilaterally canceled the agreement, it rival's revenue shriveled and the rival sued. The Supreme Court ruled that Aspen Skiing had violated antitrust law because there wa no evidence it action helped consumer. In the Lorain Journal case, the only local newspaper in Lorain, Ohio, refused to sell advertising to company that advertised on a new radio station. Here, too, the Supreme Court ruled that the exclusionary practice did nothing to benefit consumer. Indeed, in Aspen Skiing, the court even forced the monopolist to do business with it rival, a precedent that augur well for the Justice Department, which seek to force Microsoft to install Netscape's browser alongside it own. But Charles Rule, a legal consultant to Microsoft, say that in both case the court threw out exclusionary practice only because they offered no consumer benefit. The court, he argues, never pounced on practice that resulted in lower price or better product or service. Nor did the court in either case call for balancing immediate benefit against hypothetical long-term harm. Rule argues that Microsoft's practice produce demonstrable consumer benefit. Besides, he say, unlike the action taken by The Lorain Journal or Aspen Skiing, Microsoft's contract do not prevent consumer from installing Netscape's browser or from using the Web site of Microsoft's rival. In truth, though, neither case answered what consumer benefit test should apply to product design. In Jefferson Parish Hospital District No. 2 et al. v. Hyde, another case cited by both side, the Supreme Court in 1984 recognized that surgeon and anesthesiologist provide an integrated service. Yet, the court said, a hospital with monopoly power would still not be allowed to force surgical patient to use it panel of anesthesiologist if consumer wanted to purchase the two service separately. That principle could undercut Microsoft's defense that the functional interdependence of Windows and Explorer requires bundling. But Microsoft will point to a strong concurring opinion that called for a tougher standard for the government to meet when it alleges tying. Microsoft will also draw support from several court ruling that allowed IBM to change the design of it computer in way that made it hard for vendor to attach peripheral equipment. But perhaps Microsoft's best argument is that nowhere ha the government identified a single case in which the court explicitly called for throwing out a tied product on the basis of a balancing test. The court, Microsoft will emphasize, steer clear of redesigning technically sophisticated product. The Justice Department's rejoinder is to note that the sole purpose of antitrust law is to protect consumer, so it make no sense to bless practice that provide a dollar's worth of benefit today but, by stamping out competition, drive price up by $1,000 tomorrow. The Justice Department will ask the court to at least insist that monopolist use the least exclusionary mean possible to achieve whatever service they provide customer. Experts agree that the court will subject Microsoft's restrictive contract with Internet company to a balancing test. But exactly how the court will decide whether consumer are helped or hurt is up for grab. A balancing test would have the court weigh the immediate benefit to consumer of one-click access to Internet site and of feature of a bundled Windows-Explorer package versus the harm over time of diminished competition in the market for browser and operating system. But a test that make good sense in theory can prove fiendishly difficult to use in practice. Balancing test are impossibly difficult and arbitrary, said Rep. Thomas Campbell, R-Calif., who is a former law professor at Stanford University. The practical effect of balancing is to hand defendant like Microsoft almost certain victory. Microsoft argues and many antitrust expert agree that the court have in fact gravitated away from a balancing test toward a simpler predation test for exclusionary contract. Under this standard, a contract is illegal only if it is intended to drive out competition and thus to pave the way for a monopolist to raise price later. Microsoft will have an easier time defending itself against a charge of predation, which amount to victimizing it customer, than it would defending itself against a charge that it bundled product doe consumer slightly more harm than good. The antitrust record, say William Baxter, who headed the antitrust division under President Reagan, is littered with contradictory, ambiguous and sometimes nonsensical verdict. He and other legal expert agree that if nothing else, that record leaf plenty of legal leeway for the Supreme Court, should it hear the Microsoft case, to stiffen the spine of the antitrust law. Shortly before the government filed it antitrust suit against Microsoft Corp. in May, Joel Klein, the assistant attorney general in charge of the Justice Department's antitrust division, met with a Silicon Valley executive. The executive recall telling Klein that unless a case went beyond the Internet browser market, it would have little effect on Microsoft's power to stifle competition across the computer industry. Klein replied that he understood the computer executive's concern. But he said time wa running short and the strongest evidence in hand involved Microsoft's battle against Netscape Communications Corp. in the market for the so-called browser software used for navigating the Internet. This is a Netscape case, the executive recall Klein saying. But five month later, the case that the government is bringing to trial on Monday extends well beyond Netscape and the browser war to embrace what it described in a recent court filing a a broad pattern of anti-competitive conduct by Microsoft. Netscape, the government insists, is still a prime example of the pattern but only one of several example. The 12-person witness list for the Justice Department and 20 state suing Microsoft reflects the new evidence added to the case since May. James Barksdale, Netscape's president and chief executive, will appear first, but he will be followed by executive representing a cross section of the nation's high-technology company including Intel, IBM, Sun Microsystems, Apple Computer, America Online and Intuit. In bringing a more ambitious, complicated case to trial than the one it filed in May, the government ha chosen a high-risk strategy. The law state that new evidence can be added to a suit after it is filed, but not new charge. And so, in his federal courtroom in Washington, U.S.District Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson could decide to rule out some of the new evidence a ranging too far afield from the original suit. But if the government win it broadened case, the court-ordered remedy would no doubt be far tougher on Microsoft. In May, the government's suggested step amounted to equal treatment for Netscape's browser and Microsoft's browser. But the government recently asked that the judge hold a separate hearing on remedy, if it win the case. The remedy under consideration now include more basic change in Microsoft's business practice perhaps even a breakup of the company intended to loosen Microsoft's grip on computing. That would be precisely the kind of sweeping reform that Microsoft's foe would applaud. The government ha doubled the bet and doubled the stake, said David Yoffie, a professor at the Harvard business school who is co-author of the book, Competing on Internet Time: Lessons From Netscape and Its Battle With Microsoft. Meanwhile, in the Microsoft camp, the government's strategy is dismissed a a desperate act taken after a court ruling in June that threatened to undermine the antitrust suit. That ruling came in a separate case, involving the interpretation of the consent decree that Microsoft signed with the Justice Department in 1995. In the June ruling, a federal appeal court said that Microsoft could bundle it browser with it industry-standard Windows operating system and call them one product. The appeals-court ruling would seem to undercut the assertion in the government's current antitrust case that the browser and the operating system were two separate product, bundled together and given away in an effort to thwart competition in the browser market. With the appeals-court ruling in June, the government lost the heart of it case, said Charles Rule, a former senior official in the Justice Department, who is now a consultant to Microsoft. So it ha taken a blunderbuss approach of scrambling to throw everything it can find even evidence the Justice Department ha had for year into the gun barrel and see what hit. The June appellate ruling did shake the prosecution team. But mostly it strengthened the hand of those within the Justice Department who had been urging that the case be broadened, according to people who have worked on the investigation. At the same time, they say, new evidence wa coming in a the investigation moved ahead and prosecutor raced to meet the accelerated trial schedule approved by the court. Speed wa a priority from the outset, they say. The Justice Department and the state filed their suit in May to move before Microsoft's new operating system, Windows 98, wa introduced in June. While not seeking to block the release of Windows 98, government lawyer wanted to get to the the courtroom a early a possible a PC maker and computer user adopt this latest version of Microsoft's Windows operating system, which function a the central nervous system for more than 90 percent of personal computer sold. The key allegation, government lawyer note, have not changed since May namely, that Microsoft illegally used it market power in operating system to defend it monopoly position and to try to extend into new market. But the only thing that wa wrapped up in a bow in time for the May filing wa the browser, said one person who worked on the case. The real game plan wa always to get a broader case. What is more, one person noted, the prosecution team wa not at full strength until shortly before the suit wa filed. David Boies, a renowned courtroom litigator and a former partner at Cravath, Swaine &AMP; Moore who successfully defended IBM in it 13-year confrontation with the government, wa named a special counsel for the Justice Department last December. But Boies, who left Cravath last year, did not start working full-time for the Justice Department until mid-April, because he wa still finishing private case for his own firm, Boies &AMP; Schiller. The antitrust suit filed in May leaned heavily on the Netscape story, mentioning Microsoft's main rival in the browser market some 130 time in the complaint and a supporting memorandum. But it also prominently mentioned Microsoft's tactic against Sun Microsystems, creator of Java, an Internet programming language, and cited it a an example of Microsoft's behavior. It wa crafted a a template that could be added to without much stretching, one person involved in the case said. And so, a new evidence piled up and seemed to fit into a pattern, Klein step by step approved the widening of the case, the person said. And that explains, the person continued, how it is that evidence that ha been in the hand of the Justice Department for year ha been added to the case since May; only after gathering new evidence did it become apparent that the older material fit the pattern of the current case. For example, the government ha added the contention that Microsoft pressured Intel Corp., the big microchip maker and a close partner of Microsoft, to curb it development effort in multimedia and Internet software because they might conflict with Microsoft's plan. The government contends that the arm-twisting occurred at meeting between the two company three year ago, especially one on Aug. 2, 1995, which wa attended by Andrew Grove, the Intel chairman, and Bill Gates, the Microsoft chairman. Part of the government's evidence in the Intel-Microsoft episode is copy of the handwritten note taken by Steven McGeady, an Intel vice president who attended the meeting, and a memo written by him on Aug. 28, 1995. The memo, still under court seal, said that Gates made vague threat and wa livid about Intel's investment in the Internet and wanted them stopped. A handwritten note, also under court seal, quote Paul Maritz, a Microsoft executive, a saying that Netscape is their common enemy and that Intel's role should be to fill in stuff in and around Microsoft's strategy. These document were sent by Intel to the Justice Department's office in San Francisco in November 1995, in response to a Civil Investigative Demand a civil subpoena served on Intel on Nov. 10, 1995. On it own, the Intel material wa intriguing, but it became part of the antitrust suit only a other evidence surfaced, one person close to the case said. The government is contending that Microsoft also tried to urge Apple to stop selling it Quicktime multimedia software in the Windows market and tried to convince Real Networks Inc. to pull back in the market for so-called streaming software. The government case ha also broadened, people involved in the case say, a more witness from the industry have been increasingly willing to testify. In the beginning, most people in the industry believed that the government would lose and Microsoft would retaliate if they came forward, one person said. But a the strength of our case wa perceived to improve, more people were willing to come forward, and thing snowballed. You get Intel, it's easier to get Apple and so on. ","Business rivals are seeking to break Microsoft Corp.'s monopoly on computer operating systems.The Government and 20 states have filed an anti-trust suit against Microsoft, invoking the Sherman Anti-trust Act of 1890.The suit began with a Microsoft vs Netscape battle over browser software but now extends far beyond that aiming at Microsoft's overall aggressive anti-competitive conduct.The effort is extensive but inconsistent because of the ambiguity of anti-trust laws, especially the Sherman Act.The Government is examining Microsoft's financial records and painting a dark image of its Chairman Bill Gates.An unpublished book may be crucial to the trial.","In 1998 the Justice Department filed a civil suit against Microsoft to change its 9-year pattern of anti-competitive conduct.Bill Gates appears a schemer ready to crush competitors by any means.He uses Microsoft's clout to squelch internet competition.A 1996 Netscape complaint over browsers was central to the case, which grew to include Intel, IBM, Sun, Apple, AOL, and Intuit.Microsoft was ordered to let Justice examine its records and sought a trial delay.An unpublished book provided evidence.The 1890 Sherman Anti-Trust Act centered on Standard Oil and was intended to protect consumers, but its wording is broad and rulings have been ambiguous.","The Justice Department and 20 states filed a suit against Microsoft for violation of the Sherman Act, charging it illegally tried to use its dominance as the provider of Windows, the industry standard operating system, to stifle competition in other areas.At the heart of the case are Microsoft's contracts with computer manufacturers that prohibit them from substituting Netscape's Navigator browser for Microsoft's Internet Explorer, but Justice also alleges Microsoft exhibited a broad pattern of anti-competitive conduct with numerous other software companies.Microsoft says that Windows and its browser is one tool that offers immediate consumer benefit.","The government suit against Microsoft is the most aggressive antitrust case in a quarter century.The heart of the case is the Internet browser battle between Microsoft and Netscape.Microsoft says that its Internet Explorer is an integral part of its Windows system, the industry dominant operating system.Microsoft, it is argued, has told computer manufacturers that if they want Windows, they must forgo Netscape.The Justice Department and 20 states are joined in the action brought under the Sherman Antitrust Act.Microsoft's chairman, Bill Gates, usually seen as a visionary is portrayed in much darker tones in the trial."
1038,"An Islamic militant group on Thursday threatened to retaliate if Saudi dissident Osama bin Laden is arrested, and described Washington's No. 1 enemy a a hero to Muslims worldwide. Bin Laden, believed to be in Afghanistan, and a top aide were indicted Wednesday by a US. District Court in the US. embassy bombing in Africa and are accused of conspiring to kill Americans outside the United States. The State Department also announced a reward of up to dlrs 5 million for bin Laden's capture. It is a challenge to the entire Muslim world . Bin Laden is a hero of the Muslim world, said Omar Warsi, a leader of Pakistan's militant Sunni Muslim group, Sipah-e-Sahaba, or Guardians of the Friends of the Prophet. If anything happens to him, America will be responsible. Many Sipah-e-Sahaba follower are fighting in neighboring Afghanistan alongside the Taliban army, which rule 90 percent of Afghanistan and ha imposed a strict version of Islamic law in those area. Warsi's group is well-armed with everything from machine gun to rocket launcher. In Pakistan, it ha been blamed in killing of hundred of Shiite Muslims, whom the group reviles a non-Muslims based on a centuries-old dispute over who wa the proper successor to the Prophet Mohammed. Harakat-ul-Ansar, a Pakistan-based organization labeled a terrorist group by the United States, said, however, that foreigner in Pakistan have nothing to fear from u. Harakat is considered a strong supporter of bin Laden, and several Harakat follower were killed in the US. missile attack on alleged bin Laden terror site in Afghanistan. What the United States doe is their business, said Abdul Bassit, a Harakat follower. He added, however, that the United States should know bin Laden is a good Muslim, and all the Muslim world think he is a good Muslim. The Taliban say bin Laden is a respected guest who will not be extradited. However, they have set up a judicial inquiry to accept evidence of bin Laden's involvement in terrorist activity and have promised to prosecute him if the evidence warrant it. Washington blame bin Laden's group, al Qaeda, for the Aug. 7 bombing of US. embassy in Kenya and Tanzania that killed 224 people, including 12 Americans, and injured an estimated 5,000 people. The United States retaliated Aug. 20, firing Tomahawk cruise missile at suspected bin Laden training camp in eastern Afghanistan. At least 26 people were killed, but damage to the area wa not considered extensive. The US. Embassy in Pakistan evacuated nonessential staff and family member prior to the August bombing of Afghanistan, fearing retaliation. While some embassy worker are back, their dependent and about 30 percent of the staff have not been allowed to return. Embassy official said no fresh security warning followed Wednesday's indictment. Security measure already in place include cement barricade blocking the road leading to the US. Embassy in Islamabad and razor-sharp barbed wire topping the brick-walled compound. In the northwestern Pakistani city of Peshawar, on the border with Afghanistan, the US. consulate is surrounded by barbed wire and protected by an armored personnel carrier and dozen of armed police. The New York Times said in an editorial on Monday, Oct. 26: Since the deadly bombing of two American embassy in Africa in August, there ha been a troubling accumulation of evidence that the State Department inexplicably ignored warning of possible terrorist attack against the installation. The latest and most disturbing account suggests that nine month before the truck bombing in Kenya, the department received a detailed description of the planned attack but did little to strengthen security at the embassy. The pattern of negligence demand examination by the Clinton administration and Congress. Shortly after the bombing, the department acknowledged that the American ambassador in Kenya, Prudence Bushnell, had earlier recommended that the embassy be moved to a safer location. Her advice wa rejected. On Friday, Raymond Bonner and James Risen of The New York Times reported that an Egyptian now believed to have been directly involved in the bombing outlined the Kenya plot to American intelligence official last November. Mustafa Mahmoud Said Ahmed's account wa so specific he said terrorist were planning to detonate a truck bomb in the embassy's underground garage that it called for more than a temporary increase in security. Unhappily, it wa discounted, even thought to be a ruse to lure the embassy into new security measure that terrorist could monitor and defeat. The logic of this is hard to fathom, and harder still to explain to relative of the Americans and Kenyans killed in an attack nearly identical to the plan Ahmed described. Since the bombing, the department ha been quick to close embassy temporarily if attack seem imminent. It would be interesting to know if the intelligence behind those decision wa any more credible than Ahmed's warning. No one at the State Department is happy with the department's handling of security matter, but the tendency to blame limited funding and bureaucratic inertia is disheartening. Of course, additional money would have made it possible to harden defense at more embassy, and Congress ha now added to the security budget. But more decisive leadership in the department could have assured preventive step were taken in East Africa. The Taliban's chief justice accused the United States on Wednesday of looking for an excuse to launch another missile attack on his war-shattered homeland. And that excuse is Osama bin Laden, the man Washington call Enemy No. 1 and blame for the Aug. 7 bombing of US. embassy in East Africa, Justice Noor Mohammed Saqib said an interview with The Associated Press. On Aug. 20 the United States retaliated by firing Tomahawk missile at suspected terrorist camp in eastern Afghanistan, killing 26 people. According to US. intelligence source, the camp were being used to train member of bin Laden's al Qaeda terrorist group. America is looking for an excuse to fire more rocket on our dear Afghanistan and that excuse is bin Laden, Saqib said. Washington, which ha posted a dlrs 5 million reward for bin Laden's arrest, hasn't ruled out further attack on Afghanistan. Saqib, who head a judicial inquiry established by the Taliban to investigate the terrorism charge against bin Laden, say the United States ha become insecure. America fear it shadow . in every part of the world it is afraid and see every danger connected to bin Laden, he said in an interview in the Afghan capital of Kabul. In Afghanistan, bin Laden is considered an honored guest by his Taliban host. They cite Afghan tradition, which demand the host guarantee his guest protection. So far Saqib say he ha no evidence of bin Laden's involvement in terrorist activity. The Taliban have refused to turn over bin Laden to the United States, but they say if there is evidence they will try him under Islamic law. In the 90 percent of Afghanistan ruled by the Taliban a harsh brand of Islamic justice ha been imposed, including the death penalty. We want good relation with the United States and all Muslim and non-Muslim country, but they have to respect our way, he said. Saqib said his inquiry will wind up on Nov. 20 and if there is no evidence against bin Laden the case will be closed at least for the Taliban. Bin Laden is not a sinful man . America ha been silent . they have given no evidence, he said. It is too shameful for America who is now seen by all that world to have no reason to go after bin Laden. The man accused of orchestrating the US. embassy bombing in Tanzania and Kenya wa declared a free man Friday in Afghanistan, where he ha lived for year with the permission of the hard-line Islamic Taliban militia. The Taliban, who control about 90 percent of Afghanistan, on Friday closed their three-week inquiry into allegation that Osama bin Laden is waging a war of terror against the United States. It's over, and America ha not presented any evidence, Afghanistan's chief justice, Noor Mohammed Saqib, told The Associated Press in an interview at the Supreme Court building in the Afghan capital, Kabul. Without any evidence, bin Laden is a man without sin. . He is a free man. The Taliban have told bin Laden, however, that political activity is banned and he ha agreed to respect that, the Taliban information minister said in a statement Friday. The minister, Amir Khan Muttaqi, also disputed US. assertion that bin Laden is a rich man, saying the Saudi dissident ha had his foreign asset frozen, a claim not immediately corroborated. Police and soldier on Friday blocked off the street in front of a house where member of a terrorist gang are believed to have assembled the bomb that blew up the US. Embassy, killing 11 people. Wearing glove and mask, detective from the Tanzanian Criminal Investigation Division could be seen searching the yard of the house that is surrounded by a high fence. Residents, who were questioned Thursday by Tanzanian police and FBI agent, told reporter Friday there were four regular visitor to the house. They all came at night and used a white 1989 Suzuki Samuri, which is in police custody. Two men, Tanzanian Rashid Saleh Hemed and Egyptian Mustafa Mahmoud Said Ahmed, have been formally charged by a Tanzanian magistrate in the Aug. 7 embassy bombing. Police are looking for two other suspect identified Ahmad Khalfan, a Tanzanian of Omani origin and Fahad, a Kenyan of Yemeni origin. A relative of Hemed told The Associated Press the house in the Bungoni neighborhood of Ilala district had been rented by Ahmad Khalfan. The house is south of the center of Dar e Salaam and about 6.5 kilometer (4 mile) southwest of the embassy building. The relative, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said in addition to Khalfan, the three other visitor to the house were Fahad, Ahmed and Hussein. He did not furnish second name for them, and it wa not clear whether Ahmed wa the same Egyptian charged in the Dar e Salaam bombing. Residents said police showed them photograph, but they were not able to identify them because it wa always dark when they arrived and left. But all were able to identify the Suzuki vehicle. Officials believe a 1987 Nissan Atlas refrigerator truck actually carried the bomb into the embassy compound. It ha been identified by it chassis, all that remains. There ha been speculation that two men in the Suzuiki used a remote control device to detonate the bomb. A nearly simultaneous attack in neighboring Kenya killed 213 people, including 12 Americans, at the US. Embassy in Nairobi. US. authority have charged four people in connection with the Nairobi blast. Three are in custody in New York, and a fourth is a fugitive. Mohamed Sadeek Odeh, one of the three men in custody in the United States for the Nairobi bombing, told police in Pakistan where he wa arrested after arriving from Nairobi Aug. 7 that Ahmad Khalfan wa a member of the group responsible for the bombing in Dar e Salaam. According to the same Pakistani police source, Odeh identified Fahad a being involved in the Nairobi embassy bombing. A federal grand jury in Manhattan returned a 238-count indictment Wednesday charging the Saudi exile Osama bin Laden with conspiring to bomb two US. embassy in Africa in August and with committing act of terrorism against Americans abroad. Government official immediately announced that they were offering two reward of $5 million each for information leading to the arrest or conviction of bin Laden and another man charged Wednesday, Muhammad Atef, who wa described a bin Laden's chief military commander. Bin Laden is believed to be living in Afghanistan under the protection of the Taliban, the Islamic fundamentalist movement that rule that country. Atef's whereabouts are unknown. Prosecutors also unsealed an earlier indictment, issued in June, that included similar but le detailed charge against bin Laden. That indictment wa returned before the embassy bombing and wa the result of a two-year investigation into his activity in Somalia and Saudi Arabia, a well a report that he had connection to a circle of Islamic militant in Brooklyn. The new indictment, which supersedes the June action, accused bin Laden of leading a vast terrorist conspiracy from 1989 to the present, in which he wa said to be working in concert with government, including those of Sudan, Iraq and Iran, and terrorist group, to build weapon and attack American military installation. But the indictment give few detail of bin Laden's alleged involvement in the embassy attack. The indictment doe not, for example, specify whether prosecutor have evidence that bin Laden gave direct order to those who carried out the attack. Nothing in the document indicates why the original indictment wa kept secret for month, but the secret charge were returned about the time that American official were plotting a possible raid into Afghanistan to arrest bin Laden. Mary Jo White, the US. attorney in Manhattan, said, It's very common to have sealed indictment when you're trying to apprehend those who are indicted. Both indictment offer new information about bin Laden's operation, including one deal he is said to have struck with Iraq to cooperate in the development of weapon in return for bin Laden's agreeing not to work against that country. No detail were given about whether the alleged deal with Iraq led to the development of actual weapon for bin Laden's group, which is called Al Qaeda. The government said Wednesday that bin Laden's group had used private relief group a conduit for transmitting fund for Al Qaeda. The group were not identified. Prosecutors also said bin Laden's group had conducted internal investigation of it member and their associate, trying to detect who might be acting a informant, and had killed those who had been suspected of collaborating with enemy of the organization. The government indicated earlier that it knowledge of bin Laden's activity stemmed in part from the cooperation of one such informant, who it said Wednesday had worked for bin Laden, transporting weapon and explosive, helping to buy land for his training camp and assisting in running his finance. While the June indictment against bin Laden suggested that the government had a great deal of knowledge of his dealing in the month before the embassy attack, the new charge are an indication of how quickly the government ha worked to solve the embassy attack, which occurred just three month ago. Ms. White said bin Laden wa charged with plotting and carrying out the most heinous act of international terrorism and murder. Citing the more than 250 people killed in the embassy attack and the more than 1,000 wounded, she added, In a greater sense, all of the citizen of the world are also victim whenever and wherever the cruel and cowardly act of international terrorism strike. The investigation of bin Laden is continuing, said Ms. White and Lewis D. Schiliro, assistant director of the FBI in New York, whose agent have fanned out around the world to look into the embassy attack. Our investigative strategy is clear, Schiliro said. We will identify, locate and prosecute all those responsible, right up the line, from those who constructed and delivered the bomb to those who paid for them and ordered it done. A federal district judge agreed Tuesday to review complaint by lawyer for three men arrested after the bombing of two US. embassy in Africa that their jail condition in Manhattan are unconstitutional and inhumane. Judge Leonard Sand of US. District Court in Manhattan said he had received an eight-page letter from lawyer for two of three defendant in custody in Manhattan. The lawyer complained that their client were being held in total isolation for almost 24 hour a day in a unit called 10 South, the most restrictive holding area in the Metropolitan Correctional Center in lower Manhattan. The defendant are allowed only brief period of exercise in a barren room, called the rat cage, a defense lawyer, Michael Young, wrote in the letter. A second lawyer, Leonard Joy, concurred with the view in the letter, which wa made public Tuesday. In agreeing to review the condition, Sand said, Certainly it ha to be addressed, that is, the condition of confinement for all of the defendant. The judge made his comment in the first hearing in the bombing case since last week's indictment by a federal grand jury of Osama bin Laden, who the authority believe wa the mastermind of the embassy attack. Bin Laden remains at large and is believed to be living in Afghanistan under the protection of the Taliban, the Islamic fundamentalist movement that rule that country. In discussing condition at the Manhattan jail, the lawyer said that two of the defendant have not been able to call their family, while the third ha been allowed to make only one phone call. The lawyer added that the defendant cannot have visitor, write letter, or receive mail or book. The skirmishing continued in court. I cannot give my client a dictionary, a third lawyer, Bruce McIntyre, who represents Wadih el Hage, told the judge. El Hage ha been charged with conspiring to kill Americans abroad and ha been described by the government a a former personal secretary to bin Laden. The two other defendant in court Tuesday Mohammed Saddiq Odeh and Mohamed Rashed Daoud al-'Owhali have each been charged with separate count of murder in the death of more than 200 people in the embassy attack in Kenya and Tanzania on August 7. All three men have pleaded not guilty. Patrick Fitzgerald, an assistant US. attorney, told the judge that the government would have a response by Friday, and his comment suggested that the government will be prepared to make some modification in the restriction. German police raided several location near Bonn after receiving word of a terrorist threat against the US. Embassy, but no evidence of a planned attack wa found, official said Wednesday. Police, including agent of an elite anti-terrorist unit, checked several suspect during raid in an industrial zone and other site Tuesday, but no arrest were made, said Eva Schuebel, spokeswoman for the Federal Prosecutor's Office in Karlsruhe. The agency said it had received credible information that Middle East terrorist had stockpiled arm and explosive at the site, but none were found. The agency's investigation is continuing, Schuebel said. For now, we can no longer speak of an immediate threat to the US. Embassy, she said. The embassy had no comment. Security wa tightened at US. installation worldwide after the Aug. 7 bombing of the US. embassy in Kenya and Tanzania. Saudi dissident Osama Bin Laden is wanted by US. official for those attack. A suspected top aide of bin Laden, Mamdouh Mahmud Salim, is jailed in Germany pending a US. extradition request, raising concern about reprisal on German soil. US. authority charge Salim helped finance, train and arm member of a terrorist organization, including the alleged bomber of the US. embassy in Kenya and Tanzania. In September, German police stepped up security at the US. consulate in Hamburg after receiving a tip about a possible threat. NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) FBI agent this week began questioning relative of the victim of the Aug. 7 US. Embassy bombing a well a the seriously injured on request of the US. Attorney's office for the Southern District of New York, a US. official said Thursday. The blast at the embassy building in downtown Nairobi killed 213 people, 12 of them Americans, and injured 5,400. In an nearly simultaneous bombing of the US. Embassy in Dar e Salaam in neighboring Tanzania, 11 people were killed and 85 were injured, none of them Americans. The official, who could not be further identified, said the questioning wa aimed at gathering recorded testimony to be used by the prosecution in the pre-sentencing phase of the trial of the six men indicted in connection with the attack. Wadih El Hage, Mohamed Sadeek Odeh and Mohamed Rashed Daoud Al-'Owhali are being held by the US. District Court in the Southern District of New York. All three have pleaded innocent. Fazul Abdullah Mohammed is a fugitive. Saudi exile Osama bin Laden, the alleged mastermind of a conspiracy to attack US. target around the world, and Muhammad Atef, the alleged military commander of bin Laden's terrorist organization, Al-Qaeda, were charged in a separate 238-page indictment with murder and conspiracy in the bombing. Bin Laden is believed to be living in Afghanistan. US. law provides for the trial in the United States of those charged in terror attack against American citizen, even if carried out on foreign soil. Federal prison official have cut off virtually all communication for two men being held in Manhattan in the bombing of the US. embassy in Kenya and Tanzania. A federal prison official said Monday that the government moved under a rarely used federal rule that allows prison official to limit an inmate's contact to prevent future act of violence and terrorism. A spokesman for the federal prosecutor's office declined to say whether the authority foresaw further threat of terrorism. But the law allows official to impose restriction where they believe there is a substantial risk that an inmate's communication could result in death or serious bodily injury. Under the provision, approved by the Justice Department, prison official may segregate prisoner from other inmate, and cut off their correspondence, visit, interview with the news medium and use of the telephone. It wa not clear yesterday which of these restriction would be applied to the two bombing suspect, Mohamed Saddiq Odeh and Mohamed Rashed Daoud al-'Owhali. The rule doe permit communication with their lawyer. A Bureau of Prisons official in Washington confirmed that the two men are joining a group of about six inmate throughout the country being held under the restriction. The total population of federal prison exceeds 108,000 inmate. Others similarly restricted include Sheik Omar Abdel Rahman, the Egyptian cleric convicted in the conspiracy to blow up landmark in New York, and Ramzi Ahmed Yousef, convicted of masterminding the World Trade Center bombing in 1993. Michael A. Young, the lawyer representing Odeh, said he wa somewhat concerned because these are pretrial defendant, after all. You can't punish them in advance of any determination of whether they are guilty or innocent, he said. Leonard F. Joy, al-'Owhali's lawyer, said his initial impression is that some of the restriction could hinder his ability to represent his client.

1043,"Lebanon's Parliament on Tuesday ratified a constitutional amendment to clear the way for the election of the army's commander, Gen. Emile Lahoud, a president. Lahoud ha received the backing of Syria, the main power broker in the country, making the election by Lebanon's pro-Syrian Parliament later this week just a formality. A total of 113 deputy voted for the amendment and four deputy against, including the general's cousin, Nassib Lahoud, a presidential aspirant. Eleven deputy were absent. Among those who were absent wa Walid Jumblatt, a Cabinet minister who had said he would boycott the session to protest the choice of a military man even though Lahoud ha wide public and political support. The 128-member legislature is expected to meet Thursday to elect Lahoud after outgoing President Elias Hrawi sign the constitutional amendment. The amendment to Article 49 of the constitution revoke a ban on senior civil servant from running for the presidency. The new president will be sworn in Nov. 24, the day Hrawi leaf office. Hrawi ha served for nine year, including a three-year extension in 1995 to his six-year term. Lahoud, a Maronite Catholic, will keep alive a 55-year-old tradition under which the president is a Maronite, the prime minister a Sunni Muslim and the Parliament speaker a Shiite Muslim. Lahoud, appointed army commander in 1989 amid a rebellion in the fractured military during the 1975-90 civil war, is credited with rebuilding the 55,000-strong Lebanese army and in ending the reign of militia. Many hope he will copy his success with the military in the government, which is plagued by nepotism and waste of public fund. But some fear of military dominance of public life. Prime Minister Rafik Hariri ha declined an informal invitation from Lebanon's new president to form the next government, sparking a political crisis in this country a it rebuilds from it devastating civil war. Sources close to the prime minister, whose Cabinet ha been in care-taker capacity since last Tuesday's swearing in of Emile Lahoud a president, said Hariri turned down the invitation from Lahoud to select a new Cabinet. There ha been no formal announcement from Lahoud reappointing Hariri a prime minister. Although Hariri's move could be a bargaining tactic, since he remains the front-runner for the premiership, the apparent tension between the two powerful men could affect Lebanon's economic stability a it recovers from the 1975-90 civil war. Hariri, 53, the architect of Lebanon's multibillion dollar postwar reconstruction program, ha been in power since 1992. A billionaire businessman who made his fortune in Saudi Arabia, Hariri is credited with restoring economic confidence and stabilizing the national currency. Lahoud, 62, commander of Lebanon's army who wa propelled to power with widespread popular backing, pledged in a tough inauguration speech to clean up the graft-riddled administration. The British-trained general made his name rebuilding the army after it disintegrated in the civil war. Previous dispute among government leader have cost the Central Bank hundred of million of dollar in it effort to stabilize the Lebanese pound. Such political dispute in Lebanon in the past were solved only with the intervention of Syria, the main power broker in this country. Damascus support both Lahoud and Hariri. Lahoud had been expected to issue a presidential decree last week asking Hariri to form the next government. The decree wa to be issued after the president polled member of the 128-seat Parliament on their choice for prime minister. But many legislator, who in the past gave their overwhelming support to Hariri, did not name him and, instead, left it to the president to select a prime minister. The two leader met Friday, but no presidential decree followed. The source close to Hariri, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the prime minister's decision to bow out came because he did not feel Lahoud wa following constitutional procedure in selecting the premier. The Hariri camp argues that the president can poll Parliament member on their choice for prime minister but cannot accept a mandate to name a person of his choice. The dispute, in fact, appears to be the opening salvo of a struggle on how Lebanon will be governed during Lahoud's six-year term. Toward the end of former President Elias Hrawi's nine year in office, Hariri virtually had a free hand in running the country. Parliament on Thursday formally elected Gen. Emile Lahoud, the popular army commander who ha the backing of powerful neighbor Syria, a Lebanon's next president. All the 118 legislator present at the session cast vote in his favor. Lahoud is to be sworn for a six-year term on Nov. 24, the day President Elias Hrawi leaf office. Prime Minister Rafik Hariri's effort to win a fourth term in office have hit a snag after he failed to receive the expected speedy appointment from new President Emile Lahoud. Hariri is still the front-runner to form the next government but Saturday's Daily Star newspaper quoted source a saying that Hariri wa outraged that only 62 of the 128 member in Parliament declared their support for him during a meeting with Lahoud Friday. According to the constitution, a president must begin his term by appointing the prime minister and a Cabinet through a decree issued after consulting with Parliament member. A presidential decree wa expected Friday but nothing came through after a meeting between Lahoud and Hariri. Hariri had even scheduled Friday a traditional meeting between the prime minister-designate and former prime minister, but that wa canceled. The state-run National News Agency said that while only 62 deputy told Lahoud they supported Hariri, the rest refused to divulge their choice or left it to the president to decide. A TV station owned by Hariri said he won the backing of at least 100 deputy. The delay reflects the tug-of-war among the power broker in the country. Under a formula aimed at preventing the recurrence of the 1975-90 civil war, power in Lebanon is shared equally by a Maronite Christian president, a Sunni Muslim prime minister and a Shiite Parliament speaker. While the Christian Lahoud may have no objection to appointing the Sunni Hariri, it is possible that Parliament Speaker Nabih Berri's 19 Shiite supporter in the legislature are holding out to emphasize their value. The leading An-Nahar and other newspaper said the delay could last for day. But in the end, it is Hariri that is most likely to be renamed on the strength of his record in office. Hariri, Lebanon's top businessman, ha almost single-handedly created a multibillion dollar program to rebuild a country destroyed by the civil war. He is also credited with stabilizing the currency and restoring confidence in the postwar economy. But his government under former president Elias Hrawi were dogged by accusation of corruption. Hariri, who ha been prime minister since 1992, wa appointed three time during the extended term of former President Elias Hrawi. He ha remained in office a caretaker prime minister since Lahoud succeeded Hrawi on Tuesday. Lahoud, a general who a army commander rebuilt the military from 1989 until his election by Parliament in October, ha pledged in his inauguration speech Tuesday to clean up the corruption-plagued administration. The commander of Lebanon's army will become the country's next president after winning the crucial backing of Syria, the powerbroker in Lebanon. Congratulations, your excellency the general, Lebanese Prime Minister Rafik Hariri told army commander Emile Lahoud in a telephone conversation Monday that wa headlined on the front-page of the leftist newspaper As-Safir. Lebanese medium said the matter wa settled Monday at a meeting in Damascus between outgoing President Elias Hrawi and Syrian President Hafez Assad, whose country dominates it weaker, smaller neighbor. Agriculture Minister Shawki Fakhoury, a Hrawi confidant, said Tuesday that Lahoud is expected to be elected by the 128-member Parliament at an extraordinary session on Oct. 15. The election is a formality since other candidate have little chance now that Syria ha thrown it weight behind Gen. Lahoud. In another formality before the election, the Parliament will amend the constitution, which forbids senior public servant from running for president. The new president must be sworn in on Nov. 24, the day Hrawi leaf office at the end of his six-year term. The choice of Lahoud, a Maronite Catholic, will continue a 55-year-old tradition under which the president is a Maronite, the prime minister a Sunni Muslim and the Parliament speaker a Shiite Muslim. Agreement among the three official is essential for the smooth running of the government. Since Lahoud ha a good relationship with Hariri and Speaker Nabih Berri, little change wa expected in government policy. Lahoud's nomination end week of suspense over the identity of the next head of state. Lahoud, a 62-year-old naval officer trained in Britain and the United States, enjoys wide public and political support at home and ha good relation with Syria. But the choice could not have been sealed before a final say from Assad, who keep 30,000 troop in this country. His word is referred to in the Beirut medium a the password. Lahoud, elevated from rear admiral to general and appointed army commander in 1988 amid a rebellion in the fractured military during the 1975-90 civil war, is credited with rebuilding the 55,000-strong Lebanese army and in ending the reign of militia. In Lebanon, the army commander head the air force, navy and the ground force. Many hope he will copy his success with the military in government, which is plagued by nepotism and waste of public fund. But some fear that a military man in the nation's highest office could mean a return to the use of intelligence service to track civilian life the case under Fouad Chehab, the only other army commander to become president, who ruled from 1958 to 1964. The election of a military man is a threat to democracy in Lebanon, Raymond Edde, a Christian politician living in self-imposed exile in France, told the An-Nahar newspaper. Prime Minister Rafik Hariri, the business tycoon who launched Lebanon's multibillion dollar reconstruction from the devastation of civil war, said Monday he wa bowing out a premier following a dispute with the new president. He accused President Emile Lahoud of violating the constitution and demanded that he acknowledge it before he could reconsider his position. Hariri's move could be a ploy to gain more power a a new government is formed, but the crisis atmosphere generated by the possible departure of the billionaire businessman could affect Lebanon's economic recovery. I'm not a candidate, Hariri said in a live interview with CNN. He demanded that Lahoud admit that he acted unconstitutionally by allowing 31 Parliament deputy to authorize him to name a prime minister instead of naming one themselves. Such an action might put the country in danger, Hariri warned. Asked if there wa a risk of renewed conflict in Lebanon over the alleged tampering with the constitution, Hariri said: If the president continues with this, I don't know what will happen. But the dispute between the two leader appears to be over who will have the upper hand in governing the nation of 3.2 million. Lahoud, 62, is an army commander who want to assert his authority at the start of his six-year presidential term. Hariri, 53, virtually ha had a free hand in running the country since he became premier six year ago under former President Elias Hrawi. A brief meeting on Monday between the two did not help resolve the disagreement. Hariri's Cabinet ha been serving in a caretaker capacity since Lahoud's inauguration last Tuesday. Lahoud on Monday set the stage for choosing a new prime minister when he scheduled a fresh round of consultation with Parliament for Tuesday and Wednesday. In a statement, Lahoud said Hariri wa asked but declined to form the next government after a previous round of consultation. The offer came after the 128 legislator polled by the president gave Hariri a majority but fell short of the near unanimous backing he had received in his previous three mandate since 1992. Hariri is credited with restoring economic confidence and stabilizing the national currency. His globe-trotting travel to drum up political and economic support were sometimes instrumental in drawing international financial aid and investment. But he wa faulted for declining living standard at home and a rise in corruption in government. Lahoud pledged in a tough inauguration speech to clean up the graft-riddled administration. The general enjoys widespread popular backing after succeeding in rebuilding an army fractured by civil war. Central bank official on Monday tried to calm fear about a run on the Lebanese pound by announcing that the bank wa ready to intervene with it foreign currency reserve if necessary, the state-run National News Agency reported. It added that the money market remained stable.

It added that the money market remained stable. A Cabinet minister and a close Syria ally on Wednesday criticized the Syrian-backed choice of the army commander a president, and said he will boycott a vote to elect the military man for the executive post. Walid Jumblatt, the minister for displaced person, said he and his party's three legislator will not vote when the 128-member Parliament elect the president, likely sometime before Oct. 23. Although a boycott by Jumblatt's Progressive Socialist Party will hardly spoil the chance of Gen. Emile Lahoud, it could embolden others to express discontent at the choice and the process of his election. Lahoud is virtually assured of the job: the prime minister and the parliament speaker first approved Lahoud, who then won the all-important backing of Syria, the main power broker in Lebanon. Historically, we do not approve that a military man take control of the country, Jumblatt told reporter after a meeting with outgoing President Elias Hrawi. Although opposition to Syria's hold on Lebanon's politics is common among anti-Syrian politician, it is rare for somebody like Jumblatt to openly speak against a decision personally cleared by Syrian President Hafez Assad who keep 30,000 troop in Lebanon. Like Jumblatt, some in Lebanon fear that a military man a president could mean intelligence agent will track civilian life just a they did between 1958 and 1964 during the presidency of Fouad Chehab, the only other army commander to become head of state. In nominating Lahoud, rule were not respected, Jumblatt said. Things were supposed to run in a more democratic way, said Jumblatt, whose Druse militia fought Christian force during the 1975-90 civil war. The new president must be sworn in on Nov. 24, the day Hrawi leaf office after a six-year term. Jumblatt said there is adequate political diversity and competition in the country, implying that choosing a military man for president wa unnecessary. Deputy Prime Minister Michel Murr sought to calm fear about military intrusion. He told reporter that Lahoud will keep the army out of politics just a he kept politics out of the army. Lahoud, a 62-year-old naval officer, enjoys wide public and political support at home and ha good relation with Syria. He gained public admiration for reuniting an army fractured by civil war and in ending the reign of militia. Many hope he will cleanse the government of nepotism and wastage of public fund. Lahoud's nomination complies with a tradition that the president be a Maronite Christian, the prime minister a Sunni Muslim and Parliament speaker a Shiite Muslim. The government is run by the joint effort of the three official. Jumblatt said his party will also boycott a Parliamentary session to amend the Constitution so that senior public servant can run for president. Criticism of the nomination process also came from a meeting of Catholic bishop on Wednesday. Nevertheless, the bishop welcomed the choice of Lahoud, a fellow Catholic, a statement said. Parliament on Thursday formally elected Gen. Emile Lahoud, the popular army commander who ha the backing of powerful neighbor Syria, a Lebanon's next president. All the 118 legislator present at the session cast vote in his favor. Lahoud is to be sworn in for a six-year term on Nov. 24, the day President Elias Hrawi leaf office. Prime Minister Rafik Hariri ha declined an informal invitation from Lebanon's new president to form the next government, sparking a political crisis in this country a it rebuilds from it devastating civil war. Sources close to the prime minister, whose Cabinet ha been in care-taker capacity since last Tuesday's swearing in of Emile Lahoud a president, said Hariri turned down the invitation from Lahoud to select a new Cabinet. There ha been no formal announcement from Lahoud reappointing Hariri a prime minister. Although Hariri's move could be a bargaining tactic, since he remains the front-runner for the premiership, the apparent tension between the two powerful men could affect Lebanon's economic stability a it recovers from the 1975-90 civil war. Hariri, 53, the architect of Lebanon's multibillion dollar postwar reconstruction program, ha been in power since 1992. A billionaire businessman who made his fortune in Saudi Arabia, Hariri is credited with restoring economic confidence and stabilizing the national currency. The dispute appears to be the opening salvo of a struggle on how Lebanon will be governed during Lahoud's six-year term. Toward the end of former President Elias Hrawi's nine year in office, Hariri virtually had a free hand in running the country. Lahoud, 62, a former commander of Lebanon's army, wa propelled to power with widespread popular backing. He pledged in a tough inauguration speech to clean up the graft-riddled administration. The British-trained general made his name rebuilding the army after it disintegrated in the civil war. Similar political dispute in Lebanon in the past have been solved only with the intervention of Syria, the main power broker in this country. Damascus support both Lahoud and Hariri. Lahoud had been expected to issue a presidential decree last week asking Hariri to form the next government after the president polled member of the 128-seat Parliament on their choice for prime minister. But many legislator, who in the past gave their overwhelming support to Hariri, did not name him and, instead, left it to the president to select a prime minister. The two leader met Friday, but no presidential decree followed. The source close to Hariri, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the prime minister's decision to bow out came because he did not feel Lahoud wa following constitutional procedure in selecting the premier. ","Lebanon's leadership changed in Nov 1998.Army commander Emile Lahoud was elected to a 6-year term as President by the Parliament and took office on Nov 24.He had the backing of Syrian President Assad, the powerbroker in Lebanon, and a special constitutional amendment in Oct cleared his way.He did not immediately ask Prime Minister Rafik Hariri to form a new government.Hariri, the nation's top businessman, had served three terms and rebuilt the nation, but some accused him of corruption.His support in the Parliament had also slipped, but many believed Lahoud was trying to assert his authority.When finally asked to form a government, Hariri refused.","Power in Lebanon is shared equally by a Maronite Christian president, a Sunni Muslim prime minister, and a Shiite Parliament speaker, an arrangement made to prevent a recurrence of the 1975-90 civil war.Syria, with 30,000 troops in Lebanon is the main power broker there.The Lebanese parliament amended the constitution to permit popular army general Emile Lahoud to become president.Prime minister Rafik Hariri, the architect of Lebanon's postwar reconstruction, expected to get a fourth term but a conflict with the new president led him to bow out as premier.Lebanon's economic stability has been threatened by the conflict.","Lebanon's Parliament voted the country's top military man, Gen. Emile Lahoud, president.Lahoud, who promises to clean up a graft-riddled government, is popular and is backed by powerful Syria.It is unclear, though, whether Prime Minister Hariri, in office since 1992 and credited with the country's economic recovery, will continue to head the cabinet.31 of 128 legislators chose not to support him, leaving it to the president to name the next prime minister.Consequently, Hariri withdrew his candidacy, claiming the president acted unconstitutionally when he accepted the mandate to name a prime minister.Hariri's administration was plagued by nepotism.","Army Commander and Maronite Catholic Emile Lahoud was named Lebanon's president for the next 6 years, chosen by outgoing President Hrawi and Syria's Hafez Assad.Traditionally the president is a Maronite, the PM a Sunni, and Speaker of Parliament a Shiite.Election by Parliament is a formality.The constitution was amended to permit senior public servants to be president.Lahoud rebuilt the army and ended militia reign.Walid Jumblatt opposed a military president, fearing a return of surveillance on civilians.PM Rafik Hariri, a businessman who rebuilt the country and economy, refused his delayed re-appointment by Lahoud, who vowed to fight corruption."
1050,"Trying to deflect foreign criticism of a crackdown on democracy campaigner, China sent a respected labor right activist from jail into US. exile Sunday even a it prepared to put a prominent dissident on trial. Xu Wenli's trial Monday and his almost certain conviction would deprive a nascent opposition political party of a potent organizer and a moderate voice. He is the third and most influential leader in the China Democracy Party tried in a three-week campaign that ha seen at least 32 member detained or questioned. For organizing the party and thereby challenging the ruling Communist Party, Xu, 55, is accused of subverting state power, a crime punishable by 10 year to life in prison. To prevent supporter from rallying outside Beijing's No. 1 Intermediate People's Court, police detained two of Xu's colleague Sunday and kept watch on the home of at least two others, friend and a Hong Kong-based right group reported. As police moved against Xu's friend, labor right campaigner Liu Nianchun wa taken from a prison camp outside Beijing and, with his wife and daughter, wa put on a plane to Canada and then New York, his first taste of freedom in more than 3 1/2 year. Authorities released Liu on medical parole five month before the end of his sentence provided he go abroad, said his brother, exiled democracy campaigner Liu Qing. His wife claimed for two year that Liu's health wa worsening. But only last month did authority grant a comprehensive exam. Doctors found tumor, perhaps cancerous, in the 50-year-old's mouth, stomach and bowel, Liu Qing said. The timing of Liu's exile and Xu's trial wa the most brazen in a string of high-profile dissident release calculated to influence Western government. Human right group immediately denounced Liu's release a cynical and manipulative. The Chinese government continues to play hostage politics with no true commitment to international human right standard, said Xiao Qiang of Human Rights in China, a New York-based lobbying group that Liu Qing head. Over the past two year, a China tried to woo the West, Beijing signed two key UN. right treaty and won praise for bringing it spotty legal system closer to international standard. The ruling Communist Party relaxed some control on dissenting view among academic. Xu Wenli and other dissident saw opportunity in the more open atmosphere. Over the past six month, dissident in 14 province and city have tried to use Chinese law to set up and register the China Democracy Party. In a sign of the opposition party's appeal, 205 dissident from across China issued a petition Sunday calling for the immediate release of Xu and two other leader, the Hong Kong-based Information Center of Human Rights and Democratic Movement in China reported. To wipe out the opposition movement, authority have violated recently revised law that are supposed to protect the right of criminal suspect. They rushed Xu and fellow leader Qin Yongmin to trial with le than four day notice given to their family, instead of the 10 required by law. Qin and a third principal organizer, Wang Youcai, were also denied legal counsel. Police detained or scared off prospective lawyer, forcing the two to argue their own defense in separate trial on Thursday. No verdict have been announced. The Beijing court appointed Xu a lawyer, but his wife, He Xintong, suspect it is merely a formality in what she expects to be a show trial. He hasn't even read the whole indictment. How is he going to represent my husband? He Xintong said after talking with the lawyer and his aide. Authorities have turned down request by Xu's colleague to attend the trial, and He said she ha been given one pas, for herself. Xu edited an influential dissident journal in the Democracy Wall movement 20 year ago and spent 12 year in prison, most of them in solitary confinement. Since his parole ended last year, Xu ha played the role of elder adviser to dissident. He became openly involved in the China Democracy Party in November, organizing the group's branch in Beijing and nearby Tianjin. Shortly before his arrest, he called on party member and exiled dissident to convene a nationwide congress. The trial of three outspoken dissident over, Communist Party leader Jiang Zemin signaled Wednesday that China will sustain a crackdown on dissent throughout next year. In his second hard-line speech in six day, Jiang vowed to crush any challenge to Communist Party rule and preserve social stability. He demanded that official talk politics a euphemism for following party order. The speech, to senior law enforcement official, used uncompromising language heard le frequently over the past 18 month a Chinese leader sought to improve relation abroad. Jiang's harsh tone punctuated the summary trial and conviction for subversion this week of three political critic who tried to form an opposition party. To underscore the party's intolerant mood, national newspaper ran brief account Tuesday and Wednesday of the 13-, 12- and 11-year prison term given to Xu Wenli, Qin Yongmin and Wang Youcai. Dissidents are rarely mentioned by official medium, and the report served a a warning to China's 1.2 billion people. In the speech, reported by state television, Jiang said stability wa crucial over the next year. He noted two key event on the political calendar: the 50th anniversary of Communist Party rule on Oct. 1 and China's recovery of the Portuguese colony of Macau on Dec. 20. We must strengthen the ideological and political education of official and raise their awareness of and resistance to the sabotaging act of hostile domestic and foreign force, China Central Television quoted Jiang a saying. Whenever any element that undermines stability raise it head, it must be resolutely nipped in the bud. Jiang did not exclusively target political enemy. He likened their threat to that of white-collar and ordinary criminal and ticked off a list of potentially volatile problem inefficient state industry, legion of laid-off worker, stagnating farmers' income and corrupt official. The emphasis on stability and warning to those who would disrupt it were reminiscent of party pronouncement in the waning year of Jiang's mentor, Deng Xiaoping. After Deng died in 1997 and Jiang emerged victorious from a major party conclave, he projected a more confident image. Reform, not stability, were the byword of the past year. Academic debate over the past year were the boldest in 10 year by China's relatively controlled standard. Party leader too touted effort to build a more comprehensive, predictable legal system and won praise from Western government for signing UN. right treaty. Our active development of foreign affair ha reached new achievement, Jiang said. Our country's stature ha risen a step higher. By arresting and convicting Xu, Qin and Wang in le than three week, China trampled it own legal safeguard for criminal suspect and raised question about it commitment to UN. right treaty it signed over the past 15 month. Despite the swift punishment given the three, dissident have continued to campaign for justice. Four elder member of the dissident community sent a letter to UN. Secretary-General Kofi Annan and UN. human right commissioner Mary Robinson calling on China to stop persecuting political critic and release political prisoner. We have experienced extreme disappointment, worry and shock over the long sentence given Xu, Qin and Wang and the recent detention of several other Chinese, the four wrote in a letter dated Tuesday that wa released by New York-based Human Rights in China on Wednesday. In addition, 214 dissident in China planned a 100-day series of rotating 24-hour fast beginning Thursday to protest the sentence, the Information Center of Human Rights and Democratic Movement in China reported Wednesday night. The fast were to have begun with lawyer Wang Wenjiang, whom authority prevented from representing Wang Youcai, and Wang Zechen in Liaoning province in northeastern China, but the two activist were detained by police Wednesday evening, the Hong Kong-based center said. The British ambassador in Beijing, Tony Galsworthy, and others delivered a protest message to the Chinese government demanding the immediate release of Xu, Qin and Wang, the Foreign Office in London confirmed on Wednesday. It wa conveyed on behalf of the European Union, the United States, Canada and Norway. In stern judgment capping a decisive crackdown on dissident, Chinese court sentenced two prominent democracy campaigner to 13 and 11 year in prison Monday for trying to organize an opposition political party. The 13-year prison term given Xu Wenli after a 3 1/2-hour trial in Beijing wa the longest for a Chinese dissident in three year. His colleague in the China Democracy Party, Wang Youcai, wa sentenced to 11 year, in a verdict announced by a court in Hangzhou four day after his trial. Xu's conviction deprives the would-be opposition group of a potent organizer and the fractured dissident community at large of a strong and moderating voice. Xu remained defiant during his tightly controlled trial on subversion charge. He refused to answer question from prosecutor and judge and responded only to those from his lawyer, the court-appointed attorney, Mo Shaoping, said. When the court asked if he would appeal, Xu Wenli said he would not appeal, Mo said, quoting his client a saying this is political persecution. Xu's daughter also criticized the verdict. All he wanted to do wa to advocate free speech and make sure the party register peacefully. But the government failed this test, and now my father ha to go to jail again for it, said daughter Xu Jin, a graduate student at Boston University. Security force have orchestrated a concerted crackdown, trampling China's slim legal safeguard to crush the China Democracy Party. In three week, at least 32 people have been detained or questioned and Xu, Wang and another leading member, Qin Yongmin, have been put on trial. All three were charged with trying to subvert China's Communist Party-led system. Xu and Qin were given le than four day to prepare their defense. Last Thursday, Wang and Qin faced trial without legal counsel after police detained or scared off potential lawyer. No verdict ha been announced in Qin's case. Judges in Beijing and Hangzhou found that Xu and Wang plotted subversion by founding branch of the China Democracy Party in both city and accepting money from abroad, the official Xinhua News Agency said in a rare mention of dissident activity. The court ruled the two should be severely punished a repeat offender, Xinhua said in an indirect reference to their previous democracy campaigning. Wary of the China Democracy Party's appeal, score of uniformed and plainclothes police sealed off Beijing's No. 1 Intermediate People's Court Monday for Xu's trial. Foreign reporter were kept 500 meter (yards) away from the building. Xu's wife wa the only friend or family member given permission to watch the proceeding, along with an audience selected by court official. She wa escorted from her home to the courthouse by three plainclothes officer. Hours after the verdict, He Xintong still had not returned home nor had she contacted her daughter. Police detained at least two of Xu's democracy party colleague and kept watch on the house of others. Members of the China Democracy Party will struggle to the end for the realization of democracy, said Gao Hongmin, whose home wa under surveillance. Gao, who helped Xu organize the party's Beijing branch, said authority would not be able to arrest all the party's supporter. In just six month, the party attracted enough of a following to try to register branch in 14 province and city. The US. government and exiled dissident, many of whom supported the party's effort, denounced the sentence and called for the dissidents' release. We are deeply disappointed with both the guilty verdict and the extremely harsh sentence given to Mr. Xu, said US. Embassy spokesman Bill Palmer. No individual should be arrested, tried or sentenced for exercising internationally recognized freedom. Xu, 55, edited an underground journal in the Democracy Wall movement 20 year ago and spent 12 year in prison, mostly in solitary confinement. Since his parole ended last year, he ha been behind-the-scenes advisor to a host of dissident activity. He supported Qin Yongmin, another Democracy Wall veteran, in setting up an independent human right monitor and advised others to run for local legislative seat in Beijing. Xu became openly involved in the China Democracy Party in November. Wang Youcai, a student leader of the Tiananmen Square democracy demonstration in 1989 and now 32, publicly declared the China Democracy Party's formation in June and said the group intended to challenge the Communist Party's 49-year ban on opposition politics. Police have sporadically detained supporter of the democracy party. The decisive move came on Nov. 30 a Chinese Communist Party leader Jiang Zemin returned from Japan, ending a busy two year of diplomatic foray. In a speech broadcast nationwide on Friday, Jiang warned against subversive trying to bring down the system and vowed never to copy Western democracy. To allay international criticism, China released a respected labor right campaigner, Liu Nianchun, from 3 1/2 year in prison camp on Sunday and sent him into exile in the United States. German Foreign Minister Joschka Fischer, who drew China's anger recently by meeting with exiled dissident Wei Jingsheng, said China's sentencing of two dissident Monday wa unacceptable and flouted an international treaty the country recently signed. The reaction of Chinese court is totally unacceptable, Fischer said, calling for the dissidents' immediate release. The accused simply tried through peaceful mean to exercise their right to free speech and assembly, which are guaranteed by China's constitution, and by the United Nations' International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights which China recently signed, Fischer said in a statement. Chinese court sentenced dissident Xu Wenli and Wang Youcai to 13 and 11 year for trying to organize an opposition political party. Hours before China wa expected to sign a key UN. human right treaty and host British Prime Minister Tony Blair, police hauled a prominent human right campaigner in for questioning Monday. Qin Yongmin's latest run-in with the authority came a he tried for the second time in a week to legally register a human right monitoring group. Qin said a civil affair official in the Hubei provincial capital of Wuhan accused him of engaging in illegal activity. The police came soon after he returned home. As I'm sending this statement, the Wuhan Public Security Bureau is again taking me away, Qin said in a hastily scrawled message on the bottom of the typed statement faxed to reporter. Qin, detained briefly two week ago, wa questioned for about three hour before being released and threatened with prosecution if he persisted in trying to set up his China Human Rights Observer. Qin hoped the harassment would stop after China sign the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, but he said if local authority don't observe the treaty we will unswervingly push ahead with protecting human right to the last. China plan to sign the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights on Monday at the United Nations. By the time the ink is dry, Blair should be landing in Beijing on Tuesday morning for the first visit by a British prime minister in seven year. The treaty is supposed to guarantee freedom of speech and assembly. But even after China sign, the treaty would not come into force until ratified by the legislature, which may attach reservation effectively nullifying some provision. Blair ha vowed to discus difference over human right with Chinese leader. His visit ha drawn appeal from dissident and an international press freedom group urging him to persuade Chinese leader to free political prisoner. In an open letter, three dissident said that while Chinese leader say they respect human right principle, in law and practice the government allows right abuse and persecution of dissident. Thousands of political prisoner are believed to remain in Chinese prison, labor camp or detention center, said the letter, a copy of which wa released by the Hong Kong-based Information Center of Human Rights and Democratic Movement in China. The letter called for the release of Shi Binhai, a journalist who compiled a popular book on political change; Fang Jue, a businessman who called openly for political reform; and other imprisoned activist. Paris-based Reporters Without Borders urged Blair to call for the release of Gao Yu, Liu Xiaobo and Liu Jingsheng. The three are among 13 journalist imprisoned simply for attempting to practice their profession, it said in a statement. By sentencing two of the country's most prominent democracy campaigner to long prison term, China on Monday took it harshest step yet in it current crackdown on organized political opposition. After a trial that lasted just three and a half hour, Xu Wenli at 55 the dean of the dissident movement, and a man who ha already spent 12 year in prison for advocating democracy wa sentenced to 13 year for subversion of state power. Xu's alleged crime included helping to organize a new political party, calling for an end to Communist rule in interview with foreign journalist, calling for independent labor union and, prosecutor said, accepting $500 from a dissident abroad. He wa defended by a lawyer who wa appointed by the court just four day ago and met his client only once. Also sentenced Monday, to 11 year in prison, wa Wang Youcai, 32, founder of the China Democracy Party, which ha now been suppressed. Wang wa tried on subversion charge on Thursday in a brief court session, with no defense lawyer, in the eastern city of Hangzhou. The punishment of a third veteran democracy campaigner, Qin Yongmin, 44, ha not been announced. His trial began in the central city of Wuhan on Thursday and may reconvene on Tuesday, relative said. A similarly long sentence is expected. Monday's sentence, which came just six month after President Clinton's visit to Beijing, where he publicly challenged China's leader to move quickly toward political reform, were harshly criticized by the State Department. They also appeared to spell the effective end here of the China Democracy Party, which these three men, along with hundred of lesser-known individual, tried to organize in recent month. The long sentence also crushed the hope of many liberal intellectual here that China's warming relation with the United States in recent year and it signing of global treaty on human right might bring a significant easing of political control. Xu wa tried Monday morning in the Beijing Intermediate Court. When after a brief recess the three-judge panel announced his 13-year sentence, Xu stood up and shouted, I protest! said his wife of 28 year, He Xintong. Then, said Ms. He and lawyer who were present, he shouted that the judge were unfair and that he would not appeal his case because the proceeding were illegitimate. With the sentencing of Xu, China's Communist government ha silenced one of it most energetic and persistent critic, one who ha given over his adult life to the cause of democracy. Xu first came to prominence during the Democracy Wall movement of the late 1970s, then served 12 year in prison, much of it in solitary confinement. In the last several month, sensing a new opportunity to speak out and making constant use of fax machine and e-mail, he and Qin tried to draw attention to China's obligation under two international covenant it ha signed one on economic and cultural right, and one on civil and political right. In the face of several temporary detention and stiff warning, they continued their activity. Wang, in contrast, first became involved in dissident activity in 1989, while a graduate student in physic in Beijing, when he became a leader of the Tiananmen Square demonstration. After the student movement wa smashed by the army, he wa on the most-wanted list, then wa arrested and spent two year in prison. During Clinton's visit to China in June, Wang announced the formation of the China Democracy Party. Hundreds around the country, including Xu and Qin, began promoting the idea. But while the government ha allowed somewhat freer discussion of political topic in university and obscure journal in the last year, it ha not allowed any challenge in print or in the form of organized group to the principle of Communist Party rule. In a speech on Friday celebrating 20 year of economic reform, the president and Communist Party chief, Jiang Zemin, emphasized the primacy of the party, saying, The Western mode of political system must never be adopted. After learning of Monday's sentence, the American Embassy here, which ha spent the last two year building improved relation between China and the United States, issued a strong condemnation of what it termed the deplorable decision. We are deeply disappointed with both the guilty verdict and the extremely harsh sentence, the statement said. No individual should be arrested, tried and sentenced for exercising internationally recognized freedom, including those guaranteed in the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, to which China ha committed itself. Like Thursday's trial, both of which proceeded with no defense attorney because prospective lawyer had been warned off by police or detained, Monday's proceeding showed that in case involving security issue, police and court could write their own rule. According to the criminal procedure law, defendant are to be notified at least 10 day before a trial, but Xu wa told only four day ago that his trial would be Monday. His wife, who until Monday had not been allowed to contact him since his arrest on Nov. 30, wa told three day ago. Under the law, defendant also have the right to a lawyer of their choice, but Xu wa assigned a lawyer by the court late last week. Before Monday morning's trial, the lawyer, Mo Shaoping, saw his client only for one brief meeting, an associate of Mo's said. Xu's wife refused to meet the lawyer before the trial. Meeting him would be tantamount to cooperating with the whole charade, she said in a telephone interview this weekend. Responding to the accusation during Monday morning's trial, Xu's lawyer argued that Xu had engaged in the peaceful expression of his own view and that this could not amount to subversive activity against the state, an associate of the lawyer said. But in a decision that wa clearly preordained, the court declared Xu guilty and sentenced him to spend what may be much of the rest of his life in prison. Born in 1943 in the southeastern province of Jiangxi, Xu wa interested in politics even a a teen-ager, his wife said. In the 1960s, a an idealistic Marxist, he decided to get his learning in society rather than attend a university. He served in the navy for five year, then became an electrician with the Beijing railroad before becoming involved with the democracy movement and going to prison. On Monday afternoon, in a police station hour after the trial finished, Xu wa allowed a half-hour with his wife. He told me he'd be able to handle the pain, she later recounted in a telephone interview. He said that this would give him time to think thing over and calmly reflect on what ha happened. Ms. He, who ha been married to Xu since 1971, said she expected to see him in monthly visit to prison. The couple ha a daughter, Xu Jin, who is a graduate student in fine art at Boston University. In an earlier interview, soon after her husband wa arrested on Nov. 30, Ms. He said Xu had told her, I can't change the way I am. If he received a long sentence, he told his wife, she should go on and enjoy her life. And if I die, Xu said a they parted that day, please plant a tree for me. Six month after President Clinton traveled to Beijing and challenged China's leader to move rapidly toward political reform, the administration's policy of engaging Beijing wa called into question Monday when Chinese court sentenced three of the nation's most prominent dissident to long jail sentence. Critics of China on Capitol Hill and human right group said the tough prison term were evidence of the failure of the administration's policy of encouraging trade and diplomatic tie with China in hope of democratic reform. The dissident Xu Wenli, who wa sentenced Monday to 13 year in prison, Wang Youcai, who received an 11-year sentence, and Qin Yongming, who wa reported to have received 12 year were charged with subversion. The State Department said it had received report from source it did not identify that a third leading democracy campaigner, Qin Yongmin, had been sentenced to 13 year in prison after a trial last week in the city of Wuhan. Relatives of Qin in China denied the report, however, and said that his trial continued. Given Clinton's effusive praise for China's senior leader during his trip to Beijing last summer, the administration found itself on the defensive Monday and harshly criticized the prison sentence, even a it continued to insist that the administration's policy of engagement wa helping push Beijing toward democracy. James Foley, a State Department spokesman, said the United States deeply deplores the jail term and called for the immediate release of the dissident. These three men appear to have been involved in nothing more than effort to form a new political party, he said. While condemning the prison sentence, Foley and other American official were careful to note the administration's assessment that there had been progress in human right in China, some of it linked to Clinton's meeting in Beijing with Chinese President Jiang Zemin. There had been improvement in the human right situation in China, modest improvement, Foley said. The severe prison term and other recent instance of harassment of democracy campaigner in China are step backward in relationship to what had been an improved human right performance, he said. Critics of the administration's China policy noted that the long prison sentence were handed out le than a week after Jiang delivered a pointed speech in Beijing in which he made clear that China's economic reform were not a prelude to Western-style democracy. The Western mode of political system must never be copied, he said, adding that those who challenged the Communist Party's supremacy would be crushed. Rep. Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., who ha long been among China's harshest critic in Congress, said the prison sentence handed out to Xu and Wang were the clearest demonstration since the president's visit to China last summer of Beijing's true intention regarding human right. They are pathetic, really pathetic, she said of the administration. The administration can say what it want, but it must know Monday that it policy on China is an embarrassment. What the Chinese have learned is that they have all the latitude in the world. Mike Jendrzejczyk, Washington director for Human Rights Group, said the jail term were proof of the need for the administration to revise it China policy, which he described a almost entirely driven by the administration's desire to encourage trade. He said that while there had been some sign of progress in the human right situation in China over the last year notably, China's agreement to sign international treaty on civil and economic right the overall picture wa bleak. On balance, he said, any progress China ha made by allowing greater openness may have been canceled out by a more repressive attitude. Human Rights Watch, the largest American-based human right group, called on the administration to consider postponing or canceling a planned visit to China early next year by Commerce Secretary William Daley and a high-level trade delegation a a protest over the prison sentence. That would get Beijing's attention, Jendrzejczck said. Other China expert and scholar insisted that the administration wa right to continue it policy of engagement with China, and that there wa reason to believe that political reform would follow economic reform, a Clinton ha argued. Peter Rodman, a former Nixon and Reagan administration official now at the Nixon Center in Washington, said that the United States cannot control the evolution of a society a complex a China's. He said the harsh prison sentence given out Monday to the dissident were to be expected, especially since Xu and Wang had been involved in trying to set up a political party to challenge the Communists. The pattern of this regime is that every once in a while, they ease up a bit and somebody go too far and there's a crisis, he said. I don't think you can blame the United States for this crackdown, nor can you give u credit for any political reform. On human right, I just don't think there's much more we can do. China released a respected, but ailing labor right campaigner from a prison work camp Sunday and immediately sent him into exile in the United States. Releasing Liu Nianchun appeared to be an attempt by the government to blunt international criticism over Monday's upcoming trial of prominent dissident Xu Wenli. Xu is the third leading member of a would-be opposition political party put on trial for subversion in a three-week crackdown that ha seen at least 32 dissident arrested or interrogated. Beijing police Sunday detained one of Xu's China Democracy Party colleague, Zha Jianguo, to prevent him from attending the trial, Xu's wife said. Although pleased that Liu Nianchun wa free, human right group decried the Chinese government's timing a manipulative. We don't want to give any credit to the Chinese government for this cynical game it is playing, said Xiao Qiang, director of New York-based Human Rights in China. After 3 1/2 year in prison, Liu wa taken from the Tuanhe labor camp on the outskirt of Beijing, driven to the capital's airport and put on a Canadian Air flight, ultimately bound for New York, his mother and brother said. Accompanying Liu into exile wa his wife, Chu Hailan, and their 11-year-old daughter, the family said. Liu Nianchun's release follows the same pattern China used in freeing it two most famous dissident, Wei Jingsheng in Nov. 1997 and Wang Dan in April. Authorities released Liu on medical parole, exactly five month before the end of his prison term, provided he go into exile, said his brother and exiled democracy campaigner, Liu Qing. Liu Nianchun, 50, ha been in ill-health for at least two year. In an exam authority finally agreed to provide last month, doctor discovered Liu had tumor in his mouth, stomach and bowel, Liu Qing said. Like Wang and Wei, the United States and other Western government have lobbied China to release Liu. Chinese leader have been forcing well-known dissident into exile throughout the 1990s, finding that once abroad they lose their influence among dissident at home. In the only official comment on the release, the Xinhua News Agency reported that judicial department took into account Liu's health and behavior in the labor camp in approving his parole for medical treatment. I am very happy for Liu Nianchun, but at the same time sending people directly from prison into exile is a type of human right violation and persecution, Liu Qing said in a telephone interview from his home in New York's Brooklyn borough. Liu Nianchun wa one of the most respected figure in the fractured, persecuted dissident community. His more than 3 1/2 year in prison and labor camp wa a sad illustration of the way China's Communist Party ruler punish people they deem a threat. Liu wa imprisoned three time in the past 17 year. His last arrest came after he signed a petition calling for labor right in May 1995. Liu wa never put on trial. Fourteen month passed before his wife, Chu Hailan, first learned of his fate and whereabouts: a three-year spell in a labor camp in the frigid, remote northeast. His term wa the maximum police may impose on criminal suspect without trial. Labor camp official later extended Liu's sentence by a year for trying to escape, a charge Chu claimed wa fabricated. Inside the labor camp, Liu once started a hunger strike to protest his treatment. He wa beaten with cattle prod and confined to a room of 2 square meter (2 square yard) where he could only sit or stand. His wife endured police harassment, beating and detention in campaigning for his release. Chu wa dragged away and hit by security force when she tried to hand a letter to UN. human right chief Mary Robinson outside a Beijing hotel in September. German Foreign Minister Joschka Fischer, who drew China's anger recently by meeting with exiled dissident Wei Jingsheng, said China's sentencing of two dissident Monday wa unacceptable and flouted an international treaty the country recently signed. The reaction of Chinese authority is totally unacceptable, Fischer said, calling for the dissidents' immediate release. The accused simply tried through peaceful mean to exercise their right to free speech and assembly, which are guaranteed by China's constitution, and by the United Nations' International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights which China recently signed, Fischer said in a statement. Chinese court sentenced dissident Xu Wenli and Wang Youcai to 13 and 11 year for trying to organize an opposition political party. His friend and political mentor is jailed, robbing their budding opposition political party of it most potent organizer, but Zha Jianguo is not afraid. A bag packed with toothbrush, toothpaste and medicine lie ready at his Beijing home for the day Chinese police take him away. He ha told police interrogator he expects to be jailed, likely for a few year le than the 13 given China Democracy Party leader Xu Wenli on Monday. Democracy is a process, and in that process a small number of people will be sacrificed, Zha, a 47-year-old former manager of a computer design company and vice chairman of the party's Beijing branch, told The Associated Press in an interview Thursday. We want to use our sacrifice to arouse the people, and we believe that sacrifice is worthwhile. With a mixture of defiance and cool clarity about the chance for success, Zha said he and other China Democracy Party member will continue organizing and campaigning for change. His tenacity hold despite the summary trial and harsh punishment for Xu, Wang Youcai and Qin Yongmin prominent party principal from the province who were sentenced to 11 and 12 year and despite threatening sign from the ruling Communist Party. Chinese President Jiang Zemin warned in a speech published Wednesday that political subversive threatened what he called China's fragile social order. Whenever any element that undermines stability raise it head, it must be resolutely nipped in the bud, Jiang said. Zha maintains that such tactic are unnecessary. In it manifesto, the Democracy Party espoused peaceful mean to target the undemocratic system, not the political power of the Communist Party. We believe election held after the establishment of a democratic system should decide who ha the power, said Zha. What many the world over consider democracy is legally subversive in China for threatening the Communist Party-led system. In the past month, authority have arrested and convicted Xu, Qin and Wang and detained or interrogated at least 29 other party member. Police took Zha from his home Sunday afternoon and held him for nearly 24 hour to keep him from Xu's trial. Until the crackdown, the China Democracy Party distinguished itself from past attempt at opposition by it openness. Organizers publicly announced their intention to set up the party. They tried to register with authority. Statements were faxed to foreign medium and human right group to circumvent China's state-controlled medium. Now, the party's member about 500 by Zha's count are being driven underground. Party member will concentrate on increasing rank and will be more guarded in the use of telephone and fax and their occasional meeting, Zha said. If Xu and the other two were the first round, then the second round is very likely and it will be bigger, Zha said. In such an unbalanced contest, we are forced to use more secretive mean. The arrest of Xu, Wang and Qin deprive the party of it more influential member, Zha said. All had proven track record, Xu and Qin a dissident editor in the Democracy Wall era movement 20 year ago, Wang a a student leader of the Tiananmen Square democracy demonstration in 1989. But from another aspect, this ha strengthened the resolve of even more party member to struggle on, Zha said of the arrest. Zha got interested in politics a a radical youth, following Mao Tse-tung's appeal to go to the countryside in 1968. When he returned to Beijing in 1989, he marched in the Tiananmen protest and continued his activism. Friends introduced him to Xu Wenli in 1995. Having been released from prison two year before, Xu wa still not openly involved in dissident politics, but he held court in his Beijing home to discus China's future.
